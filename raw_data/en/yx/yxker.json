Biologically, these cells are distinct from the other cells that form the bulk of a tumor in that they can self-perpetuate and produce progenitor cel ls, the way that traditional stem cells do. However , to date, the stem cell model has not been adequately t ested in most cancers and findings reported to date are inconclusive. Cancer's 'Addiction' Spurs New Treatment Hopes http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=7682 Yale researchers report that while cancer uses an a rray of genetic tricks to cause havoc, it can becom e dependent upon a tiny gene that allows it to adapt and proliferate. The identification of such an \"onc ogene addiction\" within a tumor means that researchers ha ve a potentially new and valuable therapeutic targe t with the potential to cripple it. Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas: A Distinct Clinicopathologic Entity http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697320 Among exocrine pancreatic tumors, adenosquamous car cinoma is a rare, aggressive subtype with a worse prognosis and a higher potential for metastas es compared to its more conventional glandular counterpart, adenocarcinoma. Similar to the therape utics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cated resectable ASC of the pancreas, while gemcitabine or gemcitabine combinations are used fo r a more advanced disease. Both pathologic and molecular features of pancreatic ASC characterize i t as a distinct subtype of pancreatic cancer and it s molecular and genetic makeup could be exploited for both diagnostic and therapeutic quests in the futu re. ETIOLOGY Statins Cleared of Causing Cancer http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ESCCong ress/21866 Researchers report statins neither cause nor preven t cancer. The finding comes from a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials of the lipid-loweri ng medications. In those trials, which included mor e than 166,000 participants, there were no differences bet ween treatment and control arms in terms of the incidence of cancer or the rate of cancer mortality . They conclude statins are safe and do not increas e cancer, and state the data meet the \"gold standard\" of randomized trials. Statins Nested Case-C ontrol Study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697797 The study examined the relationship between statin use and pancreatic cancer risk in an UK population. A total of 1,141 pancreatic cancer cases and 7,954 controls were identified. Neither dose nor duration of statin use affected pancreatic cancer risk. Statin use at doses for managing hypercholesterolaemia was not associated with the risk of exocrine pancreatic cancer. New Strategies in Pancreatic Cancer: Emerging Epide miologic and Therapeutic Concepts http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early /2010/08/13/1078-0432.CCR-09-1942.abstract?papetoc Data from recent studies suggest that obesity and l ong-term type II diabetes are two major modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer and seem to affect th e clinical outcome of patients. Understanding the mechanistic effects of obesity and diabetes on the pancreas may help identify new strategies for prevention or therapy. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org Does Body Mass Index/Morbid Obesity Influence Outco me in Patients Who Undergo Pancreatoduodenectomy for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20676790 Researchers examined the impact of body mass index on outcomes for resected pancreatic cancer. Of the 586 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectom y for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 1981 to 2007, body mass index and morbid obesity did not ap pear to influence long-term outcomes for patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. Intra-abdominal Fat Predicts Survival in Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20725799 While measures of intra-abdominal fat correlate wit h medical and postoperative complications of obesit y, the impact of intra-abdominal fat on pancreatic can cer survival is uncertain. The authors reviewed 61 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While preoperative BMI did not predict overall survival, patients with more intra-abdominal fat demonstrated worse overall survival in a non-linear fashion. Obesity Adversely Affects Survival in Pancreatic Ca ncer Patients http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20665496 Higher body-mass index (BMI) has been implicated as a risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer, bu t its effect on survival has not been thoroughly inve stigated. The authors reported higher BMI is associ ated with decreased survival in pancreatic cancer. Altho ugh the mechanism of this association remains undetermined, diabetes and hyperglycemia do not app ear to account for the observed association. The Relationship between New-onset Diabetes Mellitu s and Pancreatic Cancer Risk: A Case- Control Study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20709528 Diabetes mellitus is associated with pancreatic can cer, though it is unclear whether it is a cause or consequence of the disease. When 1,458 pancreatic c ancer patients at two university-affiliated hospita ls were compared with a control group over a nine year period, a moderate increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was observed among those with long-standing diabetes. A significantly higher risk was observed among cases with new-onset diabet es. The study suggested that diabetes could be both an early manifestation of pancreatic cancer an d an etiological factor. Fructose Induces Transketolase Flux to Promote Panc reatic Cancer Growth http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20647326 Carbohydrate metabolism via glycolysis and the tric arboxylic acid cycle is pivotal for cancer growth, and increased refined carbohydrate consumption adversel y affects cancer survival. The researchers report that fructose provides an alternative substrate to induce pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and sho w that cancer cells can readily metabolize fructose to inc rease proliferation. Efforts are reported to reduce refined fructose intake or inhibit fructose-mediate d actions as they may disrupt cancer growth . Glycemic Index, Glycemic Load, and Risk of Pancreat ic Cancer among Postmenopausal Women http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20711806 Several reports have suggested that conditions asso ciated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance , such as diets high in carbohydrates, may influence the risk of pancreatic cancer, although results fro m prior studies have been mixed. Researchers utilized data from the population-based women's health initiative and conclude that the cohort results did not show that dietary intake of carbohydrates incr eased pancreatic cancer risk. Smoking Blamed for Increased Incidence of Pancreati c, Lung and Bronchus Cancers in Port Clinton, Ohio http://www.thenews-messenger.com/article/20100824/N EWS01/8240302/ODH-study-No-PC-cancer- cluster http://toledoblade.com/article/20100824/NEWS32/8230 402/-1/SRMAIN Port Clinton's rate of pancreatic cancer is 90% gre ater, and its rate of lung and bronchus cancers is 50% greater, than what the Ohio Department of Health be lieves should be expected for a city its size. From their investigation, they concluded that the increa sed incidence is more likely the result of excessiv e smoking than exposure to industrial chemicals or en vironmental pollutants as residents had believed. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org Viruses May ht http://www.livescience.com/health/cancer-viruses-va ccines- 100819.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&u tm_campaign=Feed%3A+Livesciencecom+ %28LiveScience.com+Science+Headline+Feed%29 University of Cambridge researchers report on a stu dy that showed that a particular mouse herpesvirus could trigger cancer in mice but then practically d isappear from the cancer cells. The study suggests that viruses might be implicated in more cancers than pr eviously believed. DETECTION , DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS Pancreatic Cancer Tumor Size on CT Scan Versus Path ologic Specimen: Implications for Radiation Treatment Planning http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20708856 Pancreatic cancer primary tumor size measurements a re often discordant between computed tomography (CT) and pathologic specimen after resec 97 consecutive patients with resected pancreatic cance r at two Boston hospitals. All patients had CT scan s before surgical resection. CT scans significantly under-represented pancreatic cancer tumor size compared with pathologic specimens in resectable ca ses. PET Scan is Prognostic of Progression-free and Over all Survival in Locally Advanced Pancreas Cancer Treated with Stereotactic Radiotherapy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20056345 This study analyzed the prognostic value of positro n emission tomography (PET) for locally advanced pancreas cancer patients undergoing stereotactic bo dy radiotherapy. PET scan parameters were found to be predictive of length of survival in locally adva nced pancreas cancer patients. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Evaluate P ancreatic Cancer http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-07/wjog -fmr073010.php http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/full/v16/i26/3292.h tm Current therapies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma off er minimal benefit. Given the success that local therapies (as opposed to intravenous systemic thera pies) have had in treating diseases like liver canc er, it is thought that similar therapeutic approaches m ay benefit pancreatic cancer patients. To develop t hese therapies, researchers need targets that are easy t o obtain and can indicate the efficacy of these treatments in models of pancreatic cancer. Northwes tern University researchers addressed this need and recently published their work in the World Journal of Gastroenterology . They report that two types of functional MRIs that they studied--diffusion-weight ed MRI and transcatheter intra-arterial perfusion M RI-- could be used to differentiate living tumor cells f rom dead tumor cells and can assess tumor viability . Validation of Blood Testing for K-ras Mutations in Colorectal and Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20683036 The authors reviewed studies in which K-ras mutatio n status was assessed in both blood and tumor to ascertain whether blood K-ras mutation is predictiv e of tumor K-ras mutation. The K-ras mutation in bl ood appears to indicate K-ras mutation in tumor, while the absence of blood K-ras mutation does not prove lack of mutation in the tumor. This funding suggest s that a blood test for the detection of tumor K-ra s may be possible, and could direct cancer treatment stra tegies. Association of Pre-treatment Peripheral Blood Marke rs with Survival in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20698242 The study assessed the prognostic value of pretreat ment lymphocyte, neutrophil and (platelet, lymphocyte, neutrop hil and mean platelet volume) and tumor marker (CA 19-9) levels were recorded. Findings indicated that pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte may be u sed as a prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. Further studies with larger patient cohorts are war ranted, however. Cancer Biomarkers Missing in Action http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/Othe rCancers/21649 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20705936 In a commentary published online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , Dr. Eleftherios Diamandis reports that despite large investments an d scientific investigations by competent researcher s, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org no new major cancer biomarkers have been validated for clinical use in the past 25 years. Diamandis claims a range of common analytical errors lead to what he calls \"false discovery,\" even when reports undergo detailed peer review and appear in high-pro file journals. Pilot Study of Blood Biomarker Candidates for Detec tion of Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467349 This study was conducted by a team of researchers i ncluding Drs. Teri Brentnall and Ru Chen, member of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Scientifi c Advisory Board and 2006 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network-AACR Career Development Award recipient, re spectively. A dozen biomarker candidates were analyzed for their potential as pancreatic cancer b lood biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the macrophage migration inhibi tory factor and osteopontin blood tests were nearly perfect in distinguishing pancreatic cancer cases f rom healthy controls (100% and 95% sensitivity, respectively, at 100% specificity). Five biomarker candidates were then tested on an expanded set of diseased controls, which included sera from patient s with pancreatitis. The sensitivity dropped significantly for all 5 candidate markers. Results suggest that biomarker candidates could fail in var ious steps of biomarker development. Earlier knowledge o f candidate biomarker flaws could lead to strategie s to overcome the flaw or alternatively lead to earli er termination of biomarkers that are prone to fail ure in the later phases of validation testing. Elevated Level of Anterior Gradient-2 in Pancreatic Juice from Patients with Pre-malignant Pancreatic Neoplasia http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/9/1/149 This study was conducted by a team of researchers i ncluding Drs. Teri Brentnall and Ru Chen, member of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Scientifi c Advisory Board and 2006 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network-AACR Career Development Award recipient, re spectively. Quantitative proteomics were applied to identify aberrantly elevated proteins in pancrea tic juice samples derived from patients with PanIN3 . Twenty proteins were found elevated in all three Pa nIN juices by at least two-fold. Among these protei ns, anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) was found to be 2-10 fol d elevated in PanIN3 juice samples analyzed by quantitative proteomics. An ELISA assay was develop ed to evaluate AGR2 levels in 51 pancreatic juice samples and 23 serum samples from patients with pan creatic chronic pancreatitis). AGR2 levels in th e pancreatic juice samples were found significantly elevated in patients with pre-malignant conditions (PanINs and IPMNs) as well as pancreatic cancer compared to control samples (p 0.03). By ROC analysis, the AGR2 ELISA achieved 67 % sensitivity at 90% specificity in predicting PanIN3 juice samples from the benign disease controls. These results suggest that elevation of AGR2 levels in pancreatic juice occurs in early pancreatic cancer progressio n and could be further investigated as a potential ca ndidate juice biomarker for early detection of panc reatic cancer. Prognostic Factors for Survival in Patients With Un resectable Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20683218 The study looked at the prognostic factors of survi val in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer after initial biliary drainage and reported the presence of distant metastases as the only independent prognostic factor for survival. TREATMENT Targeting Mutated K-ras in Pancreatic Adenocarcinom a Using an Adjuvant Vaccine http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20686403 The objective of this study was to assess the safet y and efficacy of immunizing patients with resected pancreatic cancer with a vaccine targeted against t heir tumor-specific K-ras mutation. Vaccinations w ere given to 24 patients. Median recurrence-free surviv al time was 8.6 months and median overall survival time was 20.3 months. K-ras vaccination for patien ts with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma proved to be safe and tolerable however, with no elicitabl e immunogenicity and unproven efficacy. Phase II Study of Personalized Peptide Vaccination Combined with Gemcitabine for Non- resectable Pancreatic Cancer Patients http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20664989 Researchers evaluated the safety and immune respons e of a personalized peptide vaccination with gemcitabine in patients with non-resectable pancrea tic cancer. Twenty-one patients with untreated and Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org non-resectable pancreatic cancer were enrolled. The combination therapy was generally well tolerated. Median survival time of all 21 patients was 9.0 mon ths with a one year survival rate of 38%. These res ults suggest a potential clinical benefit of this combin ation therapy for non-resectable pancreatic cancer patients as the first line therapy. Further explora tion of this approach is warranted. University Hospitals Case Medical Center Surgeon Le ads Study on Promising Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2010/0 8/uh_surgeon_leads_study_on_prom.html Dr. Jeffrey Hardacre, a surgeon at Case Medical Cen ter, discusses the New Link Genetics phase II pancreatic cancer post resection vaccine study and the progress of the current phase III trial. Prelim inary indications from the Phase II trial suggest that th e vaccine may have some positive effects for patien ts. Vaccine Shows Some Promise Against Advanced Cancers http://www.cancercompass.com/cancer-news/article/33 915.htm http://www.jci.org/articles/view/42672 Scientists have genetically tweaked a virus to fash ion a therapeutic vaccine that appears to attack a variety of advanced cancers. The vaccine was report ed to provoke the required tumor-fighting immune response in early human trials, but only in a minor ity of patients tested. The vaccine was administer ed multiple times over a period of three months to 28 patients with advanced, recurrent forms of lung, co lon, breast, appendix or pancreatic cancer. The patients had already failed several rounds of standard chemotherapy. Five patients displayed a response to the therapy including one patient with a liver les ion that was no longer visible. Docetaxel Second-line Therapy in Patients with Adva nced Pancreatic Cancer: A Retrospective Study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20683031 Researchers retrospectively evaluated the role of d ocetaxel as second-line therapy in patients with gemcitabine-refractory disease. Findings suggested that docetaxel has a mild affect in the treatment o f gemcitabine-resistant metastatic pancreatic cancer. Super-sizing a Cancer Drug Minimizes Side Effects http://www.physorg.com/news199517081.html Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that is effective in killing tumor cells, but can also seriously dama ge the kidneys. Harvard-MIT researchers have developed a w ay to package cisplatin into nanoparticles that are too big to enter the kidneys. This new compound cou ld spare patients the usual side effects and allow doctors to administer higher doses of the drug. Tum ors in mice treated with the new cisplatin nanopart icle shrank to half the size of those treated with tradi tional cisplatin, with minimal side effects. Phase II Trial to Evaluate Gemcitabine and Etoposid e for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20682649 Chemo-na\u00efve locally advanced and cancer patients' response to gemcitabine and etoposide was evaluated. The median overall surviva l for locally advanced patients was 8.8 months; thi s compared to 6.75 months for metastatic patients. On e-year survival was 10% for all patients and 11.4% for evaluable patients. Results showed that the gem citabine and etoposide combination is generally wel l- tolerated and exhibits a response rate similar to w hat has been reported in other published studies. Phase III Study Comparing Gemcitabine Plus Cetuxima b Versus Gemcitabine in Patients a randomized clinical trial that compared the therapeutic impact of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus cetuximab in patients with unresec table locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. No significant difference was seen between the two arms of the stu dy with respect to the median survival time (6.3 months for the gemcit abine plus cetuximab arm vs. 5.9 months for the gemcitabine alone arm). Although time to treatment failure was longer in patients on gemcitabine plus cetuximab ( P = .006), the length of treatment was only 2 weeks longer tin the combination arm. In this patient population, cetuximab did not improve the o utcome compared with patients treated with gemcitabine alone. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org Pain and Emotional Well-Being Outcomes in SWOG-Dire cted Intergroup Trial S0205: A Phase III Study Comparing Gemcitabine Plus Cetuximab Versus G emcitabine As First-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Pancreas Cancer http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/22/3611.abstract ?cmpid=jco_etoc_1August2010 Patients enrolled in the SWOG S0205 trial completed the Brief Pain Inventory and a measure of emotional well-being at baseline and at weeks 5, 9, 13, and 17, post random assignme nt. Change in emotional well-being and worst pain were assessed over 17 weeks. Of the 766 enrolled patients, 720 contributed baseline health-related quality of life (HRQL) data. The two treatment arms did not differ statistically in the percentage of patients with successful worst pain palliation. Analyses showed significantly improved emotional well-being for patients on both arms by weeks 13 an d 17; worst pain showed significant decreases at all time points for both arms. Palliated pain and improved well-being w ere observed for patients on this trial. These improvements were similar in b oth treatment arms, suggesting that the addition of cetuximab did not contribute to improvement in these HRQL outcome s. Gemcitabine Plus Bevacizumab Compared With Gemcitab ine Plus Placebo in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: Phase III Trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 80303) http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/22/3617.abstract ?cmpid=jco_etoc_1August2010 Based on encouraging data reported in a phase II tr ial of combination gemcitabine plus bevacizumab in metastatic pancreatic cancer, a double-blind, randomized III trial of gemcitabine/bevacizumab versus gemcitabine/placebo in advanced pancreatic cancer patients was conducted. Of 602 enrolled patients, 535 were trea ted. Median overall survival was 5.8 months for gemcitabine/bevacizumab and 5.9 months for gemcitabine/placebo. Median progression-free surviv al was 3.8 and 2.9 months, respectively and overall respon se rates were 13% and 10%, respectively. The only statistically significant differences in grades 3 and 4 toxicity occurred for hypertensio n and proteinuria. The authors concluded that the addition of bevacizu mab to gemcitabine does not improve survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. ACOSOG Z05031 Phase II Trial of Adjuvant Therapy fo r Cancer Using Cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and Interferon-Alfa-2b-B ased Chemoradiation confirm the efficacy of interfer on-based chemoradiation regimen in a multicenter phase II trial. Patients with resected adenocarcino ma of the pancreatic head were treated with t interferon-alfa-2b, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil c oncurrently with external-beam Eighty-ni patients were enrolled. The all-cause grade >/=3 to xicity rate was 95% (80 patients) during therapy. Further development of this regimen will require ad ditional modifications to mitigate toxic effects. Weekly Paclitaxel After Failure of Gemcitabine in P ancreatic Cancer Patients with Malignant Ascites: A Retrospective Study http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656694 Peritoneal metastasis is one of the major sites of disease progression of pancreatic cancer. The safet y and efficacy of weekly paclitaxel therapy was evalu ated for pancreatic cancer patients with malignant ascites in a retrospective study. Researchers repor t that paclitaxel therapy may be a useful treatment option for pancreatic cancer patients with malignan t ascites after gemcitabine failure. Estimating Optimal Concurrent in Carcinoma: Mature Results o f GEMRT-01 Trial http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20056351 Mature data show that gemcitabine doses can be incr eased when delivered twice-weekly with concurrent radiotherapy. This combination shows promise to ach ieve better recurrence-free and overall survival an d to serve as a basis for further implementation of t he multimodal treatment of locally advanced pancrea tic carcinoma. Gemcitabine Metabolic and Transporter Gene Polymorp hisms are Associated with Drug Toxicity and Efficacy in Patients with Locally Advanced Panc reatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20665488 It has not been well established whether genetic va riations can be biomarkers for clinical outcome of gemcitabine therapy. This study aimed to identify s ingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of gemcitabin e metabolic and transporter genes that are associated with toxicity and efficacy of gemcitabine-based Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreati c cancer. The results indicated that some polymorph ic variations of drug metabolic and transporter genes may be potential biomarkers for clinical outcome of gemcitabine-based therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Court Ruling Could Pave Way for Gemzar Generics http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66S0H32010072 9 http://pharmalive.com/news/index.cfm?articleID=7203 34&categoryid=9&newsletter=1 A decision by a U.S. appeals court could pave the w ay for cheaper generic forms of Eli Lilly and Co's Gemzar cancer drug to be launched in the United Sta tes beginning in mid-November. Gemzar is approved to treat ovarian, lung, breast and pancrea tic cancer. Noteworthy Clinical Case Studies in Cancer Gene The rapy: Tumor Targeted Rexin-G Advances as an Efficacious Anti-Cancer Agent http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20428757 This paper highlights a series of noteworthy case s tudies in the emergent field of targeted genetic medicine, including several patients with treatment resistant pancreatic cancer. Personalized Genome Sequencing In Cancer Treatment http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/197516.php Researchers at the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Center have provided the first published example of genome-scale RNA and DNA sequencing of a tumor to aid in clinical decision making and therapeutic choice. While the research focused on a rare tumor of the tongue, analysis of the complete genomic sequence allowed the discovery of the genet ic changes that had accumulated within the tumor and a personalized drug regimen was initiated. Thi s is the first application of this technology and u shers in the era of personalized medicine in oncology, wh ereby therapies will be tailored precisely to the g enetic make-up of the tumor. While still in a preliminary stage, this approach is of particular relevance fo r cancer with no established treatment protocols and those w ith a lack of effective treatment options. New Link Genetics Phase III Trial http://www.bcm.edu/news/item.cfm?newsID=2667 Dr. William Fisher at Baylor College discusses the New Link Genetics phase III trial and shares some research that is being conducted as part of The Can cer Genome Atlas project. Fisher is hopeful that once the pancreatic cancer genome is complete, a pa tient's tumor can then be biopsied and subjected to a genetic analysis so doctors will know exactly wha t mutations are causing the tumor, and which treatment would be best. Multimodality Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer with L iver Metastases Using Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and/or Chinese Herbal Medicine http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20683216 This study explored the utility of chemotherapy, ra diation therapy, and/or Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer with l iver metastases (PCLM). Overall median survival tim e of the 164 patients was 4.7 months; 14% were alive at least 12 months after initial diagnosis of liver metastases. Analysis showed that chemotherapy and C hinese herbal medicine were protective factors and multimodality treatment was well tolerated by p atients with PCLM and may be effective in prolongin g survival. Adjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy for Adenocarcinoma of the Distal Pancreas http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20680697 This study examined the effect of adjuvant 5-FU-bas ed chemoradiation therapy after distal pancreatectomy. Patients who received adjuvant chem oradiation therapy were compared with those who underwent surgery alone. There was no significant d ifference in overall survival between patients trea ted with adjuvant CRT versus surgery alone (p = 0.23). An exploratory subgroup analysis suggested a potential survival benefit of adjuvant chemoradiati on therapy in patients with lymph node metastases. Taste Alterations in Cancer Patients Receiving Chem otherapy: A Neglected Side Effect? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667968 Taste alterations are a frequent but under-recogniz ed treatment side effect in cancer patients undergo ing chemotherapy. This study assessed the prevalence of taste alterations and their relation to sociodemographic and clinical variables, especially chemotherapy regimens and their association with Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org quality of life. Pancreatic cancer patients compri sed 19.3% of the sample. The prevalence of taste changes in chemotherapy patients was high (69.9%). There were clear differences in taste alterations among treatment groups. Fr example, patients receiv ing a combination of gemcitabine and a platinum agent reported the lowest taste alterations. Resear chers conclude the there is an urgent need for increased attention to this side effect, both in re search and in clinical practice. Pancreatoduodenectomy for Ductal Adenocarcinoma in the Very Elderly http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20714937 This study compared therapeutic outcomes for the el derly (80 years and above) and younger patients (under age 80) who underwent PD for pancreatic aden ocarcinoma from 1981 to 2007. Results showed that in experienced institutions, PD for ductal ade nocarcinoma is a viable option among the ambulatory elderly who were determined to be operative candida tes. Preoperative Endoscopic Tattooing of Pancreatic Bod y and Lesions Decreases Operative Time for Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554299 Precise localization of small pancreatic tumors is critical to achieving adequate margins of resection while preserving as much healthy pancreas as possible. Th is study determined the effect of endoscopic tattooing of the distal pancreas on operative time. Patients with a tattoo had a shorter operative tim e compared with patients without a tattoo and none re quired repeat surgery. Researchers conclude that endoscopic ultrasound-guided tattooing of pancreas lesions before a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is safe and is associated with decreased operative time compared with nontattooed patients. Postoperative External Beam Radiotherapy for Resect ed Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Impact of Chemotherapy on Local Control and Survival Postoperative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma retrospectively reviewed from the records of 47 pat ients. Their median survival time and 2-year actuar ial overall were 30.0 months and 54.5%, respec tively. Post-operative EBRT with chemotherapy control rate for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. EBRT combined with chemotherapy conferred a survival benefit compared to EBRT alone. Radiofrequency Ablation of Locally ultrasound-guided procedure performed during laparotomy in open surgery. It is restricted to loc ally advanced, non-resectable but non-metastatic tu mors. This paper provides an overview of the technique fo r pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Radiofrequency Ablation, Heat Shock Protein 70 and procedure with popularity in the treatm ent of hepatic and pancreatic anti-tumor immunit y, possibly through the induction heat shock protein 7 0 (HSP70) expression. An English-language literatur e search was conducted on anti-tumor immunity, heat s hock protein 70, radiofrequency ablation, hepatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other related subjec ts. Results indicated that RFA can induce the expression of HSP70, which possesses properties tha t enable it to influence a variety of immunological processes. Further investigations should be conduct ed. Efficacy and Tolerability of Limited Field Radiothe rapy with Concurrent Capecitabine in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20650619 Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (L APC) are commonly managed with chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), which may or ma y not include non-involved regional lymph nodes in the clinical target volume. Researchers present results of CRT for LAPC using capecitabine and delivering radiotherapy to a limited radiation fiel d that excluded non-involved regional lymph nodes f rom Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org the clinical target volume. They conclude CRT using capecitabine and limited field radiotherapy is a w ell- tolerated, relatively efficacious treatment for LAP C. Morphine Blocks Tumor Growth http://www.acor.org/news/display.html?id=9737 http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-07/ajop -mbt072710.php Current research suggests that taking morphine can block new blood vessel and tumor growth. University of Minnesota researchers examined the effect of mor phine use on new blood vessel growth in tumors and report that chronic morphine use decreased levels o f tumor angiogenesis in a manner dependent on the opioid receptor. This effect was mediated by suppre ssion of signaling induced by low oxygen concentrations, leading to a reduction in the level s of pro-angiogenic factors. Therefore, morphine ma y not only serve as an analgesic for cancer patients, but may also inhibit tumor angiogenesis and growth . Cold Viruses Could Be Cancer Fighters http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/Othe rCancers/21878 (includes video) Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological St udies in La Jolla, California report an engineered cold virus could be used one day to destroy tumors. Both tumors and adenoviruses use a similar strategy to avoid cellular defenses- shutting down the tumor su ppressor gene p53. In normal cells, p53 acts as a brake, preventing cell cycling when there is damage and in extreme cases causing the cell to self- destruct. In tumor cells and those infected with ad enovirus, those brakes are turned off. When the engineered virus enters a cell the brakes turn on, but in tumor cells there are no brakes, so it repli cates and kills tumor cells. Curcumin in Cancer ts, Pharmacokinetics, Trials http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20726007 Curcumin, a derivative of turmeric, is one of the m ost commonly used and highly researched phytochemicals. Abundant sources provide interestin g insights into the multiple mechanisms by which curcumin may mediate chemotherapy and chemopreventi ve effects on cancer. The authors report there is sufficient data exists to advocate phase II and pha se III clinical trials of curcumin for a variety of cancer conditions including multiple myeloma, pancreatic, and colon cancer. Scientists use Salmonella Bug to Kill Cancer Cells http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67A40Q2010081 1 Treating tumors with salmonella bacteria can induce an immune response that kills cancer cells that ma y help create tumor-killing immune cells to inject in to patients. Italian and American researchers work ed with mouse and human cancer cells and report their work might help in developing a therapeutic vaccine . While the team used melanoma cells in the study, th ey report the same technique could be analyzed in other cancer types. With Muscle-Building Treatment, Mice Live Longer Ev en as Tumors Grow http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100819 121206.htm In the vast majority of advanced cancer patients, t heir muscles will gradually waste away. The reasons for this are not well understood. Researchers report in the August 20 issue of Cell some new clues to this relationship and a way to reverse that process in m ice. Animals with cancer that received a muscle- building experimental treatment lived significantly longer, even as their tumors continued to grow. Th is is the first demonstration that muscle mass plays a ke y role in cancer survival,\" said H.Q. Han of Amgen Research. Funding May Affect Reporting of Trial Results http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Clin icalTrials/21491 Among drug trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, those primarily funded by industry were more likel y to report positive outcomes than those funded through other sources. The vast majority, 85.4%, of publish ed industry-funded trials had positive findings, compa red with 50% of those funded by government and 71.9% of those funded by nonprofit or nonfederal or ganizations. Can Cancer Patients Benefit From Phase I Drug Trial s? http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/726951?src=mpne ws&spon=7&uac=61043SJ Pancreatic Cancer Action Network | 2141 Rosecrans Ave. Suite 7000 | El Segundo, CA 90245 | Tel: 877.272.6226 | www.pancan.org There has been significant controversy about whethe r advanced cancer patients are get taken advantage of in phase I trials, and whether they actually ben efit from experimental drugs. Findings from a recen t study out of MD Anderson suggest that doctors shoul d consider referring their terminally ill patients to such trials. They reported that patients with advan ced head and neck cancer survived just as well on experimental drugs in phase I trials as they did on FDA-approved standard therapies. Cancer Patients' Roles in Treatment Decisions: Do C haracteristics of the Decision Influence Roles? http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2010/08/16/JC O.2009.26.8870.abstract Patients with more active roles in decisions are mo re satisfied and may have better health outcomes. Patients making decisions about treatments for whic h no evidence supports benefit, and decisions about noncurative treatments, reported more physician control, which suggests tha t patients may not want the responsibility of deciding on treatments that will not cure them. While this study looked at lung and colorectal patients, better shared decision-making strategies are needed for all terminally ill patien ts when there is no evidence to support the benefit of a treatment. Continental Divide? The Attitudes of US and Canadia n Oncologists on the Costs, Cost- Effectiveness, and Health Policies Associated With New Cancer Drugs http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/gca?sendit=Get+All+Chec ked+Abstract%28s%29&gca=JCO.2010.29.1625v1 Both U.S. and Canadian health care systems face cha llenges posed by the rising costs of cancer drugs. The study surveyed oncologists' attitudes regarding the costs and cost-effectiveness of medications and related health policy. More US oncologists reported favoring access to effective treatments regardless of cost, while more Canadians favored access to effective tr eatments only if they are cost-effective. Both groups reported patient out-of-pocket costs influence their treatment recommendations, bu t less than half the respondents always or frequently discuss the co sts of treatments with their patients. Both groups have similar attitudes regarding cancer drug costs, cost-effecti veness, and associated policies, despite practicing in different health care systems. Frank Talk About Care at Life's End http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/health/24brod.htm l?src=me&ref=health Legislators have begun to recognize the medical, hu manitarian and economic value of helping terminally ill patients and their families navigate treatment options as they approach the end of life. Last week , over the objections of New York State's medical society, Gov. Paterson signed into law the New York Palliat ive Care Information Act requiring physicians who treat patients with a terminal illness/condition to offe r information about prognosis and options for end-of- life care, including aggressive pain management, hospice care and possibilities for further life-sus taining treatment. The need has been identified for education and training to increase physician compet ency in discussing palliative care with patients an d families, and in identifying those with limited lif e expectancy. Letting Go - What Should Medicine do When it Can't Save Your Life? http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/02/10080 2fa_fact_gawande The August 2 issue of the New Yorker magazine discusses the difficulty of end-of-life di scussions between doctor and patient noting the balancing act between not killing hope and confronting death. Th e article asks, \"What should medicine do when it can' t save your life?\" The author uses as illustration s several case histories, including the story of a fi refighter with pancreatic cancer. Study Shows Value of Quality-of-Life Cancer Care http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i XzZIJ8diAKIpyWggY9NPVjTA81AD9HM4JP01 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1000678 A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirms the benefits of end-of-life care in the terminally ill. While the study looked at patients with terminal lung cancer, the findings can apply t o pancreatic cancer, which also has a substantial sym ptom burden and need for comprehensive care. The study reported terminal lung cancer patients wh o began receiving palliative care immediately upon diagnosis not only were happier, more mobile and in less pain as their disease progressed, but they al so lived nearly three months longer.
