[byAtlas Team](#) As Hong Kong implements its latest push for all residents to get their third covid vaccine, you may be aware of and experience some of the covid vaccine side-effects. Women, particularly, are starting to see the trend in their menstrual cycles following the vaccine. Common complaints in research and what our clients have reported include delayed bleeding, longer periods, or missed periods, post-vaccine. One study showed that 66.3% of women had menstrual abnormalities following their covid vaccine. Another study found that up to 70% of women had irregular periods following their second vaccine. One other report showed that this is not just a problem for menstruating women. Post-menopausal women have also had symptoms with 66% of them experiencing breakthrough bleeding. Since the female reproductive cycle is around 28 days, it can take some time to see these side-effects. Whereas neurological side effects like facial paralysis tend to happen within hours to days of the vaccine, if a woman receives the vaccine at the very beginning of her cycle (i.e. when she is on her period), she may not notice any changes for 4 weeks. By then, it is easy to forget about the vaccination and she may not even correlate the vaccine and her abnormal period. As more women report reproductive issues following vaccination, the scientific community is starting to do studies and collect data from women in order to discover why this is happening and what potential long-term effects may occur. As with any new pharmaceutical intervention put to market quickly, we cannot possibly have known all the potential effects beforehand. Ordinarily, years of research is done before a drug goes to market. The last couple of years have been one of the biggest opportunities to collect significant data on a pharmaceutical, since it is rare for a drug to be distributed to such a broad group of people during initial research. This is basically the biggest science experiment we have done on ourselves, so it is a remarkable chance to learn from it. Menstrual cycles are an excellent reflection of a woman's health. According to one study, women with irregular and longer menstrual cycles have a higher risk of death before 70 years old. So, it is vitally important that women know if their cycle is regular and look into the root cause of any irregularity. What can women do to avoid these side effects if they choose to get the covid vaccine? The research is not yet conclusive. Remember it takes years to learn about the long-term effects of new pharmaceuticals. However, regardless of pharmaceutical interventions, there are a few basic rules you can follow to have a healthy reproductive cycle: - Have your spine, pelvis, and nervous system checked by a chiropractor. The muscles and other soft tissues around the reproductive organs need to move well for maximal comfort throughout your cycle. What controls the movement of those soft tissues? The nervous system. By getting the nervous system in good shape, the soft tissues can function better. Better function means less inflammation, less pain, and less cramping. - Check in on your nutrition. 350 mg of magnesium, 40 mg of zinc, and 1000-3000 mg of high quality omega-3 fish oil daily can help with inflammation and PMS symptoms in many women. Check with your doctor if you need your levels checked to dial in your specific needs. - Exercise daily. Intensity can change during different phases of your cycle, so you may want to ramp up the intensity with cardio and strength training while you're bleeding and ease into Pilates and low intensity workouts in the days leading up to your period. Start tracking your workouts and how you feel at different points in your cycle to discover what works best for your body. The Wild AI app is a great free option.
