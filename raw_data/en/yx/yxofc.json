It is based on the concept that illness arises when the bodys three systems, or doshas, are out of balance. To balance the nervous (Vata), the venous (Pitta) and the arterial (Kapha) systems, Ayurvedic practitioners primarily prescribe medicinal herbs and massage with oil. Additional healing methods can include yoga, sweat baths, meditation, medical enemas and nasal cleansing. Rooted in Hinduism, the philosophy of Ayurvedic medicine contends that the body, mind and soul are connected to the outer world. When the relationship among these elements of ones personality is out of balance, health problems arise. The practice has evolved in recent years to treat such modern health concerns as addiction, work stress, weight loss and infertility. Modern Indian society recognizes Ayurveda as a legitimate medical system. Practitioners receive state-licensed, institutionalized medical training. Approximately two-thirds of Indias rural people, who comprise 70 percent of the population, use Ayurveda for their primary health care needs. In the United States, approximately 751,000 people have received Ayurvedic treatment, according to a 2004 National Center for Health Statistics study. Despite Ayurveda's growing popularity in the West, traces of lead, mercury and arsenic have been found in over-the-counter Ayurvedic medicines manufactured in South Asia. The Center for Disease Control received 12 reports of lead poisoning linked to Ayurvedic medications in 2004. As well, Ayurveda faces challenges brought about by the continued modernization in all sectors of Indian life. Read the extended interview with Dr. Ram Manohar of Arya Vaidya Pharmacy for more on the finer points of Ayurvedic treatment, the dilemmas that come with standardized medicine and training, and the UCLA study measuring Ayurvedas effectiveness compared with Western practices.
