She wants to live in a world where chocolate chip cookies are considered a health food, refrigerators double as personal chefs, and chickens can be chickens, not food. Vegetarian since 1992, her switch to veganism in 1999 was coupled with becoming the in-house attorney for the Physicians Committee. Her first assignment was to sue the US Department of Agriculture for establishing a Committee tasked with updating the Dietary Guidelines for Americans whose members were riddled with financial links to the meat, dairy and egg industries. Thereafter, she filed several more lawsuits and petitions against the federal government and multi-national corporations like Kraft and Tysons demanding changes in nutritional policy and truthfulness in marketing. Today, Mindy is the Chair of the Board of Directors for the Physicians Committee.
