The earliest efforts to immunis e persons to prevent disease date back to about 1000 AD. However, only after the 1902 formation of the Biological Control Act in the Unites States of America , which regulated manufacturers and required both licen sing and inspections , were vaccines produced with more consistent quality (1). From 1914 onwards, there was licensing of bacterial vaccines (e.g. tetanus toxoid, vaccines against typhoid and pertuss is) that fulfilled the criteria of the Biologic al Control Act. Since the 1920s, vaccin es have spread across the globe . The first vaccination programmes dramatically reduced the number of deaths from disease and were crucial in establishing the concept of preventive public health measures (2) . For example, in Australia diphtheria notifications and deaths plummeted in the 1930s due to infant and school -based immunis ation programmes (3). Viral vaccines were also developed a fter the discovery of cell cultures th at could grow viruses in 1930 (1) . The increasing number of vaccines urged the development of combination v accines containing antigens against several diseases in order to decrease the number of immunis ations (4). The first combination vaccines , targeting diphtheria and tetanus (DT) and eventually pertussis (DTP) were licens ed in 1947 and 1949, respectively. To date, many other combination vaccines are available for protection against multiple diseases. Alongside the increased use of vaccinations to prevent disease, criticism of vaccination has spread around the world , as sho wn in Figure 1 (5, 6) . General introduction 3 1 Figure 1. The Cow Pock ...or...the Wonderful Effects of the New Inoculation! A cartoon by James Gillray, published June 12, 1802 by H. Humphrey, St. James's Street. As many vaccine -preventable diseases have the highest disease burden in early childhood (7), almost all countries have a universal childhood national immunis ation programme in place , starting in the first months of life. In 1974, the Expanded Programme on Immunis ation of the World Health Organ isation (WHO) was established to ensure tha t all children in all countries benefited from lifesaving vaccines (8). In 1977, the goal was set to make immunis ation against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles , and tuberculosis available to every child in the world by 1990. To date, this goal has not been achieved, but tremendous progress has been made. Major challenges to the Expanded Program me are accelerating and sustaining national immunis ation efforts. Th ese national immunisation efforts are also recognised as an essential aspect to reach WHO's Sustainable Development Goals concerning the reduction of child mortality (9) . The aim of sustained high national immunis ation coverage is to decrease morbidity and mortality of the disease as much as possible in the target group, leading to interrupted transmission and herd immunity, if possible. If a disease is completely under control, eradication or elimination of diseas e can be discussed (10 -12). Eradication refers to a situation where disease and its causal agent have been removed completely and permanently. Once the worldwide incidence has reached to zero for a certain amount of time , it can be discussed whether intervention m easures Chapter 1 4 are no longer needed. In 1980, the goal of smallpox eradication was reached (2) . For poliomy elitis, eradication efforts began in 1988 and the goal is nearby (13) . For elimination to occur, the specific agen t may still circulate but does not lead to disease because of vaccination programmes and herd immunity. Continued high vaccination coverage is needed to prevent re -establishment of transmission, and surveillance must be in place to detect outbreaks as soon as possible. The World Health Organi sation aims to eliminate both measles and rubella, as has already been achieved in the Americas for measles . All six WHO regions have measles elimination goals , and three have also developed rubella elimination goals (14) . Worldwide, the extent of control of the other diseases, targeted through mass vaccination programmes, differs per country. Immuni sation programmes in the Netherlands In the Netherlands, two routine national immunisa tion programmes are in place . The Programme (NIP) , also called 'Rijksvaccinatie programma ', targets infants and children, and the seasonal influenza vaccination targets older adults and predefined risk groups. The National Immuni sation Programme In 1952, routine childhood vaccination targeting diphtheria, tetanus , and pertussis was introduced in the Netherlands. Th e NIP officially started in 1957 (15, 16) , following a large poliomyelitis outbreak in the preceding year (17) . During the first years, inf ants received a primary series targeting diphtheria, tetanus, pertus sis, and poliomyelitis (DTP- IPV) at three, four , and five months of age with booster dose s at 11 months and four years of age (18) . In 1965, the pertussis component was left out of the four year booster and a second dT -IPV booster dose at nine years of age was added to the programme. In 1987, after a short period of single vaccination against rubella ( 11-year -old girls) and measles (boys and girls) a measles -mumps -rubella (MMR) combination vaccine was implemented with two doses, i.e. one at 14 months and the second at nine years of age (19) . In recent decades, vaccinations were introduced against Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib; 1993), Meningococcal serogroup PCV7 in 2006, 2011). Lastly, vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV, 2010; 12 year old girls) and universal hepatitis B (HBV , 2011) were implemented (16) . Over time, several a daptations in the NIP have been implemented, mainly in view of the re- emergence of pertussis. In 1999, the primary schedule was advanced to start at 6 to 9 weeks. In late 2001, an acellular pertussis (aP) component was added to the preschool dT -IPV booster at four years of age , and in 2005 we s witch ed to vaccines General introduction 5 1 with aP during infancy from combination vaccines incorporating whole- cell pertussis (wcP ) in the primary and booster infant series. Currently, the Dutch NIP contains 14 vaccinations, given between two months and 12 years of age and targeting 12 diseases (Figure 2). All NIP vaccinations are free of charge , and participation is voluntary. Figure 2. The National Immunis ation Programme of the Netherlands in 2018. Organ isation of the N ational Immunisation Programme All NIP vaccines are purchased from private manufacturers by the Department for Vaccine Supply and Prevention Programmes (Dienst Vaccins en Preventieprogramma's; DVP) within RIVM . The buying of these vaccines is subjected to a European tender procedure with a fixed contract duration (20) . Therefore, product changes occur over time. This department also manages supply and distribution of all NIP vaccines, monitors cold chain procedures , and facilitates invitations for vaccination. Finally , it manages the national vaccination registry, incorporated in 'Praeventis'. Th e Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control (Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding ) within RIVM is responsible for NIP management. The NIP is fully embedded in regular child health care (jeugdgezondheidszorg), with high attendance (21) . Coverage for all vaccinations steadily ranges between 90% and 96% (22) except for HPV among teenage girls , for which coverage ranges between 53% and 61 %. Influenza vaccination for older adults and risk groups Alongside the NIP, there is the annual seasonal influenza vaccination , a routine mass vaccination programme during autumn. Influenza vaccination always has been a task Chapter 1 6 of general practitioners . Systematic invitation of target groups started in the early 1990s (23) . Since 1996, o n advice of the Health Council , the seasonal vaccination has been offered to healthy people 65 and above in addition to groups at risk for complications from influenza virus infection because of certain chronic medical conditions (24, 25) . In 1997, the Dutch National Influenza Prevention Programme , or 'Nationaal Programma Grieppreventie' (NPG) , was implemented. Since 2008, all individuals aged 60 years and older are invited. The N ational Influenza Prevention Programme Foundation (Stichting Nationaal Programma Grieppreventie) is responsible for the practical implementation of the NPG, whereas the Centre for Health and Society (a s part of RIVM), coordinates the NPG as a whole. The vaccination is free of charge. Regarding the influenza vaccination programme, the Department for Vaccine Supply and Prevention Programmes has the same tasks and responsibilities as with respect to the NI P, except that registration of administered vaccines is not centralised but locally documented in the medical files of the general practitioners. Following an increase in coverage from 30% (1992) to 70% (2009), coverage went down to 53% in 2014 and 50% in 2015 (26, 27) . The decrease is most pronounced in 60-65-year -old and otherwise healthy adults, whose coverage was 24% in 2015. In addition to the groups mentioned above, health care personnel in close contact to patients with an increased risk for a severe course of influenza are urged to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Their employers are responsible for of fering this vaccination (28) . Information on the uptake among health care workers is not systematically monitored, but the few available studies show extremely low uptake (29) . Vaccination campaigns during o utbreaks Besides these two routine mass vaccination programmes, vaccination campaigns are organised if necessary, e.g. during an outbreak. In the Netherlands, groups of Orthodox Protestants live in socio- geographically clustered communities and are critical towards vaccination on religious grounds. Th e resu lting area of low vaccination coverage spreads from the south -west to the north -east of the country and is called the 'Bible Belt', with 75% of Orthodox Protestants living in these regions. The remaining 25% live in scattered clusters across the country (30) . Because of this socio- geographic clustering, Orthodox Protestants do not profit from the herd protection provided elsewhere by high vaccination coverage in the general population. Outbreaks may occur if a NIP -targeted pathogen is introduced and the number of susceptible individuals is sufficient. For example, in 1999 -2000 and in 2013 -2014 measles outbreaks occurred in the Orthodox Protestant community (31, 32). During the most recent outbreak, early MMR was offered to 6- to-14-month -old infants living in municipalities with MMR1 vaccination coverage below 90%, to protect them against severe disease. General introduction 7 1 Outbreaks of poliomyelitis have been another problem in the Bible Belt . Since the instalment of the NIP (using only inactivated polio vaccine, or IPV) , vaccination with oral polio vaccine (OPV) was used during poliomyelitis outbreaks in 1971, 1978 and 1992 -1993 in the Bible Belt wi th 39, 110 and 71 cases, respectively (33 -35). Nationwide, even outside areas with low vaccination coverage , new strains of pathogens may emerge and rapidly spread. For instance, outbreaks of meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) disease were controlled using a polysaccharide MenC vaccine in 1998 (36) and a conjugated MenC vaccine in July 2001 (37) . No vaccination wa s offered during two smaller outbreaks in late 2000 and early 2001 (38) . The 2000 - 2001 -outbreaks coincided with a genera l increase in notifications of meningococcal serogroup C disease (39) . This increase resulted in a large mass vaccination campaign in 2002, using conjugated MenC vaccine . A catch -up campaign was organised for all children from one to 18 years of age, followed by NIP implementation of MenC vaccination at 14 months of age from September 2002 onwards (37) . In 2018, due to an outbreak of MenW starting late 2015, the MenC vaccination at 14 months will be replaced by a MenACWY vaccination, and a booster MenACWY dose for adolescents will be added to the NIP (40, 41) . Similarly , in 2009 a new variant of an influenza A virus spread from Mexico to all other continents and reached the Netherlands in April of that year (42) . Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination was available from November 2009 and was used to protect groups who were most at risk. Be sides all the people who were eligible for seasonal influenza vaccination, several other groups were eligible for H1N1 - vaccination. Among them were 1. h ealthy pregnant women in their second and third trimester, 2. infants between six months and five years of age, 3. h ousehold members of infants below six months of age , and 4. h ousehold members of high risk patients. Decision- making regarding composition of NIP , target groups for seasonal influenza, and vaccinations during outbreaks. After a new vaccine is licensed and available, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS) may request the Dutch Health Council , together with the Health Care Insurance Board , to advis e on the position of the vaccine within the entire spectrum of vaccination care in the Netherlands. Bearing in mind the public health nature of vaccination , factors that determine whether a vaccine should be part of a mass vaccination programme have been translated into seven selection criteria that are grouped under five thematic headings: seriousness and exten t of the disease burden, effectiveness and safety, acceptability, efficiency , and priority of the vaccination (Table 2) (43) . The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports finally decides on the advice of the Health Council . Chapter 1 8 Table 2. Criteria for inclusion of a vaccine in a mass vaccination programme in the Netherlands (44) . Seriousness and extent of the disease burden 1. The infectious disease causes considerable disease burden within the population. a.The infectious disease is serious for individuals, and b. The infectious disease affects or has the potential to affect a large number of people. Effectiveness and safety of the vaccination 2. Vaccination may be expected to considerably reduce the disease burden within the population. a. The vaccine is effective for the prevention of disease or the reduction of symptoms. b. The necessary vaccination rate is attainable (if eradication/elimination or the creation of herd immunity is sought). 3. Any adverse effects associated with vaccination are not sufficient to substantially diminish the public health benefit. Acceptability of the vaccination 4. The inconvenience or discomfort that an individual may be expected to experience in connection with his/her personal vaccination is not disproportionate in relation to the health benefit for the individual concerned and the population as a whole. 5. The inconvenience or discomfort that an individual may be expected to experience in connec tion with the vaccination programme as a whole is not disproportionate in relation to the health benefit for the individual concerned and the population as a whole. Efficiency of the vaccination 6. The balance between the cost of vaccination and the associate d health benefit compares favourably to that associated with other means of reducing the relevant disease burden. Priority of the vaccination 7. Relative to other vaccinations that might also be selected for inclusion, provision of this vaccination serves a n urgent public health need at reasonable individual and societal costs. Usually, d uring outbreak situations , an outbreak management team (OMT) advi ses on temporary vaccination strategies to control the outbreak (45) . If the advice is adopted General introduction 9 1 by the Administrative Advisory Board (Bestuurlijk Afstemmingsoverleg), the final decision to start the vaccination campaign is taken by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport s. This system of scaling up during outbreaks and crises was implemented shortly after the 1992 -1993 outbreak of poliomyelitis . During the H1N1 -pandemic in 2009, the Health Council and the Centre for Infectious Disease Control advised together on target gr oups and priorit isation (42) .Evaluation of the National Immunization Programme, seasonal influenza vaccination, and mass vaccinations during outbreaks is an integral part of the task of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control. The Centre coordinates the control of infectious diseases, including effective prevention, close vigilance , and quick response in the event of an outbreak, and contributes to reducing health problems related to infectious diseases. It also provides the Health Council with up -to-date data on vaccine preventable diseases that are currently part of mass immunisation programmes or may be embedded in the near future. Indeed, in general the Health Council mentions in its advice the need for close monitoring of short- and long -term effects of the vaccinations, including s afety . Surveillance of mass immunis ation progr ammes . To measure the success of a vaccination programme , it is essential to monitor its impact. In particular , there is a need to verify if a vaccine has a continuous positive benefit/ risk balance, not only in the target group, but also in the entire popu lation and for a longer period of time . Therefore, continuous surveillance remains essential both for diseases under control (e.g. polio) , diseases that remain endemic (e.g. pertussis, pneumococcal disease and influenza ), potentially emerging vaccine -preventable diseases, and those that may re -emerge despite vaccination. Surveillance is defined as the ongoing systematic collection and analysis of data and the provision of information which leads to action being taken to prevent and control disease (46) . There must be ongoing assessment of vaccination coverage, disease incidence, safety, pathogen, plus serological surveillance of the target population and the population as a whole (11) . These surveill ance systems are usually designed to monitor trends, detect and describe problems , and generate hypotheses to be tested in more refined research designs (12) . Such systems are important, because immunis ations ch ange the epidemiology of diseases. For instance, due to a decrease in the force of infection, age of infection can increase and in some diseases lead to a more severe cour se (47) . This occurred for example in Greece in the 198 0s, when an increase in congenital rubella syndrome occurred due to suboptimal (i.e. 50%) uptake of MMR vaccination in infants. Furthermore, a new pathogen or a non- vaccine -preventable strain can occupy the niche that becomes available after vaccination . Likewise, a pathogen can change, leading to decreased vaccine effectiveness , as is currently shown for pneumococcal disease and also postulated for pertussis (16, 4 8, 49) . Likewise, antibody levels and the duration of protection can differ between naturally infected and vaccinated Chapter 1 10 people. This is exemplified in decreased transfer of measles -specific maternal antibodies from mothers vaccinated with MMR compared to mothers who were naturally infected with measles (50, 51) . This changing epidem iology may require fine-tuning or adaptation of the NIP. Surveillance systems should be periodically reviewed based on their quality as well as their usefulness and cost (52) . A vaccin e surveillance system is useful if it can 1. detect trends signalling possible new problems, 2. d etect outbreaks leading to control and prevention activities, 3. provide quantitative estimates of prevented morbidity and mortality, 4. identify factors invol ved in disease occurrence, 5. f acilitate research that is likely to lead to control or prevention , or 6. p ermit assessment of the effects of control measures. Sensitivity, specificity, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, flexibility , and acceptabil ity should be taken into account when looking at quality. In the assessment of costs, direct and indirect costs should be involved, e.g. by using a social cost- benefit analysis. Surveillance and epidemiological studies of the Dutch National Immunis ation Programme and seasonal influenza vaccination programme The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports has commissioned the Centre for Infectious Disease Control with the evaluation of the NIP, seasonal influenza vaccinations and mass vaccination campaigns du ring outbreaks. For this task, the Centre uses a surveillance system that is based on five pillars, by which we aim to answer several questions: 1. Vaccination coverage. How high is the vaccination coverage? Are there specific groups or regions were vaccination coverage is lower? Is the coverage high enough to sustain herd immunity? Do we meet WHO targets? What trends over time occur? To this end, the Centre for Infectious Disease Control uses data from the individual - based electronic national vaccination registry 'Praeventis' to assess coverage of the National Immunisation Programme. Likewise, for coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination, data bas ed on a sample of nearly 800,000 general practitioner's records are used. 2. Safety surveillance. What is the safety profile of vaccines in both the short and long term? Which new, rare, and/or severe adverse events are reported after vaccination? What is the frequency of milder and more commonly occurring adverse events? Which adverse events can be expected in view of the introduction of a new vaccine and what is their background rate? General introduction 11 1 The cornerstone of safety surveillance is the passive reporting system of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), in place at the Dutch Pharmacovigilance Centre, also called 'Lareb'. Aggregated results of AEFI following NIP and influenza vaccinations are described in yearly reports and placed on the Lareb website (53) . Furthermore, the Cent re for Infectious Disease Control performs epidemiological studies to assess and quantify a possible association in case of safety signals (54) . Tolerability surveys are carried out if new vaccines are introduced in the routine programme or in temporary outbreak control. Finally, backgr ound rates of AEFI are studied in advance of the introduction of a new vaccine to gain more perspective, especially when new groups become eligible for vaccinations (55 -57). 3. Disease surveillance. What is the effectiveness of vaccin ations in reducing the incidence of the target disease and its complications? How does effectiveness develop over time? Do all people eligible for vaccination, benefit equally? Is herd protection apparent? For most NIP diseases, data are based on mandator y notifications by care providers. Data on 'influenza like illness' (ILI) or 'acute respiratory illness' (ARI), derived from the 'NIVEL Primary Care Database' (Netherlands institute for health services research) are used to monitor influenza (58) . Furthermore, data from the National Reference Laboratory for bacterial meningitis and weekly reports of virological laboratories are used. Additional data on disease -specific hospitalisations and deaths give insight into more severe disease courses for all vaccine -preventable diseases. When vaccination data are also available, vaccine effectiveness can be calculated. 4. Pathogen surveillance. Do changes occur in circulating pathogens as result of vaccination pressure, and does this impact vaccine effectiveness? How closely are new -found pathogens related; is a common source plausible? Wha t are the characteristics of influenza -positive samples during the influenza season? Monitoring is based on evaluation of strain variations due to differences in phenotype and/or genotype. 5. Immunosurveillance. What are the risks for (re)emergence of diseases targeted by vaccination? How well is the population protected at present and in the future? Are some groups at increased risk for disease? Can potential problems be expected in view of changing dynamics in infectious disease after vaccination and age -specific antibody profile (e.g. waning immunity)? To answer the above questions, the Centre for Infectious Disease Control periodically collect s a blood sample and questionnaire data from a representative sample of the general population , i.e. PIENTER surveys , to assess seroprevalence acquired through natural infection or vaccination (16) . This survey was performed in 199 5-1996 (59) and in 2006 -2007 (60) . Data collection of the third survey was finished late 2017. Chapter 1 12 Oversampling of risk groups, e.g. people living in regions with low vaccine coverage and immigrants was performed. This surveillance system is supplemented with more in -depth studies and research if necessary. For several surveillance aspects, the Centre for Infectious Disease Control collaborates with external partners. The combined information collected through the five surveillance pillars offers an integrated picture of the Dutch NIP and influenza vaccination programme . This picture gives insight in to aspects and parts of the programme s that need more study or can be optimise d. Current status of vaccine -preventable d iseases targeted through mass vaccinations. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccinations were introduced in early 1950s. The two diseases are currently under control with only rare occasions of disease (16) . Regarding tetanus, protection in the general population is very high and sustained, perhaps enabling a widening of the 10 -year interval between tetanus toxoid boosters, described in the tetanus post -exposure prophylaxis guideline (61) . In this thesis, we investigated a bedside test for tetanus immunity, to support this optimisation of tetanus vaccinations. With respect to poliomyelitis, d espite the presence of the high -risk Orthodox Protestant community, the Netherlands as a whole is categorised as 'low -risk country' since 2011, based on high vaccina tion coverage and adequate surveillance being in place (62) . The latest poliomyelitis outbreak occurred in 1992 -1993 (35) . With respect to measles and rubella , elimination is challenging because vaccination coverage of at least 95% for both doses of MMR vaccine is required to maintain sufficient population immunity (63 ). For some years, vaccination coverage has been slowly declining (64) . In 2016, coverage for the first MMR at 14 months of age and second MMR at 9 years of age w as 94.8% and 92%, respectively . The latest rubella outbreak was in 2004 -2005 (65) , while the latest measles outbreak occurred in 2013 - 2014 , both spreading in the Bible Belt area (32) . During the last measles outbreak, children 6 -14 months old living in municipalities with a low MMR1 cover age were offered early MMR vaccination, since young infants are at increased risk for severe disease. However, the literature shows that effectiveness of early MMR is age - dependant, being lower effectiveness at younger age (66, 67) . Finally, information on the tolerability of this early MMR was very limited and derived mainly from studies in developing countries. Therefore, we aimed to assess effectiveness and tolerability of this early MMR as a temporary outbrea k measure. Mumps is an example of waning immunity after vaccination. O utbreaks occur on a regular basis, mainly among students who have received two MMR vaccinations (68, 69). Modelling studies showed that under specific conditions mumps could increase General introduction 13 1 among vaccinated individuals about 30 years after the introduction of vaccination because of suboptimal coverage or waning immunity (70, 71) . The m ost prominent example of vaccine failure is the worldwide re- emergence of Bordetella pertussis (72, 73) . Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis has resurged since the late 1990s, with additional epidemic peaks every three to four years . From 1996 onwards, the yearly number of notifications ranged between 2,573 (1998) and 13,828 (2012). There is an increase in incidence among adolescents and adults, who are an important source of transmission for infants not yet fully vaccinated (74, 75) . An increase is also seen in very young infants , who are at highest risk for hospital isation and severe morbidity and mortality (76) . In our thesis, we assessed whether measures taken to stop the increase were effective and actually protected the not yet (fully) vaccinated infants. Preterm infants are at even higher risk for severe pertussis disease and overrepresented in infant pertussis hospitalisations (77, 78) . In a medical record study on pertussis hospitalisations, we aimed to compare the pertussis disease burden in term and preterm infants, relate the clinical presentation to vaccination status, and compute vaccine effectiveness estimates for both groups. To quantify the underreporting of pertussis hospitalisation and death, particularly in the light of the possible introduction of maternal pertussis vaccination, we also performed a capture- recapture analysis using two sources for each outcome. The incidence of invasive disease caused by the vaccine types of Streptococcus pneumoniae has decreased considerably since the introduction of PCV7 in 2006 and later switch to PCV10 in 2011 , not only among vaccinated children, but also in other age categories, especially the elderly. However , this decrease is progressively eroded by the increase in disease due to non -vaccine serotypes , particularly in older adults and elderly (79) . The impact on non -invasive and far more frequent pneumococcal respiratory disease, like pneumonia, is also monitored based on primary care and hospitalisation data (80) . Cases of Haemophilus influenza type b, Meningococcus serogroup C disease , and acute Hepatitis B are rare (16) . For the Netherlands, time after introduction of HPV vaccination is too short to draw firm conclusion s. However, international data show that vaccine effectiveness against cervical lesions and genital warts is high (81) . Follow -up of vaccinated and unvaccinated gi rls in the Netherlands show s high effectiveness against early endpoints of HPV, i.e. against p ersistent infections with HPV16 and 18. Given the continual media focus on adverse events following HPV vaccination, safety surveillance with respect to HPV vaccination is very important. Already at the start of the introduction, experts urged assessment of background rates of possible AEFI, especially immune -mediated disorders (55, 57) . In this thesis, we describe the background rate of Multiple Sclerosis to evaluate potential future reports o n adverse events in perspective (55, 56) . Chapter 1 14 The incidence of influenza -like illness and influenza virus infection fluctuates from year to year. Vaccine effectiveness estimates vary over time, because circulating influenza strains do not always match with the strains included in the seasonal vaccines. The threat of a new pandemic always plays a role. Therefore, during the 2009 pandemic, the Centre for Infectious Disease Control participated in a European consortium that calculated background rates for a set of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) with a known association with seasonal influenza and therefore of possible importance in the 2009 pandemic (83) , again to put potential reports of adverse events into perspective (55, 56) . For th e Netherlands, we looked into the background rates for Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an adverse event known to follow certain infections and particularly a swine flu vaccination programme in the USA in 1976 (84) . Lessons le arned from the outbreak measures, taken during the 2009 -pandemic are meaningful for both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our study on adverse events following both vaccines in 2009 was set up to increase knowledge on the tolerability of serial administere d influenza doses and differences between adjuvanted and non - adjuvanted vaccines. Likewise, the linkage study on adverse pregnancy outcomes following pandemic influenza vaccination during pregnancy was conducted to learn more about the safety of maternal influenza vaccination, a measure advised by the WHO but not yet implemented in the Netherlands. Aim and o utline of this thesis. As described above, monitoring of NIP and influenza mass vaccination programmes is relevant to optimise vaccination strategies and keep programmes successful with high acceptance and trust by the public and professionals. The aim of this thesis was to obtain insight into strengths and limitations of the various surveillance systems used to monitor the NIP and influenza programme and bring forward ideas on improvement of surveillance. It focusses on three aspects of surveillance of vaccine -preventable diseases: disease, safety, and immunosurveillance. The first part of the thesis concerns disease surveillance and epidemiological studies on pertussis. The first study on pertussis disease is a surveillance study designed to obtain knowledge on pertussis epidemiology in relation to changes in the pertussis vaccination schedule (chapter 2) . We wanted to know whether the young, not yet (fully) vaccinated infants, who are at highest risk for severe disease, are well protected via the current pertussis vaccination schedule. Given the known underestimation of more severe disease courses, we tried to assess the completeness of records on pertussis hospitalisations and deaths, covered by several registries routinely used for surveillance in the light of possible introduction of additional vaccination measures, e.g. third- trimester maternal pertussis vaccination (chapter 3) . As preterm and term infants might profit differently from this maternal vaccination, General introduction 15 1 we obtained baseline information on the pertussis burden in these two groups (chapter 4) . The next part of the thesis concerns early measles vaccination, which was offered during the latest measles outbreak. Because vaccine effectiveness estimates against laboratory -confirmed measles in infants below 9 months of age had not been reported using an observational study design in developed countries, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of this outbreak response measure (chapter 5). Likewise, because data on early MMR tolerability stem mainly from studies in developing countries, we looked into that aspect in chapter 6 . The next chapters deal with safety and preparedness for possible safety issue s regarding two large mass vaccination campaigns launched in 2009: the catch -up campaign of HPV vaccination among girls 13 to 16 years old and the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Given the urgency of the latter, extensive information on the tolerability of pan demic vaccines was lacking. Yet safety was an issue because adjuvanted instead of non -adjuvanted vaccines were used, and new groups were vaccinated (e.g. pregnant women). Therefore we assessed the tolerability of seasonal influenza vaccination followed by two doses of pandemic vaccine (chapter 7) in adults who received these vaccinations from their general practitioners. Likewise, we studied the safety of pandemic vaccination during pregnancy for mother and infant, because vaccinating healthy pregnant women had never been advised in the Netherlands, and in general there is hesitancy to interfere during a pregnancy (chapter 8). To be able to put possible safety signals into perspective, we also assessed background rates of a range of adverse events following influenza vaccination, including Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (chapter 9). Likewise for the HPV vaccination campaign, preparedness for possible safety signals was important, because eligible girls formed a new age group for vaccination. Furthermore, adolescenc e coincides with increased incidence of several immune -mediated diseases, which could be attributed to the HPV vaccination, whereas in fact there is only a temporal association (55, 57) . Again, therefore, we assessed background rates of several immune -mediated disorders, including Multiple Scle rosis (chapter 10). The last part of this thesis includes two studies on immune -surveillance. We assessed the seroprotection against poliomyelitis in the light of ongoing eradication efforts (chapter 11). Lastly, we used a rapid test to assess immunity ag ainst tetanus to investigate the adherence to the Health Council guideline on tetanus post- exposure prophylaxis (T -PEP) and the eligibility to receive T -PEP based on the Health Council guideline (chapter 12). In the discussion (chapter 13) , we will use st udy results and their strengths, and weaknesses to deliberate whether the current surveillance systems fulfil expectations or can be improved.

Chapter 2 Pertussis in the Netherlands, is the current vaccination strategy sufficient to reduce disease burden in young infants? Nicoline A.T. van der Maas Frits R. Mooi A.E. Conyn- Spaendonck : Vaccine. 2013;31(41):4541 -7 (DOI 10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.060) Chapter 2 22 Abstract Background Pertussis has resurged in the Netherlands since 1996. Several mea sures, i.e. acceleration of the schedule, introduction of a preschool acellular pertussis booster and change from an infant whole cell to an acellular pertussis combination vaccine were implement ed in the National Immunisation Programme to decre ase disease burden, in particular among very you ng infants who have the highest morbidity and mortality of pertussis. Nevertheless, a large outbreak occurred in 2011 -2012. Methods. 1996 -2010 was divided in 3 -year -periods to assess the impa ct of the measures taken, using notifications and hospitalisations. These results were compared with 2011 - 2012. Mean Incidence rates (IRs) per 100,000 were calculated. Results. Although the measures taken resulted in decreased IRs amon g the targeted age groups after implementation, overall mean IRs of notifications increased from 32 (1996 -2004) to 37 (2005 -2010) and 63 (2011 -2012). Young infants, not yet vaccinated, did not benefit; during the 2011 -2012 outbreak, IR in 0 -2-month -olds amounted to 259.6. IR among persons over 9 years of age increased from 6.8 (1996 -1999) to 59.1 (2011 -2012) . For hospitalisations overall mean IRs decreased from 1.95 per 100,000 (1997 -2004) to 0.88 (2005 -2010) and 0.76 (2011). Conclusion. The measures taken reduced IRs of notifications and hospitalisa tions among groups eligible for vaccination, but had no effect on the increasing IRs in adolescents and adults. This trend is also observed in other countries. The high IRs in 2012 in adolescents and adults prob ably resulted in increased transmission to infants, who are at risk for contracti ng severe pertussis. Therefore, additional measures to protect this group should be considered. Pertussis in the Netherlands, is the current vaccination strategy sufficient to reduce disease burden in young infants? 23 2 Introduction Pertussis or whooping cough is characterised by a catarrhal phase which is followed by a phase with persistent paroxysmal coughing. In typical cases, coughing may be followed by inspiratory whooping and vomiting. Pertussis may be complicated by cyanosis, apnoea, pneumonia or seizures. Even encephalopathy or death may oc cur, albeit infrequently. [1] Severe pertussis usually occurs in young infants. In adolescents and adults pertussis usually has a mild and more atypical disease course. [2, 3] Since the 1950s, vaccination programmes have been introduced worldwide. First whole cell pertussis vaccines (WCVs) were used, later, in the 1990s, many western countries switched to acellular pertussis vaccines (ACVs) with a more favourable safety profile. [4, 5] Despite constant high vaccine coverage, pertussis has resurged in many countries, including the Netherlands. [6-9] Pertussis was originally defined as a childhood disease, but the largest increase in pertussis incidence is nowadays found in adolescents and adults. In the Netherlands pertussis notifications increased suddenly in 1996 and since then remained at a higher level, with additional peaks every 3 -4 years. [10] In 2012, a particular high and broad peak in notifications was observed, starting at the end of 2011 and continuing in 2012. In contrast to the usu al seasonal pattern with peaks in late summer and autumn, the incidence stayed at a high level during winter and spring, and decreased only after August 2012. [ 11] In view of the resurgence of pertussis since 1996 in the Netherlands, several measures were taken to reduce disease burden, with special focus on protecting the most vulnerable, not (completely) vaccinated infants. In 1999, an accelerated schedule of the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) was implemented, in which the first vaccination was given at two instead of three months. From November 2001 onwards, ACV was administered to four -year -olds, simultaneously with the booster Diphtheria -Tetanus -Inactivated Poliovirus (DT -IPV) vaccine. Finally, in 2005 the DTP -IPV-Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) combination vaccine including WCV was replaced by a combination with ACV at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months of age. This article aims to evaluate the impact of these measures on the pertussis burden, using surveillance data on hospitalisations and notifications by law routinely collected since 1975. We discuss the possible impact of additional measures in view of improvement of the control of pertussis, in infants too young to be vaccinated who have the highest morbidity and mortality. Methods and materials Notifications Pertussis is notifiable by law since 1976. In the mandatory reports, among others, information on vaccination status is available. We included data from 1996 -2012 since Chapter 2 24 in this period a stable case -definition for notification was used, which includes a clinical picture compatible with pertussis combined with laboratory confirmation of Bordetella (para)pertussis infection or contact with a laboratory confirmed patient with a B.(para)pertussis infection in the last three weeks. Laboratory confirmation can be based on isolation of the bacterium, detection of DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a 4 -fold rise in IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin (Ptx) in paired serum samples, or a single serum sample with IgG -anti -Ptx concentrations above a defined age-specific cut- off value. [12] The relative distribution of diagnoses based on culture or PCR, serology as well as epidemiological linked cases (i.e. ~5%, ~90%, ~5% respectively) has been stable over the years under study. Hospitalisations Hospitalisation data in the period 1997 to 2011 were retrieved from the National Medical Registrati on (LMR). LMR collects discharge diagnoses of all patients admitted to the hospital. Only inpatient diagnoses are registered. Diseases are registered as main or side diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9) coding. Coverage w as ~ 99% until mid- 2005; thereafter coverage has fluctuated around 90%. Age specific data were available since 1997. Patient records with code 0330 or 0331 (whooping cough caused by B.pertussis and B.parapertussis, respectively) and 0338 or 0339 (whooping cough caused by other specified or an unspecified organism, respectively) were included. Statistical analysis To assess the impact of the measures taken, we divided 1996 -2010 in five periods of three years.(Box 1) Three of the five periods, 1999 -2001, 2002- 2004 and 2005 -2007, coincided with a change in the NIP. We calculated mean incidences per 100,000 for each period, which diminished the influence of peak incidences every 2 -3 year; peak years were 1996, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2008. To relate these results to the current situation, we also present mean IRs for 2011 -2012. For hospitalisations the first period consisted of two years (1997 and 1998) and data on 2012 were not available yet. Pertussis in the Netherlands, is the current vaccination strategy sufficient to reduce disease burden in young infants? 25 2 Box 1. Overview of used schedules and vaccines in the defined periods. Changes between successive periods are in bold. a=DTwP -IPV (+Hib) vaccine/RIVM+NVI b=from January 1st 2005 til December 31st 2005 Infanrix -IPV- Hib/GSK was administered during infancy. From January 1st 2006 till 2008 Pediacel /SP MSD was administered. From 2008 onwards Pediacel was gradually replaced by Infanrix -IPV- Hib again. From October 1st 2011 onwards all infants received Infanrix hexa/GSK. c=Untill July 2006 single aP/GSK was used as a booster. From August 2006 till 2008 Triaxis Polio/SP MSD was administered. Thereafter this was gradually replaced by Infanrix -IPV/GSK. Mean incidences were calculated using numerators from the respective registries and age specific denominators, retrieved from CBS ( www.statline.nl ), being the number of inhabitants in the specific period. For comparing incidences in different periods or age categories, risk ratios (relative risk, RR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals ( 95%CI). Changes were regarded as significant if the 95%CI did not include '1'. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated using the 'screening -method'. [13] VE = 1 - PCV/(1 -PCV)*(1 -PPV)/PPV PCV= proportion of cases vaccinated PPV=proportion of population vaccinated For infant vaccinations and the booste r dose at four years of age, PPV was set at 96% and 92%, respectively. [14] If PCV exceeded PPV, estimation of VE was not possible. Calculations were performed using SAS version 9.3, Excel and Episheet. Results The overall mean incidence per 100,000 of notifications increased from 32 (1996 - 2004) to 37 (2005 -2010) and 63 (2011 -2012). For hospitalisations overall mean incidence decreased from 1.95 (1997- 2004) to 0.88 (2005- 2010) and 0.76 2008 -2010 2011 -2012 infant WCVa start NIP 3 m no booster 4y infant WCVa start NIP 2 m no booster 4y infant WCVa start NIP 2 m ACVc booster 4y infant ACVb start NIP 2 m ACVc booster 4y infant ACVb start NIP 2 m ACVc booster 4y infant ACVb start NIP 2 m ACVc booster 4y Chapter 2 26 Figure 1. Overall incidence of notifications (left Y- axis) and hospitalisations per 100,000 (right Y -axis) for 1996 -2012 and 1997 -2011, respectively. Age specific incidences fluctuated over time with peaks every 2 -3 years in the period 1996 -2004 (Figure 2A and 2B). After the peak in 2004, for those of 4 -6 and 10 years as well as those 0 -2 months of age peaks occurred in 2008, with the largest peak occurring in the young infants. For the age groups 3 months to 3 years of age a decreasing trend was observed from 2004 until 2010 -2011 with no discernible peaks. Thereafter, an increase was seen again. Acceleration of the vaccination schedule in 1999 The incidences in 0 -2-month -olds for notifications and hospitalisations increased in 1999 -2001 compared to 1996- 1998. (Table1 and 2).

Comparing these two age categories for 1996 -1998 resulted in a non -significant decrease. For hospitalisations , the incidence in 3 -5-month -olds was significantly lower than in 0 -2- month -olds in both periods (1996 -1998 RR 6- 11-month -olds a non -significant increase in incidence of notifications was seen when 1996 -1998 and 1999 -2001 were compared. In the age categories -2.74) a significant increase in incidences of notifications was observed comparing these respective periods. Incidences of hospitalisations decreased slightly or showed no change, except in 1 -3-year -olds, in which a significant decrease was seen (RR 0.61; 95%CI 0.40 -0.92) co mparing 1997 -1998 and 1999 -2001. Implementation of the booster dose at four years of age in November 2001 After the introduction of a preschool ACV booster in November 2001, the mean incidence of notifications and hospitalisations in 4 -6-year -olds decreas ed comparing the period2002 with 2008- 2010 (Table1 and 2). Comparing 2002 -2004 (post - introduction) to 1999 -2001 (pre -introduction) revealed a significant decrease in incidences of notifications and hospitalisations in 4 -6-year -olds (95%CI 0.18 incidence of notifications in 0 -2-month -olds decreased significantly (RR 0.70; 95%CI 0.53 -0.92), when pre - and post -introduction periods were compared. In 3 -5-month -olds a non -significant decrease was visible, comparing these periods. Incidences of hospitalisations for 1999 -2001 compared to 2002 -2004 In 7 -9-year-olds, incidences of notifications increased significantly comparing the periods 1999 -2001 and 2002 -2004. Thereafter, mean incidence of notifications in 7 -9- year -olds decreased significantly, most likely due to the fact that during these years 7 - 9-year -olds were eligible for the preschool ACV. Incidences of hospitalisations of this age group showed non -significant changes over the periods.. In 10 year old people incidences of notifications and hospitalisations increased in 2002 -2004 compared to1999 -2001. This increase was only significant for notifications (RR 1.21; 95%CI 1.15 -1.28). Mean vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the booster dose decreased with time since last vaccination, being 82%, 76%, 63%, 59% and 52% for 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 -year -olds, respectivel y. (Table 3).

In 3 -5-month -olds a decrease in mean incid ence of notifications was seen comparing 2002 -2004, 2005- 2007and 2008- 2010. The same pattern was seen in incidences of hospitalisations. None of these decreases was significant. After the switch from WCV to ACV the incidences of both notifications and hospitalisations decreased significantly in 6 -11 month old infants between the periods 2002 -2004 and 2005- 2007 (RR of the decrease continued in both registries, although non -significant. In 1 -3 year old children, incidences of notifications decreased comparing 2002 -2004, 2005 -2007 and 2008- 2010. The last decrease was significant (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.37 - 0.52), probably because during 2008 -2010 a larger part of this ag e category was eligible for infant ACV. Incidences of hospitalisations showed a non -significant decreasing trend in 1 -3-year -olds in the periods concomitant with the introduction of infant ACV. In 10- year -olds, the incidence of notifications increased s ignificantly from 2005 - 2007 to 2008 -2010 (RR 1.18; 95%CI 1.14 -1.23). No significant changes in hospitalisations were observed. After the introduction of ACV, mean VE per 3 -years -period of the primary series increased, ranging from 33 -73%, 27 -48% and 24 -51% for 1 -, 2-, and 3- year -olds Chapter 2 34 before introduction to 86 -92%, 75 -91% and 65 -85% for the respective ages after implementation. Outbreak 2011 -2012 In 2011 -2012, all age categories under study showed an increase in incidences of notifications compared to 2008 -2010 (Table 1). In 3- 5 and 6 -11-month -olds, and 4- 6 year old children this increase was not significant. In 0 -2-month -olds the incidence increa sed from 183 to 260 (RR 1.42; 95%CI 1.07 - 1.87), in 1- 3-year -olds from 32 to 42 (RR 1.32; 95%CI 1.09 -1.61), in 7- 9-year -olds from 71 to 185 (RR 2.60; 95%CI 2.32- 2.90) and in persons 10 years of age from 35 to 59 (RR 1.68; 95%CI 1.62 -1.73) comparing 2008 -2010 and specific incidences for hospitalisations showed non -significant changes when comparing 2011 to 2008 -2010 (Table 2). Discussion. Despite various changes in the pertussis vaccination schedule as implemented in the period 1996 to 201 2, our routine surveillance data showed an increase in overall IRs of notifications (32, 37 and 63 in 1996 -2004, 2005- 2010 and 2011 -2012). During the outbreak in 2011 -2012, a possible positive impact in the target groups caused by the changes, i.e. earlier start of NIP, preschool ACV booster vaccination and change from an infant Dutch WCV to ACV, may h ave been nullified by the large upsurge of pertussis in infants too young to be vaccinated and in those above 9 years of age. With regard to more severe pertu ssis, resulting in hospitalisation, the positive impact in age groups targeted for measures was evident, however. Fortunately, only a small rise was observed in the total number of hospitalisations due to pertussis in 2011. The earlier start of the NIP res ulted in a significant decrease in IRs of notifications and hospitalisations, comparing the age groups of 0 -2 and 3- 5 months pre - and post - acceleration. The implementation of an ACV preschool booster resulted in a decrease of IRs of notifications and hospitalisations in all age categories from 0 -2 months up to 4-6 years, except for hospitalisations in 6 -11-month -olds. The decrease in young infants implies an indirect effect of the introduction of a booster dose at 4 years of age. De Greeff et al. showed the importance of siblings in the transmission of pertussis. [15] However, we also obs erved that the estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) declined after ~ 4 years, suggesting only a limited period of protection by the preschool booster and therefore a short period of reduced transmission. A limited durability of protection by the preschool booster was also observed in two recent outbreak studies. [16, 17] The transition to an ACV in the primary infant vaccination series in 2005 decreased IRs of notifications and hospitalisations in the age groups 2 -5 months up to 3 years. In Pertussis in the Netherlands, is the current vaccination strategy sufficient to reduce disease burden in young infants? 35 2 contrast to the period before introduction of ACV in the primary schedule, VE remained high until the age at which the preschool booster is administered. These data confirmed that the Dutch WCV, as previously reported, had relative low effectiveness. [10] No further indirect effect of this measure on unvaccinated infants was observed. The resurgence of pertussis observed in the Netherlands, is seen in many other countries across the world, mostly as a result of a steady increase of pertu ssis in adolescents and adults, but also due to peaks in the youngest age groups. [6, 8, 9] Recent outbreaks, for in stance in USA and UK [ 18, 19] triggered the discussion about additional measures to protect the young, not yet fully immunised infants, who are most at risk for contracting severe pertussis. In both US and UK pregnant women are advised to be vaccinated. [ 19, 20] Other countries adopted booster doses for adolescents and adults, including cocooning strategies. However , in general uptake has been low and recently Australia decided to stop pertussis vaccination in adults because no effect was seen on pertussis in young infants. [21, This resurgence is probably associated with wan ing immunity, because the duration of immunity after vaccination is limited. [23, 24] Furthermore, adaptation of B.pertussis [25], in particular the emergence of strains that produce more Ptx may play a role. [26, 27] Ptx suppresses the innate and adaptive immune system, resulting in increased infection and transmission, especially when anti- Ptx-antibody levels have waned. [27, 28] These strains with increased Ptx production are found worldwide. [29, 30] Recently, also strains emerged, which lack one or more of the vaccine antigens. [31-33] The impact of the emergence of these strains is not yet known. Strengths and limitations Of course, in addition to waning immunity and pathogen adaptation, several other causes may play a role in the increase of pertussis notifications such as improved diagnostics and increased awareness. [6, 34] All notifications in the Netherlands require laboratory confirmation or an epidemiologic link to a laboratory confirmed pertussis case. The latter only occurs in about 5% of the notifications. The frequencies of the laboratory diagnostics did not change during the years under study, with about 90% of the notifications confirmed by serology and ~ 5% by PCR or culture. Therefore, better diagnostics probably had little influence on the pertussis increase. Furthermore, the case -definition for notification did not change during the study period. In addition the ag e-specific hospital admission data showed a similar trend compared to age -specific notifications; i.e. hospital admissions decreased among the age-groups targeted for additional measures and increased slightly for older age groups. The less evident increas e in hospital admissions in older people is probably associated with low hospitalisation among this group. Many adults show a mild Chapter 2 36 clinical picture of pertussis, thereby outnumbering an increase in severe pertussis, needing hospitalisation. Results of tw o large Dutch cross sectional population based serosurveys confirmed the changes found in age specific pertussis IRs of notifications. [ 3] Presumably due to the introduction of ACV at infancy a nd a preschool booster at 4 years of age, inducing a better serological immune response compared to the Dutch whole cell vaccine, an increase of children with high antibody levels against Pertussis toxin (Ptx) was seen in 2006 -2007 compared to 1995- 1996. H owever, these surveys also demonstrated an increase in anti -Ptx antibodies in the population older than 9 years. As anti- Ptx antibodies induced by vaccination have largely disappeared in 9 -year -olds [23], this increase suggested higher infection rates in the latter period. In 2006 -2007, 9.3% of these persons had an antibody level, indicative for a pertussis infection in the past year compared to 4.0% in 1995 -1996. These seroprevalence data imply that the increased notifications among adolescents and adults reflect a real increase. In a sensitivity analysis we further disentangled the effect of time and the true vaccination effect. We took the group of 10 years and older as reference for the time effect, because this group mainly consists of people, vaccinated with a relative weak Dutch whole cell vaccine during infancy and therefore, the influence of vaccination on incidences is negligible. All RRs of noticiations in this group are above '1'. We adjusted for this natural increase over time by dividing the RR of the other age groups by the RR of the over -9-years. This resulted in a further lowering of RRs, originally below '1', so even further confirming the positive effects of changes in the vaccination schedule. On the other hand, the increase in IR that we saw in some age groups is attenuated by adjusting for this time effect. These adjusted RRs showed that the impact of the changes in vaccination schedule might have bee n larger than visible in the changes in incidence between periods, shown by our RRs. On the other hand for public health purposes observed incidences and differences are also relevant information. Our data on hospitalisations could be an underestimation, due to decreased coverage of this surveillance source since 2005. However, information on the number of patients hospitalized, as registered in the notifications, showed no major changes since 2005 (data not shown). Therefore, we think the impact of the possible underesti mation will be limited. Finally , use of antibiotics could have influenced the hospitalisation rates. In the Netherlands, national guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of pertussis are in place and no major changes were implemented during the period under study.( http://nhg.artsennet.nl/kenniscentrum/k_richtlijnen/k_nhgstandaarden/Samenvatti ngskaartje -NHGStandaard/M78_svk.htm and http://www.rivm.nl/Bibliotheek/Professioneel_Praktisch/Richtlijnen/Infectieziekten /LCI_richtlijnen/LCI_richtlijn_Pertussis_kinkhoest ) Because most general practitioners and municipal health doctors follow these guidelines, we think the Pertussis in the Netherlands, is the current vaccination strategy sufficient to reduce disease burden in young infants? 37 2 influence of changed use of antibiotics on the decrease in hospitalisation will be minor. In conclusion, we showed that measures taken to reduce pertussis burden in the Netherlands decreased infection rates in childre n, eligible for vaccination. However, rates in adolescents and adults steadily increased, while rates in infants not yet (fully) vaccinated remain high and showed an increase in the 2011 -2012 epidemic. Therefore, additional measures must be considered to reduce the pertussis burden. Based on the current literature, maternal immunisation seems most effective. However, before wide scale introduction of maternal vaccination, further studies on the levels of antibodies, required for protection, persistence of maternal antibodies in infants, safety issues, interference and acceptation of this vaccination are needed.

(DOI : 10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.06.037 ) Chapter 3 42 Abstract Objective Despite vaccination, pertussis has remained endemic, sometimes leading to severe disease. We aimed to quantify the completeness of reporting (CoR) of pertussis hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherlands. Study design CoR was estimated using capture -recapture analys es. Hospitalizations (2007 -2014) from the National Registration Hospital C are ( hospi tal data) were matched to the notifiable Infectious Disease case registry ( notifications ) providing (month and) year of birth, gender and postal code . Deaths (1996 -2014) from Statistics Netherlands (death registry ) were matched to notifications using gende r, age, year of death and notification date. Cases <2 years (y) and 2y were analysed separately. Chao's estimator estimated the total population, which w as used to calculate CoR. Results Using strict matching criteria, we found 461 matches among 876 ( hospital data ) and 757 ( notifications ) hospitalizations <2y. The population estimate of hospitalised infants was 1446 , resulting in CoR between 52% and 61%. For hospitalizations 2y (246; hospital data and 264; notifications ) 43 matches were found, with a population estimate of 1512 and CoR between 16.5% and 22%. Among thirteen ( death registry ) and ) deaths <2y , seven cases overlapped . The population estimate was 16. CoR of the two sources was 50% -81%. With t wo ( death registry ) and ei ght ( notifications ) deaths 2y without overlap, the population estimate was 26 and CoR 8% -31% . Conclusion Result s showed substantial underestimation of pertussis hospitalizations and deaths. This has to be taken into account in evaluat ion of current and future immunization programs. Severe underestimation of pertussis related hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherland s: a capture -recapture analysis 43 3 Introduction Pertussis is a respiratory tract infection, commonly caused by Bordetella pertussis [1]. Typical pertussis illness including paroxysmal coughing mainly affects young children who are not (fully) vaccinated, who are als o at the highest risk for severe morbidity and mortality. Still, pertussis can also occur as a milder infection or even asymptomatic in older children, adolescents and adults. To prevent severe disease and mortality, routine vaccination against pertussis was introduced in the National Immunization Program of the Netherlands in 1957 [2]. Up to 2005, a whole cell pertuss is combination vaccine was used [3], but at present , an acellular pertussis combination vaccine, targeting diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Hepatitis B (DTaP -IPV-Hib-HBV ) at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months of age is offered, with vaccination coverage above 95% [4]. Since 2001, the N ational Immunization Program also includes an acellular pertussis booster for 4 -year -olds because of the observed high incidence of pertussis in this age group [5]. The vaccination coverage of the booster amounts to approximately 92% [4]. Despite these changes and uninterrupted high vaccine coverage from 1980 onwards, an increase of pertussis is observed, not only in the Netherlands , but also worldwide [6, 7] . This increase occurs in all ages, with epidemic peaks every 2 to 3 years [3]. Surveillance data also show that infants, too young to be (fully) vaccinated, show increasing pertussis incidence rates from 2 005 onwards with 64 (2013) and 222 (2014) notifications per 100,000 . To evaluate the potential impact of vaccination strategies , adequate data on morbidity of severe pertussis infection and mortality caused by pertussis are essential. However, different s ources to assess severe morbidity and mortality vary in their completeness of reporting [8, 9]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify the completeness of reporting (CoR) of hospitalization and death caused by pertussis in the Netherlands by means of capture -recapture analyses. Methods Setting Reports of pertussis were derived from three databases with national coverage. Data of the National Registration Hospital C are ( hospital data ) and of the 'Online System for Infectious diseases Reporting with in the Infectious diseases Surveillance System' ( notifications ) were used in the analysis of hospitalizations . CoR was studied over the period from 2007 up to 2014, during which all pertussis vaccines within the National Immunization Program were acellular and date of birth was available in hospital data . Chapter 3 44 Data of notifications and of Statistics Netherlands ( death registry ) were used in the analysis of death s. CoR was studied between 1996 and 2014. The case definition for pertussis has remained the same si nce 1996 [8] . No medical ethical approval was needed b ecause only routinely collected data were used and people were not imposed to specific deed. Data sources Natio nal Registration Hospital Care data (hospital data) Hospital data is collected by Dutch Hospital Data. This database registers medical and administrative information from hospitalized patients in the Netherlands [10]. From 2007 onwards, the rate of nationally participating hospitals fluctuated around 90% [11] . Main diagnosis as well as date of birth, four digits of the zip code, gender, and date of hospital admission is registered. C ases within the hospital data were included for analysis when a patient was diagnosed with whooping cough according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, i.e. ICD -9 0330 or -9 0339 or ICD- 10 A379 (other unspecified organism). Notification data Notification data is part of the national surveillance system for notifiable infectious diseases in the Netherlands. Information on reported cases in the system includes year of birth, four digits of the zip code, gender, date of disease onset and vaccination status. Month of birth is only provided in cases <2y of age. Furthermore, information on hospitalizations or death of the reported case is registered if known. C ases were included when a patient was notified for pertussis. Criteria for notification are 1. Clinical symptoms of pertussis (i.e. coughing for at least two weeks or either paroxysmal coughing, inspiratory whooping or vomiting after coughing) and 2. Laboratory confirmation using culture, PCR or serology or 3. Close contact to a laboratory confirmed case in the previous three weeks. Only patients which were hospitalized or death according to the notification system, were included in the respective analys es. Data of Statistics Netherlands (death registry) Statistics Netherlands collects and presents data and national statistics on societal and demographic aspects for scientific and political purposes [12] . Information on deceased individuals includes cause of death, gender, year of death, and age or age category at death. Cases were included for analyses when pertussis was reported as the cause of death (ICD -10 code A37). Severe underestimation of pertussis related hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherland s: a capture -recapture analysis 45 3 Linkage procedure Hospitalized cases Prior to the actual linking procedure, the data base of hospitalizations was checked for double entries of the same individual based on date of birth, gender, four digits of the zip code, date of hospitalization, date of discharge, and hospital code. Only first hospitalization s were included. Furthermo re, about 25% of notifications were supplemented with an imputed day of disease onset because this was missing. Here, the median interval between disease onset and notification from the records with a known day of disease onset (i.e. 43 days) was subtracte d from the notification date. For infants <2y, matching variables were four digits of the zip code, gender, and month and year of birth. For cases 2y, matching variables were identical , though without the month of birth . Matched hospitalized cases were cl assified as certain, likely, probable and unlikely matches (Table 1). Cases with identical matching variables and a maximum of 30 days (d) between a known day of disease onset and hospitalization were classified as certain matches. Cases with identical matching variables and an imputed day of disease onset were classified as likely matches if the interval between disease onset and hospitalization was 30d at most. Cases with an interval of 31 -45d were classified as probable matches if all matching variables were identical irrespective of a known or imputed day of disease onset. Furthermore, if there was one logical deviation in matching variables, e.g. typing errors like zip code 8013 instead of 8031, and the interval between disease onset and hospitalization was 45d at most, likelihood of matching was lowered by one category. Likewise, in case of two deviations the likelihood decreased by two categories. Table 1: Combinations of criteria per matching category. 0 deviations 1 deviation 2 deviations Known disease onset, <31 days from hospitalization Certain match Likely match Probable match Imputed disease onset, <31 days from hospitalization Likely match Probable match Unlikely match Known disease onset, 31-45 days from hospitalization Probable match Unlikely match No match Imputed disease onset, 31-45 days from hospitalization Probable match Unlikely match No match Chapter 3 46 First, certain matches were matched using the statistical software. Remaining cases were categorized according to matching criteria manually by two researchers independently (JH and NvdM). For these manually matched records, t he Kappa statistic for observer agreement was calculated and conflicting cases were discussed until agreement was reached [13] . Analyses were performed using the number of matched cases after full agreement. Deceased cases Deceased cases were linked manually across the notifications and the death registry using the variables gender, year of death (available in death registry) , date of notification (available in notifications) , and age. C ases were linked when the date of notification was within the year of death, and all othe r variables were identical. Statistical analyses Descriptive statistics were performed regarding age and gender of included cases. Capture -recapture analyses were performed using Chao's lower bound estimator for total population size [14, 15] . The total population size (N) including the unreported cases, is estimated by identifying the number of unique c ases in each source and the number of overlapping cases [14, 16] . The applied formula and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are defined by: (f1 2f2+1)2) Hereby n represents the total captures, f1 represents the number of cases uniquely captured by source one plus source two, and f2 represents the number of cases that were captured by both sources. For hospitalizations, estimates were provided for 1. certain matches only, 2. Certain and likely matches combined, 3. Certain, likely and proble matches combined and 4. All matches combined. The estimates of the total population sizes were used to calculate the completeness of reporting (CoR) of the different sources separately as a percentage of the total estimated population. Cases were analysed in two age groups: a group with individuals less than 2 years (y) of age and a group with individuals of 2y or older. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0. Severe underestimation of pertussis related hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherland s: a capture -recapture analysis 47 3 Results Hospitalizations in infants < 2 year of age The number of infants , hospitalized for pertussis in 2007 -2014 <2y equalled 876 (422 males) in the hospital data , after removal of multiple hospitalizations (n=160). Among the notifications , 757 hospitalized cases (359 males) were identified (Table 2). Median age was 2.0 months (m) in the hospital data compared with 1.0 m in the notifications . The kappa statistic on likely, probable and unlikely matches equalled 0.88 (n agreement =681, n conflicting = 30).

This corresponded with a population estimate ranging between 1446 for certain matches and 1230 for all matches, indicating a CoR for hospital data between 61% and 71% for the respective matching categories . Likewise, with in the notifications 52% to 62% was reported, respectively (Table 3). Hospitalizations in people 2 year of age Hospitalized cases 2y amounted to 246 cases (118 males) in the hospital data after removal of multiple hospitalizations (n=14) compared with 264 cases (114 males) within the notifications (Table 2). Median ages were 23.5y (range 2 -88y) and 40.0y (range 2 -89y) in the respective groups. The kappa statistic equalled 0.74 (n agreement = 414, n conflicting = 10). Matches amounted to 43 for certain matches and 55 for all matching categories. The corresponding population estimate was 1512 and 1182. CoR of hospital data amounted to 16.5% for c ertain matches and 21% for all matches. Likewise, CoR of notifications were 17.5 % and 22%, respectively (Table 3) . Chapter 3 48 Severe underestimation of pertussis related hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherland s: a capture -recapture analysis 49 3 Deaths in infants < 2 year of age The number of reported deaths <2y between 1996 and 2014 equalled 13 (five males) in the death registry , and eight (four males) in the notifications (Table 4). Seven cases overlapped leading to a population estimate of 16. This indicated a CoR of 81% within the death registry , and 50% in the notifications . Deaths in people 2 year of age For the age group 2y, two deaths (both female ; 10- 15y and 75 -80y old ) were reported in the death registry , compared to eight deaths (three males ; range 7 -87y) in the notifications (Table 4) . No overlapping cases could be identified and thus, C hao's estimator could not be calculated. Using Chapman's formula as an alternative [17] , a total population estimate of 26 deaths was obtained. Hence, the CoR was 8% and 31% for the death registry and notifications, respectively . Discussion We studied the completeness of re porting (CoR) of hospitalizations and deaths due to pertussis in the Netherlands and showed that severe pertussis requiring hospitalization or resulting in death is substantially underestimated by combining data from three nationwide registries with information on hospitalizations and deaths. Furthermore, the CoR strongly varied between age groups and sources. For infants <2y, the estimated number of hospitalized cases was 1.5 -2 times higher than reported within hospital data or notifications alone, with hospital data being more complete than notifications. For people 2y, the estimate was even 4 -6 times higher for both sources. Likewise, for infants <2y who died following pertussis, the estimate was 1.2 -2 times higher than reported through the death registr y and notifications, respectively. Hereby, the death registry was more complete than the notifications. For people 2y, the estimate was 3 -13 times higher with a higher CoR for notifications than for the death registry. Comparable studies for hospitalized pertussis cases conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), and New Zealand showed a CoR of 29.6%, 23- 32%, and 81-84%, respectively [18 -20]. The UK and US percentages, both including all age groups, are comparable with the CoR we found in pe ople 2y (16.5 -22%). However, our findings for infants (CoR 52 -71%) are more consistent with the New Zealand study, which focused on infants <12 months old. In the UK, half (40 -55%) of the estimated number of deaths were reported [9] , compared to one third (23 -33%) in the US [20] . The study population in the UK included children, and their CoR is comparable to the completeness we found for infants <2y (50-81%). Chapter 3 50 Severe underestimation of pertussis related hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherland s: a capture -recapture analysis 51 3 However, a more recent paper on underestimation of deaths (all ages) in England found a much higher CoR ( 69% -79%) [21] . The completeness for the older deceased in the Netherlands (8 -31%) seems to be consistent with the findings in the US (all age groups). However, similarities and dissimilarities in results of different countries must be interpreted with caution because of differences in surveillance systems and reporting criteria. Striking differences in CoR between the sources exist; for hospitalized cases, the hospitalization registry has the highest completeness for infants <2y (61 -71%), while the reporting rate was lower within the notifications (52 -62%). Several reasons for underreporting in the registries may pla y a role. Pertussis notifications, covering pertussis in primary care as well as hospitalizations, are based on laboratory confirmation and Municipal Health Services report as early as possible. Municipal Health Services sometimes do not receive follow -up information on hospitalizations and deaths and therefore cannot incorporate this information in the notification. If additional information on hospitalization and death becomes available, additional actions from several professionals are needed to incorporate this in the notification system, which are not always carried out. Also, diagnostics for pertussis are often not performed, since this has no consequences for treatment. For these reasons, both for notifications and hospitalizations, under -ascertainmen t of pertussis must be taken into account. For pertussis as the cause of or death, misclassification is also likely to be the case. Because pertussis is an unclear cause of death, at least in adults, many doctors or coroners will not report pertussis as the cause of death; they might use pneumonia or other complications related to pertussis instead [9, 22] . The reliability of the capture -recapture estimates depends on the possible violation of the underlying assumptions. First, independency of sources is assumed. In our study, positive dependency between sources is likely. Reporting parties mainly involve healthcare professionals reporting to both sources. Therefore, our results might underestimate the true hospitalized and deceased population. The second assumption implies that every individual should have homogeneous chances for being captured by a certain source [16]. As differences in reporting and ascertainment are well established between young infants and older indivi duals, stratified analyses were conducted to prevent violation of this assumption. The cut- off at 2y was also chosen because different matching criteria could be used in both groups. Furthermore, all individuals should be within the time -space unit of study and no false positive cases should be in the study population. Inclusion of cases was based on the medical diagnosis and ICD codes. In general, in the Netherlands, pertussis diagnosis is laboratory confirmed (data not shown). Therefore, we think false positives are of minor influence. Finally, capture -recapture analysis assumes a closed study population. Due to the length of the study period, violation of this assumption is Chapter 3 52 inevitable. This might have resulted in an overestimation of the true populatio n size [23, 24] . Cases should be matched properly to obtain an adequate estimate [16] . Ideally, linkage is based on a unique identifier to prevent mismatch of cases, but due to privacy legislation, in the Netherlands such a number is not available. Due to the lack of additional information on the deceased in the death registry such as date of birth or four digits of the zip code, some uncertainty remained in the linkage, i.e. the possibility of inclusion of false positive - and false negative matches. Twins in the datasets might have complicated linking as well. In addition, we might have missed hospitalize d matches based on the range between disease onset and hospitalization. Rare cases in which more time between disease onset and hospitalization elapsed (>45d), were not matched. Moreover, the exclusion of multiple hospital registrations might also have caused missing matches, as only first hospitalizations were included. However, it was assumed that the missing of matching due to this exclusion was limited, as in regular cases, the disease onset would be closest in time to the first hospitalization. Besides the capture -recapture assumptions, limitations to the current study include the incompleteness of the National Registration Hospital Care data; approximately 90% of all Dutch hospitals supply data. Therefore, our total population estimates can be either a n over -estimation because matches were missed, or an underestimation of the real number of cases, since 10% of the entire population might not be included. Because the notifications are extracted from a nationwide registry that was linked to hospital data with 90% coverage, over- estimation of the total population estimate is more likely than under -estimation. Moreover, a two- source capture -recapture analysis was used, which could not include possible interactions between sources. In theory, a person could h ave different postal codes in the respective registries, e.g. due to a divorce of moving, unjust preventing a match. However, in the Netherlands, all people are only registered at their main home address and only records with a restricted, narrow time inte rval of 45 days were included. Therefore, we think these aspects had very limited impact on our results. Finally, the ICD codes that were used for case inclusion might have contained false -positives. These might have caused the over -estimations. Despite t hese limitations, we think our data give a crude estimate of the CoR for hospitalizations and deaths and indicate substantial underreporting. Increased awareness of occurrence of pertussis by public and professionals, increased diagnostics, correct registr ation of the diagnosis and sufficient follow up time to include hospitalizations and death in the notifications can help to decrease underreporting in the registries used. This is important in view of a reliable evaluation of the current National Immunization Program and possible changes in the programme, e.g. the introduction of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy.

Nicoline A.T. van der Maas Elisabeth A. M. Anneke Westerhof Hester E. de Melker Submitted to CID Chapter 4 Chapter 4 56 Abstract Background Pertussis cause s severe disease in young unvaccinated infants with preterms potentially at highest risk. We studied the clinics of infants hospitalized for pertussis, related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination. Methods Hospitalization data of pertussis patients (0 -2y) over 2005- 2014 were linked to the vaccination registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against pertussis hospitalization between terms and preterms using the screening m ethod. Results Of all 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms with 8% preterms present in Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3m for preterms and 2m for terms (p<0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccinations (62% vs 44%; p=0.01) and were coinfection (37% vs 21%; p=0.01). Preterms tended to suffer more often from complications or required artificial respiration and intensive care (ICU) admittance, with longer ICU stay (15d vs 9d; p=0.004). Vaccinated infants had a lower median length of stay and crude risks of apneas, artificial respiration, additional oxygen and ICU admittance. VE against pertussis hospitalizations of the first vaccination (95%CI 93% and preterms, respectively. Conclusions Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. This stresses the need for alternative prevention, in particular maternal pertussis vaccination, to effectively reduce pertussis in both groups. Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness 57 4 Introduction Pertussis or whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection, mostly caused by Bordetella pertussis and less frequen tly by Bordetella parapertussis [1].Before mass immunization programmes, in particular infants and children contracted pertussis in the first years of life with a clinical course characterized by uncontrollable coughing attacks, often accompanied by paroxysms, post- tussive vomiting and inspiratory whooping. Vaccination with continuous high vaccination coverage led to a substantial decrease of pertussis among infants and children [2, 3] , but newborns too young to be (fully) vaccinated remain at high risk for severe complications, including apnea, cyanosis, pneumonia, encephalopathy or even death. This risk is increasing due to the worldwide pertussis reemergence in the nineties of the pr evious century, even under high vaccination coverage among all age groups with transmission of disease from household members to newborns. Today, high pertussis incidences in young infants are observed with peaks in disease incidence every two to three yea rs [3-5]. For this re ason, many countries nowadays offer maternal pertussis vaccination to protect newborns. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Health Council also advised to offer maternal pertussis vaccination in the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. While this strategy is overall very effective in prevention of pertussis in early infancy, preterms may benefit less due to less transfer time of protective antibodies from mother to child before delivery [6, 7] . In the light of the introduction of maternal vaccination strategy against pertussis in The Netherlands, we sought to gain more insight into the current pertussis burden among hospitalized infants, with special attention for preterm infants. Methods and materials Data s ources National Registration Hospital care Hospital Care data include m ain diagnosis as well as date of birth, four digits of the zip code, gender, and date of admission of hospitalized patients or outpatient treatment [8]. We extracted medical records of 0 -2 year old patients with a primary diagnosis of whooping cough between 2005 and 2014 according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, i.e. ICD -9 0330 or -9 0339 or ICD- 10 A379 (other unspecified organism). Setting, data collection and linkage After written approval from the hospital board, data extraction from medical records was performed by trained medical students, supervised by a medical doctor (NvdM). Besides date of birth , sex and postal code, demographic data on gestational age (GA) and birth weight were collected. Furthermore, clinical symptoms at admission, date of Chapter 4 58 admission and discharge, diagnostics to confirm pertussis and details about the medical situation, complic ations, treatments and clinical status at discharge were extracted. Medical record data were linked to the national vaccination registry, including all 0 - 18y old children. Changes in residence are archived within the register. In both datasets, pseudonyms were created based on date of birth, sex and postal code. Of infants who moved over time, pseudonyms were created based on all known postal codes to a maximum of six. To ensure privacy, a Trusted Third Party was used for steps in data collection and data linking. (Figure 1) Researchers were only allowed to use age in rounded months. Medical ethical approval was not needed because people were not subjected to imposed rules or acts. Informed consent of patients was not necessary because the study served p ublic interest and asking permission was not feasible [9]. Statistical analysis Differences in general characteristics and clinical aspects of pertussis between preterms , defined as born befo re 37w GA, and term s were described and tested using Pearson's Chi Square or Fisher's exact test for dichotomous and categorical variables and student t -test or Wilcoxon rank test for continuous variables . Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between preterm delivery and the clinical picture of pertussis and to study the association between pertussis vaccination and clinical characteristics stratified by gestational age. Both analyses were adjusted for age at hospitalization and coinfections. Vaccine effectiveness (VE), stratified for preterms and terms, was computed using the screening method [10] . Hereby we used monthly cumulative coverage estimates of a timely first dose, stratified by preterms and terms [11] . In the main analysis, children without exact GA but with written information of a term pregnancy and infants without information on GA were both classified as terms. In sensitivity analyses, we only included children with known GA. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, terms were set as reference in all analyses. Results General descriptives Of the 87 invited hospitals, 4/8 university -, 19/26 top clinical - and 27/51 local hospitals participated. Overall, data of 57% of eligible cases (676/1187) were available. Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness 59 4 GA was known for 61% of all children. Of the remaining 39% GA, information on a term pregnancy was recorded in 8.6%. When all medical records were taken into account, 11.8% (95%CI 9.6% -14.4%; n=80) - 36w) compared to an overall 7.8% prematurity in birth cohorts in the Netherlands [12].

Pseudonyms of the remaining records were too unspecific for reliable linkage. Main analyses (n=676) Chapter 4 60 Hospitalization Median age at hospitalization was 2 months. (Table 1) Terms were hospitalized at younger age. Median duration of hospitalization was 5 and 6 days for terms and preterms, respectively. Overall, 46% of infants were vaccinated at admission, with statistically significant higher frequencies in preterms than in terms. Clinical course and treatment On admittance, 93% of infants were coughing, with 73% also having coughing attacks. (Table 1) Other classical pertussis symptoms such as wheezing, whooping, vomiting and apneas were reported in up to 35% of the patients. With the exception of cyanosis that was more often reported in terms than in preterms (44% vs 31%; p=0.03), we found no differences in solicited symptoms ad admission between terms and preterms. Complications, like bradycardia, respiratory insufficiency and desaturation, feeding problems a nd weight loss and pneumonia were reported in 9% of infants, with a slightly (not- significant) higher frequency in preterms. (Table 1) Two term infants, too young to be eligible for vaccination, had died due to pertussis. Twenty percent of infants already had received antibiotics before admission, while 81% received antibiotics during hospitalization. (Table 1) Though preterms were slightly more often treated with intravenous antibiotics, start and duration of antibiotics w as comparable between the two groups. We found similar need for additional oxygen (37% vs 34%) and admittance to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU; 13% vs 10%), though a trend to more often need of artificial respiration was observed in preterms compared to terms(14% vs 7%; p=0.05). Duration of ICU stay was longer in preterms than in terms (median 15 vs 9 days; p=0.004 ). At discharge, 77% of infants still suffered from complaints, with the vast majority still coughing. (Table 1) Likewise, 14% needed re -admittance within 6 weeks after discharge. Both frequencies were somewhat lower in preterms compared to terms. Diagnostics For 91% of infants, information on diagnostics to confirm pertussis was found in the medical record.(Table 1) In 5% we found evidenc e of all three diagnostic procedures (i.e. culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology), whereas in 25% and 64% of infants evidence of respectively two and one diagnostic was found. Leukocyte data were available for one third of the medical reco rds, with median highest value of 17.2 (range 4.3- 106.1) with somewhat lower values in preterms. (Table 1) Likewise, C -reactive protein (CRP) was available for 21% of records with lower median CRP in terms than preterms (4.7 vs 15; p=0.007). In 53% of the infants, diagnostics for other pathogens were performed. (Tables 1&2) Overall, preterms were more often tested (61% vs 51%; p0.2) and diagnosed (36.7% Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness 61 4 vs 20.6%; p=0.01) with coinfections than terms. with RSV, para -influenzavirus Chlamydia trachomatis more often observed in preterms, although Chlamydia was only rare ly observed. (Table2) Assessment of the influence of age at hospitalization and coinfections on the clinical picture Multivariable logistic regression analysis on clinical course and treatment of pertussis, adjusted for age at hospitalization and coinf ections, did not change the trends, described above. (Table 3) In case of apnea, preterms showed an increased risk after adjustment (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.0- 3.3). Being vaccinated was associated with a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization among b oth terms (9 vs 3 days; p<0.0001) and preterms (13 vs 5 days; p=0.01). A lower median duration of Intensive Care admission was found among vaccinated preterms (8 vs20 days; p=0.1), but not in terms. Vaccination was significantly associated with a lower cr ude risk of apneas, artificial respiration, additional oxygen and ICU admittance both in terms and preterms. (Table 4) Furthermore, vaccination appeared to reduce the crude risk of complications and prescription of antibiotics during admission in terms, bu t the crude risk of antibiotic prescription before admission appeared higher among the vaccinated term group. After adjustment for coinfections and age at admittance, differences were no longer significant except the lower need of oxygen treatment in vaccinated terms. Influence of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness Among preterm infants, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the first infant dose, i.e.at 2 months of age, was to 95% (95%CI 93%- 96%) among term infants. (Table 5) VE of the second dose of the primary vaccination series did not differ between the groups. Sensitivity analyses; n=468 Taken into account only those infants with known gestational age, findings of the analyses were similar, i.e. analyses in relation to preterm delivery (n=468), vaccination status (n=379) and VE estimates (not all data shown).

Furthermore, preterms were older at hospitalization and had more often received first vaccinations against pertussis. VE of the first dose of pertussis vaccination was lower for preterms than for terms. Furthermore, preterms tended to need more often intensive treatment and had a longer stay at the Intensive Care Unit. Likewise, preterms tended to be diagnosed more often with coinfectio ns. Despite lower VE, the first vaccination against pertussis resulted in lower disease severity and less need for intensive treatment in both groups. Coinfections and age at admission influenced the need for intensive treatment and mitigated the beneficial effect of being vaccinated. The overrepresentation of preterms is also reported in other studies . In Norway, 10% of infant pertussis hospitalizations concerned preterm s, compared to 5.2% born prematurely nationwide [13] . More or less similar data are derived from England [7], Australia [14] and Canada [15] . Low birth weight, which is associated with preterm delivery, was increased among hospitalized pertussis cases in Jerusalem [16] . Likewise, Langkamp et al. showed that l ow birth weight infants were at increased risk of pertussis hospitalizations compared to normal birth weight infants [17] . The clinical picture in our observational study resembles findings in other retrospective studies. Marshall et al. showed that preterms had a higher pertussis disease severity score (defined by a longer hospital stay, ICU admittance, need for rehydration, respiratory support, coinfections and the presence of complications) than terms [14]. In England, a longer d uration of hospitalization, higher frequencies of ICU admittance and coinfections were observed among preterms, although their frequency of coinfections was lower than ours (10% vs 37% ) [7]. Langkamp et al. also reported a higher median age at hospitalization and a longer median length of stay among l ow birth weight infants than among normal birth weight infants [17] . In contrast, in case of more active and prospective study designs, higher frequencies of clinical characteristics were observed in infants (i.e. terms and preterms combined) hospitalized for pertussis, like higher frequencie s of cyanosis/ desaturation (72%) and than in our study [16] . Australian researchers observed higher rates of ICU admittance (18%) and treatment with antibiotics (96%) but lower median length of ICU stay (6 days) [18] . In Switzerland, hospitalized infants <6m of age had higher frequencies of coughing attacks (93%), whooping ( 69%), vomiting (59%) and complications Pertussis hospitalizations among term and preterm infants: clinical course and vaccine effectiveness 71 4 (24%) [19, 20] . As active designs u sually profit from more structured clinical observations and documentation in the medical record, the frequencies, found in the retrospective studies probably are an underestimation of the pertussis burden in terms and preterms [21]. The aim of vaccination against pertussis is to prevent severe disease. We confirmed that vaccination reduced disease severity and duration of hospitalization, comparable to other studies [18, 22 -24], and in line with a previous s tudy, performed in the Netherlands in 2006 -2008 [5]. However, our data on vaccine effectiveness were higher than for example in studies in Germany (VE 68%; 95%CI 45.6 -81.1) [25, 26] . Unfortunately, no data on GA were provided in these studies. In Norway (VE 60.7% in terms and 71.2% in preterms) and Denmark (VE 51% in terms vs 45% in preterms), no difference in effectiveness of the first pertussis v accine dose against hospitalizations between terms and preterms was observed [13, 27]. Both Scandinavian countries start at age 3 months with their immunization schedule as compared to the Netherlands with a first dose between 6 weeks to 2 months. In 2 month olds, protective maternal antibodies may be higher as compared to 3 months of age and higher in terms than in preterms. [29]. Likewise, studies have showed a decreased immune respons e after immunization at 2 months in preterms compared with terms [30, 31] and an equal response in terms and preterms at 3 months [32]. The fact that the Scandinavian countries failed to see a difference in vaccine effectiveness betwe en term and preterms might be explained by the interplay between maternal antibodies that reduce a first response and a less effective immune response in preterms at younger age that may have improved at age 3 months [28]We didn 't find difference in VE of the second dose between terms and preterms. Diagnosed coinfections influenced the effect vaccination had on the clinical course, similar to findings in other studies [7, 14] . Like in other studies, we observed coinfections with viral infections like RSV [33-38]. However, a recent systematic review concluded that the influence of coinfections on pertussis disease severity still is unclear [39]. Our study has seve ral strengths. First, the study used nationwide data over a 10 year period. Participating hospitals were spread over the country and showed a good representation of tertiary, top clinical and local hospitals in the Netherlands. Collected data contained detailed information on clinical characteristics of pertussis, also including information on possible confounding factors, e.g. coinfections. Furthermore, linkage to the vaccination registry enabled us to use validated vaccination records. Finally, all pert ussis cases were laboratory confirmed. Chapter 4 72 Limitations of our study are the retrospective design with differences in pertussis diagnostics, diagnostics for coinfections and registration of clinical and laboratory disease characteristics. Secondly, the incomplete reporting of hospital diagnoses at discharge, assessed in a recent capture- recapture analysis [40] might have influenced our results. Although we could not stratify this underreporting by gestational age, the good representation of tertiary, top -clinical and local hospitals in our study probably led to inclusion of a representative variety in the spectrum of pertussis disease. The found overrepresentation of preterms, wh ich is comparable to findings in other studies, underlines this conclusion. Furthermore, the retrospective use of medical records led to missing data, e.g. on gestational age, birth weight, with possible impact on our results. For this reason our main an alysis was based on all included records, assuming that records with unknown GA were born term. The performed sensitivity analysis showed no major impact of missing data on GA, thereby confirming our findings. Likewise, leukocytosis and CRP data were incomplete, also leading to less informative results. Linking between medical records and vaccination data, based on pseudonymization, might have led to incorrect linkage. Medical records include the home address of the patient at time of the last visit, while the vaccination registry includes the current home address. Especially in case of frequent moving and a large interval between the last hospital visit and the current residence, linkage might be incorrect. In our study, 38% of infants did not move house. Furthermore, the use of additional pseudonyms based on previous home addresses, also stored in the vaccination registry, lowered the risk of incorrect linking. In conclusion, we found an overrepresentation of preterms among pertussis hospitalizations with a slightly higher overall risk of complications, increased need for intensive treatment and lower effectiveness of the first infant pertussis vaccination. Recently, the Dutch Health Council advised to offer maternal pertussis vaccination in the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy. While this strategy is overall very effective, preterms may benefit less due to less protective maternal antibody transfer before delivery [6, 7] . They probably will be nefit more from 2 nd trimester immunization. However, for infants born of unvaccinated mothers, a timely first dose remains important, as this prevents clinical pertussis and decreases disease severity. This study underlines the need for more in- depth surve illance of vaccine preventable diseases in relation to gestational age and more insights in optimizing the vaccination program for all children but in particular for preterm infants who are the most vulnerable group.

Knol Melker Rob S. van Binnendijk Susan J.M. Hahn\u00e9 Published in : J Infect Dis. 2017 Apr 15 ;215(8):1181 -1187 (DOI : 10.1093/infdis/jiw586) Chapter 5 78 Abstract Background Routinely, the first measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine dose is given at 14 months of age in the Netherlands. However, during a measles epidemic in 2013 -2014, MMR vaccination was also 6-14-month -olds in munic ipalities with <90% MMR vaccination coverage. We studied the effectiveness of the early MMR vaccination schedule. Methods Parents of all infants targeted for early MMR vaccination were asked to participate . When parent(s) suspected mea sles, their infant's saliva was tested for measles -specific antibodies. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory -confirmed and self - reported measles was estimated using Cox regression, with VE calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio. Results Three vaccinated and 10 unvaccinated laboratory -confirmed cases occurred over observation times of 106631 and 23 769 days, respectively. The unadjusted VE against laboratory -confirmed measles was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 79% - 98%). After adjustment for religion and sibling's vaccination status, the VE decreased to 71% (72%- 95%). For self-reported measles, the (40% -82%) and 43% (12% -71%), respectively. Conclusions Infants vaccinated between 6 and 14 months of age had a lower risk of measles than unvaccinated infants. However, part of the effect was caused by herd immunity, since vaccinated infants were more likely to be surrounded by other vaccinated individuals. Effectiveness of Early Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination Among 6 -14-Month - Old Infants During an Epidemic in the Netherlands: An Observational Cohort Study 79 5 Background Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can lead to severe illness and even death, with th e greatest burden in the young est children [ 1, 2]. Most deaths from acute measles are due to secondary in fections resultin g -induced suppres sion of immune responses [3]. Measles vaccination programs have led to a large decline in global mortality, from an estimated 562 400 annual measles deaths in 2000 to 114 900 in 2014 [4]. Infants aged <1 year were at highest risk of measles in recent outbreaks in Europe [ 5, 6]. This is worrisome because the risk of measles -associated complications and case - fatality rates are highest among infants [2, 7]. Passively acquired maternal anti - bodies protect infants against measles during the first months of life. However, infants of vaccinated women have significantly lower concentrations of maternal antibodies than infants of naturally immune women [8], and protection is on average 2-3 months shorter [ 8, 9]. At the age of 6 months, most infants (95% born to naturally immune women and 99% born to vaccinated women) lack detectable maternal antibodies [8]. The World Health Organization advises delivering the first dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to infants aged 9 months in measles -endemic countries and to infants aged 12 months in countries w ith low rates of measles trans mission [10]. In the Netherlands, children are offered MMR vaccination at 14 months and 9 years of age. Infants who have lost their protection from maternal antibodies are susceptible until their first vaccination. Administering vaccinations at an earlier age than 9 months may be beneficial when the risk of measles is high. However, measles vaccination of infants <9 months of age has been associated with lower proportions of children who develop protective antibody levels after measles vaccination. The median proportion of children who seroconverted after measles vaccination at 8-9 months of age was 90% (interquartile range [IQR], 82% -95%) among median was 99% (IQR, 93% -100%) among infants vaccinated at 11 -12 months in 21 studies [ 11]. However, the majority of these studies were con - ducted in developing countries. Seroconversion results stratified by age may be different in industrialized countries. Reasons for this include lower levels of maternal anti bodies, since most mothers have vaccine -induced immunity to measles only. In a study where infants were inc luded without maternal antibod ies, no differences were found in the seroconversion rates for infants vaccinated at 9 and 12 months of age [12 ]. In a systematic review of case -control and cohort studies, the effectiveness against laboratory -confirmed measles of a 1-dose measles -containing vaccine (MCV) administered at the age of 9 -11 months was estimated to be 84%, while the vaccine Chapter 5 80 effec tiveness (VE) for infants who were vaccinated at the age of 12 months was 93% [13]. VE estimates for infants vaccinated at <9 months of age are scarce. In a retrospective cohort study in Niger in 1995, a single dose of MCV administered to infants aged <9 months resulted in a VE of 87% (95% CI, 81% -91%) against self - reported clinical measles among children 6 -59 months of age [14]. To date, no VE estimates against laboratory -confirmed measles have been reported in observational studies among infants vaccinated at <9 months of age. Estimates of VE against laboratory -confirmed measles are more accurate because they discriminate measles from other diseases with rash and fever. Here we investigated VE against self -reported and labo ratory -confirmed measles among infants who received an MMR vaccination between 6 and 14 months of age during a measles epidemic in the Netherlands. The epidemic started in May 2013 and lasted until March 2014, with 2700 reported cases [ 15]. Most cases were unvaccinated orthodox Protestant primary and secondary school -aged children. The epidemic peaked in July 2013, slowed down during the summer holiday, and progressed with a second, lower peak in October 2013. This study was possible because the Dutch Ministry of Health offered an MMR vaccination temporarily to all infants between 6 and 14 months of age who were living in municipalities with MMR vaccination coverage of <90% and to infants in orthodox Protestant families living elsewhere. Methods Study Procedures We conducted a prospective observational cohort study during the measles epidemic in the Netherlands in 2013 -2014. As part of the vaccination campaign, infants between 6 and 14 months of age living in municipalities where coverage with the first dose of MMR vaccine was <90% [16] were invited for an additional or an early MMR vaccination. Infants 6 -11 months of age were offered an extra vaccination (and would thus still be eligi ble for their second MMR vaccination at the age of 14 months), while 12 -14-month -old infants were offered an early MMR vaccination as an alternative for the regular time point at 14 months of age. All infants are eligible for another dose of MMR scheduled at 9 years of age. Approximately 4 weeks after t he personal invitation for vac cination, all parents of infants targeted for the early MMR in the 29 municipalities received an invitation to enroll their infant(s) in the study. We could not invite parents of infants in orthodox Protestant families living outside of the 29 targeted municipal ities to participate in the study, as religion is not registered in the vaccination registr y of the N etherlands. Invitations to par ticipate in the study were sent from week 35 of 2013 up to week 8 of 2014 [17]. Parents of invited infants were asked to register for the study by sending a reply form by regular mail, indicating their e -mail address. Subsequently, Effectiveness of Early Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination Among 6 -14-Month - Old Infants During an Epidemic in the Netherlands: An Observational Cohort Study 81 5 they received a link to the online baseline questionnaire. Infants were followed until the end of the epidemic (14 March 2014). Along the follow -up period, parents were reminded monthly by e -mail to report suspected measles in their infant. When parents did so, they received a second questionnaire and a saliva sampling kit for detection of measles virus. The Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects of the Netherlands approve d the study. Data Collection In the baseline questionnaire, vaccination status was asked, as well as permission to check vaccination status in the national vaccination register. Parents were also asked whether their infant(s) had had measles in the precedi ng 3 months. In the baseline questionnaire, measles was defined as having a fever (temperature, >38\u00b0C), exanthema , and at least 1 of the follow ing symptoms: cough, runny nose, or sore eyes [ 18]. Other questions, among others, were about sex, day-care center atten dance, vaccination status of the parent(s) and sibling(s), educa tion level of the parent(s), religion, travel history, medication use, comorbidities, breastfeeding, birth weight, and duration of pregnancy. The second q uestionnaire, which parents received when they reported that their in fant had measles, consisted of questions to ascertain symptoms to diagnose self -reported measles. Laboratory Testing When parents reported measles in their infant, they were sent a saliva sampling kit, consisting of a tube and a swab. Briefly, we used an immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme immuno - assay specifically designed for the detection of IgM antibodies in oral fluid specimens, according to procedures recommended by the manufactur er (MicroImmune, Hounslow, Middlesex, United Kingdom). The relative specificity and sensitivity of IgM antibody detection in oral fluid as compared to serum is near 100%, as reported by the manufacturer. An infant of whom the parents reported a suspected measles case and from whom the saliva sample tested IgM positive was regarded as a laboratory -confirmed measles case. Laboratory testing was only offered to suspected cases occurring after the baseline questionnaire was completed. Infants for whom it was i ndicated in the base- line questionnaire that they had had measles in the 3 months before filling out the baseline questionnaire were not offered saliva testing. Outcomes We estimated VE against laboratory -confirmed measles and self -reported measles. For VE estimation against laboratory -confirmed measles, the observation time Chapter 5 82 started at the date the baseline questionnaire was filled in and stopped at either the reported date of onset of disease, a second MMR vaccination or the end of the epidemic (14 M arch 2014), whichever came first. For self-reported measles, the baseline questionnaire included a question about the occurrence of measles in the preceding 3 months. Therefore, we included this 3 -month period in the observation time for the outcome of sel f-reported measles. The start of the observation time for the outcome of self -reported measles was ther efore 3 months before the base line questionnaire, with a minimum at 6 months of age. The end of the observation time for self-reported measles was the date of onset of measles, a second MMR vaccination, or the end of the epidemic, whichever came first. Statistical Analysis Infants with a missing address or no permission to check their vaccination status were excl uded. We also excluded self -reported cases before the start of the observation time, cases reported 5 -12 days after vaccination, and infants who enrolled after their second MMR vaccination or after the epidemic. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) times 100 [ 19]. The HR is the ratio of the hazard among vaccinated infants versus the hazard among unvaccinated infants. Kaplan -Meier estimates were used to visualize empirical probabilities of lab - oratory -confirmed and self- reported measles in vaccinated and unvaccinated infants. A Cox proportional hazard model, which gives a HR as the outcome, assessed the association between vaccination status and the outcomes of laboratory -confirmed measles and self -reported measles. Owing to the varying expo sure to measles during an epidemic, we used calendar time as the time scale [ 20]. Vaccination status was included as a time -varying exposure variable ; infants could contribute person -time to both the unvaccinated and vaccinated group. The vaccinated person- time started 12 days after the MMR vaccina tion. Age was also included as a time -varying variable and was updated every quintile of the observation period. The following covariates were considered a priori as potential confounders: age, breastfeeding, religion, sibling's vaccination status, day -care center attendance, and travel history. To test which covariates we had to include in our model, we first performed bivariable analyses. The covariate that gave the biggest relative change in the VE (with a minimum of 10%) was included in the model. Subsequently, we added the remaining covariates one by one to the model to check for another change of >10% in the VE. A final model was reached when none of the remaining covariates led to a >10% change. We tested the proportional hazards assumption by using scaled Schoenfeld residuals, where we considered the proportional hazards assumption to be valid with a P value of > .05 for the variables in the final model. Data analysis was conducted using R (version 3.2.0). Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan- Meier estimates were conducted by using the package survival . Effectiveness of Early Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination Among 6 -14-Month - Old Infants During an Epidemic in the Netherlands: An Observational Cohort Study 83 5 Vaccine The vaccine administered during this v accination campaign was the same as the live attenuated MMR vaccine used in the national immunization program (M- M- RVAXPRO; Sanofi Pasteur MSD). This vaccine contains at least 103 50% cell culture infectious doses of measles virus Enders' Edmonston strain [21]. Figure 1. Flowchart study population. Abbreviation: MMR, measles, mumps, and rubella Results Between 13 July 2013 and 1 March 2014, 10097 infants in 29 municipalities were invited for an early MMR vaccination ( Figure 1 ). For 123 infants, the address was not available or parents had indicated that they did not want to receive regular mail from the vaccination registry. We invited 9974 infants to participate in the study, of Chapter 5 84 whom 1866 (19%) agreed and 1304 (13%) filled in the baseline questionnaire. In total, 74 infants (6%) were excluded because parents did not give permission to check their infant's vaccination status, resulting in 1230 eligible infants (12%) for analysis. Characteristics of the cohort are presented in Table 1. The vaccinated and unvaccinated groups differed considerably. Vaccinated infants were on average 31 days older at enrollment. Unvaccinated infants were more likely to have an unvaccinated sibling or parent and to go to a church with low vaccination coverage. Vaccinated and unvaccinated infants were similar with regard to sex, parents' education level, medication use, comor bidities and birth weight. In total, 1080 infants were eligible for the analysis of the outcome of laboratory - confirmed measles, after the exclusion of 62 infants with self- reported measles before the start of the obser vation time, 8 infants who enrolled after their second MMR dose, and 80 infants who enrolled after the measles epidemic ( Figure 1 ). During the observation period, 3 vaccinated and 10 unvaccinated laboratory -confirmed cases of measles were reported ( Table 2). Two vaccinated infants were vaccinated at 6 months of age and 1 at 8 months of age. Most cases occurred between September and November 2013 ( Figure 2 ). Using Cox proportional hazard modeling, we found an unadjusted HR of 0.06, which corresponds to a VE of 94% (95% confidence inter - val [CI], 79%- 98%; Table 2). When we adjusted for confounding (sibling's vaccination status and religion), VE decreased to 71% (95% CI, 72% -95%). For the analysis of the outcome of self -reported measles, we excluded 12 cases who reported measles 5 -12 days following after the early MMR vaccination and 14 cases who reported measles before the start of the observation time. In total, there were 20 vaccinated and 37 unvaccinat ed self -reported cases of measles ( Table 2), which were reported throughout the observation time ( Figure 3 ). The unadjusted VE for self- reported measles was 67% (95% CI, 40% -82%), and the VE adjusted for religion and sibling vaccination status was 43% (95% CI, 12% -71%; ).

Chapter 5 88 Discussion We showed that infants vaccinated between 6 and 14 months of age had a reduced risk, compared with unvaccinated infants, of laboratory -confirmed measles during an epidemic in the Netherlands, with an unadjusted VE estimate of 94%. This reduction cannot be solely attributed to the effectiveness of the vaccine. Vaccinated infants were probably exposed to measles to a lesser extent than unvaccinated infants, as the latter were more frequently members of the orthodox Protestant community, in which the vaccination coverage is low, and more often had an unvaccinated sibling or parent. When we adjusted for these differenc es in exposure to measles, the VE against laboratory -confirmed measles decreased to 71%. Owing to low numbers, this estimate was no longer statistically significant. Unadjusted and adjuste d VE estimates against self -reported The lower VE estimates against self -reported measles, compared with laboratory -confirmed measles, most likely reflect misdiagnosis. First, with an effective vaccine, the presence of cases misdiagnosed as measles results in a lower VE, as relatively more of these cases are present in the vaccinated group [22 ]. Second, it could be that vaccinating parents may be more likely to erroneously interpret any rash appearance as measle s, since they are probably less familiar with measles than parents who are opposed to vaccination. This could lead to a selective increase in false -positive cases among vaccinated infants as compared to unvaccinated infants and hence an underestimation of the VE. Furthermore, most lab oratory -confirmed cases occurred from September to October, which coincided with a peak of reported cases during the measles epidemic in the Netherlands [15], while self-reported cases in our st udy population occurred constantly over time. Our estimate of VE against the outcome of laboratory -confirmed measles is more accurate, as the laboratory test excludes most rash cases that are not caused by the measles virus. Our adjusted point estimate of the VE against laboratory -confirmed measles (71%) is adjacent to the lower end of the IQR of the VE (72% -95%) found in a systematic review [ 13]. This VE estimate was based on 44 MCV estimates, using laboratory confirmation of cases and studies with a cohort or case -control design. However, this estimate was limited to infants vaccinated at 9 -11 months of age, while in our study infants 6 -8 months old were also included. A study more comparable in respect to age with our study was conducted during an outbreak in Canada [ 23]. Deserres et al estimated a VE of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72% -99%) against clinical measles for infants 6 -11 months of age. Our adjusted estimate against laboratory -confirmed measles borders the lower value of the 95% CI, despite the inclusion of infants vaccinated between 12-14 months of age in our study. However, the Canadian study assumed comparable levels of exposure to measles between the vaccinated and unvaccinated infants, whereas we tried to include Effectiveness of Early Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination Among 6 -14-Month - Old Infants During an Epidemic in the Netherlands: An Observational Cohort Study 89 5 exposure to measles in our model through adjustment for surrogates of exposure to measles. Our results indicate that exposure to measles as assessed through such proxies differe d between vaccinated and unvac cinated infants and that it influenced the VE estimates. Adjustment of the VE with surrogates of measles exposure led to lower VE estimate s for both self-reported and laboratory -confirmed measles. This was in line with our expectations, given that the measles epidemic in the Netherlands largely took place among unvaccinated orthodox Protestant children [15], who live in socio- geographic clusters [ 24]. Thus, we think that exposure to measles is an important factor to take into account in the estimation of VE in observational studies, especially given that parents' choice to vaccinate also depends on the choices of their social network [25] and that, if the networks of the parents' children overlap, clusters of unvaccinated children emerge [26]. To our knowledge, only one randomized clinical trial has been conducted to estimate the measles efficacy of MCV in children vaccinated at <9 months of age in an outbreak setting [27]. Because infants were randomly assigned to be vaccinated, different levels of exposure to measles can most likely be ruled out in this clinical trial. Martins et al followed 1333 infants aged 4.5 months, of whom 441 were vaccinated, for 5 months and found a VE of 94% (95% CI, 74% -98%) against laboratory -confirmed measles. In comparison with our estimate this is substantially higher, all the more since infants were vaccinated at 4.5 months of age. It is, however, important to note that in this trial the Edmonston Zagreb vaccine was used, which has been reported to have a higher immunogenicity in infants than other vaccines [ 27, 28]. The main limitation of our study is that infants were not randomly assigned to receive or not receive early MMR vaccination but self -selected whether to vaccinate, and therefore we studied different groups in respect to exposure to measles. We have addressed this difference in exposure to measles by correcting for surrogates, but residual confounding canno t be excluded. Another limitation of our study is the low response rate and small number of cases. As a result, we did not have sufficient statistical power to find precise VE estimates, which may account for some of the variance between our VE estimates a nd previous estimates in literature. In addition, the small number of cases limited us to study differences in the severity of disease between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases and to stratify the results by age at vaccination. In a subgroup analysis of infants vaccinated at <9 months of age and unvaccinated infants enrolling before 9 months of age, we found an unadjusted VE against laboratory -confirmed measles of 81% (95% CI, 7.6% -96%). Since infants are at the greatest risk during recent outbreaks in Europe and as they are at the highest risk for complications, too, it is important to protect them during Chapter 5 90 outbreaks. Recently, a study by our group concluded that MMR vaccine is safe to protect infants aged 6 -14 months of age [29 ]. The trade -off, however, is a lower VE, leaving rel atively more vaccinated infants susceptible. This lower VE can be largely voided by the additional measles vaccination recommended in the World Health Organization schedule, g iven that the majority of chil dren who did not develop sufficient antibodies after their first measles vaccination will develop protective antibody levels after their second measles vaccination [ 11]. However, a concern is that vaccinated infants who received their first MCV vaccination at 6 months of age \u2014and despite subsequent secondary and tertiary doses \u2014had lower levels of humoral responses at 7 -10 years of age, compared with those who received the first dose of MMR at 12 months [30 ]. This blunting could be associated with the interference of maternal antibodies and an immature immunity. That this effect may be of clinical relevance is suggested by first results of an outbreak investigation among students in Canada [31]. Here relatively more twice -vaccinated cases were reported who received their first MMR dose at 12 months of age than twice -vaccinated cases who received their first MMR at 15 months of age. In conclusion, MMR vaccinated infants between 6-14 months of age were at lower risk of measles than unvaccinated infants. However, part of the effect was caused by the herd immunity yielded by the regular national immunization program in the Netherlands; vaccinated infants were more l ikely to be sur rounded by vaccinated individuals and were therefore to a lesser extent exposed to measles. Our VE estimates, adjusted for expo sure to measles through the use of proxies, suggest that the early MMR vaccination campaign in the Netherlands was effective, but precise estimates are lacking, and further research on VE at a young age is required. In the meantime, given the high disease burden in infants <14 months of age and the early loss of mater nal protection, early MMR vaccination is recommended when the risk of measles is high.

Chapter 6 Tolerability of early measles- mumps - rubella vaccination in infants aged 6- 14 months during a measles outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013- 2014 Nicoline A.T. van der Maas Tom Woudenberg Susan J.M. Hahn\u00e9 Hester E. de Melker Published in : J Infect Dis. 2015. (DOI : 10.1093/infdis/jiv756 ) Chapter 6 94 Abstract Background In 2013- 2014, a measles outbreak spread through the Netherlands. To protect young infants, measles -mumps -rubella (MMR) vaccination was offered to 6 -14-month -olds in municipalities with MMR1 coverage below 90%. We assessed tolerability of this early MMR. Methods After study -entry, parents of eligible infants (n=10,097) filled in a questionnaire. In case the infant received an early MMR (n=962), we asked information on adverse events (AEs). AE -frequencies were compared between 6 -8-, 9-11- and 12 -14-month - olds. Using multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the association between the risk of AEs and age at early MMR. Results Parents of 59 (6.1%) and 350 (36.4%) infants receiving early MMR reported local and systemic AEs, respectively. Parents of infants vaccinated at 6 -8 months reported less frequently systemic AEs (32%) than parents of children vaccinated at 9 -11 (45%) and 12-14 (43%) months (p=<0.001). For local AEs no 7% and 10%, respectively; p=0.08). Compared to vaccina tion at 6 months, all older infants, except 14 -month -olds, showed an increased risk for any AE and for systemic AEs starting 5 -12 days after vaccination. Conclusions Early MMR is well tolerated with lowest AE -frequencies found in 6 -8-month -olds. Thus, it is a safe intervention to protect young infants against measles. Tolerability of early measles -mumps -rube lla vaccination in infants aged 6 -14 months during a measles outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013 -2014 95 6 Introduction Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease, with most severe disease in young infants and adults (1) . Measles vaccination was introduced in the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) in the Netherlands in 1976. Since 1987, measles vaccination is given in combined measles -mumps -rubella (MMR) vaccination at 14 months and 9 year of age with corresponding coverage amounting to 96% (first dose) and 93% (first and second dose) (2) . From May 2013 until March 2014, a measles outbreak spread across the Netherlands, mainly among orthodox Protestants living in socio- geographically clustered communities with a low acceptanc e of vaccination (3) . A previous outbreak among the same group occurred in 1999 -2000 with more than 3,200 registered cases (4) . To protect infants below the age of routine MMR vaccination in high -risk areas, all infants aged 6 -14 months living in municipalities with MMR1 coverage be low 90% were invited for an early MMR vaccination. Current vaccination guidelines in the Netherlands already advice to vaccinate infants from 6 months onwards when there is a real risk to contract measles, e.g. when travelling to a country where measles is endemic (5). This is similar to guidelines in the United States (6) . Worldwide licensed MMR vaccines are registered from 12 months of age, while in outbreak settings they can be used from 9 months onwards. In concordance with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) information, infants receiving MMR vaccination before 12 months of age are offered a second MMR vaccination after the age of one year because of the beneficial effects on the cellular and humoral immune response against measles (7) . Irrespective of early MMR vaccination, in the Netherlands all children are offered another dose of MMR at the age of nine years. The advice to vaccinate infants aged 6 months and older was based on Dutch population - based seroprevalence data from 1995 -1996 and 2006- 2007, combined with evidence on age -specific immunogenicity and effectiveness (8-11). The seroprevalence data suggested that most infants of 6 months or older lacked maternal antibodies, especially when they were born to vaccinated mothers . MMR vaccination from 6 months old onwards is regarded safe based on studies mainly performed during vaccination campaigns in developing countries (12 -15). Some studies also show beneficial effects due to a reduced overall mortality after early measles vaccin ation (16) . In the light of continuing measles outbreaks in developed countri es and the need to comply with WHO targets for eliminating measles and rubella, information on effectiveness, safety and impact of early MMR vaccination gives valuable input to policy makers responsible for outbreak control measures. In this article we describe and discuss results of the tolerability monitoring of the early MMR vaccination campaign in the Netherlands. Chapter 6 96 Methods Setting and participants In response to the measles outbreak among orthodox Protestants, an outbreak management team decided on June 17th 2013 to offer early MMR vaccination to all infants between 6 and 14 months of age living in municipalities with MMR1 coverage below 90%. On July 13 th 2013, parents of eligible infants received a personal invitation for early MMR through the routi ne vaccination programme register. The Netherlands has a very complete national vaccination registration, which allows direct targeting of additional vaccination to risk groups (17) . Thereafter, all parents of infants turning 6 months in the previous week and resident in the eligible municipalities received an invitation for early MMR vaccination of their infant. Last invitations were distributed in week 8 of 2014. To avoid interfere nce with the willingness to vaccinate, invitations to participate in our study were sent 4 weeks after the invitation for vaccination. Parents willing to participate could return an application form with their e -mail address. In return, they received a link to an online questionnaire. Parents who indicated in the past that they do not want to receive regular mail from the vaccination registry were not invited to participate in our study. For this study IRB -approval was not necessary, as checked with the C entral Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects of the Netherlands. Vaccine The vaccine administered during this vaccination campaign was identical to the MMR vaccine used in the NIP at 14 months and 9 years of age at that time (MMRvaxpro\u00ae; Sanofi Pasteur MSD). This vaccine contains at least 1x10 3 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID 50) measles rubella virus Wistar 27/3 strain. All strains are live a ttenuated. Measles and mumps strains are produced in chick embryo blasts, whereas the rubella strain is produced in WI -38 human diploid lung fibroblasts. The vaccination is given subcutaneously in the upper arm. Data collection The online questionnaire as ked for demographics of the infant eligible for early MMR and of the entire household. Furthermore, past and present measles infections and vaccination status of all household members was ascertained. In case early MMR was administered, questions about loc al and systemic adverse events (AEs) were asked with details on severity, interval with vaccination and duration of symptoms. Tolerability data are only available for infants who received the early MMR vaccination before parents filled in the first questionnaire. Tolerability of early measles -mumps -rube lla vaccination in infants aged 6 -14 months during a measles outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013 -2014 97 6 Outcome definitions Local AEs were classified as mild, moderate or pronounced. Systemic AEs were dichotomized. We defined fever as a temperature 38.0 \u00b0C., measured sublingual, intra -auricular or rectally , based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition (18) . Very high fever was defined as a temperature 40.5 \u00b0C. Time between early MMR and start of systemic AEs was divided in three periods, i.e. start on days 0 -4, 5- 12 or 13. Covariates All covariates were retrieved from the questionnaire. If parents permitted, their infant's vaccination status was checked in the national vaccination register. All other covariates were self -reported without validation. Statistics Frequencies and means of demographics, local and systemic AEs are presented overall and stratified by age, categorizing infants in 3 age groups; 6 -8-, 9-11- and 12- 14- month -olds. Differences were tested using Pearson's Chi Square or Fisher's exact test (for dichotomous and cate gorical variables) or student t- test (for continuous variables). To assess whether age at time of the early MMR was associated wi th risk for any AE (i.e. local or systemic AE in any risk window) or with s ystemic AEs starting 5 -12 days after early MMR vacc ination only, we performed multivariable logistic regression . Hereby age was categorized per month. Covariates with a plausible or known effect on the outcome were part of the multivariable model as possible confounders , i.e. sex, underlying disease of th e infant, ever being breastfed, gestational age, older siblings in the household, maternal age and educational level, measles vaccination status and past measles infection of the mother and reasons to refuse vaccination (see also Table 1). Using stepwise b ackward selection, all covariates with <10% influence on the estimate of the main determinant, i.e. age in months, were discarded from the model. We also assessed possible interactions. Risks are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3. In all analyses, a p -value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Response In total 10,097 infants in all (n=29) municipalities with MMR1 coverage below 90% in 2012 were invited for an early MMR. Of these, parents of 9,974 infants were invited to participate in the study (for 123 infants the address was not available or parents h ad indicated that they do not want to receive regular mail from the vaccination registry). Chapter 6 98 Parents of 1,866 infants (19%) responded. Finally, parents of 1,304 infants (13%) filled in the first questionnaire. By the time parents filled in the first question naire, 962 infants (74%) had already received an early MMR. We report tolerability data of these 962 infants. The median interval between MMR0 and filling out the questionnaire was 49 days (mean 51.4d, range 1- 211). For 6 -8-month -olds, the median interval was 44d (mean 48.7d, range 1- 211), while this was 57.2d (mean 55d, range 9 -148) and 51d (mean 53.3d, range 8- 144) for 9- 11- and 12 -14-month -olds, respectively. Differences in median interval between the groups were statistically significant (p<0.0001). Demographics Median age at early MMR vaccination was 7.0 months (range 5.7 -14.9). In total 603 (62.7%) infants received their early MMR at the age of 6- 8 months (median 6.3), whereas 239 (24.8%) and 120 (12.5%) infants received their early MMR at age 9 -11 months (median 10.0) and 12 -14 months (median 12.7), respectively. An equal number of boys and girls (n=481; 50%) received early MMR vaccination during this campaign. Sex distribution between the three age groups were equal (p=0.3; Table 1). Furthermore, w e found no differences in day -care attendance; underlying disease of infant; duration of pregnancy; presence of older siblings; refusal of vaccination based on life philosophy or religion; maternal educational level; maternal vaccination status and matern al measles infection in the past between the three age groups. In contrast, 6-8-month -olds were less frequently ever being breastfed (p=0.01) and less frequently had a mother in the oldest age category, i.e. older than 38 years (p=0.02) than infants of old er age groups. Local AEs Parents of 59 infants (6.1%) reported one or more local AEs following the early MMR (Table 2). There was a trend of an increasing frequency of local AEs with increasing age, but differences were not statistically significant (p= 0.08). We found no difference in the frequency of any local AE between the early and the late responders, both in the overall study population (p=0.09) as well as in the three age groups (p=0.2, p=0.5 and p=0.6 for re spectively 6 and 12- 14m). Red ness (n=53; 5.5%) was reported most often, followed by pain (n=40; 4.2%) and swelling (n=33; 3.4%). Redness, pain and swelling started within 24 hours after vaccination in 72%, 80% and 82% respectively, whereas symptoms lasted less than three days in 72%, 75% and 70%. Parents of 8 (0.1%), 6 (0.1%) and 4 (0.07%) infants reported that respectively redness, pain and swelling was pronounced. Tolerability of early measles -mumps -rube lla vaccination in infants aged 6 -14 months during a measles outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013 -2014 99 6 Systemic AEs Parents of 350 infants (36.4%) reported one or more systemic AEs (Table 2). Parents of infants who were 6- 8 months old at the time of early MMR reported less frequently systemic AEs than older age groups (p<0.001). Overall frequencies were 31.7% (n=191), 45.5% (n=108) and 42.5% (n=51) for those aged 6 -8, 9- 11 and 12 -14 month olds, respectively. We found no d ifference in the frequency of any systemic AE between the early and the late responders in the overall study population (p=0.1) and in the 12 -14-month -olds (p=0.3). In the 6- 8-month -olds the frequency of any systemic AE was higher in the early responders t han in the late responders (52.8% vs 47.2%; p=0.05). Likewise, among the 9 -11-month -olds early responders reported any systemic AE in 56.9% compared with 43.1% in late responders (p=0.04). No differences in the frequencies of specific systemic AEs were fou nd between age groups, except for rash, which occurred less frequently in the group with the youngest age at vaccination (8%, 20% and 18%, respectively). Listlessness (n=274; 28%) was crying (n=185; problems (n=94; 10%). Parents of 2 infants reported fever with a temperature of 40.5 \u00b0C or higher. For one of these fever started within the risk window 5 -12 days after vaccination. Most systemic AEs started 5 -12 days after the vaccination, with a range of 62% to 75% for specific systemic AEs. A minority of parents reported a start of symptoms within 4 days after vaccination (range of percentages regarding different systemic AEs 13% -26%) or more than 12 days after vaccination (range 5% -24%). In 30% -69% of specific systemic AEs, duration of symptoms was 2 days or less, whereas in 15% -26% and 16% -50% symptoms lasted 3 days or 4 days and more, respectively. Influence of age on occurrence of local and systemic AEs After entering all possible confounders in the multivariable logistic regression, for both outcomes stepwise backward selection led to removal of all covariates, i.e. no adjustment was necessary. With 6 -month -olds set as reference, ORs for all older ages were above 1 (range 1.1 -2.7 and 1.4 -4.0 for any AE and systemic AEs 5 -12d after vaccination, respectively) except for 14 -month -olds (ORs 0.5 and 0.8) for local and systemic AEs (Table 3). For any AE, ORs were not statistically significant in 8 - and 14 - month -olds, whereas for systemic AEs occurring 5 -12 days after vaccination ORs were non- significant in infants aged 7, 8, 12 or 14 months.

Logistic regression analysis of risk of any AE and of systemic AEs 5 -12d after early MMR and age. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed tolerability of MMR vaccination administered from 6 months of age onwards in a developed country. We showed that this early MMR was well tolerated and that AEs in infants receiving their first MMR dose at 6 -8-month of age were less frequent compared to MMR administered at 14 months, the age when routine MMR1 vaccination is scheduled in the Netherlands . We found that the occurrence of AEs is age dependent. Frequencies of all local and most systemic AEs were lower in the youngest age group of 6 -8 month olds compared with older age groups. For both local as well as most systemic AE frequencies were lowest in the youngest age category. For fever and rash, we found respectively 15% and 7% 15% (12m). However, only the frequencies of rash and all systemic AEs combined differed statistically significant between the age groups.

Bolotovski et al. found frequencies of 6 - 14% for fever and rash after administration of several measles vaccines differing in strain and potency to 6 (n=1202) and 9 (n=1250) month o ld infants (13) . AEs were collected via an interview during a home visit in the second week after vaccination. In the study of Helfand et al. proportions for fever and rash were somewhat lower than in our study (14% and 1%, of a HIV -unexposed control group (12) . In the study of Helfand et al., pare nts recorded AEs in a daily log for 21 days after vaccination. The differences in the frequency of AEs between these studies and our study may be attributed to varying methods of AE ascertainment. Furthermore, Bolotovski and Helfand presented no case defin ition and cut- off for fever , possibly leading to different counting of cases with fever, which perhaps partly explains the differences. In a study on German infants, receiving MMR, 70% of 9 -olds (n=29) reported f ever (19) . This is much higher than the frequencies we found (28% and 21%), but these differences are difficult to interpret giving the small sample size of the German study. Another pos sible explanation for the lower frequencies of AEs in younger infants is the presence of maternal antibodies against measles virus that prohibit replication of vaccine virus and thereby prevent the occurrence of AEs. Dutch seroprevalence data showed that, in the general population, immunoglobulin G antibody levels were below the cutoff for protection in 54% of 3- month -old infants (95% con fidence interval, 34% -74%) (9). Among childre n born to orthodox reformed Protestant mothers who in general were naturally infected, the duration of protection was approximately 2 months longer (10) . Furthermore, breastfeeding, maternal vaccination status, and past measles virus infection of the mother were included in the multivariable regression analysis but did not in fluence the main estimate by >10% and were therefore not considered as confounders. Therefore, we think the in fluence of maternal antibodies is limited. However, we cannot exclude a possible in fluence of nondetectable, residual maternal antibodies. Furthermore, young infants are immunologically immature, which may also lead to less reactogenicity. Two other Dutch surveys on the tolerability of MMR1, given at children aged 14 months, found different frequencies of local and systemic AEs than we assessed in our 12-14-month -olds (20, 21) . Kroesbergen et al. local reactions and 32%, 38% and 24% for fever, crying and rash, respectively (20) , while Jongerius et al. (n=391) found 24%, 20% 17% and 17% for the respective AEs (21) . In our study, frequencies were 10%, 14%, 18% and 13%. The lower frequencies we found may be explained by study logistics: study participation was asked 4 weeks after the invitation for vaccination and infants received the vaccination before parents filled in the survey and maybe they did not remember all AEs, in particular the less severe symptoms. Another possible explanation for the lower frequency of AEs found in our Tolerability of early measles -mumps -rube lla vaccination in infants aged 6 -14 months during a measles outbreak in the Netherlands in 2013 -2014 105 6 study is that our primary aim was to assess vaccine effectiveness with additional questions on AEs, while both MMR1 surveys exclusively assessed tolerability. Therefore, frequencies found probably suffer less from over -reporting compared with the two tolerability su rveys. Apart from this survey, parents were asked to report AEs after vaccination to the Dutch Pharmacovigilance Center, Lareb. Lareb received 11 reports, of which 2 involved serious systemic AEs (1 infant had febrile convulsion and 1 experienced crying and dehydration). Our study has several limitations. First, only 13% of the parents of eligible infants complet ed the questionnaire, which may hamper generalizability. However, th e overall early MMR vaccination coverage in the 2 9 municipalities was 66%, while 74% of the infants in our study received early MMR vaccination. These percentages do not differ very much. Therefore, we think the risk of bias is low, despite the low response rate. Furthermore, the sex distribution in our study is comparable to the distribution in the general population. The overall median interva l between early MMR vaccination and questionnaire completion was >1.5months. This possibly in fluenced the reported AEs, resulting in an underestimation. However, because the age group in which this interval was shortest also had the lowest AE frequencies, recall bias may be limited. Because this outbreak occurred in a high -income country, results may be less applicable to d eveloping countries. The latter countries often have a less de veloped healthcare system and a greater prevalence of malnutrition, possibly (1) resulting in an impaired immune response and (2) in fluencing the occurrence of AEs. Furthermore, all AEs were s elf-reported without additional validation. This may have led to an ov eres timation of AE frequencies. As known from the twin study by Peltola et al on MMR vaccine -associated AEs, the vast majority of AEs following MMR vaccination are tempora lly associated but not causally related (22) . Therefore, most AEs reported in our study were probably not caused by MM R vaccination. Since we did not compare results with the occur rence of symptoms in age matched unvaccinated children, we cou ld not assess causality. We also were unable create an inter nal control group by monitoring the occurrence of the AE s prior to vaccination, because we sent invitations to participate 4 -5 weeks after the invitation for vaccination so that there would be no interference with parent 's decision regarding the vaccination. However, the rates found are useful for monitoring variation in AE frequencies between groups and over time and an ef ficient and easy way to monitor tolerability. To conclude, our results show that e arly MMR vaccine administration during an outbreak is safe to protect infants aged 6- 14 months against measles. Frequencies of local and common systemic AEs were lowest in younger age classes. Chapter 6 106 References 1. Plotkin S, Orenstein WA, Offit PA. Vaccines. 6 ed2012. 2.

Chapter 7 Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands Nicoline A.T. van der Maas Sarah Godefrooij : Hum Vaccin Immunother 2016 Apr 2;12(4):1027- 32 (DOI : 10.1080/21645515.2015.1120394 ) Chapter 7 108 Abstract In the Netherlands, people indicated for seasonal influenza vaccination are divided in three risk groups, i.e. those less than 60 years (y) with comorbidity and those 60y and over with and without comorbidity. Those risk groups were also eligible for pand emic vaccination during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic . We assess ed tolerability of seasonal i nfluenza vaccination and two doses of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine , adjuvanted with MF -59, administered 2 and 5 weeks after seasonal 2009- 2010 vaccin ation among adults. Vaccinees were asked to return questionnaires on local and systemic adverse events (AEs) after each of 3 consecutive vaccinations given at the office of their General Practitioner . Sex- and risk group -specific AE -frequencies wer e calculated. Generalized Linear Mixed Model w ith seasonal vaccination as reference was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for AEs of the two pandemic doses. 5553 questionnaires (3251 vaccinees) were returned. Vaccinees reported any local AE after season al vaccination and both pandemic doses in 34%, 23% and 18%, respectively. These percentages were 29%, 25% and 16% for any systemic AE. Men reported fewer local and systemic AEs then women (p<0.0001). The risk of local (OR range 0.34 -0.63) and systemic (OR range 0.39 -0.99) AEs (overall, stratified by risk group and by sex) was lower after both pandemic doses compared to seasonal vaccination. This decreased risk was more pronounced after the second pandemic dose than after the first. Therefore, we conclude that MF59 -adjuvanted pandemic vaccine given after seasonal vaccination was well tolerated . Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 109 7 Introduction Annual influenza epidemics occur worldwide, resulting in considerable morbidity, mortality and economic burden.1 Morbidity and mortality are generally associated with vulnerable populations at risk of complications of infection, like pneumonia .2-5 In 2009, the W orld Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic, caused by an Influenza A(H1N1) strain. In response, the Dutch Health Counc il advised that all people in the Netherlands, eligible for routine seasonal influenza vaccination should be offered vaccination against this pandemic strain.6 Several additional groups were defined for vaccination by their General Practitioner (GP), e.g. pregnant women in their second and third trimester and household members of high -risk patients . Health care workers were offered vaccination by their employers whereas children between 6 months and 5 years of age and household members of infants below 6 months of age could get the vaccinations from the municipal health services. 6 Given the urgency of availability , extensive information on tolerability of th ese new pand emic influenza vaccines lacked.7 At the time the vaccines became available, a stern public debate about its safety started worldwide. In the Netherlands, safety of pandemic vaccinations was monitored by passive surveillance and by several active questionnaire surveys. Here we report on the tolerability of the pandemic vaccine administered after the seasonal vaccination in the Netherlands among adults vaccinated at GP office . Results Response and demographics The o verall response rate was an estimated 40% with approximately 14,000 questionnaires distributed. No exact numbers distributed per predefined risk group are available , precluding calculation of category specific response rates. In tota l, 5553 questionnaires were returned by 3251 1591 (48.9%) vaccinees returned 2 or just 1 questionnaire, respectively (Table 1) . There was slight predominance (52.5 -54.3%) of female respondents, which is comparable to the sex distribution for the adult population in the Utrecht province (52% females) . Reported comorbidity varied by vaccination (69.7% -74.8%) . In less than 3% of the respondents, sex and comorbidity were unkno wn. Participants mean age for the three vaccinations varied between 63. 8y-65.2y. With respect to administered vaccine, women were statistically significantly younger than men (1.3y, 1.7y and 1.4y for the respective doses). Chapter 7 110 Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 111 7 Local Adverse Events Participants reported a significant higher proportion of any local AE (redness, swelling and /or pain at the injection site) f ollowing the seasonal influenza vac cination compared with both pandemic vaccine doses ( Table 2 ). For redness percentages were 17.9%, 4.9% and 3.6% for the respective doses, for swelling 17.3%, 5.1% and 3.9% and for pain at the injection site 28.9%, 20.9% and 17.2%. T he majority concerned reports of mild or moderate events . Over the 3 doses together , for redness 20% -28% of the reports concerned pronounced local AEs. Likewise, 18% -19% and 12%- 13% of reports on respectively swelling and pain were considered as pronounced . For any local AE the reported frequency in women was statistically significant higher than in men. Systemic Adverse Events Vaccinees reported at least one systemic AE in 29.4% (n=576), (n=535) and ns. L istlessness, fatigue , headache and myalgia were reported most frequently (Figure 1) . After seasonal vaccination, 4.5% (n= 88) of vaccinees reported fever, compared with 4.6% (n= 98) and 1.9% (n=28) following the first and second pandemic dose s, respecti vely. F or fever following seasonal vaccination, 51 participants (2.6%) reported a 'the highest temperature measured' . Twenty -five (1.3%) median 38.5 \u00b0C; range 38- 39.6 \u00b0C). For the first pandemic dose, 68 participan ts (3.2%) reported a highest temperature (41(1.9%) 38\u00b0C ; median 38.0 \u00b0C; range 38 - 40\u00b0C). For the second pandemic dose 11 (0.7%) out of 17 (1.2%) vaccinees reported a temperature 38\u00b0C (median 38.0 \u00b0C; range 38 -39\u00b0C). Proportions for all reported systemic AEs, except itch, were not statistically significantly different between the seasonal vaccination and the first pandemic dose. Proportions of reported fever, listlessness, fatigue , headache, dizziness and myalgia were all statistically significantly higher after the first pandemic dose than after de second pandemic dose. Frequencies of reported systemic AEs in women were higher than in men , for all 3 vaccinations except for rash after both pandemic doses. These differences were statistically significant except for fever and fainting (all doses), dizziness (seasonal vaccination and second pandemic dose), listlessness (first pandemic dose) and arthralgia (second pandemic dose). Risk Groups For all 3 vaccine doses , the risk group <60y with comorbidity showed higher frequenc ies of local and systemic AEs compared with both other risk groups 60y (Table 3 , Figure 2). This difference was statistically significant for any local AE, any Chapter 7 112 Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 113 7 Chapter 7 114 Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 115 7 Chapter 7 116 redness, any swelling, any pain, any systemic AE, fever, fatigue, headache, myalgia (all doses), grades of redness and swelling (seasonal vaccination), listlessness (seasonal vaccination and first pandemic dose), grades of pain, dizziness (both pandemic doses), arthralgia, itch (seasonal vaccination and second pandemic dose) and for fainting (second pandemic dose). Generalized Linear Mixed Model GLMM, with seasonal influenza vaccine set as reference, showed a decreased risk for local and systemic AEs for both pandemic doses, overall (adjusted for age) and for separate risk groups (adjusted for sex) (Table 4). These differences were statistically significant, except for systemic AEs in both risk groups 60y and the male stratum in the overall analysis . Table 4. Multivariable Generalized Linear Mixed Model analysis of the risk for local and systemic AEs after both pandemic doses with seasonal inf luenza vaccination set as reference, stratified by risk group Risk Groupsa 1st dose Focetria 2nd dose Focetria OR [95%CI] on comorbidity b: adjusted for sex c: adjusted for age AEs in respondents with three vs less than three questionnaires (data not shown) We found no statistically significant differences for any of the reported local AEs between the par ticipants who returned all three or fewer questionnaires (all p -values 0.1). However, vaccinees who returned all 3 questionnaire s, reported statistically significantly lower frequencies of any systemic AE after seasonal vaccination and the Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 117 7 second pande mic dose compared with those who filled in fewer questionnaires. Likewise, this holds for some specific systemic AEs. Regarding reported local and systemic AEs, in general no statistically significant differences were observed between risk groups with participants returning all three questionnaire s and risk groups returning fewer questionnaires . GLMM, for participants returning three questionnaires, also showed decreased risk s after both pandemic doses , but with the smaller numbers, more ORs were statistically non- significant (data not shown). Discussion We compared and presented observational tolerability data of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination, consecutively administered in late 2009. Data are partly cross - sectional, but 20% of participants provided tolerability data on all three vaccinations , offering the possibility of a cohort- based analysis. In general, results show lower frequencies of both local and systemic AEs following the two -dose pandemic vaccine compared with the seasonal influenza vaccine , although not all differences are statistically significant. In addition, women reported higher frequencies of AEs than men did and people <60y with comorbidity reported the highest frequencies of AEs compared to vaccinees 60y with and without comorbidity . We found higher proportions for pain a t the injection site as well as for systemic AEs compared with findings of Harmark et al . who also studied the tolerability of Focetria \u00ae 8 in the Netherlands . Harmark et al. used Dutch inhabitants in their survey who received their pandemic vaccinations through GPs . However, they did not restrict inclusion to people who were eligible for seasonal vaccination, as we did. However, coverage data show that most Dutch people eligible for the pandemic vaccination were also vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine . 9 This impl ies that most participa nts in Harmarks study pro bably also received seasonal influenza vaccine prior to the pandemic doses but they only assessed AEs after pandemic vaccinations. The differences found may be caused by inclusion of other groups, e.g. pregnant women and household members of high -risk pati ents, and by recall bias. Harmark et al. collected data between November 16, 2009 and March 3, 2010 and participants could register online within this entire period. However, nearly all GPs finished their pandemic vaccination campaigns before Christmas 200 9. In our study, questionnaires were handed out directly after immunization and we requested to send them back after one week. W e did find equal frequencies of local redness and swelling, possibly indicating that the source population in both surveys shows much resemblance. Chapter 7 118 Within the different risk groups, the proportion AEs was statistically significant higher in the <60y with comorbidity group compared with the other older age risk groups. A similar result was found in two other studies on tolerability of influenza vaccination and in a study on tolerability of Q -fever, all showing that the odds of AEs decrease with increasing age . 8, 10, 11 This decreasing risk for AEs with increasing age may be caused by immunosenescence and/or comorbidity or medication.12 Furthermore, the sex dependency of AEs we found is also found in the Q- fever study 11 and similar to the findings of Harmark et al..8 Several studies comparing MF59 adjuvanted vaccines with non -adjuvanted vaccines , have found that adjuvanted vaccine s resulted in slightly more AEs 2, 13 as is also known for other adjuvants . Interestingly however , we found lower rates of AEs after the pandemic doses compared with the non- adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines . Several explanations for these findings may be possible. F irst, the seasonal 2009 - 2010 influenza vaccine did contain a H1N1 strain, although it differed from the circulating pandemic H1N1 strain. P erhaps this influenc ed the reactions to the subsequent pandemic doses , because of some cross -immunity . A second exp lanation for our results could be that although an adjuvant was added to the pandemic vaccine , the low er amount of virus antigen may have resulted in fewer AEs. One pandemic dose contained 7.5 mcg virus antigen compared with in total 45 mcg virus in the se asonal influenza vaccines . Furthermore , the seasonal vaccine s contained three different influenza strains, which could trigger a stronger and broader response of the immune system by multiple epitopes and by interaction , resulting in more AEs. Finally, th ere is the possibility of assessment bias due to the decreasing attention for experienced AEs in booster doses. Strengths and Limitations Through our study we gained insight in the occurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after subsequent doses of different influenza vaccines. This resembles real life, because people eligible for seasonal influenza vaccination often also are eligible for pandemic vaccines. Data as in our study provide important information on within and between v ariance of the participants regarding the occurrence of AE FI. However, our study also has several limitations. We found lower frequencies of some systemic AEs between participants returning three questionnaires and participants, returning fewer, although most of the differences were non- significant. Therefore, we think this influence will be limited. However, questionnaire surveys on AEs are prone to selection bias, as participants tend to return the questionnaire only in case of AE -occurrence, usually resulting in an overestimation of frequencies. We also had to rely on self -reported comorbidity and AEs. Our classification was not validated by the GP, which could have led to misclassification. For comorbidity this is Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 119 7 probably non -differential, because co ding was performed independent of the knowledge on AEs. Therefore, we think the influence of misclassification regarding risk groups will be limited. However, differences in interpretation of solicited AEs could have influenced the frequencies found. Furt hermore, the respective risk groups could have different reply attitudes, influencing the results found. In addition, information on date and time of onset and duration of each AE contained a lot of missing values. Therefore, no analysis could be performe d on these variables and likelihood of causality could not be assessed. For local AEs a causal relation with the vaccination is highly likely. However, for systemic AE other coincidental influences could be the cause. Furthermore, we did not include an unv accinated control group and therefore, even reported systemic AE frequencies with a short lag time include the background rate. Our data could also be influenced by the so called 'healthy vaccinee' effect, i.e. people who are willing or able to come to the GPs office for a vaccination may be healthier than people who are not able to come. 14 This might influence the generalizability of our result s. However, we believe these frequencies are useful for monitoring variations in AE rates in the general population under real life circumstances and our questionnaire surveys are an appropriate method for surveillance purposes in view of costs and efficie ncy. Conclusion The MF59 -adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine was well tolerated with lower reported frequencies of local and systemic AEs compared with the prior seasonal influenza vaccination, administered two to five weeks earlier. A possible 'prim e- boost' relation with the seasonal influenza vaccine may explain the lower frequencies both of the first and second pandemic dose. As is seen in other vaccination campaigns women had higher rates of reported AE compared with men, as have younger people than the elder. Further research is necessary in understanding AEs after consecutive doses of influenza vaccine . Effective vaccination strategies and education are required to combat forthcoming influenza pandemics. Materials and m ethods Setting GPs located in the Utrecht province (n = 15) were approached by telephone to ask for cooperation . Five GP practices consented and participated, located in different districts and villages to address variation in degree of urbanization and socio- economic statu s. GPs organized the vaccinations mainly in mass vaccination sessions at their office. S easonal vaccin ation was given first, after 2 weeks followed by 2 Chapter 7 120 consecutive doses of pandemic vaccine , 3 weeks apart as stipulated in the guidelines.6 At each of these mass vaccination sessions, staff of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Contro l (Cib) of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) asked all vaccinees to participate in this tolerability survey when leaving the GP office. After consent , vaccine es were handed a questionnaire to fill in and return to CIb in a pre-stamped envelope. Thus, a participant could fill in 3 questionnaires, one for each vaccination. Besides a n oral reminder at the next vaccination rounds to send in all questionnaires, no reminders were sen t. People vaccinated on occasions other than at mass sessions were not recruited. Medical ethical approval of this study was not necessary because only questionnaire data were used and participants were not subjected to imposed rules or acts. Inclusion criteria Adults of 18 years (y) and older who received any of the influenza vaccination s at the GP could participate. The returned questionnaires were categorized in three study groups: people <60 y with comorbidity, those aged 60y with comorbidity and people aged 60y with out comorbidity. These three categories are in line with the Dutch General Practitioners Association (NHG) criteria for eligibility for seasonal influenza vaccination, based on the annual HC advice . Vaccines The two seasonal influenza vaccines, used in the Netherlands i n 2009, i.e. Vaxigrip\u00ae (split or thiomersal, given intramuscularly or subcutaneously . The composition vaccines were supplied in single -dose syringes. The pandemic vaccine, used by all G Ps was Focetria\u00ae (Novartis) and had 7.5 mcg influenza virus surface antigens of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) like virus per dose . The vaccine contained MF59C.1 as adjuvant. It was presented in multi- dose containers with thiomersal as preservative. The two -dose pandemic vaccination campaign started on November 2, 2009. The seasonal vaccination campaign started in the month before. The 2009 vaccination campaign ended before Christmas. All questionnaires were received before the end o f January 2010. Data Collection With the questionnaires information on age, sex, comorbidity, medication, vaccine type and dose number was acquired . In addition , information was collected on local adverse events (AEs) like redness, swelling and/or pain a t the injection site (4 categories to tick by the respondent: none, mild, moderate or pronounced ) and Tolerability of two doses of pandemic Influenza vaccine (Focetria\u00ae) and of a prior dose of seasonal 2009- 2010 Influenza vaccination in the Netherlands 121 7 systemic AEs, including fever, l ethargy, fatigue , headache, faint ing, dizziness, myalgia, arthralgia, rash and itch (yes/no). In case of fever, we asked f or the highest temperature measured and calculated the median temperature . For each local or systemic AE, additional information on the date and time of onset and the duration of each AE was asked, until one week after immunization. We computed 2 dichotomous (yes/no) variables for any reported local AE and any reported systemic AE, respectively. Statistics The proportions of reported local and systemic AEs were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), for each risk group and sex . For fever the m ean, median and range of the 'highest temperature measured' was determined. To check for selection bias, we used chi square test to assess differences in AE frequencies between groups who returned all three questionnaire s and fewer than three questionnaire s, stratified for the three vaccinations and risk groups . Data were also analyzed by means of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), to address dependency of data. Possible confounders studied were age, sex and comorbidity. Variables with s tatistically significant influence on the outcome were left in the multivariable model. To address possible selection bias, we performed the GLMM on participants, who returned all three questionnaires , similar to the above mentioned chi square test. P-valu es <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 and SAS 9.3. Chapter 7 122 References 1. Simonsen L.

Chapter 8 Safety of vaccination against Influenza A(H1N1) during pregnancy in the Netherlands: results on pregnancy outcomes and infant's health: cross sectional linkage study Nicoline BJOG 2015 (DOI: 10.1111/1471 -0528.13329) Chapter 8 124 Abstract Objective This study aims to assess the safety of H1N1 -vaccination, administered during the second and third trimester and containing MF59 and thiomersal (Focetria\u00ae), measured by pregnancy outcomes and infant's health. Design: Cross sectional linkage study. Settin g and sample: A sample of pregnant women, eligible for prenatal screening, were invited to participate. Methods Questionnaire data were linked with the Netherlands Perinatal Registry (n=1920). Information on infant's growth, development (n=1739) and inf ection -related contacts with the general practitioner (GP) during the first year of life (n=1671) was obtained. Main outcome measures: Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between H1N1 -vaccination and small -for-gestational age, preterm delivery and a composite adverse outcome, i.e. low Apgar -score, NICU -admission, neonatal resuscitation or perinatal death. I nfluence of maternal vaccination on growth, development and GP infection -related contact- rates were assessed using multivariate linear mixed modelling and multivariate negative binomial regression, respectively. Results Response rate was 21%. Though we f ound differences in characteristics between unvaccinated and vaccinated women, in the multivariate analyses no association was found between H1N1 -vaccination and small -for-gestational age delivery (OR 0.98; 95%CI adverse outcome (OR 0.84; 95%CI 0.44 We found no (incidence rate ratio 1.07; 95%CI 0.91 to 1.28) between infants of unvaccinated and vaccinated mothers. Conclusion Pregnancy outcomes did not differ between H1N1 -vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Furthermore, growth, development and GP infection -related contact- rates, assessed after the first year of life, were similar in offspring of vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers. Safety of vaccination against Influenza A(H1N1) during pregnancy in the Netherlands: results on pregnancy outcomes and infant's health: cross sectional linkage study 125 8 Introduction In spring 2009 an Influ enza A(H1N1) pandemic occurred. Influenza during pregnancy increases the risk of hospitalization due to respiratory complications, especially for women with comorbidity ( 1-3). Furthermore, during the 2009 pandemic, an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes after infection was reported ( 4-6). Therefore, the Dutch Health Council advised all pregnant women in the second and third trimester to be vaccinated ( 7). A was used. Until that moment, there were no universal vaccination programmes for healthy pregnant women in the Nether lands. In 2009, information on the safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy was scarce and merely based on non -adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. No safety signals were acknowledged in these studies, i.e. no serious adverse events, no differe nces in adverse pregnancy outcomes or infant hospital admissions, no excess of malformations or childhood malignancies ( 8-11). To date, several studies on the safety of adjuvanted influenza vaccines during pregnancy have been published. None showed an increased risk on adverse pregnancy outcomes (12-19). The majority of the studies concerned the effect of Pandemrix\u00ae, adjuvanted with ASO3. None of the studies included follow up of the offspring up to one year of age. The Centre for Infectious Disease Control of the Netherlands, part of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) monitored the determinants of acceptance, coverage and safety of the H1N1 -vaccination campaign among pregnant women. Data on acceptance and coverage have been reported previously (20). The current paper describes and discusses the safety of vaccination with Focetria\u00ae during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. To assess the possibl e impact of the vaccination, data on pregnancy outcomes and growth, development and infection -related contacts with the general practitioner (GP) of the infants up to 1 year of age were retrieved from three different sources and linked to data of a questionnaire survey. Methods and materials Study population and setting All pregnant women in the Netherlands are offered screening on infectious diseases, i.e. hepatitis B, syphilis and HIV, around the 12th week of pregnancy (in any case before the 15th week). The Centre for National population screening of RIVM is responsible for this screening programme. Department for Vaccine Supply and Prevention Programmes of RIVM is responsible for data management. Data are Chapter 8 126 registered in a nationwide database. A random sample of nearly 15,000 pregnant women, eligible for vaccination against Influenza A(H1N1) in November and December 2009 and known to the Department for Vaccine Supply and Prevention Programmes were asked to participate in a questionnaire study on determinan ts of acceptance and vaccine coverage ( 20). Women who were willing to participate in further research on safety were asked to fill out an additional questionnaire, to give permission to link to the Netherlands Perinatal Registry (PRN) ( 21) , to obtain information on growth and development of the infant from the child health care and to ask for infection -related contacts with the general practitioner (GP) during the first year of life. Due to higher risks on low birth weight and short gestational age, wome n with multiple births were excluded. Medical ethical approval of this study was not necessary because only routinely collected data were used and participants were not subjected to imposed rules or acts. All participants signed written informed consent for the respective study parts. Furthermore, the Board of the PRN approved the study. The latter included approval obtained upon assessment by a privacy commission. Data collection The Netherlands Perinatal Registry (PRN) is a joint effort of four professio nal organizations that provide perinatal care in the Netherlands: Royal Organization of Midwives in the Netherlands, National Organization of General Practitioners, Dutch Association of Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Paediatric Association of the Netherlands . PRN covers about 95% of all deliveries. Only pregnancies from 16 weeks onwards are registered in PRN, so information on early abortions is not available. Participating midwifes, obstetricians and GPs performing deliveries fill in predefined forms concerning a large number of variables for each birth. Data processing and -cleaning is performed in a systematic way to enhance comparability and enable trend analysis. Questionnaire data were linked to the database of midwifes, obstetricians and paediatricians from PRN based on date of birth of mother and child and four digits of postal code. In this way, forms were combined when multiple obstetric professionals were involved in the care process during pregnancy, delivery or the postpartum period. No other perso nal data were accessible to the researchers. Three dichotomous pregnancy outcomes were defined: 1. Small- for-gestational age, defined as a birth weight below the tenth percentile, adjusted for gestational age (GA) and based on Dutch averages ( 22). 2. Preterm delivery, i.e. birth before 37 weeks GA. 3. A composite indicator for other severe adverse outcomes, including at least one of the following: low Apgar -score (score < 7 at 5 minutes after delivery), admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), resuscitation of the new -born or perinatal death. Safety of vaccination against Influenza A(H1N1) during pregnancy in the Netherlands: results on pregnancy outcomes and infant's health: cross sectional linkage study 127 8 Growth and development of infants is monitored by Dutch child health care centres, for which attendance amounts to 99% ( 23). Growth is subdivided in length, weight and head circumference and recorded according to standardized graphs for Dutch children (24, 25). Development is measured by \"van Wiechen schedule\" with age specific milestones acc ording to the 90th percentile for Dutch children ( 26). Hereby five aspects are scored, i.e. fine and gross motor function, speech, language and psychosocial aspects. The scores on the developmental instrum ent were quantified using a developmental score (D -score), based on the Rasch model. A D -score enables a comparison of scores between persons and an evaluation of the developmental velocity within a child ( 27). Data about infection -related contacts of the children within their first year of life were collected through medical records of GPs. Nearly all people living in the Netherlands are registered wi th a GP. The medical records from GPs contain all relevant medical history, including prescriptions, laboratory results and secondary care information. For each child, we asked the GP for an excerpt including all contacts, i.e. telephone calls, consults at the office and house visits, during as well as outside working hours, related to temperature or fever, symptoms of an infection of one or more organ systems or prescriptions to treat infectious symptoms. The number of contacts were counted. Vaccine and vaccination Pregnant women eligible for vaccination could receive their vaccination at the GP practice. GPs offered these H1N1 -vaccinations free of charge from 9 November 2009 onwards. The H1N1- vaccination campaign was finished before Christmas, with only a few people vaccinated in 2010. A two- dose schedule was used with an interval of 3 weeks between the doses. The only vaccine used was Focetria\u00ae, delivered as multi- dose containers with thiomersal as a preservative, MF59C.1 as adjuvant and 7.5 micrograms influenza virus surface antigens of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) like virus per dose. In this study, vaccination status was self -reported. Covariates All but three covariates were retrieved from the self- reported questionnaires (see Table 1). Maternal problems (defined as abnormalities in general medical, gynaecological and obstetric history and obstetric problems during current pregnancy), birth weight and small- for-gestational age were retrieved from PRN -data. All covariates were chosen based on a plausible or known possible influence on the outcomes. Chapter 8 128 Statistical analysis Differences in characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated women were tested using Pear son's Chi Square or Fisher's exact test (for dichotomous and categorical variables) or student t- test (for continuous variables). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between H1N1- vaccination and the three defined a dverse pregnancy outcomes. To improve comparison of the models for the three outcomes, all models included the same set of possible confounders, i.e. year of birth, country of birth, educational level, self - reported use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs durin g pregnancy, parity, underlying medical condition as reason for vaccination, maternal problems, H1N1 -infection and philosophy of life, e.g. religion, anthroposophy. Associations are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The z-scores, i.e. standard deviation scores, for head circumference -for-age, length - for-age and weight- for-age were calculated using Dutch references ( 22). A z -score is compute d to determine the outcome of an individual in relation to reference measurements of a comparable population with the same age and sex. Z -scores were analysed using a linear mixed effect model, with random intercept and random slope for age. We compared z -scores between infants of vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers, and adjusted for birth weight, sex and number of previous pregnancies. Differences in D -scores between infants of vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers were assessed using a linear mixed effect m odel with random intercept and random slope for age, adjusted for educational level of the mother and whether or not the mother was born in the Netherlands. Counts of the total number of infection- related contacts in the first year of life, registered in t he medical record of the GP, were analysed using negative binomial regression, adjusted for educational level, country of birth of the mother and small - for-gestational age. Differences in contact rates were expressed as an incidence rate ratio (IRR). Befor e the study, we estimated that about 2,200 pregnant women had to be included to detect an increase in the prevalence of abnormal postnatal growth from 2.5% to 5%, measured through length and weight ( = 0.05, =0.20), based on an expected vaccination cove rage of 33% -50%. Hereby, abnormal growth is defined as length or weight below the 2.5 th percentile or above the 97.5th percentile compared to a reference group of Dutch infants of the same sex and age. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3, z -scores for growth were computed using R. In all analyses, a p -value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, unvaccinated mothers and their offspring were set as reference in all analyses. Safety of vaccination against Influenza A(H1N1) during pregnancy in the Netherlands: results on pregnancy outcomes and infant's health: cross sectional linkage study 129 8 Results Study population Twenty -one percen t of the 14,529 invited women participated in the coverage study, of whom 88% (n=2,672) were interested in further studies ( 20). In figure 1, the number of women in each step of the s tudy is presented. Finally, we could link data of 1,736 women (85.3% of the 2,034 who participated in this study) to the Netherlands Perinatal Registry (PRN), we obtained data on growth and development of 1,554 children (76.4%) and information on infection- related GP contacts of 1,435 children (70.6%).

Chapter 8 130 Vaccinated women were older than unvaccinated women, had a higher educational level, were more often multipara, more frequently had an underlying medical condition as reason for vaccination and less often reported a religious background or a specific life philosophy such as anthroposophy compared to unvaccinated women. (Table 1 ) There was no difference in country of birth, self -reported use of alcohol or drugs and self -reported smoking during pregnancy. Table 1.

They gave birth to 902 boys and 819 girls. Of 15 infants, the sex was unknown. No maternal deaths were reported. Logistic regression showed no association between H1N1 -vaccination and small for gestational age (SGA) (crude OR 0.81, adjusted OR 0.84; 95%CI 0.50 to 1.43). (Table 2) Likewise, no increased risk for preterm birth (crude OR 0.95, adjusted OR 0.98; 95%CI 0.59 to 1.62) nor for the composite outcome (crude OR 1.01, adjusted OR 0.86; 95%C I 0.46 to 1.64) was found. Growth and development We found no statistically significant difference in the z -score for weight- for-age between infants of unvaccinated and vaccinated mothers ( -0.05; 95%CI - 0.13 to +0.04), adjusted for sex, number of infants in the household and birth weight. This indicates that the weight of infants of vaccinated mothers and unvaccinated mothers is distributed similarly compared to a reference group of Dutch infants of the same age and sex. Similar results were found for length -for-age and head circumference -for- age (z -score -0.01 (95%CI - 0.09 to +0.06 and - 0.05 (95%CI - 0.13 to +0.03, respectively). Furthermore, we found no statistically significant differences in developmental -scores between infants of vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers ( -0.06; 95%CI - 0.28 to +0.17), adjusted for educational level and country of birth of the mother. Infection related GP contactsTotal number of GP contacts per infant in the first year of life ranged from 0 -29 (mean 3.4, median 3.0). (Figure 2) In total, 1336 and 3438 GP -contacts were reported for infants of unvaccinated women and vaccinated women, respectively. Acute (upper) airway infections were mentioned as reason for the GP- contact in 28% and 27% of the contacts of infants of unva ccinated and vaccinated mothers, respectively, followed by acute otitis media (9% and 10%), gastro- intestinal complaints (7% and 6%) and fever (7% and 5%). For other diseases, the percentages were lower. Sixty -two hospitalizations were documented. We found no significant difference in the proportion of infants having contact with their GP for infection -related symptoms between vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers. The incidence rate ratio was 1.07 (95%CI 0.91 to 1.28), adjusted for SGA and educational level and country of birth of the mother.

To our knowledge this is the first study about the safety of MF59 -adjuvanted H1N1 - vaccination, not only assessing pregnancy outcomes, but also the possible impact on the infant's health during the first year of life. We found no increased risk of MF59 - adjuvanted H1N1 -vaccination in the second and third trimester of pregnanc y on adverse pregnancy outcomes measured by preterm birth, small- for-gestational age and a composite outcome including rare but severe adverse outcomes. Furthermore, we found no negative impact on growth (i.e. head circumference, length and weight), develo pment and GP contacts for infection -related reasons during the first year of life. Strengths and limitations. This study has several strengths. Data collection and -entry were performed independent of the vaccination status. Data were merged with the orig inal questionnaire data after data entry in the respective study databases and only the original questionnaire contained information on self -reported maternal vaccination status. Furthermore, vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers were recruited simultaneous ly, so they were exposed to the same environmental influences, e.g. influenza infection. Due to the extensive questionnaire survey, we were able to adjust for several well - known confounders, e.g. smoking. Finally, PRN -data are cleaned and coded using stan dardized methods, resulting in good comparability of pregnancy outcomes. Several limitations must be acknowledged. The participants of this study were not fully representative of all Dutch pregnant women. In the first questionnaire survey on coverage and acceptance there was a low and selective response ( 20). Respondents were slightly older and less likely to have a due date in November 2009 compared to non- respondents. Furthermore, respondents were more frequently born in the Netherlands and had a higher educational level than assessed in nationwide surveys. Although we cannot exclude this may have affected our results, it is unlikely that any selective response would have had large impact on the association between H1N1 - vaccination during pregnancy and the studied outcomes, because our results are comparable with results of other studies, including a non -selective, nationwide cohort study, performed in Denmark ( 14-16, 19, 28, 29). Furthermore, our analysis of adverse pregnancy outcomes showed significant effects of several well -known risk factors with the outcome measures, e.g. smoking (data not shown). Finally, frequencies of preterm birth, support of pregnancy and de livery by midwife or gynaecologist in our study were comparable with results of the PRN -data in general, enclosing 95% of the pregnancies in the Netherlands ( 30). Likewise, the number of participants did not amount to the number, assessed in the sample size calculation, but we think a higher number of participants will not change Safety of vaccination against Influenza A(H1N1) during pregnancy in the Netherlands: results on pregnancy outcomes and infant's health: cross sectional linkage study 135 8 our conclusion, because our results are in line with results of other studies and frequencies of important variables are comparable with frequencies, found in other databases, as already mentioned above. Timing of vaccination could not be included as a possible confounder, because of the presence of unvaccinated women in our study. Stratif ying vaccinated women by trimester of vaccination and comparing each subset with the group of unvaccinated women would reduce the power of the study, so we decided not to do this. Our results are not generalizable to women, vaccinated in their first trimester, because in the Netherlands, only women in their second and third trimester were eligible for vaccination. The estimated coverage among pregnant women was 63% ( 20). In the subset of women, participating in the follow- up study on safety, 67% of the women reported to be vaccinated, i.e. an overrepresentation of vaccinated mothers. This might have influenced our results. However, we were able to adjust for a large number of possible confounders, so we think this influence will be limited. Misclassification due to mistakes in data entry can have influenced our results. However, this misclassification is probably non- differential, because during data collection and - entry the vaccination status of the participant was unknown. Furthermore, in the Netherlands, registries do not include a personal unique identifier. Therefore, linking of PRN - and questionnaire data was only possible based on date of birth of the mother and child, and posta l code. This might have led to inaccurate linking in case of identical linking variables in two or more records. This misclassification is probably non -differential, because information on vaccination status was unknown during linkage. Furthermore, we tri ed to prevent these inaccuracies by manually reviewing overlapping records and by also using infants' birth weight as a linking variable in these records, if the exact weight was available in the questionnaire data. The H1N1 -vaccination campaign was implemented during the pandemic. In fact, 66 pregnant women in our study reported to have had pandemic flu. In most cases, the exact date of onset was unknown and no laboratory confirmation was performed. Forty -eight of these women also reported H1N1 -vaccination. Analysis without the inclusion of these 66 women did not change our results (data not shown). Therefore, we think the influence of this was limited. Finally, the vaccination status was self -reported. The occurren ce of recall bias is possible when pregnant women were unaware of their vaccination status. However, we believe this risk is small, because there was strong debate about vaccination during pregnancy in our country. Chapter 8 136 Interpretation. Our results are in line with previous studies on the safety of adjuvanted H1N1 - vaccines, administered during pregnancy ( 14-16, 19, 28, 29). All these studies included at least low birt h weight, preterm birth or small -for-gestational age in their analysis, and in none of these studies, an increased risk on these outcomes following vaccination was found. Our results on infant's growth fit well to the findings of normal birth weight and normal duration of pregnancy after H1N1 -vaccination during pregnancy, because following intrauterine noxious exposure, abnormal postnatal growth may not occur without fetal growth impairment ( 31, 32). Furthermore, t he similar development of infants of vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers we found is consistent with the fact that no excess of congenital anomalies was found in any study ( 14, 19, 28, 29). Frequent or long -term hospitalization due to congenital anomalies may result in impaired (motor) development (33, 34). In these cases, often a catch up in development is seen after discharge. Furthermo re, some congenital anomalies and impaired development have a common aetiology, e.g. genetic syndromes, exposure to noxious agents, congenital brain anomalies ( 35-38). However, a normal development in the first year of life does not imply a normal development later in life ( 39). Conclusion Our study showed no increased risk for several adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant's health during the first year of life follow ing administration of an influenza A(H1N1) vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59 and preserved with thiomersal, during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. These findings are reassuring for public and professionals and may help the decision making process on maternal immunization in case of a new pandemic and possible other infectious diseases, which can be prevented by maternal vaccination. Further research regarding the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of maternal immunization is needed to further cover gaps in knowledge .

To interpret the occurrence of GBS after introduction of large scale immunization programmes, it is important to define recent background incidence rates (IRs) of GBS. We used a general practitioner electronic medical record database to assess age specific GBS IRs between 1996 and 2008 in the Netherlands. All possible GBS cases were manually reviewed. Validated incident cases were reviewed by a neurologist (BJ) for diagnostic certainty using the GBS case definition of the Brighton Collaboration (BC). In a population of 638,891 persons, we identified 23 validated incident GBS cases (mean age 46 year). IR was 1.14 per 100,000 person years (95%CI 0.67- 1.61) and was lower for people under 50 years (0.76; 95%CI 0.41- 1.32) compared with elderly of 50 years or older (1.80; 95%CI 0.98 -3.05). Only 6 cases fulfilled level 1 or 2 of diagnostic certainty of the BC case definition. IR of GBS increases with age. Since vaccina tions are often targeted at specific age groups, age specific rates should be used to monitor GBS observed versus expected rates after introduction of large scale vaccination programmes. . Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome: background incidence rates in the Netherlands 141 9 Introduction. Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) is a (sub)acute polyradiculoneuropathy.(1, 2) Already in 1978, diagnostic criteria for GBS were de veloped. (3) More recently, it became clear that the clinical spectrum of GBS wa s pathophysiologically diverse. (4) Nowadays, we know that the kind of preceding event and specific hos t factors seem to determine the form and severity of GBS. (5) Worldwide, the reported GBS incidence rates (IR) vary between 0.4 to 4 per 100,000, depending on age, sex, region, study methodologies and case ascertainment. (1, 2, 6- 8) Besides a known association with infections (9), vaccinations also have been suggested to increase the risk of GBS, although biological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. A sudden increase in cases was seen following a vaccination campaign against swine flu in 1976 in the USA. (10) More recently, an association between the quadrivalent Meninogococcal vaccine and GBS was postulated. (11) As in other countries, in the Netherlands, vaccination campaigns recently have been expanded, such as vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) for girls, broader age range for seasonal Influenza vaccination and vaccination against pandemic influenza virus. (12-14) Background incidence rates are important in signal detection, using observed versus expected analysis during a mass vaccination campaig n.(15, 16) Here we present age specific incidence rates of GBS in the Netherlands between 1996 and 2008. Furthermore, we classified the certainty of diagnosis by using the new GBS Brighton Collaboration case definition, which was developed to facilitate international comparison of GBS data in vaccinovigilance. (17) Methods and Materials. Setting The Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database is a longitudinal general practitioner (GP) research database, presently containing more than 1 million patient records from more than 400 GPs in the Netherlands. The patient population is representative of the Dutch population regarding sex and age, except for a slight under representation of the elderly population who move to nursing homes. (18-20) Nearly all people in the Netherlands are register ed with a GP from their date of birth onwards. The medical records from GPs contain all relevant medical history, including secondary care information. The electronic records of the patients in the IPCI database store anonymized information on demographics , signs and symptoms (using the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) codes and narratives), diagnosis (ICPC and narratives), clinical findings, specialist referrals, laboratory results, Chapter 9 142 hospitalizations, and drug prescriptions. (18) Summaries of hospital discharge letters and letters from specialists are entered as free text and hard copies of original letters can be provided upon request. (19) Each patient in the database has a unique code, containing spec ific patient information, encrypted in a standardized way. Therefore, double counting of cases can be checked and corrected for. The IPCI database complies with the European Union guidelines on the use of medical data for medical research and has been prov en valid for (pharmaco) -epidemiological studies. (20) The Scientific and Ethical Advisory Group of the IPCI database approved the study. Study population The total study population comprised all persons in the IPCI database between January 1996 and April 2008. To have sufficient background morbidity information on all subjects, the GP practice had to be contributing data to the IPCI database for at least 1 year and the patient had to be registered with the GP for at least 1 year. Follow - up started on January 1996 or on the date that 1 year of valid history was a vailable. Follow -up ended on the date the person transferred out of the practice, on the date of last data supply by the GP, death, diagnosis of GBS, or April 2008. Case ascertainment Cases of GBS were identified in the IPCI database using an extensive c omputerized database search including a list of disorders regarded as GBS variants or with similar symptoms as GBS. See Table 1 for a complete list of search criteria and Fig. 1 for an overview of the case identification process. Table 1: search criteria for Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, \"GBS\" chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, neuropathy, AMSAN We first carried out a broad electronic narrative search, using GBS search criteria, to find potential cases (step 1). In a first validation (step 2 fig. 1), the full electronic medical record of all records with one or more GBS search criteria was manually reviewed in order to eliminate obvious non- cases and to classify cases as either incident or prevalent case. If the first Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome: background incidence rates in the Netherlands 143 9 diagnosis occurred after th e start of follow -up time of that person, this case was defined as incident. Patients with a diagnosis of GBS prior to study entry were classified as prevalent. Furthermore, incident cases were divided in true and possible cases. Cases were considered as t rue cases if the electronic medical record stated that GBS was confirmed by a neurologist. Cases were defined as possible if a differential diagnosis of GBS was made by the GP or a neurologist, but no final diagnosis had been made. A second validation (st ep 3 fig. 1) was carried out on all true and possible incident cases. A short questionnaire was sent to the GPs together with a request to supply copies of specialist letters. The questionnaire was used to confirm the diagnosis of GBS and the date of onset of weakness or other neurological deficits as a first manifestation of GBS. Furthermore, information on infections, vaccinations or drug prescriptions within 6 weeks prior to GBS was requested. Information from discharge letters was used to establish the nadir severity of disease, using the frequently used GBS disability score (legend Table 2). (21) Brighton Collaboration (BC) case definitions. In 2009 the Brighton Collaboration (BC) GBS Working Group developed a standardized case definition for (variants of) GBS as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). (17) The case definition contains three levels of diagnostic certainty. Ideally, information is collected during hospitalization. Information regarding the onset of muscle weakness, deep tendon reflexes, nadir of symptoms, illness pattern, electrophysiological findings and cerebrospinal fluid analysis is required to fully classify the level of diagnostic certainty for GBS cases. For classification of Mill er-Fisher syndrome (MFS), additional information on the presence of ophthalmoparesis and ataxia is required. In epidemiological studies case classification is often done retrospectively. In this study we used information in the electronic medical record, the GP -questionnaire and the specialist letter to assess the BC classification retrospectively, acknowledging the fact that the information for appropriate assessment (e.g. test results of specialist) may not be available in medical records or discharge let ters. This classification was performed by an expert neurologist (BJ) to ensure the most reliable interpretation of all available medical information. Chapter 9 144 Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome: background incidence rates in the Netherlands 145 9 Statistical analysis Incidence rates (IR) of GBS were calculated by dividing the total number of incident cases by the total number of person years (py) at risk of the study population. Rates were calculated per calendar year and calendar month, by sex and age. To better study seasonality we grouped months into seasons: winter including December -Febr uary, spring including March -May, summer including June -August and fall including September -November. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were based on the Poisson distribution. Some GPs could not retrieve the decoded patient identifier anymore because they had changed practice software system. Both the cases and the source population of the GPs that could not provide additional information were excluded from the primary analysis. A secondary sensitivity analysis was done in the total population by including possible and true incident GBS cases and the source population of the GPs that could not provide data for a maximum scenario. The expected absolute number of GBS cases in the Dutch population was calculated using age specific rates and the age distributio n of the Dutch population (www.statline.nl). Results Study population The source population for the study comprised 191 GP practices, including 638,891 patients, contributing a total follow up time of 2,328,655 py (mean 3.65 py, range 0.003- 11.0 py). Wit hin this population, the broad narrative search revealed 1592 records with a match in the GBS search criteria. After the first manual review of the full electronic medical record of all the potential patients, using symptoms, diagnoses and specialist refer rals, we retained 170 potential GBS cases. Of those cases, 99 were prevalent and 71 were classified as true (n=41) or possible (n=30) incident cases. For 21 out of these 71 cases, i.e. 14 true and 7 possible cases, the GPs could not be contacted as they sw itched GP information system or stopped their practice. For the remaining 50 cases (70%) the GP could be contacted, covering a source population of 578,117 patients. For 47 of the 50 cases additional information was received. For 23 of the 47 documented c ases the GP confirmed the diagnosis of GBS (n=21) or MFS (n=2) in nearly all cases supported by neurologist letters (true incident cases). This implies a positive predictive value (PPV) of 49% (95%CI 35% -63%) for GBS identification based on the manual rev iew of the electronic medical record only. For the 24 other cases, GBS was not confirmed since symptoms were very mild and disappeared spontaneously (n=3), GBS diagnosis was rejected or alternative diagnosis was made (n=9) based on additional laboratory in vestigation or consultancy of a neurologist. In 10 cases information on the correct diagnosis was missing, but it was definitely no GBS, in one case the GP used the GBS code inadvertently and one case was lost to follow up (Fig. 1). Chapter 9 146 The mean age of the 23 true incident cases was 46 years (median 51; range 3 -75 years) and 30% was male. A preceding infection or vaccination was recorded in 70% and 6%, respectively. The mean duration of hospitalization was 19.3 days (median 17; range 7 -36 days) and the mean tim e of follow up after diagnosis was 280 days (median 106, range 7- 1,026 days). Intravenous immunoglobulins were administered to 88% of the patients. No patient underwent plasmapheresis. Four patients needed mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Minor sequelae or signs of neuropathy were present in 76%. One patient died. Two patients (9%) had a second episode of GBS, with the second episode following 8 months and 3 years after the first onset- date, respectively (Table 2) Table 2: Characteristics of 23 true incident cases with Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Characteristic absolute numbers (%) or mean (median; range) Na Mean age in years 46 (51; 3 -75) 23 Male (%) 7 (30%) 23 Mean hospital stay in days 19.3 (17; 7 -36) 14 Receiving intravenous gamma globulins 14 (88%) 16 Treated with plasmapheresis 0 (0%) 19 Need of mechanical ventilation during hospitalization 4 (21%) 19 Mean time of follow up in days 280 (106; 7 -1026) 17 GBS disability scoreb =0 1 (5.9%) 17 GBS disability scoreb = 1 13 (76.5%) 17 GBS disability scoreb = 3 2 (11.8%) 17 GBS disability scoreb = 6 1 (5.9%) 17 GBS relapse 2 (9%) 23 infection within 6 wk prior to GBS 16 (70%) 23 vaccination within 6 wk prior to GBS 1 (6%) 17 a= number of patients for whom information was available b= GBS disability score: 0= healthy state; 1= minor symptoms or signs of neuropathy but capable of manual work/running; 2= able to walk without support of a stick (5 m across an open space) but incapable of manual work / running; 3= able to walk with a stic k, appliance or support (5 m across an open space); 4= confined to bed or chair bound; 5= requiring assisted ventilation for at least part of the day; 6=dead. Applying the GBS Brighton Collaboration case definition rules on information from the GP medical records, questionnaire and discharge letters showed that only three cases fulfilled criteria for level 1 of diagnostic certainty, three cases were classified as level Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome: background incidence rates in the Netherlands 147 9 2. For the remaining 17 true incident cases, the electronic medical record, specialist letter and questionnaire contained insufficient information to score the BC level appropriately or meet the minimal criteria for GBS according to the BC classification scheme (Fig 1). Incidence rates The incidence rate (IR) based on the 23 true incident cases in the primary study population was 1.14 per 100,000 py (95%CI 0.67- 1.61). The IR based only on the first validation step in the electronic medical record, containing 71 possible and true incident c ases (i.e. not considering additional information from the GP) was 3.05 per 100,000 py (95%CI 2.34 -3.41). Taking into account the positive predictive value of 49% the IR in the entire population would be 1.49 per 100,000 py (Table 3).

The IR for people < 50 years of age was significantly lower (0.76; 95%C I 0.41 -1.32) compared with elderly of 50 years or older (1.80; 95%CI 0.98 -3.05) (Table 3). We found no significant differences in age - and calendar year specific IR between men and women. No trend was found in IRs over the different calendar years in the primary and total study population (considering 71 possible and true incident cases). Seasonal changes could only be studied in the total population: rates seemed highest in spring (IR: 3.8; 95%CI 2.2- and lowest 1.3 -3.8) (Fig. 2). Extrapolation to absolute number of cases in the Netherlands Based on the age specific GBS rates in the primary study population translated to that of the Dutch population, the absolute number of GBS cases, expected in one year, would be 166 -186 (95 %CI 0 -394) in the Netherlands.( www.statline.nl ). Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome: background incidence rates in the Netherlands 149 9 Figure 2: seasonal incidence rates of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (autumn containing September -November, winter December -February, spring March -May, summer Jun e- August) Discussion The main finding of this study is that the incidence rate of GBS did not change over the years in the Netherlands: in our study the incidence rates based on validated cases was estimated at 1.14 per 100,000 py (95%CI 0.67- 1.61) du ring 1996 -2008, which is very similar to the rate from a previous Dutch study, covering the 10 years prior to our study (1987- 1996) and based on hospitalization records (IR 1.18 per 100,000; 95%CI 1.08 -1.29). (3, 8) Neither of the studies found a change in IR over the calendar years within their study period, further strengthening the suggestion that the rate is rather constant over the past 20 years in the Netherlands. This finding is important as 0,001,002,003,004,005,006,00 aut umn win t er spring summerincidence rate per 100,000 pyinc:100,000 95%CI upper limit 95%CI lower limitChapter 9 150 it allows historic rates to be used for calculations of the expected number of cases. For the Netherlands it means that we could expect around 190 cases of G BS yearly. Furthermore, these age- specific rates can be used to calculate the expected rates of GBS cases if mass vaccination is targeted at predefined age groups. A secondary finding of this study is the low positive predictive value (49%) in recorded di agnoses of GBS in electronic medical records. Electronic health care databases are frequently used to estimate background rates of disease and cross reference with GPs and treating physicians cannot always be done. (15) Our low positive predictive value, based on review of electronic medical records from GPs shows that for trustworthy background rates, additional information needs to be collected either through specialist letters or preferably by chart review in the hospital. Rates based on non -validated cases may lead to overestimations (21, 22) and reduce the usefulness of these rates for observed vs. expected analysis. The rate we found is comparable with the results of other international studies. Hughes et al. (1997) found a mean IR of 1.3 per 100,000 persons, based on 35 identified series of GBS patients, published before 1997. (2) A recent review (2009) of the epidemiology of GBS, comprising 63 studies, performed in Europe and North America, most of which covering time periods between 1980 and 2000, reported rates between 0.84 and 1.91 per 100,000py. (22) The clinical characteristics of the GBS patients included in our study were also comparable with those reported in previous studies, as reviewed by Hughes and McGrogan. (2, 22) The Dutch study on GBS during 1987- 1996 was part of both reviews. (8) In our study, 73% of the cases had a preceding infection, whereas McGrogan reports 40% -70%. In line with McGrogan (22) , we found no strong seasonal pattern of GBS rate in the total study population. In contrast, Koningsveld et al. found a more pronounced seasonal preponderance over 1987 -1999 in Cura\u00e7ao, possibly related to an increase in Campylobacter jejuni infections .(23) Furthermore, nearly 90% of our cases received intravenous immunoglobulins, implicating that especially severe cases were included in our study. A third important finding of the current study is that the validated cases were all diagnosed as G BS or MFS by a neurologist, but in 70% of the cases the additional information (often discharge letter) was insufficient to meet at least level 3 classification of diagnostic certainty of the BC case definition. This is mostly explained by insufficient detail in the discharge letter. To meet the BC case definition level 3 or better it is necessary to value changing symptoms during the course of the disease, which is usually not fully recorded in medical files and letters. This means that the BC criteria which are meant to allow for international harmonization of case definitions are less suitable for retrospective validation and classification of cases obtained from healthcare databases even if additional validation information is obtained. (24) Given the usefulness of healthcare databases to rapidly estimate background rates of events of potential interest and the importance of standardizing case classification such as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome: background incidence rates in the Netherlands 151 9 the one for GBS, the BC might want to consider creating a separate classification for this type of research. The incidence ra te distribution increases with age. Some age categories are also considered to have a higher risk for infectious diseases and are often vaccinated according to a population based immunization programme. Just recently, Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion reported a rate ratio of 1.77 (95%CI 1.12 -2.56) for GBS following Influenza A(H1N1) vaccination compared with non -vaccinees. (25) Furthermore, in the years 2006 -2009, analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) showed a higher reporting rate of GBS after the administration of quadrivalent HPV vaccine than that of the general population. (26) Assessi ng GBS age specific baseline incidence rates is important to address an increase in GBS reports following immunizations properly. Low incidence rates stress the importance for international collaboration in order to detect a much smaller increase timely. Being retrospective and observational in nature, our study has certain limitations. The incidence rate of elderly people living in nursery homes might be underestimated due to a slightly under representation in the medical record database used in this study . However, the incidence rate for people older than 70 years found in our study is comparable with corresponding age specific incidence rates of several studies, as shown in the review of McGrogan et al.. (22) Using prede fined search criteria, true cases may be missed, resulting in underestimation. To prevent this, we applied a broad search algorithm to capture all potential cases. Since our incidence estimate is well in range with other, much larger studies, we believe th at false negatives are of minor importance in this study. Validation through additional information requested to the GP, decreased the influence of false positives. However, for a large number of cases we were unable to obtain further information anymore s ince the GP had changed medical record keeping software and could not decrypt our patient identifier anymore. To avoid underestimation of the rates both the cases as well as the source population of these GPs were not considered. In conclusion, our study showed a stable GBS incidence rate of 1.14 per 100,00 py (95%CI 0.67- 1.16) in the Netherlands for the period 1996 -2008, increasing with age, using validated data of a GP medical record database. Assessing GBS age specific baseline IRs is important to addre ss an increase in GBS reports following immunization properly, especially if the targeted population has age restrictions.

Chapter 10 Incidence of multiple sclerosis in the general population in The Netherlands, 1996 -2008 Merlijn A. Kramer Nicoline A.T van der Maas Eva 10.1159/000338678) Chapter 10 154 Abstract Background We estimated the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) incidence in The Netherlands for better active monitoring of potential vaccine safety signals. Methods A retrospective cohort study (1996 -2008) was conducted using a population -based general practice research database containing electronic medical records. Additional information was collected to validate incident probable ca ses. Results In the source population (648,656 persons), 146 incident probable MS cases were identified. Overall incidence rate was 6.3/100,000 person years (py; 95%CI 5.2- 7.2). In the sub -group in which MS could be fully validated, the incidence increased from 4/100,000 py (95%CI 3- 5) in 1996- 2004 to 9/100,000 py in 2007/8 (95%CI 6 -16). This increase was highest among women, but not statistical significant different by gender. Th e median lag time between first recorded symptoms and MS diagnosis decreased from 32 months (<1998) to 2 months (> 2005). Conclusion s MS is rare in The Netherlands. In recent years, there was a slight increase in the incidence especially among women during the fertile age. This increase coincided with a decrease in lag time between symptoms and diagnosis, both for men and women. This trend should be taken into account in the interpretation of MS cases occurring in a population where new vaccinations will be introduced shortly. Incidence of multiple sclerosis in the general population in The Netherlands, 1996 -2008 155 10 Introduction Mul tiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system manifesting with signs of multiple neurological dysfunctions, e.g. loss of vision, tingl ing/numbness, and limb weakness [1]. The onset of disease is mostly between 20 -45 years of age [2,3] . The European incidence rate (IR) of MS was estimated at 4.3 cases per 100,000 per year [4] and 20 years ago (1995 -1990) at 3.0 per 100.000 for The Netherlands [5]. There is a heavy debate i n the literature about the potential association between vaccinations and occurrence of autoimmune diseases, amongst which MS [6 -10]. One of the suspected links which have been claimed is between MS and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination. In one study, increase d onset of MS symptoms within 3 years of HBV vaccination was observed compared to unvaccinated controls [11] . Earlier and subsequent studies as well as a systematic review failed to support this association, although some studies had methodological and power issues [12-18]. To be able to conduct observed/expected analysis and to judge possible changes in MS incidence over time in particular in association with changes in vaccination programmes (i.e. universal HBV vaccination [18], vaccination against hu man papillomavirus [19] and pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) ) we aimed to re -estimate the incidence of MS. Methods The Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database is a longitudinal general practitioner research database. Data collection started in 1996 a nd presently contains more than 800,000 patient lives originating from more than 400 general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands [20,21] . The patient population is representative of the Dutch population regarding age and sex. In the Dutch health care sy stem, almost all citizens are registered in a GP practice. A GP acts as a gatekeeper to, and as a central receiver of information from secondary care. Therefore, patients' medical records at the GP are likely to contain all relevant medical information. El ectronic records of the patients in IPCI database comprise anonymized information on demographics, signs and symptoms (using the International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) codes and narratives), diagnoses (ICPC and narratives), clinical findings, specialist referrals, laboratory results, hospitalizations, and drug prescriptions. Summaries of letters from specialists are entered as free text and hard copies of original lette rs can be provided upon request [20] . The IPCI database complies with the E uropean Union guidelines on the use of medical data for medical research and has been proven valid for (pharmaco) -epidemiological studies [22] . The Scientific and Ethical Advisory Group of the IPCI project approved the study. Chapter 10 156 Study population The total study population comprised of all persons with a patient record in the IPCI database between January 1996 and April 2008, who had at least one year of valid database history (i.e. GP practice contributed data to IPCI database for at least 1 year and the pati ent was registered with the GP for at least 1 year). This history was required to have sufficient background information on all subjects. Follow -up started on January 1996 or on the date that 1 year of valid history was available, whichever date was latest . Follow -up was terminated at the earliest of the following dates: when the person transferred out of the practice, the date of last data supply by the GP, death or MS diagnosis. Case definition MS cases were identified through multiple steps. The first step was an extensive computerized database search for codes and narratives pointing to MS, including a list of disorders with similar symptoms as MS (i.e. encephalomyelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, optic neuritis, myelitis transversa).(available on request) In the second step, complete electronic medical records of potential cases were manually reviewed in order to eliminate obvious non -cases and to pre -classify patients as prevalent or incident and as probable or possible. A patient with a MS diagn osis prior to study entry was classified as a prevalent MS case and was excluded from further analyses. When the first symptoms started after start of follow -up time of that person, this was defined as an incident case. Incident cases were considered as probable if the record stated that the patient had MS and this diagnosis was confirmed by a neurologist. A case was defined as possible if a differential MS diagnosis was made by the GP or neurologist, but no final diagnosis had been made yet. Possible cases were not included in final analysis. In the third step a short questionnaire was administered to GPs that could still be contacted in order to assess whether a probable incident case was truly an incident case. The questionnaire was used to confirm the MS diagnosis and to obtain the (date of) first symptoms of MS. To assess the latter, GPs could choose between the symptoms 'change of sensation', 'weakness of the limbs', 'visual disturbance' or 'unknown'. GPs could fill in other symptoms as free text also. When a symptom was mentioned, the date of onset was requested. Additionally copies of all specialist letters related to MS were requested. These letters provided information about the medical history of the patient, the date of MS diagnosis and physical examination. Incidence of multiple sclerosis in the general population in The Netherlands, 1996 -2008 157 10 Statistical analysis The MS incidence was calculated by dividing the total number of probable MS cases by the total number of person years at risk (py ) in the source population. Incidence rates were calculated by calendar year, sex and age. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals ( 95% CI) were based on a Poisson distribution. The incidence was calculated in the total study population (maximum estimate o f MS incidence) as well as in the sub-population of patients registered at practices from which additional information could be obtained. Moreover, we standardized rates by sex and age using the 2002 population for The Netherlands. We tested for a trend in the incidence ratio for males and females separately by fitting a piecewise Poisson regression model. Next, a piecewise Poisson regression model that included both sex and trend was fitted and another model that additionally included an interaction betwee n both. Trend and age analyses were all conducted in the restricted (validated) population only. Results Study population The dynamic study population consisted of 648,656 patients who contributed a total of 2,344,724 py of follow up during the study per iod (mean 3.6 years per person). Within this study population, 796 potential MS cases were identified. After review of the electronic medical records (i.e. the second validation step), 547 cases were classified as prevalent cases, 146 as incident probable cases and 103 as incident possible cases (Figure 1). In 159 practices (source population 511265 patients) with a total of 92 probable incident MS cases, additional information on the (date of onset of) first symptoms and specialist letters could be requested from the GP. Of the 92 probable incident cases, 84 (91%, i.e. positive predictive value) were confirmed as definite incident MS cases, i.e. 'restricted' population. Eight cases were not confirmed by the GPs as incident MS cases, 1 case was found to be a prevalent case, 4 cases were eventually not diagnosed with MS and 3 were classified as possible MS case. The median age at diagnosis for incident cases in both the total (n=146) and the restricted population (n=84) was 39 years (interquartile range (IQR) 33- 49 years). Respectively 73% and 79% of cases in the total and the restricted population were females. According to the additional information provided by GPs, patients were diagnosed with MS by a specialist with a median of 6 months (range 0 months - 18 years) after they consulted their GP with MS symptoms. The median lag time between the first visit to the GP with MS symptoms and MS diagnosis decreased over time from 32 months (0 months - 18 years) in the period before 1998 to 2 months (0 -20 months) in the period after 2005 both for males and females. Changes in sensation (39%), weakness of the limbs (30%) and visual disturbance (22%) are symptoms related to MS for which most patients visited their GP the first time. Chapter 10 158 Incidence In the total study population, which includes probable incident cases for whom no additional information was available, the incidence rate (IR) was 6.3 per 100,000 py (95%CI 5.2- 7.2; Table 1 - Total population). The overall age -sex standardized IR of MS based on confirmed cases by the GP and specialist letters was 4.8 per 100,000 py (95%CI 3.9- 6.0; Table 1 - Restricted population). The IR of MS in the restricted population was around 4 per 100,000 py between 1996 and 2005 (Figure 2). After 2005, the IR of MS slowly increased to 9 per 100,000 py in 2007/8. We found a statistically significant increase in the MS incidence over the period 2005 -2008 (6.4 per 100,00 py, 95%CI 4.7 -8.9) compared to the preceding study period (4.0 per 100,000 py, 95%CI 3.0 -5.3). Incidence of multiple sclerosis in the general population in The Netherlands, 1996 -2008 159 10 The incidence rate was higher among women (7.5 per 100,000 py, 95%CI 5.9- 9.6) than men (2.1 per 100,000 py, 95%CI 1.3 -3.3) (Figure 3). For males no significant increasing trend after 2005 was found (p- value= 0.62), while for females a significant increase in the trend of the incidence was present (p -value = 0.0026). However, a likelihood ratio test showed that there was no significant difference in trends between males and females (p -value = 0.38). Differences between sexes were observed for the age at dia gnosis. For women, a peak in the MS incidence was shown in the age group 30-39 years. For men, only a small peak could be observed for those aged 50 -59 years (Figure 4, Table 1). Chapter 10 160 Incidence of multiple sclerosis in the general population in The Netherlands, 1996 -2008 161 10 Chapter 10 162 Discussion This paper shows that during 1996 -2005, the MS incidence in our study population was approximately 4 per 100,000 py. From 2005 onwards, the incidence has gradually increased to 9 per 100,000 py in 2007/8. The incidence rate was three times higher for women than for men, but there was no significant difference by gender in the overall incidence trend. The results of our study show a higher MS incidence (4.8 per 100,000 py, 95%CI 3.9 -6.0) than previously reported in The Netherlands (3.0 per 100,000).[5] Howev er, the earlier estimate was based on the period 1985 -1990 and was conducted in a small region of The Netherlands. As MS incidence changes by latitudes, the incidence rate for The Netherlands should only be compared with rates of surrounding regions with comparable latitudes (52 0N), e.g. the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany. Alonso et al. found a crude incidence rate of 5.5 cases per 100,000 py (95%CI 5.1 -5.9) for the entire population in the UK (1993 -2000) [23]. For Germany, an annual incidence of 8.0 per 100,000 py (95%CI 6.4 -10.0) was reported for the period 1998 -2002 [24] . Other study results from surrounding regions are limited to Nordic countries [25 -27], whereby the study of Grytten et al [25] showed an increasing incidence (1953 -1997) to 6 per 100,00 0 py (95%CI 5.0- 7.2) in 1993 to 1997. An explanation for the increasing MS incidence may be changes in diagnostic criteria (availability of MRI and CSF analysis), diagnostic awareness in the public health service system and an increasing proportion of people with only minor symptoms and signs diagnosed with MS. More rapid diagnosis due to the availability of MRI and changing criteria for MS diagnosis was reflected by a steady decline in the delay between onset of symptoms and actual diagnosis for both men and women. The median interval between date of first symptoms and assessment by a neurologist declined from 32 months in the period before 1998 to only 2 months for the period after 2005. The range in diagnostic delay also decreased over time, although the broad range in diagnostic delay (0 -20 months in the period 2005 -2008) is still indicative of the often insidious onset and slow progression of several cases. If MRI availability and/or diagnostic awareness caused the observed increase, then the incidence rate would stabilize or might decrease in the coming years. Other explanatory factors for an increasing MS incidence are largely unknown but changes in environmental factors have been suggested [28,29] . In line with our study, several other studies reporte d that the increasing MS incidence was mostly attributable to an increase among women [23,25,27,30- 34]. Solid evidence for the shift in F:M sex ratio is yet unknown but perhaps changing lifestyle factors among women, e.g. increased smoking, use of oral contraceptives, changing roles of women in workforce, dietary habits and timing in childbearing years may play a role [32] . In some countries the increase started several decades ago or has already stabilized. In our study, which covered a 13 -year period, an increasing difference in MS incidence for men and women was only visible over the Incidence of multiple sclerosis in the general population in The Netherlands, 1996 -2008 163 10 past five years, but the difference in trends between males and females was not statistically significant. For women, the highest incidence was observed in the age group 30 -39 years, while for men no well -defined peak in the incidence was shown. Almost identical patterns in MS incidences by age were observed for both men and women in the UK and France [23,30] . In the UK however, the incidence for women peaked in the 40 -44 age group [23] . A Canadian and US study found similar patterns in women, but not in men (peak incidence in 25 -34 and 45- 54 age group respectively) [35,36] . A Norwegian study found a peak incidence for both men and women in the age group 50 -59 years [25]. The relatively smaller size of the population under 10 years of age and the slow progression of disease might explain why we did not observe any young MS cases. It seems rather difficult to diagnose children with MS. Vague symptoms such as fatigue, tinglin gs, blurred vision with one eye and clumsy locomotion are not well understood by parents and not mentioned by children [37]. As this is a retrospective and observational study, certain limitations should be mentioned. Misclassification can be introduced b y using computerized medical records. Since MS is often difficult to diagnose, cases who are not (yet) diagnosed with MS by a specialist will not be identified as potential cases. Our estimates may be an underestimation of the true MS incidence. The reliab ility of our observed rates is however supported by similar results from other studies and there is no reason to believe that the degree of underestimation has changed over time. To decrease the inclusion of false positives, additional information was requ ested from the GP; however this was not available for all patients, since some GPs had changed information system and could not de -crypt the patient code anymore. Restricting the analyses to only those for whom additional information was received from thei r GP did not change the observed trend of MS over the past years. Our MS incidence estimates were based on small numbers resulting in broad confidence intervals. The relatively wide confidence intervals for the years 1996 and 2008 were due to the low numbe r of person- years by left censoring in 1996 (early stage of the IPCI database) and a high degree of right censoring in 2008 (data available until April 2008). Conclusions Insight into the background incidence rates of autoimmune diseases prior to vaccine introduction is a crucial part of the assessment of possible vaccine safety concerns. Background rates provide information about the expected number of events in the absence of vaccination. In our study the upper confidence limit of the observed incidence rate by age could be used to calculate the expected number of cases per age group. If vaccination of a particular (age) group is more likely to be perceived as a Chapter 10 164 trigger (i.e. exacerbation of an underlying silent autoimmune process) or a cause, this will b e reflected by an increase in the MS incidence in this (age) group. Signal detection may be done based on observed and expected ratios.[38] The assessment in this study of the age and gender specific background MS incidence will improve safety monitoring after recently or new introduction of vaccines.

Demogra phic and epidemiological data were used for statistical regression analysis. Seroprevalence in the NS was 94.6% (type 1), 91.8% (type 2) and 84.0% (type 3). Infants (0 -7 months -old) had 80% seroprevalence for all serotypes. The highest seroprevalence was found in children, with type 1 and type 2 in five year -olds and type 3 in nine to 10 year -olds. In the LVC group, orthodox protestants, many of whom refuse vaccination, showed seroprevalence rates of 64.9% (type 1), 61.0% (type 2) and 62.1% (type 3). In th e NS group, non -Western immigrants and travellers to non - European continents had higher seroprevalences compared to Western immigrants and travellers within Europe, respectively. The Dutch National Immunisation Programme against poliomyelitis has provided good seroprotection, with high and long -lasting GMTs against all serotypes upon completion. The unvaccinated population remains at risk. Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 169 11 Introduction Poliomyelitis is a severe infectious disease caused by poliovirus, an enterovirus with three serotypes (types 1, 2 and 3). In 90 -95% of cases, the infection remains subclinical. In about 1% of the symptomatic cases, poliovirus invades the central nervous s ystem, leading to muscle weakness and acute flaccid paralysis [1]. In 1988, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a polio eradication initiative [2]. Since then, large vaccination campaigns have decreased the worldwide number of poliomyelitis cases by more than 99%. However, the WHO's goal of worldwide eradication remains unachieved. Europe has been classified by the WHO as polio- free since 2002, despite the 2010 epidemic that originated in Tajikistan, because its dissemination was interrupted succ essfully. The Netherlands, where poliomyelitis has been notifiable [3] , suffered from a large type1 poliomyelitis epidemic in 1956 and three smaller outbreaks in 1971 (type 1), 1978 (type 1) and 1992 -93 (type 3) [4 -6]. In all of these smaller ou tbreaks, export of poliovirus to two polio- free countries, the United States (US) and Canada, occurred, but only during the 1971 and 1978 outbreaks symptomatic cases among unvaccinated individuals in US and Canada were reported. The last two outbreaks wer e restricted to orthodox protestant individuals, most of whom were refusing vaccination because of religious reasons and living in socio- geographically closely clustered communities. Since 1993, no cases of poliomyelitis have been reported in the Netherlan ds [8-11]. Currently, the risk of reintroduction of poliovirus to the Netherlands is discussed due to silent circulation of wild poliovirus in Israel and cases of poliomyelitis in Syria [12,13] . Vaccination against poliomyelitis, using trivalent inactiva ted polio vaccine (IPV), was introduced in the Netherlands in 1957 for all individuals born in 1945 and younger. Vaccination is free of charge for all inhabitants of the Netherlands up to the age of 18 years, and participation in the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) is not mandatory. From 1962 onwards, IPV was administered in a combination vaccination strategy, along with the diphtheria, tetanus and whole -cell pertussis vaccine (DTwcP - IPV). Booster vaccinations with DT -IPV at four and nine years of age were added to the NIP in 1965. Initially, infant vaccinations were given at three, four and five months of age, followed by a booster at the age of 11 months, but this schedule was changed to two, three and four months of age in 1999, in response to an upsurge in pertussis [14]. This schedule, i.e. six IPV doses, was in use at the time of this survey (2006 -07) and still is. In 2005 the infant doses of whole -cell pertussis vaccine were replaced with the safer acellular pertussis vaccine [15]. Vaccination coverage with the infant vaccinations has been continuously high (>95%) since 1957 [16]. Chapter 11 170 A first nationwide seroprevalence study, performed in 1995 -96, aimed to monitor the immunity of the Dutch population against diseases included in the NIP [17]. A second study was performed in 2006 -07 [18]. Comparison between these studies enables us to assess the impact of changes in the vaccination schedule and (the absence of) circulation of microorganisms targeted by the NIP. The first survey showed good seroprotection rates against poliomyelitis in the general population [19]. Here we describe and discuss the protection against poliomyelitis in a representative Dutch population sample, including individuals from municipalities with low vaccination coverage (LCV), for w hom banked serum samples and corresponding demographic and epidemiologic data, retrieved in the second serosurvey in 2006 -07, were available. Methods Study population and design A national NIP sera and data bank was established in 2006 -07 to estimate age -specific seroprevalence of antibodies against vaccination -targeted diseases, as described previously [18, 20]. The specimen - and database includes male and female Dutch inhabitants, 0- 79 years -old, from 40 municipalities nationwide (nationwide sample (NS); n=6,386), with oversampling of the migrant population. In addition, inhabitants from eight LVC municipalities were included (n=1,518). The demographic and epidemiological data in cluded vaccination and travel history, and other known risk factors. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Testing Committee of the Foundation of Therapeutic Evaluation of Medicines (METC -STEG) in Almere, the Netherlands (Clinical Trial Number: ISRCTN 20164309). All participants (or the parent/guardian of minors) provided signed informed consent for blood sampling and data gathering via a questionnaire. Serology The serum samples, derived from blood by centrifugation (10 min at 1,000 G), were retrieved from 80 C storage. Poliovirus neutralising antibody titres against serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were determined in a standard neutralisation test (NT) using Sabin vaccine strains as challenge viruses, as recommended by the WHO [21] . Sera were tes ted in two -fold dilutions series. Quality control samples consisting of virus control and an in- house human serum control were added to each plate. Results were expressed as log\u00b2 reciprocal titres and samples were considered protective if NT titres were 8 (i.e. log\u00b2 titre3) [22]. Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 171 11 Statistical analysis Seroprevalence and mean log2 titres , both with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), were calculated using a sampling weight for each study participant. For the NS group, results were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, degree of urbanisation, and a two- stage cluster sampling, taking into accoun t the strata (five regions) and clusters (40 municipalities). For the LVC group, results were adjusted for age and sex; in addition, the LVC population was stratified by vaccination coverage related to religious denomination, as defined by Ruijs et al [23] , with orthodox protestants (including Protestant Congregations in the Netherlands, Old Protestant Congregations, Restored Protestant Church and Protestant Congregations) representing low or intermediate vaccination coverage and non -orthodox protestants (including Protestant Bond, Christian Protestant Churches, other Protestant Christians, and other, no or unknown religion) representing moderate to high vaccination coverage. Linear regression analysis was performed to study the decline of antibodies in individuals who had received the complete NIP vaccination series, consisting of six IPV- containing vaccinations. As such, this analysis was limited to individuals between 10 and 45 years -old, since the sixth IPV- containing vaccination would have been administ ered at approximately nine years of age and those older than 45 years would have been born before the current NIP strategy. Logistic regression analysis was performed on the NS group to assess possible risk factors for non -protection (NT<3), using a multivariate model which included all variables with a p -value <0.2 already adjusted for age, sex, degree of urbanisation, and geographic region. To maximise comparability between the three serotypes, the full model was applied without backward selection to eac h serotype. The results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (version 9.3) and Microsoft Excel. Results Immunity in the nationwide sample The seroprevalence in the NS sample was 94.6% , 91.8% and 84.0% for poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Mean log2 titres were 7.39, 6.96 and 6.04 for the three respective types (Table 1). Chapter 11 172 For one month -old infants, who were too young to be vaccinated, the seroprevalence (reflecting maternal antibodies) was 83.0% (type 1), 79.1% (type 2), and 65.9% (type 3). These percentages were higher for the two to four month -old infants, who were eligible for vaccination (maximum of three IPV doses), with seroprevalences of 89.2%, 83.3% and 85.6% for the three serotypes. Owing to waning of antibodies, the seroprevalence percentages decreased thereafter, with the five to 10 month -olds showing 79.7%, 80.8% and 75.0% for the three serotypes, but increased again in the 11 to 13 month -olds , who were eligible for a booster dose, with seroprevalences of 92.1%, 97.4% and 94.7% for the three serotypes. The highest rates of seroprevalence for type 1 and type 2 (both 100%) were found in five year -old children (after the fifth IPV dose at four yea rs of age), and for type 3 (95.9%) in nine to 10 year -olds (after the sixth IPV dose). Plotting of the mean log 2 titres of infants and children, stratified by age, indicated the positive effect of booster doses at 11 months and at four and nine years of a ge (Figure 1). In contrast, plotting of the mean log2 titres of adults showed a gradually declining trend up to the age of 45 -49 years, followed by an increase in mean log2 titre for people born before 1957, who possibly had been in contact with wild- type poliovirus. The overall seroprevalence and mean log2 titres of non -Western immigrants (n=1,069) were higher than those of individuals of Dutch or Western origin (n=5,317). Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 173 11 The higher seroprevalence of type 1 and type 2 in the non -Western group was mai nly due to higher seroprevalences in children under the age of four years and adults 40 years and older. The increased seroprevalence of type 3 was evenly distributed over the age categories. Immunity in the low vaccination coverage sample The seroprevalence in the LVC sample excluding orthodox protestant persons was 92.9%, 90.3% and 86.1% for the three respective serotypes, corresponding to a mean log 2 titre of 7.33 (type 1), 6.66 (type 2) and 6.21 (type 3) (Table 1). Chapter 11 174 For the orthodox protesta nt sub- category within the overall LVC sample, both seroprevalence and mean log2 titres were significantly lower; moreover, analysis of immunity against poliomyelitis in four cohorts in this subcategory, based on date of birth, showed the influence of poliomyelitis outbreaks (Table 2). The results indicated that the youngest cohort, individuals born from 1994 onwards, had not been in contact with wild- type poliovirus, whereas two adult cohorts, i.e. individuals born 1979 -93 and 1957 -78, had been in contact with type 3 and type 1. This is in agreement with the recorded serotype -specific outbreaks that occurred in 1992 -93 and in 1971 and 1978 [6,9]. These outbreaks were controlled with trivalent (1992 - 93) and monovalent (1971, 1978) live attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV), which possibly also contributed to the observed seroprevalence rates. The cohort born before 1957 lived in the era before large- scale immunisation and therefore probably encountered wild -type virus regularly, as reflected in the moderate to high seroprevalence rates. Persistence of antibodies in relation to completion of the poliovirus vaccination strategy in the Dutch National Immunisation Programme For the NS cohort of 10 to 44 year -olds who had completed the normal immunisation schedule o f six IPV -containing vaccinations by the age of nine years, and had not obtained any extra polio antigen- containing vaccinations (n=1,260), the seroprevalence percentages were 98.8% (type 1), 97.5% (type 2) and 90.9% (type 3). Plotting of the mean log 2 titres showed a decreasing trend with age for all serotypes, but the titres remained well above the protection cut- off of 3, indicating that seroprotection had been achieved (Figure 2). Linear regression analysis to assess the relation between mean log 2 titre and age yielded the following slopes: type 1, 0.06 (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.04), type 2, 0.09 (95% to 0.08) and type 3, 0.07 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.05). Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 175 11 Demographic and vaccination-related risk factors of non-protection The multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for a non -protective antibody level (NT<3) in the overall NS cohort is presented in Table 3. The lowest seroprevalence for type 1 and type 2 was found in the 0 year -old infants, while the lowest seroprevalence for type 3 was found in the one to four year -olds. Furthermore, non- Western immigrants had higher seroprevalences than Western immigrants or individuals of Dutch origin. Likewise, the cohort who had travelled to Asia, Africa, or South and C entral America had higher seroprevalences than the cohort who reported not having travelled to these continents. The cohort that reported practicing a religion that is associated with vaccination refusal had lower seroprevalences than the cohort that did n ot belong to these religious groups. Chapter 11 176 Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 177 11 Chapter 11 178 The cohort that had received their last polio antigen -containing vaccination more than 10 years (type 3) or more than 20 years (types 1 and 2) before sampling, or who had never received the vaccination, were at increased risk of having a non -protective antibody level compared to the cohort that had received their last vaccination less than one year before sampling. An increased risk for a non- protective antibody level was also found for individuals with medium- level (types 1 and 2) or high -level (types 1 an d 3) education, compared with those with low -level education. Finally, individuals who had started but not completed the NIP vaccination series, i.e. those who had received only two to five polio antigen- containing vaccinations, were found to be at higher risk for non -protective antibody levels than the individuals who had completed the NIP vaccination series, although the difference in risk for serotype 2 did not reach statistical significance. Discussion The serosurvey described herein, using samples an d data obtained in 2006 -07 from across the country, showed that the general population of the Netherlands had an overall high poliovirus vaccination coverage, with protective antibody levels (NT3) being at >90% for serotypes 1 and 2 and slightly less (84% ) for serotype 3. The seroprotection levels in the youngest population showed a trend of good adherence to the recommended initial vaccination schedule in early life; furthermore, analysis of long -term protection against all three serotypes indicated the b enefit of completing the recommended vaccination series, starting in early life and receiving boosters in later childhood. Not surprisingly, the demographic feature of belonging to a religious group that is associated with vaccination refusal was identified as a risk factor for a non- protective antibody level. These collective results are comparable to those of a previous Dutch seroprevalence study done in 1996 -97 [19], as well as several seroprevalence studies from other countries [24-28]. In particular, the previous Dutch study showed similar age -related trends in seroprotection that correspond to the vaccination schedule and natural exposure, although the seroprevalences found in the current study were overall slightly lower. When comparing the current results from the Netherlands with those from other nations, no remarkable differences were observed for the age -specific trends in seroprevalence of type 1 or type 2; however, the seroprevalence trends for type 3 did appear to be lower than those reported in the other studies. Unfortunately, substantial differences in study design precluded direct or systematic comparison of the results, as some of the previous studies used for example age -restricted categories and included individuals with unknown vaccinat ion status. One hypothesis is that the lower seroprevalence of type 3 found in the current study may be related to the whole -cell DTP -IPV- Hib vaccine used in the Netherlands until January 2005, which Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 179 11 may induce lower antibody titres against serotype 3, but this needs further study. A possible future third serosurvey will provide more insight into this. The low seroprevalence rates of the orthodox protestants in the Netherlands highlight the continued risk of poliomyelitis in this community. This was also reflected in the composition of affected persons in the last three natural outbreaks (type 1 in 1971 and 1978 and type 3 in 1992 -93) that occurred in the Netherlands [11]. Compared with the first survey, seroprevalence rates in ortho dox protestant individuals were even lower in this second survey [19]. Since 1993, no notifications of poliomyelitis have been reported in the Netherlands. In addition, nationwide laboratory and environmental surveillance yielded no signal of poliovirus ci rculation, so it can be assumed that no boosting opportunities with wild- type poliovirus have occurred in the Netherlands since 1993 [9,11]. It is well known that vaccine -derived polioviruses originating from OPV vaccines represent a possible route of dise ase introduction into communities without established seroprotection. This threat is especially applicable to communities with close socio- geographical clustering, such as the Dutch orthodox protestants. The current study also found that individuals who h ad received their last IPV - containing vaccination more than 20 years before sampling, were at increased risk of having antibody levels below the protective threshold. However, Abbink et al. previously demonstrated memory immunity against poliomyelitis in their study of 400 elderly people who were ineligible for vaccination but who were likely to have encountered wild -type infection earlier in life [29]. Assuming that vaccination - induced immunity is as effective as natural immunity suggests that adequate vaccination strategies (including initial and booster doses) will produce sufficient and long -term protection. Another intriguing finding of the current study is that the non- Western immigrant cohort had higher seroprevalence rates and higher mean log 2 titre s than the cohort of Dutch citizens and Western immigrants. In contrast, several other studies found no differences [30,31]. It is possible that the differential results reflect differences in study populations, including variations in age, country of birth, national vaccination strategies (i.e. vaccine type and schedule), and previous exposure. In the current study, individuals travelling to Asia, Africa, or Central and South America also showed higher seroprevalence rates than those who did not travel to these continents. Indeed, the dT -IPV vaccination is strongly recommended by travel medicine physicians [32] . Assuming that many travellers decide to get this vaccination before travelling, it is possible that the number of polio- antigen containing Chapter 11 180 vaccina tions reported in the Dutch NIP registers collected in this study does not accurately reflect the total number of vaccinations an individual has received. In an attempt to address this potential limitation of the current study design, the study participants were requested to provide their personal vaccination booklets that are kept for such travel purposes; however, we cannot exclude that people may have forgotten to bring this certificate. Finally, the current study found that higher educational level (of the individual or female parent/guardian of a child) was associated with an increased risk for non- protective antibody levels. This finding seems contradictory to the mass of worldwide studies that have shown higher education to be associated with increas ed healthcare and higher rates of compliance with health -related policies. In particular, a previous analysis of the Dutch NIP questionnaire indicated that lower socio- economic status (which is generally associated with lower education) was associated with lower participation [33]. Two other studies, assessing the uptake of human papilloma virus vaccination and NIP vaccinations in general, reported a similar link between lower socio- economic status and lower vaccination compliance. Thus, the finding from th e current study must be investigated in future studies to determine its validity or underlying causes. The current study design, using data from both a questionnaire and blood sampling of a large random sample of Dutch inhabitants, affords the possibility to extrapolate results to the general population and to assess the potential risk factors of decreased seroprotection. However, any self -reported data (such as vaccination history) carries a risk of being incomplete or incorrect, and may negatively impac t study's findings [34]. In addition, the current results may have been impacted by assay -related limitations; for example, the neutralisation test used here and in most seroprevalence studies is recommended by the WHO as the gold standard for detecting viral serotypes, but may yield false positives or negatives and preclude direct comparison between laboratories or between studies [35,36]. However, in the current study, the testing of the nearly 8,000 samples was carried out over a period of one year, whic h may have helped limit the potential influence of day -by-day variability in the testing method and its results. Moreover, an in- house control serum, calibrated to the WHO standard, was included on each test plate. These technical strategies were carried o ut to help strengthen the results' representation of the current status of immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands. In conclusion, age -related variations in seroprevalence rates were found in the NS that were related to the Dutch NIP against pol iomyelitis. The lowest rates were found in children younger than 14 months, who would be eligible for a maximum of four IPV Immunity against poliomyelitis in the Netherlands, assessed in 2006 to 2007: the importance of completing a vaccination serie s 181 11 doses, and the highest rates were found in five year -old children, who would have received five polio- antigen containing vaccination s according to the NIP strategy. Completion of the NIP vaccination series (including all six initial and booster doses) was associated with high and long -lasting seroprotection. In the general population, seroprevalence rates were above the threshold nec essary for prevention of poliovirus transmission, estimated at 82 -87% given the condition of homogeneous mixing [37], with the exception of one month -old infants and children between five and 10 months of age. Furthermore, the orthodox protestant community remains at high risk due to their refusal of vaccination. Thus, it is important to continue efforts to increase cove rage among this population, and improved approaches should be designed with respect to the particular religious arguments that underlie non -compliance with a vaccination programme [38,39]. Finally, conducting updated nationwide serosurveys is important to monitor the effects of the recent extended period (since 1993) without wild -type virus challenges, and to assess the efficacy of changes in the immunisation schedule.

Chapter 12 Performance of a bedside test for tetanus immunity: results of a cross sectional study amongst three emergency departments in the Netherlands in 2012- 2013 Nicoline A.T. 0:1-6. ( doi:10.1136/emermed- 2015- 205412) Chapter 12 186 Abstract Introduction Despite sustained high vaccination coverage and a national guideline by the Health Council (HC -guideline) on tetanus post- exposure prophylaxis (T -PEP), tetanus sporadically occurs in the Netherlands. This study aims to assess the added value of a bedside test for tetanus im munity (Tetanos Quick Stick\u00ae; TQS; Ingen BioSciences Group, France), in the context of routine T -PEP in two adult cohorts: those born before introduction of Tetanus Toxoid- vaccination in the National Immunization Programme (NIP) in 1957 (pre -NIP-cohort; n= 196) and those born after (NIP -cohort; n=405). Methods Adults included at the time of visiting one of three participating emergency departments received T -PEP as per routine recommendations. Subsequently, a nurse performed the TQS and filled in a questio nnaire. We compared the indication for T -PEP based on TQS- results with those based on the HC-guideline and with actually administration of T -PEP, stratified by cohort. Results Among the pre -NIP and NIP -cohort, 16% and 9%, respectively, received T- PEP whilst this was not indicated based on the HC -guideline. Furthermore, 8% and 7%, respectively, did not get T -PEP although it was indicated by the guideline. Comparing the indicatio n derived from the HC -guideline with TQS result found that 22% (pre -NIP-cohort) and 8% (NIP -cohort) were not eligible for T- PEP according to the HC -guideline but had a negative TQS. Conversely, 36% (pre- NIP-cohort) and 73% (NIP -cohort) were eligible for T- PEP according to the HC -guideline but had positive TQS, indicating sufficient tetanus protection. Conclusion Use of the TQS would allow better targeting of T -PEP. Furthermore, stricter adherence to the HC -guideline can prevent over -immunization and decr ease the risk of tetanus. Performance of a bedside test for tetanus immunity: results of a cross sectional study amongst thre e emergency departments in the Netherlands in 2012 -2013 187 12 Introduction Tetanus is a serious disease, acquired when spores of the bacterium Clostridium Tetani infect a wound or a new -born's umbilical stump 1 2. Anaerobic conditions in the wound can lead to the production of the neurotoxin tetanospasmin, which causes muscle contractions and spasms. Tetanus can be lethal without treatment. Because of large -scale vaccination programmes, nowadays the incidence of tetanus is very low in developed countries, including the Netherlands. However, sporadic cases of tetanus still occur in the Netherlands, mainly among adults who receive insufficient tetanus post -exposure prophylaxis (T -PEP) 3. In the Netherlands, tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination was included in the National Immunization Programme (NIP) in 1957 for persons born in or after 1951. Since then, vaccination coverage has been continuously high 4, with a coverage of at least 95% for three doses of infant diphtheria -pertussis -tetanus -poliomyelitis (DPT -IPV) vaccine for birth -cohort 1969 onwards. Before start of the NIP, men who attended military service were vaccinated against tetanus. For T -PEP, a national guideline by the Dutch Health Council (HC -guideline) is available (Table 1). Besides this HC -guideline, several other guidelines are used 5. The current HC -guideline on T -PEP administration is based on age, gender and vaccination history 6. Previous studies showed that the self -reported history of received vaccinations is an unreliable method to assess the vaccination status of a patient 7 8. Most pat ients are unsure on their vaccination status and they do not bring their vaccination booklet when they visit an emergency department (ED) or general practitioner (GP) for an injury 9. A large population -based ser osurvey, performed in 2006 -2007 in the Netherlands to assess the immunity against NIP -diseases in the Dutch population, showed that the Dutch population is well protected against tetanus 10 11. Seroprevalence in persons, eligible for the NIP, amounted to 99% (95%CI 99 -100; cut-off0.01 IU/ml) with a geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 1.5 IU/ml (95%CI 1.4 -1.6). Birth cohorts that were not eligible for NIP- participation, i.e. those born before 1951, had a seroprevalence of 77% (95%CI 75- 79) with corresponding GMC of (95%CI 0.15 -0 . 2 1 ) . T h e s e r e s u l t s m a y i m p l y t h a t T T a n d / o r a n t i -tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) for persons born in these latter cohorts often is given while adequate tetanus immunity exists. Therefore, it might be possible to extend the current period of 10 years between consecutive booster doses as recommended in our country. This was also described by Mallick et al. 2. On the other hand, the sporadic cases of tetanus that still occur in the Netherlands (0 -5 per year for 1997- 2014) show that tetanus prophylaxis does not reach all individuals who require this 3.

This Tetanos Quick Stick\u00ae (TQS; Ingen BioSciences Group, France) was compared to the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method, considered as the ref erence standard to assess tetanus immunity, and was shown to be cost saving in an ED -setting 12-16. This study aims to a ssess 1. The adherence to the HC -guideline and 2. The concordance between TQS -result and the eligibility to receive T- PEP based on the HC - guideline. We studied two birth cohorts, i.e. born before and after the introduction of tetanus toxoid vaccination in the Dutch NIP. METHODS Setting This cross -sectional study was conducted in three EDs across the Netherlands between October 8th, 2012 and December 31th, 2013. Patients who visited one of Performance of a bedside test for tetanus immunity: results of a cross sectional study amongst thre e emergency departments in the Netherlands in 2012 -2013 189 12 these EDs with a wound were asked to participate. To be included, participants had to be older than 18 years of age, mentally competent and not in a critical medical situation. This multicentre study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, was app roved by the Medical Ethics Committee, VCMO, situated at Nieuwegein, the Netherlands (NL39940.100.12) and was registered in the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR3530). Study procedure Patients eligible for inclusion were invited to participate upon arrival at th e ED. They received study information and when agreeing to participate, written consent was obtained. All participants first received T -PEP if indicated, based on the guideline, routinely used in that ED. Afterwards a nurse filled in a questionnaire on ye ar and country of birth, gender, self -reported vaccination status and whether the patient was immunocompromised. Furthermore, the nurse performed the TQS -test and reported the test result in the questionnaire. In case the TQS -test was negative and the part icipant had not received adequate T- PEP yet, the participant received appropriate T-PEP. To assess possible differences between study participants and non -participants, age and gender of all adults visiting the EDs and fulfilling the inclusion criteria b ut not participating in the study were recorded between start of the study and December 31th, 2012. Birth cohorts The study population was divided in two cohorts 10: participants born before 1951 and therefore not eligible for NIP vaccinations (pre -NIP-cohort)and participants born in or after 1951 (NIP -cohort). Tetanus Quick Stick The TQS (T\u00e9tanos Quick Stick, Gamma SA, Belgium) is a bar shaped device which detects specific anti- tetanus toxoid anti bodies in blood (Figure 1). In contrast to an ELISA -assay, the TQS is a bedside test, giving a result within 10 minutes and easy to perform by a nurse in emergency setting. The manufacturer of the used TQS reported a sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% an d 100%, respectively, using a cut -off of 0.1 IU/ml for long term protection. 16 Other studies on the Gamma SA TQS and the TQS of two other manufacturers, all having a cut- off of 0.1 IU/ml, found a sensitivity between 55% a nd 87.1% and a specifi city ranging from 97.5% to 100%13 16-19. Blood from a finger prick sample must be placed in a well. Diluent is added to cause migration of the sample through the device. A control line in the result window indicates test- validity. Appearance of a pink line indicates an anti -tetanus antibody Chapter 12 190 level 0.1 IU/ml. TQS results of participants, in which no control line appeared or the test result was not filled in were defined as incorrect or unknown. Figure 1. Statistical analysis For descriptive characteristics of the participants, means or proportions and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Differences between the two birth cohorts and between men and women were described using rate differences (RD) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) or tested using Pearson's Chi Square or Fisher's exac t test (for dichotomous and categorical variables) or student t- test (for continuous variables). Adherence to the HC -guideline was tested by comparing the administration of T -PEP in the ED with the advice given in the HC -guideline. Next, we compared the recommendation of the the HC -guideline with TQS- results to assess the concordance between these two. In these analysis participants with an unknown or incorrect test result were excluded. In both analyses, percentages of inappropriate T -PEP administration we re estimated. Combining results of the two analyses shows the difference between the current practice and practice exclusively based on TQS -results. We initially estimated that 379 patients in the pre -NIP-cohort and 371 patients in the NIP-cohort would be sufficient to show a 50% (\u00b110%, 95%CI) discordance between self-reported vaccination status and TQS result ( = 0.05, =0.20). Interim analysis showed discordance in the pre -NIP-cohort in 20% of the patients, resulting in a required sample size of 244. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Performance of a bedside test for tetanus immunity: results of a cross sectional study amongst thre e emergency departments in the Netherlands in 2012 -2013 191 12 Results Study population During the study period, 616 persons agreed to participate. Fifteen persons were excluded due to: absence of informed consent signature (n=8); unknown age (n=4); under 18 years of age (n=3). Therefore, 601 participants could be included in the analyses. Mean age in the two cohorts was 74 and 41 ye ars (median 73y and 43y; Table 2 ). Table 2. Demographics of participants, stratified by birth cohort.

For 18 participants the gender was unknown. There were no differences in gender distribution between participants and non-participants, stratified by birth cohort (p=0.4 for both cohorts). Among persons born before 1 -1-1951, the mean age did not differ between participants and non- participants (p=0.4). Among persons born from 1951 onwards, non- participants were younger than participants (36 and 41 years, respectively; p<0.0001). Adherence to the HC - guideline Administration of T -PEP was consistent with HC -guidelines in 74% and 81% of the pre-NIP-cohort respectively (RD 0. 06; 95%CI - 0.09 to 0.21; Table 3). In two (pre -NIP-cohort) and 13 (NIP- cohort) participants, the actual administered T - PEP was unknown. Among the pre -NIP and NIP -cohort, 16% and 9% (RD -0.13 to -0.005), respectively, received T -PEP whilst this was not indicated based on the HC -guideline. Furthermore, 8% and 7% (RD - 0.01; 95%CI - 0.06 to 0.03), respectively, did not get T -PEP despite an indication based on the guideline. Chapter 12 192 We found no differences between men and women regarding the concordance between indicated (according to the HC -guideline) and received T -PEP (p=0.26 and p=0.99 for respective cohorts; data not shown).

In another five (0.8%) participants, the test result was unknown. Of the remaining participants 402/590 (68%) had a positive and 188/590 (32%) had a n egative TQS test result (Table 4 ). In the pre- NIP-cohort, 44% were positive compared to 80% in the NIP -cohort. In the pre-NIP-cohort, women less often had a positive test result than men (32%; 32/99 and 56%; 49/88 respectively, RD -0.23; 95%CI -0.43 to - 0.04). In the NIP -cohort, no significant differences in the proportion positive were found between the genders (76%; 63/83 and 80%; 243/303 respectively, RD -0.04; 95%CI - 0.26 to 0.17). Performance of a bedside test for tetanus immunity: results of a cross sectional study amongst thre e emergency departments in the Netherlands in 2012 -2013 193 12 Twenty two percent of the pre -NIP-cohort was not eligibl e for T -PEP according to the HC-guideline, but was unprotected based on the TQS result (Table 4 ). For the NIP - cohort, this percentage was 8% (RD -0.13; 95%CI - 0.29 to 0.02). In contrast, 36% of the pre -NIP-cohort with a positive TQS was eligib le for T -PEP according to the HC -guideline. In the NIP -cohort, this percentage was 73%; (RD 0.37; 95%CI 0.23 to 0.51). In the pre -NIP-cohort, men, who were eligible for T -PEP according to HC -guideline, significantly more often had a TQS than tetanus (T -PEP) according to Health Council (HC) -guideline, related to tetanus quick stick (TQS) -result, stratified by cohort.

In daily practice, 66 TIG injections were administered to the participants of this study, whilst this would amount to 79 if the HC -guideline was strictly followed and 188 if the TQS -result was decisive (Figure 2). Furthermore, participants received 437 tetanus toxoid series or doses, while only 407 were needed according to the HC -guideline and 188 if administration was based on the TQS -result. Relating the administered TT- doses or -series in daily practice to the need for TT based on TQS -result shows 132% over -use (Figure 2). In contrast, we assessed 65% under- administration of TIG. Chapter 12 194 Figure 2. Discussion We report the first study on the administration of T -PEP in EDs in the Netherlands. According to the HC -guideline, 19% and 37% of the pre -NIP-cohort and NIP -cohort, respectively, were protected against tetanus and did not need T -PEP. The results of the bedside test for tetanus immunity s howed that 44% and 80% of the respective cohorts we re protected. Furthermore, we demonstrated that stricter adherence to the HC-guideline and use of the TQS would save TT- doses. Simultaneously, additional TIG - injections should be given, leading to a lower risk of contracting tetanus, especially in elderly. Non -adherence to current guidelines was also described in other studies 5 20 21. The resulti ng overuse of TT and underuse of TIG is in line with a prospective observational study of Talan et al., performed in five EDs across the United States to assess compliance with the tetanus prophylaxis recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 20. Te Wierik et al. also addressed that a more systematic administration of TIG probably will help to prevent tetanus 3. The main limitation in complying fully with the HC -guideline is the fact that the vaccination status is almost entirely self -reported and not verifiable during the ED visit. The ability to check vaccination status online would facilitate compliance with the HC -guideline provided data are available throughout life. Performance of a bedside test for tetanus immunity: results of a cross sectional study amongst thre e emergency departments in the Netherlands in 2012 -2013 195 12 The 68% positive TQS- tests we found is well in line with the proportion assessed in other studies (ra nge 64%- 74%), probably because all studies were performed in countries with extensive immunization programmes and included only adults 8 12-14. T-PEP indication based on TQS results would allow a more complete administration of T-PEP, most pronounced in the pre -NIP-cohort and the female NIP -cohort. At the same time, over -immunization of TT could be prevented, especially in the NIP -cohort. However, repeated TT -immunization is safe 22 and therefore probably no major problem. Nevertheless, NIP policy makers are obliged to arrange vaccinations as efficient as possible. Using the TQS test, TIG immunizations would likely increase , although the number of truly needed TIG administrations probably will likely be less then we estimated, due to the 0.1 IU/ml cut- off used in this TQS- test. This cut- off is the limit for full long term protection, as stated by World Health Organisation, w hereas a value between 0.01 IU/ml and 0.1 IU/ml also implies protection, but probably less durable. These persons probably will not contract tetanus and therefore do not need TIG. TIG should as much as possible only be administered if truly necessary, beca use of the risks associated with immunization using blood- derived products. Developing a TQS with 0.01 IU/ml would be helpful. Tetanus toxoid is less expensive than the TQS test, which in turn is less expensive compared with TIG. Therefore, incorporating TQS in all T -PEP decisions will result in an increase of costs for T -PEP. It needs further study to assess whether the use of the TQS in T -PEP indication in the total population or in certain risk groups, e.g. elderly, people with doubtful vaccination hist ory, is cost- effective. Both the high TQS positivity as well as the high seroprevalence in our country 10 suggest that it is possible to increase the interval between subsequent booster TT - doses in pe ople with a completed infant vaccination series against tetanus. The current HC -guideline advises booster doses every 10 years, irrespective of a completed infant tetanus toxoid vaccination series, (6 doses in the Dutch NIP). In contrast, Public Health Eng land states that a completed vaccination series during childhood (5 doses) offers lifelong protection 23. A study on tetanus notifications in England from 1984 -2000, revealed 175 reports 24. In 91 cases, the vaccination history could be assessed and all except one had incomplete or absent NIP vaccinations. This is in l ine with results of Steens et al. who stated that only 0.7% of persons, included in a large seroprevalence study to assess immunity against NIP -diseases in the Netherlands, were not sufficiently protected against tetanus despite a last registered vaccination > 10 years 10. On the other hand, ACIP advises a booster dose when the last dose is more than 5 years ago 25. To assess this in more detail, longitudinal seroprevalence data in adults are important. This study has several strengths. This is the first study in the Netherlands assessing the usefulness of a bedside tetanus immunity test and adherence to the HC -guideline Chapter 12 196 on T -PEP. Furthermore, routine T -PEP was administered independent of TQS results. The same holds for answering the questionnaires. Therefore, bias related to these aspects will be minimal. Non -participants were sligh tly younger compared to participants but had a similar sex distribution. Therefore, selection bias will have only a limited effect on our results. Some limitations must be acknowledged too. In our study, we set TQS as reference standard, but several studie s assessed that diagnostic accuracy is not 100% 13 16-19 . While for the test we used in our study the manufacturer reported a sensitivity and specificity of 96.4% and 100%, other studies using the same test found 77% and 97.5%, respectively. For TQS -tests of other manufacturers, lowest estimates were 55% and 97.6%, respectively. Th us some misclassification might have occurred, possibly leading to incorrect conclusions with regard to TQS -over - and under- immunization in some cases. Furthermore, we do not know if the professionals that performed the TQS, executed the test correctly. We instructed them on paper, but did not check correct use and interpretation. This may have led to misclassification also. Therefore, we recommend assessment of both TQS and ELISA results simultaneously in one set of samples before TQS is recommended for u se in daily practice. In particular, those found positive in TQS with a negative vaccination history should be studied in more detail. Conclusion Both the use of TQS and a stricter adherence to the HC - guideline on T -PEP can prevent over -administration of tetanus toxoid doses and decrease the risk of contracting tetanus due to more appropriate administration of TIG. The ability to check individual vaccination status online could facilitate a stricter adherence to the HC-guideline, whereas TQS might be of additional value in people with a doubtful or negative vaccination history and in people who were born before 1951 and therefore are not eligible for the NIP but state they are protected. Modelling studies and cost-effectiveness analyses on elongating th e interval between subsequent TT -booster doses and the benefit of TQS -use in certain risk groups can inform a revision of the HC-guideline on T -PEP in the Netherlands.

Chapter 13 General discussion Chapter 13 200 Discussion Surveillance enables countries to monitor and assess the impact of vaccination strategies and activities for reducing the morbidity and mortality of vaccine- preventable diseases (VPDs) (1) . Collection, analysis, and interpretation of surveillance data is vital in guiding vaccination policies and programmes to ensure that immunisation targets are reached. For each vaccine -preventable disease, this requires continu al assessment of vaccination coverage, incidence, safety , and circulating pathogen, and immune -surveillance of the target population and the population as a whole (2) . This way, trends are monitored and potential problems are detected. More in -depth research can be required to obtain additional data, e.g. to verify signals and answer questions arising through surveillance (3) . In this thesis, we focussed on disease- , safety - and immun e surveillance (chapter s 2, 3 and 11 ) and epidemiological studies ( chapters 4 -10 and 12) of VPDs in the Netherlands. We aimed also to illustrate the strong and w eak points of the present surveillance systems, the data sources used in the epidemiological studies, and the necessary logistics. This discussion will address the strengths and limitations shown in the studies included in this thesis and follow with in- depth scrutiny of the strengths and weaknesses of the overall VPD surveillance system in the Netherlands. For the future, we provide recommendations for improvement to ensure timely and high -quality surveillance for current and new vaccine -preventable dise ases. This improvement will contribute to reducing health problems related to infectious diseases through effective prevention. General discussion 201 13 Main study findings and strengths and limitations regarding the surveillance systems now in use In chapter 2 we used nationwide collected data on pertussis disease (mandatory notifications and data on hospital discharge diagnoses) to calculate age -specific incidence rates and to retrospectively assess trends in pertussis disease in relation to changes in the per tussis vaccination schedule. We showed that the three changes in the pertussis vaccination schedule in the period 1999 - 2005, advised by the Health Council, decreased incidence rates of pertussis notifications and hospitalizations among the age groups eligible for the (additional) pertussis vaccination. At the time of the respective advisories, these notification and hospitalization data were also used by the Health Council, showing the relevance of this kind of continual disease surveillance. However, data also showed that overall pertussis incidence rates increased over time and that young, not yet (fully) vaccinated infants did not profit from the measures taken. These findings were exemplified by the continually high incidence rates in infants in the first months of life and the considerab le peak in pertussis disease during the 2012 outbreak in this most vulnerable group. Based on these data, the Health Council recently advised that maternal pertussis vaccination be offered to all women in their third trimester of pregnancy in the Netherla nds (4). This use of data to drive vaccine policy underlines the importance of VPD disease surveillance. Likewise, data on the course and severity of disease are important in deci ding whether a new vaccine should be introduced. Availability of these data, through mandatory notifications or by use of various registries, is a key factor in VPD surveillance. Also relevant is identification of risk groups, e.g. premature infants, but at the moment these types of data are not available in the datasets applied to Dutch surveillance. They are nevertheless crucial for advice on, for example, maternal (pertussis) vaccination or rotavirus immunisation. Increasing the detail of existing regist ries or linkage to other registries that contain this type of information may overcome this problem. Furthermore, data derived from the hospitalisation discharge diagnoses registry and death statistics are required but nowadays become available only after a delay of at least one calendar year, making them less useful in case timely evaluation is warranted, e.g. during an outbreak. Data on hospitalisation and death included within the mandatory notifications would enable a more real -time Chapter 13 202 evaluation. We studied whether the current mandatory data give a reliable estimate of pertussis hospitalisations and deaths by means of a capture -recapture analysis in chapter 3 . In chapter 3 , we assessed the completeness of reporting of hospitalisations (within the mandatory notifications and within the national hospital discharge diagnoses registry) and deaths (in the mandatory notifications and the death registry of Statistics Netherland). Results showed a substantial underreporting of both hospitalisations as well as deaths in all registries and all age groups. This underreporting is important to take into account, as it influences, for instance, cost- effectiveness estimates used by the Health Council. Having multiple data sources makes it possible to assess the underre porting that is inherent to passive surveillance systems (5, 6) . Repeating such assessment on a regular basis can show possible changes in the ranges of underreporting. The availability of a third data source, to take into account in capture -recapture analysis, could also favor more reliable e stimates. Trying to decrease underreporting, e.g. by facilitating mandatory reporting, may be required to improve surveillance. In the above study, we looked for identical cases in both registries by using identifying data and disease data. For instance, w ith respect to hospitalisations in children under two years of age, we used month and year of birth, four digits of the postal code, sex, and onset date of disease. However, these data do not enable very accurate matching. They allowed only rough estimates of the completeness of disease reporting, with substantial inaccuracies in the estimated number of yearly hospitalisations of 25 (<2 y e a r s o f a g e ) a n d 3 8 ( 2 y e a r s o f a g e ) . S u c h u n c e r t a i n t i e s a f f e c t c o s t -effectiveness analyses or vaccine -effectiveness es timates. Therefore, the use of more specific linking variables, e.g. a unique identifier, is warranted for obtaining reliable data. Potential privacy issues are discussed later in this chapter. Newborns in the first months of life and in particular prematu rely born children are the most vulnerable groups for severe infections like pertussis and at highest need for improved protection by vaccination (7 -9). In view of the introduction of maternal pertussis immunisation to protect the newborns alongside mothers themselves, we performed a retrospective medical record study of 0 -2- year -old children hospitalised for pertussis. These records were selected from the nationwide hospitalisation discharge registry, also used in the studies from chapters 2 and 3. We assessed the General discussion 203 13 clinical course and treatment of pertussis in relation to ges tational age and vaccination status ( chapter 4 ). We were able to obtain data on 57% of eligible pertussis hospitalisations together with linked data from the vaccination registry. This way, we found that vaccine effectiveness of the first pertussis vaccin ation was lower in preterm than in term infants. Furthermore, preterm infants were overrepresented within the hospitalised cohort and showed a slightly higher risk of complications and increased duration of intensive care stay. Data from the hospital disch arge diagnoses were required for this study. However, the need for informed consent from the hospital board/treating physician, the privacy issues, and inaccurate data for linkage as well as the missing data resulted in a significant loss, i.e. from 676 to 379, of medical records that contained the desired information for analyses. Likewise, the logistics of informed consent of the hospitals and the custodian of the hospital discharge registry, plus privacy and linking issues, proved costly and highly time -consuming, leading to substantial delay of study results. As this type of study contributes to the policy on maternal vaccination and shows the need for more insight into advantages of second- versus third -trimester maternal vaccination, a more timely availability of these data is relevant to the international discussion on maternal vaccination. Although the limitations described above are inherent to epidemiological studies, we think substantial improvement is required, e.g. authorisation to perform certain VPD surveillance without informed consent from patients, treating physicians, or database custodians; accurate variables for reliable linkage, and automated extraction of medical record data. Improvement would facilitate adequate, high - quality, and timely monitoring of the risks and benefits of mass vaccination programmes that in turn would improve vaccination strategies and thereby public health. As is well known, the Netherlands is inhabited by a group of Orthodox Protestants who refuse vaccination based on religious grounds and live in socio- geographically clustered communities in the 'Bible Belt'. In this group, a measles outbreak occurred in 2013 -2014 (10) . In chapter s 5 and 6 , we evaluated vaccine effectiveness and tolerability of an early MMR vaccination, offered to 6 -to-14- month -old children during this outbreak. Early MMR vaccination was offered because infants of this age group are at increased ris k for more severe measles. Moreover, as measles is no longer endemic, newborns are less well protected by maternal antibodies, which have Chapter 13 204 decreased since measles vaccination was introduced (11, 12) . Data on effectiveness and tolerability of this early MMR are scarce and mainly derived from studies in low - income countries, which urged the need to collect such data during this outbreak in the Netherlands. We contacted parents of eligible infants, using data of the vaccination registry within Praeventis. Using questionnaire data filled in by parents of participating children, together with laboratory confirmation of a possible measles infection, we found a crude and adjusted early MMR vaccine effectiveness of Furthermore, this early MMR vaccination was well tolerated, with the lowest frequencies of adverse events found in infants aged 6 -8 months. These results will inform the Outbreak Management Team in case of a future measles outbreak. Such an outbreak will not only spread in the Bible Belt, if the number of susceptibles is again sufficient, but might also occur in the general populatio n if vaccination coverage drops further (13) . During recent years, coverage of all NIP vaccinations during childhood is slowly decreasing. From birth cohort 2013 onwards, coverage of MMR1 is below 95% and dropping, which threatens the goal of measles and rubella elimination (14) . These findings are also of value for policy -making in other European countries, as measles outbreaks occur regularly within Europe nowadays (15, 16) . Likewise, they contribute to the discussi on on timing of the first MMR dose within the Dutch NIP schedule. The possibility of using data from the centralised vaccination registry to invite people to participate in a study was an efficient way to contact parents. After their permission, we were able to validate the vaccination status of participating infants in the vaccination registry. However, a low participa tion rate hampered the assessment of robust estimates. It may have been higher if we had been allowed to send the invitation to participate in the study simultaneously with the invitation for the early MMR vaccination, instead of four weeks later as we wer e requested to do. This interval intended to give parents time to decide on early MMR vaccination unhampered by knowledge of the study. This experience shows that we need to involve people more in the monitoring of mass vaccination programmes and to convi nce them of the need for close monitoring. Increased involvement may help to increase participation. In 2009 an influenza A(H1N1) pandemic spread across the world (17) . The first case in the Netherlands was reported on April 30. This pandemic required the set- up of a General discussion 205 13 mass vaccination programme, which started by the end of October 2009. In chapter s 7 and 8 , two epidemiological studies on the safety of this pandemic influenza vaccination are described. A paper -based questionnaire survey ( chapter 7 ) among more than 3000 people vaccinated by their general practitioner (GP) showed that local and systemic adverse events were reported less frequentl y after the first and second pandemic vaccination as compared to seasonal vaccination, indicating that adjuvanted influenza vaccinations are well tolerated and there is no negative impact on the safety of three subsequent influenza doses. This is valuable information in case of a next influenza pandemic. To perform the study, we invited people when they visited their GP practice for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccinations (i.e. 3 vaccination moments), which was very labor -intensive. We needed to rely on self - reported vaccination data, as we were not allowed to verify vaccination status in the GP medical records. This stricture hampered causality assessment of the solicited adverse events. Finally, data on the number of invited people in each practice as a denominator were not available either, which may have led to biased frequencies. Set-up of a centralised influenza vaccination registry could overcome these problems. During the pandemic, all pregnant women were advised to be vaccinated for protectio n of both mother and child. In the study on adverse pregnancy outcomes after pandemic influenza vaccination during pregnancy ( chapter 8 ), we invited pregnant women by using routine prenatal screening data on infectious diseases . These data are stored in P raeventis, similar to the NIP vaccination registry. Participants filled in a questionnaire which, upon permission, we linked to data of the Netherlands Perinatal Registry. We also retrieved infant data from the child health care and the general practitione r. We found no increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in vaccinated women. Likewise, infants of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy did not differ from infants of unvaccinated women with respect to weight-for-age, length -for-age, head -circumference- for-age, developmental scores, and infection -related GP - contacts in their first year of life. Therefore, our data confirm the conclusion that adjuvanted influenza vaccination during pregnancy is safe (18) . These data contribute to the general knowledge on maternal immunisation against influenza, which is an attractive and effective way to protect both mothers during pregnancy and newborns in their first months of life. Chapter 13 206 Inviting pregnant women based on data from the routine prenatal screening data on infectious diseases stored in Praeventis was an efficient way of obtaining data. Afterwards, however, there was a stern debate as to whether we were allowed to use these data. Though prenatal screening data on infectious diseases is stored in Praeventis, these data are not part of the vaccination registry and might be considered not for our use. Also, we could use only self -reported vaccination status, possibly leading to inadvertently misclassifying pregnant women as vaccinated or unvaccinated. Finally, we encountered problems in linking questionnaire data with data of the Nethe rlands Perinatal Registry due to inaccurate data for linkage. These problems illustrate that we need to reconsider what is required for optimal (safety) surveillance of vaccine -preventable diseases and mass campaign policies. As with studies on the tolerab ility of pandemic influenza vaccinations ( chapter 7 ), a centralised influenza vaccination registry and authorisation to use it for influenza surveillance is desirable. Likewise, accurate variables for linkage would have increased data quality, efficiency, and timeliness of these studies. Permission to use data stored in other registries for VPD surveillance (e.g. to select pregnant women) would be helpful. Alongside the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccination campaign, a catch -up campaign to vaccinate 13 - to-16-year -old girls against human papilloma virus (HPV) infection was organised in 2009 (19) . For both mass vaccination campaigns, background rates of several adverse events following immunisaton (AEFI) were assessed. Chapters 9 and 10 deal with background rates of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS, chapter 9 ) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS, chapter 10 ), assessed in view of preparedness for pandemic influenza vaccination and HPV vaccination, respectively. Such background rates enable researchers, regulators, and policy -makers to put AEFI reports into perspective, as AEFI can occur in temporal association with the vaccination without being caused by it. We assessed those background rates in a large general practitioners (GP) database (Integrated Primary Care Information, or IPC I) containing anonymised information (codes and narratives) on demographics, signs, symptoms, diagnosis, clinical findings, specialist referrals, laboratory results, hospitalisations, and drug prescriptions (20) . With respect to GBS in chapter 9, we found no increasing incidence rate (IR) over time. However, IRs did increase with age. Furthermore, we put effort into case validation using a short questionnaire to the GP. This revealed a General discussion 207 13 positive predictive value of 49%, i.e. in more than half of the cases, GBS diagnosis was not confirmed by the GP. We did find an increase over time in MS diagnoses (chapter 10), coinciding with a decrease in the lag -time betwee n symptoms and diagnosis, which was significant for women. This suggests that the found increase is likely due to improved diagnostics and not a real increase, which is important to take into account in vaccinovigilance. Inclusion of more than 2.3 million person years in these studies and good representation of the Dutch population was advantageous, leading to more reliable estimates. Likewise, the ability to use free text along with codes on disease increases data validity (21) . On the other hand, selection of cases by means of free text is also labor intens ive and thus costly. Furthermore, case validation using a short questionnaire to the GP showed rather low positive predictive values and underlines the importance of cross validation through specialist letters or chart review to prevent overestimation (22, 23) . Unfortunately, there was a suboptimal participation rate among GPs with respect to this validation step, perhaps due to extra workload and low priority. Rates of more rare diseases or disorders (e.g. background rates < 1 per 500,000) may not be reliable du e to low numbers; collaboration between databases and pooling of data might be a solution to this problem. To increase usefulness for VPD surveillance, more automated case selection and validation, e.g. using machine - learning techniques, is helpful. Furthe rmore, permission to link GP data to vaccination data without informed consent of the GP and the patient would enable to use these databases also to study more efficiently the associations between vaccinations and adverse events, like HPV vaccination in re lation to migraine (24) and chroni c fatigue syndrome. Currently, the latter is allowed only after permission, leading to high risk of bias, low participation rates, and untimely results. A trusted third party can perform the linkage to ensure privacy. Accurate variables for linkage, e.g. a unique identifier, are a prerequisite. Immune responses after natural infection or vaccination are the topic of chapters 11 and 12 . Nationwide immunosurveys are performed about every 10 years (Peiling Immunisatie Effect Nederland Ter Evaluatie van het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma, or PIENTER). They started in 1995/1996, with a second survey in 2006/2007 and data collection for a third survey in 2016/2017 (25 -27). For these cross sectional PIENTER studie s, individuals aged 0 to 80 years are invited to provide a blood sample and Chapter 13 208 questionnaire data to assess their immune status. These surveys are a structural part of current NIP surveillance and result in detailed knowledge on immunological correlates of pr otection against vaccine -preventable and other infectious diseases in the Netherlands. In chapter 11 we studied antibody presence against poliomyelitis. We found that over 84% of individuals in the general Dutch population have protective antibody levels against poliomyelitis. This indicates that following a completed national vaccinaton programme, protection against poliomyelitis is high and long -lasting. In contrast, seroprevalence among the Orthodox Protestants ranged between 61% and 65%, and age -speci fic rates clearly showed the impact of previous outbreaks. These estimates are an important part of poliomyelitis surveillance in view of the polio eradication. Because of the Bible Belt, the Netherlands still has a susceptible population. However, because of the robustness of surveillance, we can preserve its status as a 'low -risk country' (28, 29) . PIENTER data are also of use in case of a potential poliomyelitis outbreak, for example during the sudden increase of Syrian refugees arriving at a time of poliomyelitis outbreaks in Syria (November 2013) or following the industrial spill of wild poliovirus type 2 in a Dutch plant that produces inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) , as happened in April 2017. The first two PIENTER surveys, from 1995/96 and 2006/2007, yielded a mine of information used to guide VPD policy. However, these surveys ar e costly and labor -intensive, and their participation rates are declining. It is important to explore ways to improve participation rates, e.g. self -sampling, expanding PIENTER office hours, and digitalisation. Increased engagement of the general public in the monitoring of infectious diseases will increase participation. Naturally, the cross -sectional nature of these surveys hampers insight into individual changes in immune protection over time. To overcome this problem, the third survey in 2016 -2017 inclu ded the possibility for a longitudinal component for a subset of participants. Due to continually high vaccination coverage, tetanus is a rare disease in the Netherlands (27) . Besides tetanus vaccination within the NIP, tetanus vaccination may be advised after wounding, as described in a Health Council guideline on tetanus post-exposure prophylaxis (T -PEP) (30) . The epidemiological study to assess the added value of a 20 -minute bedside test for tetanus immunity (TQS test) in c hapter 12 showed that adherence to the Health Council guideline on T-PEP can be improved. General discussion 209 13 Furthermore, in a substantial number of cases the result of the TQS test was not in agreement with the advice laid down in the Health Council guideline. Up to one fifth of the participants were not eligible for T -PEP according to the guideline, but had a negative test result with antibody levels below 0.1 IU/ml, indicating non -protection. Conversely, up to 73% was eligible for T -PEP but had a positive test result, i.e. 0.1 IU/ml, indicating long -term protection. Overall, we found ov er-immunisation with tetanus toxoid and under -immunisation with tetanus immuno- globulins. The possibility to verify a person's tetanus vaccination status would have benefitted this study, as vaccination status is crucial in the T -PEP guideline. Verifiable vaccination status would also be a great advantage for T -PEP in general. Written evidence of tetanus vaccination is requested in the T- PEP guideline algorithm, and since most people cannot hand this over when they visit the emergency department (ED), many EDs follow the adage 'better safe than sorry'. The same holds for other v accinations administered in individual health care settings. Therefore, a centralised registry including all administered vaccinations (i.e. individual and via mass vaccination programmes) that allows online consultation by the public and professionals, is advantageous for medical care. Surveillance and epidemiological studies covered in this thesis proved valuable for the monitoring of mass vaccination programmes in the Netherlands. However, several limitations and challenges have been identified. It is important to discuss how to improve surveillance systems and how to retrieve more detailed data without high additional costs. Improved surveillance systems should result in more timely and in - depth results of benefits and risks of vaccine -preventable dis eases and limit the need for more costly and time -consuming additional epidemiological studies. Regarding the surveillance systems used in our studies, several ways for improvement can be identified. The first recommendation would be the use of centralised and validated vaccination records, followed by the ability to accurately link data of different registries. Related privacy issues and the need for informed consent from patients, physicians, and database custodians must be weighed against the impact for public health and the need to have knowledge on benefit/risk profiles of mass vaccination programmes. Furthermore, the advantage of using routinely collected medical record Chapter 13 210 data for surveillance will greatly improve insight into current data on disease c ourse and risk groups, and allow more personalised medicine. As these improvements cannot be implemented without engagement of health care professionals, the general public, and other stakeholders, it is necessary to discuss them with all parties involved and to increase their engagement in the surveillance of vaccine -preventable diseases. These recommendations will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. Improvement of current VPD surveillance system: Use of centralised and validated vacci nation records Accurate linking of different registries by means of a unique identifier or other very specific variables Permission to use routinely collected medical record data for VPD surveillance No need for informed consent from patients, physicians, and database custodians Ensuring privacy by means of a Trusted Third Party Engagement of all stakeholders is a prerequisite for all above recommendations. Registration of vaccination status From way back, registration of vaccinations of the two mass vaccination programmes in the Netherlands has been organised differently, and this influences the possibilities for surveillance. While the National Immunisation Programme has a centralised vaccin ation registry, stored within Praeventis, vaccinations within the seasonal influenza vaccination programme are registered in the medical records of general practitioners. A centralised vaccination registry has great advantages for surveillance, as demonstr ated in the studies described in chapters 4 -6, 8 and 11 . Such a centralised registry can be linked to the population registry and therefore always contains accurate and reliable information on name, home address, and date of birth. This information can be used to invite people for studies, as occurred in the studies included in chapters 5, 6 and 8 . This targeted invitation is efficient and enables researchers to select a specific group of possible study participants. General discussion 211 13 Furthermore, a centralised registry co ntains vaccination records at an individual level, enabling researchers to use validated data ( chapter s 4-6 and 11 ) instead of self - reported vaccination status ( chapters 7 , 8 and 12 ), as self -reported vaccination status is found to be unreliable (31 -33). Also, a registry can give detailed insight into vaccination coverage, which can be stratified by sex, age, and/or by region, municipality, or even postal code if needed (34) . Such insights can identify risk groups, which is important during infectious disease outbreaks. The register can be used to send personalis ed invitations for vaccinations, not only for routine immunisation programmes, but also for mass vaccination campaigns during an outbreak, e.g. the early MMR vaccination during the last measles outbreak in 2013 - 2014 or the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 200 9 (10, 17, 34) . If the registry is accessible online, the public and health care personnel could check a vacci nation status and update if necessary. In Denmark since 2012 -2014, a nationwide vaccination registry is in place, an upgrade of their long -standing NIP registry that includes all administered vaccinations, i.e. immunisations within and outside national programmes (35) . Reporting of all administered va ccinations is mandatory for health care personnel, but also citizens can register the immunisations they receive. Doctors can validate and, if necessary, correct those vaccinations (36) . Citizens and health care personnel have online access to their own vaccination data and to the vaccination status of their patients, respectively. Norway has a comparable system (37) . In the Netherlands, a nationwide centralised influenza registry was discussed during the 2009 influenza pandemic (38) , in case it would be necessary to offer vaccination to the entire population. However, during the course of the pandemic the Centre for Infectious Disease Control , the Health Council, and the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports decided to offer targeted vaccination while using existing ways to register vaccinations. A dedicated vaccination registry was set up only for the pandemic vaccinations offered to childr en aged 6 months to 5 years and household members of infants < 6 months of age. Studies clearly showed that local storage of vaccination status hampered validation of patient vaccination status (33) and led to suboptimal estimates of vaccine effectiveness (39) . Locally stored data also led to inaccuracies of vaccination coverage estimates during outbreaks due to the lack of precise denominators, even though this information is crucial for outbreak management (40) . Chapter 13 212 Similar disadvantages were also encountered in Sweden in relation to safety surveillance. The Swedish medical products agency performed in -depth studies on the association between narcolepsy and Pandemrix\u00ae, one of the pandemic vaccines (41) . They concluded that data collection was very time -consuming and offered inaccurate data on vaccination status. Therefore they urged installation of a centralised influen za vaccination registry. These findings underline the value of a centralised influenza vaccination register, and as these issues are not limited to a pandemic situation but also apply to seasonal influenza (e.g. in case influenza vaccination of pregnant w omen is implemented), such a registry is recommended. Beside NIP and influenza vaccinations, a central registry including individual vaccinations that are not part of a mass vaccination programme is advisable. The Health Council has stated that use of li censed vaccinations, not included in a mass vaccination programme, needs to be promoted (42) . The Health Council also has urged that adequate monitoring of the risks and benefits of these vaccinations be put in place. However, given the current surveillance systems, monitoring of VPDs outside mass immunisation programmes is very complicated. For example, the Health Council recently advised introduction of universal mass rotavirus vaccination (43) . However, when the cost appears infeasible, the Health Council advised that a targeted risk - group approach would be more cost- effective. In case of targeted risk -group vaccination, vaccination status needs to be included in the individual medical record, but denominators of eligible infants are unknown, hampering good surveillance. As validated vaccination records are the cornerstone of good coverage estimates and of disease - and safety - surveillance, a centralised vaccination registry also including these immunisations is an important facet of adequate VPD surveillance (44) . Instead of three separate registries, i.e. for NIP, influenza, and vaccinations outside mass immunisatio n programmes, we recommend upgrading the logistics of the current NIP vaccination registry. From only including vaccinations as part of the NIP and up till 19 years of age, it could expand to include all people living in the Netherlands and their entire sp ectrum of vaccinations (44) . It is of great importance that this registry is available online for each individual to register immunisations and check their vaccination status. Similar rights should be granted to treating physicians or other dedicated medical personnel. Likewise, the organisation designated for VPD General discussion 213 13 surveillance by the government, i.e. the Centre for Infectious Disease Control, should be authorised to use those data for VPD surveillance. If such a vaccination registry is in place, registration and validation of administered vaccinations need to be promoted. It is important to have a user -friendl y system and to avoid double entry through integration of the register into existing electronic patient- record systems at GPs, hospitals, and travel clinics. In addition to positive effects for surveillance, such a vaccination registry will also benefit cl inical practice, e.g. the tetanus vaccination status can be checked when a wounded person visits the emergency department, thereby avoiding unnecessary tetanus toxoid vaccinations (45) . Clinicians can check and if necessary update a patient's vaccination status in preparation for travel or before starting immunosuppressive medication. The latter becomes more and more important as the Dutch population gets older and the number of people using immune -modulating drugs is increasing (46) . Making vaccination data accessible online for individuals may improve self - management, public engagement, an d overall vaccination coverage. As people become more involved and responsible for their health, they will probably become more aware of vaccinations and their usefulness throughout life (47 -50). The use of vaccination applications for mobile devices and text messaging to remind someone of an appointment for vaccination can further improve public engagement. Recommendation: 1. Instalment of a centralised vaccination registry including all people living in the Netherlands and covering the entire spectrum of vaccinations, i.e. c urrent infant NIP, seasonal influenza vaccinations, travel- related vaccinations and other individual vaccinations such as post- exposure prophylaxis 2. Authorisation of the organisation that is designated for VPD surveillance by the government to use these vac cination data for surveillance in view of improved and timelier benefit/risk balances of vaccine -preventable diseases and optimisation of public health Chapter 13 214 Benefits for VPD surveillance: Detailed and accurate information on vaccination coverage Accurate vaccine effectiveness estimates Improved causality assessment as part of improved safety surveillance Access to validated vaccination records in surveillance and epidemiological studies Possibility to invite specific groups for specific studies Other bene fits: Improved clinical practice Increased involvement of health care personnel in prevention through vaccination Increased public involvement by self -management Challenges: Protection of privacy Compliance of treating physicians Completeness of vaccination records Avoidance of double entry Costs and sustainability Linking mother and child records in the light of maternal vaccination Linking to other registries for diseas e- safety, pathogen - and immuno -surveillance Data linkage, privacy, and inf ormed consent in relation to VPD surveillance All data and registries used in the studies of this thesis contain personal and medical data. For mandatory notifications, permission to use those data for public health on a local level is described in the Pub lic Health Act (51) but i n general, identifying personal and medical data may only be used after permission from the patient, which is regulated by law (52- 54). To protect privacy of patients, professionals, and organisations, registry data a re intentionally anonymised or pseudonymised before they are made available to analysts at the national level, e.g. by degrading a date of birth to only year of birth or including only digits of the postal code instead of a full zip code. These procedures limit the possibility of accurate linking, which is General discussion 215 13 disadvantageous for accurate VPD surveillance that aims to gain insight into benefit/risk balances of vaccinations and improve public health. This disadvantage was clearly shown in chapter s 3, 4 and 8 of this thesis, in which we used identifying variables to link different registries. According to current law, informed consent of patients to use their medical data is not needed if 1. seeking permission is impossible or requires a too great an effort and if 2. the study serves public interest and 3. the study cannot be performed without requested data and 4. the patient did not oppose usage of data for statistics. Although jurisprudence and the Dutch Data Protection Authority (autoriteit persoonsgegevens) f urther define 'great effort' and 'public interest', professionals are unsure about their exact meaning. Some stay on the safe side and do not share medical record data without permission of the patient despite the public interest of a study. These differen ces in opinion played a role in the medical record study in chapter 4 and resulted in long study duration and suboptimal participation. On 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR or AVG: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming) will beco me effective (55) . This law further strengthens and extends privacy legislation, which will also become similar in all European countries. In line w ith the current situation, this new GDPR demands informed consent of all persons before their medical data are stored in a database. Its exceptions regarding collection without informed consent are identical to current legislation. However, organisations are allowed to collect medical data without informed consent based on those grounds, only if this is explicitly regulated by law. At this moment, the government has no intention to formalise by law such a special position of the Centre for Infectious Dise ase Control, although the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports assigned it with the monitoring of the NIP and influenza vaccinations. Furthermore, the new GDPR defines even pseudonymised data as identifying data, and therefore pseudonymised data must be treated in the same way as identifying data. This new legislation can hamper use of and linkage with e.g. vaccination registry data. Likewise, it will be become more difficult to perform medical record studies, as described in chapter 4 . Alongside the transition of the responsibility for the NIP to municipalities, which is anchored in the newly amended Public Health Act (51) , explicit parental consent for the central registration of NIP vaccinations will be implemented in near future. If this Chapter 13 216 procedure leads to a substantial percentage of parents refusing storage of infants' vaccination data and an outbreak of e.g. poliomyelitis is emerging, it is unknown whether these infants are vaccinated or not. On an individual level, parents may not know if their infant is at risk but if they have a vaccination booklet, seeking advice from medical doctors with expertise on vaccinations can solve this problem. However, on a population level, this situation may result in insufficient insight into the risks and threats of an outb reak, which hampers the instalment of adequate outbreak control measures. Furthermore, to use registration data of vaccinations that are not included in this National Immunisation Programme for VPD surveillance, separate informed consent is needed. For example, if rotavirus vaccination for risk groups instead of universal rotavirus vaccination is implemented in the near future, vaccination status will be entered into the medical record. Organisations assigned by the government to survey VPDs can use those data for rotavirus surveillance only if it is explicitly asked by the pediatrician during the informed consent process. This procedure must be coordinated with the pediatricians of all children involved, which is time -consuming and (in my personal opinion) also confusing for parents. Therefore, it is advisable to clearly regulate by law that VPD surveillance is a dedicated task of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control, serves public interest and can be performed without informed consent, as is the case already in several other European countries. To this end, data that are crucial for surveillance, e.g. vaccination data, need to be collected and stored in the interest of public health and made available to authorised parties without need for informed consent. Likewise, adequate identifying information, e.g. a unique identifier, would allow reliable linkage of registries as part of VPD surveillance, again without permission. A trusted third party , as used in the medical record study in chapter 4 , might be called in to ensure optimal privacy during linkage (56) . Statistics Netherlands have a unique position, regulated in the Statistics Netherlands Act, that is similar to what we recommend for the Centre for Infectious Disease Control. They are allowed to use identifying var iables, e.g. the social security number, to link different registries for research (57) . In the Nordic countries, comparable legislation for public health institutes is in place, despite GDPR being operative in those countries. All inhabitants have a unique General discussion 217 13 identifying number, and public health institutes are allowed to use that number for linkage of several nationwide registries (35, 58) . Together with a nationwide vaccination register, this linkage enhances the possibilities for VPD surveillance. For example, Denmark produced nationwide estimates of adverse pregnancy outcome s after the influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (59, 60) , and several Scandinavian countries assessed the risk of autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembol ic AEFI following HPV vaccination (61) . Norwegian researchers need permission from an Ethics Committee for linking data from different registries (58, 62) . Researchers in Denmark are allowed to use and link data without informed consent when data are used for 'statistical and scientific purposes of significance to society' (63) . This variable operation of GDPR is an example for policy development with respect to privacy and public health in the Netherlands. Organisations with a dedicated task in infectious disease control will benefit from a unique position with less strict privacy legislation, thereby contributing to reduced health pr oblems related to infectious diseases. Recommendations: 1. Central storage of data essential for VPD surveillance, accessible without informed consent 2. Legal authorisation of organisations assigned by the government to survey VPDs to do this without the need for informed consent 3. Permission to these organisations to use identifying data for linkage of different registries and databases Benefits for VPD surveillance: Precise knowledge of vaccination status More reliable information during outbreaks More accurate, complete, and detailed results More real- time results Timely detection of changes in the vaccine's benefit/risk balance Chapter 13 218 Other benefits: Less administration for treating physicians More timely information for clinicians during outbreaks More reliable information for individuals in relation to VPDs Challenges: Political engagement and change of law Definition of data that are essential for VPD surveillance Commitment from professionals, public, and other stakeholders Protection of privacy as much as possible, e.g. through use of trusted third parties Transparency of procedures used for VPD surveillance Use of routinely collected medical record data We used routinely collected medical record data in the studies from chapter s 4, 9 and 10 in which we collected in -depth information on pertussis hospitalisations and background rates of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis, respectively. Nowadays , personal health records are digitalised, stored in large databases, and available with only a short delay of time. VPD surveillance must use these data more frequently and intensely, as they contain a wealth of information. Some of these registries cont ain only codes, some both code and free text. The latter can give more specific information on the disease. It can also lead to inclusion of more possible cases, i.e. when a disorder is described only in free text, and not coded. On the other hand, searchi ng this free text is labor -intensive and therefore costly. In general, information is entered by medical doctors or other trained personnel; it can be used without extra workload for the medical doctors and is available near real -time. These electronic health care records can be harnessed to advance public health goals in general and VPD surveillance in specific (64) . Use of these medical record data can lead to increased insight into more severe courses of VPDs (chapter 4 , medical record study on pertussis hospitalisations ) or Adverse Events Following Immunisation ( chapters 9 and 10 , background rates of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis ), especially if accurate vaccination data are available within the electronic health records or linkage with a centralised vaccination registry is possible. However, before General discussion 219 13 electronic health record -derived data can be used for VPD surveillance, some challenges must be overcome (64) . First, underrepresented subgroups, e.g. healthy adults, can lead to incompleteness of sampling, which may also be an issue in the currently used surveillance systems. In general, selection bias must be taken into account; c omparisons with e.g. immune surveillance data can help to quantify this bias. Secondly, the registries need to contain large numbers of patient records with sufficient follow -up time to also enable surveillance of more rare disorders. As manual data extrac tion and validation is very labor intensive, automation of processes needs to be promoted. Furthermore, systems of electronic health records must be interoperable, and metrics supporting assessme nt of population health and VPD s and their risk factors need to be integrated into the systems. Training in coding systematics and structured filling in of medical records should be integrated into the bachelor and master of medical science . Last but not least, privacy must be ensured. The above cannot be achieved without the engagement of and collaboration with treating physicians. Therefore, it is important that both medical personnel and surveillance experts acknowledge that they need each other. Surveillance can use data reported and collected by medical profess ionals and the other way around: medical doctors can improve their clinical care by using evidence from surveillance and epidemiological studies. Likewise, usefulness for surveillance and epidemiological studies should be taken into account when the infras tructure of health care data is adapted. Finally, patients should be involved in these discussions, as they are the owners of their medical data. Of course, spin -off of this collaboration and increased use of medical record data goes beyond VPD surveillanc e. In our three studies that used routinely collected data, data extraction was performed manually, a labor -intensive process. More automated data extraction would result in more timely data and also provide the opportunity to repeat studies on a regular basis. Therefore it is recommended to increase the use of routinely collected medical record data and organise data extraction in an automated way. Several studies on the feasibility of using those medical record data are ongoing in the Netherlands. For i nstance, the Integrated Primary Care Database, through which the background rates of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis were assessed, was used to look for associations between HPV vaccination and respectively migraine (24) and chronic fatigue syndrome. Likewise, data from the NIVEL Primary Care Chapter 13 220 Database gain insight into respiratory infections (65) and the Integrated Alert and Response System (ICARES) aims to detect clusters of infectious diseases, using CPRD -, DBC - and DOT -codes (66) . Currently, this ICARES system is being used to study severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) as part of the surveillance of respiratory infections (67) . In the USA, comparable automated near real- time passive monitoring systems using medical care data ar e in place. For example, safety surveillance was improved by the development of the Vaccine Safety Datalink system (68) . Electronic health care data, including vaccination records, are used to monitor Adverse Ev ents Following Immunization (AEFI) in near real -time using rapid- cycle analysis (69) . In the long term, if a widespread network of medical record data in primary and secondary care is in place and VPD surveillance through this network is successful, there will be no need any more for specific registries like mandatory n otifications (64) . After all, medical doctors ask for laboratory confirmation when they suspect a patient of an infectious disease, and the request is recorded in the medical file. Likewise, the test result should be recorded. All this information can be extracted directly from the medical record without transfer to a disease notification registry. Recommendation: Increasing the use of routinely collected medical record data in an automated way Benefits for VPD surveillance: Increased, more in -depth and more timely insight into severe courses of VPDs Ability to continually monitor AEFI Other benefits: Infrastructure useful for surveillance of other public health issues Challenges: Creation of a research mindset in medical doctors that leads to more stru ctured medical records Interoperability of electronic health records Inclusion of metrics for population health, VPDs, and their risk factors Commitment from medical doctors Costs and sustainability Guaranteed privacy General discussion 221 13 Collaboration between public health, clinical care, and general public The recommendations discussed above will not be effective without the engagement and collaboration of health care personnel, patients, the general public, and other stakeholders. In general, medical doctors are reluctant to disclose patient information due to concerns about the extent to which public health agencies are dependable to protect health information ( 'trusting beliefs ') and the possibility of loss due to disclosing health information ( 'risk beliefs ') (70) . This general reluctance is in contrast with the openness to share and disseminate data in most of the Nordic countries (63) . More insight into attitudes and beliefs underlying these differences in openness could help to increase the willingness for collabora tion between public health and clinical care in the Netherlands. In addition, public health professionals should nurture a relationship of respect and trust with patients and the public, not just during an outbreak but before times of urgent need (71) . They need to collaborate with and make use of clinicians, because surveys show that their opinions and advice have a large impact on people's attitude towards e.g. vaccinations (72, 73) . Communication with general public should be transp arent and address both benefits and risks of vaccine -preventable diseases, vaccinations, and surveillance, as many people believe public health institutes communicate only the benefits and not the risks (74) . Such mistrust must be taken seriously and dealt with, e.g. by discussing the recommendations with a public panel, the Dutch Patient Federation, a forum of groups that are eligible for vaccinations, or their representatives. Conclusion VPD surveillance in the Netherlands has a long track record and has always been of high quality. However, both the NIP and the influenza surveillance system have changed little over the years, while health care and the world are changing fast. Due to rapid digitalisation and automation plus the need for more detailed and timely results and increased emphasis on privacy and informed consent, VPD surveillance risks falling short of expectations in the foreseeable future . Financial constraints play Chapter 13 222 a role together with an increasing workload in public health and clinica l care. Therefore, increased efforts to renew the surveillance systems, making use of modern technologies as much as possible, are very important. Consultation of and collaboration among surveillance experts, public health experts, clinicians, the public, and other stakeholders can overcome possible hurdles, increase trust, and pave the way towards a modernised VPD surveillance system that can inform professionals, policy -makers, and public with timely and accurate estimates on coverage, disease burden, an d safety as well as in -depth insights into immunogenicity and pathogen changes. Recommendations As accurate and accessible vaccination data are the cornerstone of VPD surveillance, impl ementation of a centralised national vaccination register, containing data on all inhabitants in the Netherlands on all vaccinations and accessible to public and professionals , would be a major improvement for VPD surveillance . To avoid untimely results or insignificant data due to low numbers, all professionals and relev ant stakeholders need to agree that VPD surveillance is an essential part of public health that should be allowed the use of data without informed consent of patient or third parties. Furthermore, this authorisation needs to be regulated by law. As linking or automated exchange among registries and medical information systems is beneficial for VPD surveillance, its strong promotion is warranted. Sufficient identifying variables or a unique identifier are crucial for accurate linkage and exchange. Logistics must be organised to guarantee privacy as much as possible. As another precautionary measure, trusted third parties can be used. Timeliness of data, especially on more severe disease stages, can be achieved if data from medical records or other databases are available on a regular basis, e.g. monthly or weekly, automated exchange or linking is performed as soon as those data are available, and data in medical records can be attuned to the needs of VPD surveillance. Public health, medical doctors, the gene ral public, and other stakeholders of infectious disease control need to collaborate more closely and communicate more intensely.

Appendix About the author About the author 238 Appendix 239 A Nicoline van der Maas was Born in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, on April 19, 1963. At nine years of age she moved with her parents to Utrecht. There she attended the 'Christelijk Gymnasium' and completed her exam in 1981. She studied Medicines at the Utrecht University and finished her medical degree in 1988. Thereafter she became a teacher in study courses related to medicines for s enior vocational students. In 2003 she started to work at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). As a researcher she was part of the team that was responsible for the passive safety surveillance system of the National Immunisa tion Programme. One year later she became head of this unit. In 2009 she finished a master in Epidemiology at the 'EMGO Institute for Health and Care' (VU). In 2010 she switched jobs within RIVM and started to work as an epidemiologist within the unit 'epidemiology and surveillance of the National Immunisation Programme'. During her work at RIVM she participated/participates in several European projects on vaccinovigilance, e.g. VAESCO (vaccine adverse events monitoring and communication), Advance (acceler ated development of vaccine benefit- risk collaboration in Europe) and EUpert LabNet (European pertussis laboratory network). In January 2016 she started with the course of Public Health specialist (arts Maatschappij & Gezondheid) at NSPOH (Netherland Scho ol of Public & Occupational Health ). At the same time, she decided to concretize her plan for a PhD. She defends her thesis on June 12, 2018 and the course of Public Health specialist will end on July 6, 2018. Nicoline is married with Willem and has two a dult sons, Jordy and Eric. About the author 240 Appendix List of publications Appendix 242 This thesis. 1. van Melker HE.
