They take great care of me and both of my kids. I can't recommend them enough. Excellent!Sharon Our entire family of 5 has been seeing Dr. Elliott for 9 years now! He has seen us through broken bones, pulled muscles, hormonal imbalance, allergies, nutritional needs, colds, flu, physical therapy, laser work and chiropractic adjustments. He is truly a miracle worker and his Avatar analysis is spot on. We also see Josh for Thai massage & he is amazing. Eva is a master at acupuncture, needling and homeopathic muscle injections. Christine at the front desk is phenomenal. We feel so blessed to have found this practice full of caring practitioners with such high levels of expertise in their respective fields. Put simply...Alternative Chiropractic rocks!!!Kd After years of antibiodics for sinus infections, I am antibiodic-free, and working with Dr. Elliott to address previously unknown food allergies that allergists had overlooked. Working with the Avatar has been amazing, and totally substantiated by blood tests. Relief from aches & pains via cold laser therapy, chiro adjustments, Thai massage by Josh, and acupuncture by Eva have been a substantial improvement in quality of life. The front desk does handsprings to accommodate schedules and personal needs, something lacking in so many offices.Anonymous I started coming to Dr. Elliott over 10 years ago and continue to be amazed at the breadth of his knowledge. Not only has he helped me through some serious health issues during that time, he has also led me to a more holistic understanding of how my body works and what I can do to stay healthy. He's never too busy to answer a question or help me figure out the next step. Whether using chiropractic, acupuncture, the Avatar or any other method his is acquainted with, I always feel confident that his diagnosis and suggested treatment will work, and it always does! He also works with a terrific group of people who are professional, knowledgeable and always ready to laugh - what a great combination! Many thanks, Dr. E!LI My wife came home raving about some Dr. Elliott. \"You ought to go see him,\" she said. I thought he was a witch doctor and a quack because of what she thought about the Avatar but I had Barrette's esophagus, ulcers, lower intestinal problems, fatigue and digestion. I thought maybe I'd give the quack a try. Now I am ulcer free, down to one esophageal scope every other year, and hardly notice any acid reflux. I used to practically fall asleep at the wheel driving out to work. Now I am no longer fatigued. My digestion has improved, my energy level is improved, and my estimation of Dr. Elliott is greatly improved. So much for the quack!JG When I first came to see Dr. Elliott, I was desperate. Truly desperate. And I didn't have any real hope that I could find a doctor to help me. In fact, I had about given up on doctors of any sort. I hadn't slept more than 4 hours in months, was down to about one dozen foods I could eat comfortably, and no longer had my old spark or resilience. I was so exhausted I cried at the drop of a hat. Many nights I had laid awake contemplating terrible measure to get some relief. Thank God I didn't have to act on any of them. I now sleep pretty good on a regular basis, understand what food I can and cannot eat, have been cleared of many food sensitivity , have healthy functioning organs, and experience lots of energy, happiness, and joy. Dr. Elliott had not only helped me with my initial complaints, but has helped me to be proactive with my health. I haven't found a doctor I trust more! God bless you, Dr. Elliott!RSP Dr. Elliott, we are so happy that you are kind enough to care about the animals as much as you do humans. I was at the end of my rope when I was referred to you. Libby has suffered from airborne allergies since she was a puppy, and only in the last year or two she had developed food allergies. We visited so many vets over the last several years that told us we would have to live with the \"cocker spaniel\" ailments and the only answer came in the form of expensive and often harmful antibiotics. After we went through the initial cleansing of her system, she improved so quickly. She has such clear skin now, and she even wants to play ball again! Thank you for making my dog a happy, comfortable dog again. Best Wishes!LB and Libby Elliott is a natural teacher and his work in this world is notable. His humility and generosity make him a pleasure to learn from and work with. Anyone, with any sense, that crosses his path knows that they are lucky to have done so. Not only is Elliott an amazing practitioner and healer, he tops the list for best colleague to be in cohorts with; he is a walking Wikipedia! One of the many things I appreciate about Elliott is that he leads in a way that allows those near to him to thrive, both professionally and personally. Thank you for that. You're the "}
