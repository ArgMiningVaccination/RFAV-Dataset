SRTP offers three areas of emphasis: - Diabetes and Obesity Research areas include pancreatic islets/insulin secretion, neuroscience related to obesity and diabetes, carbohydrate physiology, hormone action/signal transduction, immunology related to diabetes, complications of diabetes, exercise physiology, and patient education or behavior related to diabetes. - Kidney Disease Research areas include diabetic nephropathy, immune-mediated kidney disease, kidney fibrosis, hypoxia and cellular signaling, metabolism and inflammation in acute and chronic kidney disease, and psychosocial aspects of kidney disease. Students selected for this program will participate in the Vanderbilt Center for Kidney Disease Student Research Training Program in Kidney Disease; [click here for more information.](https://medicine.vumc.org/nephrology) - Digestive Disease Research areas include epithelial integrity, gastrointestinal development and function, gastrointestinal physiology, inflammatory bowel disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and GI-related cancer. PROGRAM OVERVIEW - Students spend 2-3 months at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](https://ww2.mc.vanderbilt.edu/)and receive a stipend of approximately $2,200 per month. - Students must participate for a minimum of two calendar months (60 days calculated to include weekends) between late May and August and participate in the research symposium at Vanderbilt (July 25th and 26th). - Program staff will assist students in selecting an appropriate research project and preceptor. Prior research experience is not required. In addition to working on his/her own research project, each student attends a series of seminars addressing various clinical and research aspects of diabetes mellitus and its complications, kidney disease, and digestive disease. - MD and DO students are eligible to apply. SRTP 2023 Applications Are Closed Applications for Summer 2024 will open this October [Click here](https://www.vumc.org/vdrc/training-srtp-alumni) to view SRTP alumni and their affiliations. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: - The objectives of the Vanderbilt Medical Student Research Training Program (SRTP) are: - To provide the opportunity for the student to conduct diabetes and obesity-related research, kidney and hypertension-related research, or digestive disease-related research in order to gain an improved understanding of research and career opportunities in biomedical research - To provide an atmosphere that encourages and facilitates student interaction with a diverse group of established investigators and clinicians - To give participants a comprehensive and current understanding of diabetes mellitus, its clinical manifestations and its unsolved problems Read here: [Impact of Medical Student Research in the Development of Physician-Scientists](https://www.vumc.org/vdrc/sites/default/files/public_files/SRTP/SRTP%20article.pdf) The SRTP started in the summer of 1975 and during the past 42 years over 1000 students from more than 100 medical schools have participated. Each summer approximately 30 medical students participate in the program (see below section for a list of recent alumni). Each student chooses an established Vanderbilt investigator in the field of Diabetes, Obesity, Kidney Disease, or Digestive Disease. The areas of research are quite broad and range from basic laboratory studies to clinical studies in humans. Program staff will assist students in selecting a preceptor. The Vanderbilt faculty member and the medical student jointly design a research project which is then conducted over the course of the summer. At the conclusion of the summer, each student presents a brief summary of his/her/their work in a national research symposium. In addition to working on his/her/their own research project, each student attends a series of seminars addressing various clinical and research aspects of diabetes mellitus and its complications, kidney disease and hypertension, and digestive disease. Through these seminars, Vanderbilt faculty alert students to recent advances in basic and clinical research and treatment options. Each student receives a stipend (currently calculated at a rate of approximately $2,100 per month) from which expenses for travel, food and housing may be paid. The stipend amount is prorated based upon the actual number of days a student participates in the program. Students are expected to spend 2-3 months in the program. Please note that students must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents to participate in this program. - - Program Director Diabetes and Obesity Emphasis Area Co-Directors Kidney Disease Kidney Disease Digestive Disease - Diabetes and Obesity Track Cell Signaling Faculty Name Research Interest Affiliation(s) Breyer, Richard Prostaglandin E2 receptor signaling Medicine; Nephrology Collins, Sheila Biochemistry of metabolic disease Medicine Davies, Sean Oxidative stress Pharmacology Clinical Research, Genetics, and Epidemiology Faculty Name Research Interest Affiliation(s) Barkin, Shari Pediatric obesity Pediatrics Biaggioni, Italo Role of the autonomic nervous system in hypertension and obesity Clinical Pharmacology Cox, Nancy Genomics Medicine Elasy, Thomas Relapse prevention in diabetes Medicine Giri, Ayush Women's health in diabetes/obesity Medicine Jaser, Sarah Risk factors and interventions in T1D Pediatrics Luther, Matt Aldosterone and islet function Medicine; Mulvaney, Shelagh Improvement of self-management of diabetes Nursing; Pediatrics Rothman, Russell Patient education in diabetes Medicine Roumie, Christianne Epidemiology in pediatric diabetes Medicine Russell, William ERB signaling in liver regeneration Pediatrics Schlundt, David Environmental influences on diabetes and obesity Psychology Yu, Danxia Nutritional and molecular epidemiology Medicine Complications Related to Diabetes Faculty Name Research Interest Affiliation(s) Brantley, Biomolecular models atherosclerosis Vickers, microRNA communication and systemic homeostasis Medicine Zent, Roy interactions in kidney Medicine; Nephrology In Vivo Metabolic Regulation and Obesity Faculty Name Research Interest Affiliation(s) Abumrad, Naji Obesity/bariatric surgery Surgery Aronoff, David Placental inflammation in gestational diabetes Medicine Avison, Malcolm CNS development and function Pharmacology Ayala, Julio Gut-brain interactions in energy balance Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Bingham, Nathan Pediatric metabolic disease Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Flynn, C.
