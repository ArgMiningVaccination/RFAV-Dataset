Try these 4 points below to support you this holiday season and keep you feeling your best. Stomach 36: If you only have time for one point, ST36 is your go-to for immune strengthening. ST36 is the chicken noodle soup point of all the acupuncture points. It will help you recover from fatigue and boosts endurance. Kidney 27: KI27 is a great point to help open the chest and stop coughing. It is often used for the common cold, the flu, and folks with a compromised immune system. Large Intestine 11: LI11 is the point if you need to let out a little steam. This point is classically used to help reduce fevers. LI11 can also effectively help prevent the flu and other immune compromising conditions. Lung 7: LU7 is the master point for the head and neck; therefore, it can be used for headaches and a stiff neck. Being a lung point, LU7 is used to treat asthma, bronchitis, cough, and congestion.
