Culprits are small particles like dust, pollen, dirt, germs, mold and microscopic viruses or bacteria, or some environmental factors that act as an allergen that triggers Allergic Rhinitis. The human immune system is well designed to recognize any foreign body. The nasal lining systematically produces mucus, which traps these foreign bodies. This contaminated mucus flows from the front of the nose and drains down the back of the throat naturally. If the immune system of a person is oversensitive it will react to these foreign bodies and now these foreign bodies are termed allergens. Antibodies are produced to fight against this allergen (antigen). Antigen-Antibody complex developed whenever antigen comes in contact with the nasal passage of your nose and throat internally, these antibodies cause cells to release a number of chemicals, including histamines. The irritated nasal mucous membrane becomes inflamed and produces too much mucous. This thick mucus, or contains irritating substances can flow from the front nasal opening as a sign of a runny nose, or become noticeable from the back, as post-nasal drip, or as a cough for clearing the throat. Thus resulting in something wrong typical symptoms like continuous sneezing, runny or blocked nose, irritation in nose & eyes and in the throat, headache, febrile body, etc. Arbitrarily, rhinitis lasting less than six weeks is called acute rhinitis, and persistent symptoms are called chronic rhinitis.

NO HAY, NO FEVER SO WHY IT IS \"HAY FEVER?\" \"Hay fever\" is a turn-of-the-century term that has come to describe the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, especially when it occurs in the late summer. Although, the signs and symptoms are not caused by hay, in real ragweed is one of the main culprits. Secondly, seasonal rhinitis is not accompanied by fever.
