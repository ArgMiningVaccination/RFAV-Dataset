Purpose Current official standards expressed in General Chapter <231> Heavy Metals were last updated in USP 28 . This document summarizes the standards -setting activities relative to USP's new Elemental Impurities (EI) standards , which are designed to replace <231>. The document is divided into four sections : work done prior to 2000 , and work in each of the three revision cycles of the 21st century. II. Prior to 2000 Prior to 2000, there were a number of publications which appeared in Pharmacopeial Forum (PF) relating to compendial testing for EI, some of which related to <231> and others of which related to the USP monograph for Magnesium Stearate. These are summarized below. PF Stimuli article [1975] page 861(Attachment 1) This publication made the following recommendations with respect to <231> : a. It is recommended that all articles now tested by Method I be evaluated by the three- tube monitor procedure to confirm the suitability of the method (i.e., no complexation due to the sample, no interfering colors, and no precipitation) or use with each article. Note: It is hoped that each producer of the articles involved will look at his products and report directly to the appropriate Director of Revision (Dr. D. Banes for NF and USP articles; Mr. Duarward Dodgen for FCC articles) concerning the suitability, or lack of suitability, of the method for use with his products. b. It is recommended that the three- tube monitor procedure, with or without the zirconium modification, be given consideration as a replacement for the current Method I procedure. c. It is recommended that all future monographs specify use of Method II for Heavy metals determinations unless adequate evidence, including the results of recovery studies, is presented to support use of a different procedure. PF 17(5) [Sept. -Oct. 1991] page 2419 (Attachment 2) This recommended several changes to the USP Magnesium Stearate monograph, including the deletion of the current colorimetric Lead test and the addition of atomic absorption tests for cadmium, lead, and nickel. These recommendations were based on test results showing high levels of cadmium 2 | Page and nickel in some magnesium stearate samples . Limits of 3 ppm, 10 ppm, and 5 ppm for cadmium, lead, and nickel, respectively, were suggested. PF 18(4) [July -Aug. 1992] page 3591\u2014(Attachment 3) Pharmacopeial Previews This publication proposed the deletion of test colorimetric test for lead in the Magnesium Stearate monograph and suggested using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometers for testing cadmium, lead, and nickel . This proposal was based on the PF 17(5) Stimuli article referenced above and subsequently appeared as an in- process revision as described below . PF 19(4) [July Stearate monograph This publication proposed the deletion of colorimetric test for testing lead in the USP Magnesium Stearate monograph and suggested using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometers for testing cadmium, lead, and nickel in Magnesium Stearate . This proposal was based on the PF 17(5) Stimuli article as referenced above and subsequently 21(1)[Jan -Feb. 1995] page 157\u2014(Attachment 5) Magnesium Stearate\u2014 Proposed for cadmium, lead, and nickel . Zak T. Chowhan, Lee. T. Grady, and W. Larry Paul Based on the comments received on P F 17(5) Stimuli article, the Committee of Revision (now the Council of Experts ) decided to review this issue from a toxicity/safety viewpoint. USP e stimate d the maximum daily intake of cadmium, lead, and nickel in a worst -case setting, i.e., under conditions of maximum daily dosing of three currently marketed pharmaceutical products that are formulated with above average levels of magnesium stearate containing the maximum proposed levels of cadmium, lead, and nickel. Results of this study were presented in this PF publication. Although the results could have been used to justify more appropriate limits with better analytical procedure, further progress did not occur. PF 21(6) [Nov -Dec.1995] page 1632\u2014(Attachment 6) Harmonization of EP, and JP Heavy Metals Testing Procedures , by Katherine B. Blake, IPEC HPMC Harmonization Task Force The study presented in this PF publication was conducted to harmonize heavy metals testing for HPMC across the three named pharmacopeias. Results indicated that approximately 50% of the metals may be lost during the ash process. The loss of metals is probably matrix -dependent, and because the procedures are very labor -intensive, recoveries can vary significantly among analysts. The report note s that mercury, which is one of the more toxic heavy metals, was not recovered from either set of samples. The difference s among the pharmacopeias in the handling of the heavy metals test reference standard proved to be the basis for the different specifications for heavy metals seen in the monographs for many substances. Based on these findi ngs, a USP limit of 10 ppm may be equivalent to the EP limit of 20 ppm. Because of the loss of metals during ignition, the validity of test results obtained with the current USP, JP, and 3 | Page EP general test procedures is questionable. The data thus obtained should not be used to justify elimination of h eavy metals requirements in monographs . Specific r ecommendati ons made included the following: a. USP Method III (wet digestion) should be added to the general test procedures in the EP and JP. b. The Heavy Metals test procedures in which ignition is used, USP Method II, EP V.3.2.8 Method C, and JP Method 2, should be deleted, or revised to include a spiked control. c. Spiked control samples should be taken through the general test procedures to validate the methodology for each monographs d. Atomic absorption analytical techniques should be included as an option. PF 21(6) [Nov - Dec. 1995] page 1629\u2014(Attachment 7) Excipient and heavy metals limits , by W.L. Paul. USP surveyed all official USP correspondents to obtain maximum daily intake data for 28 frequently used excipients selected by the USP Subcommittee on Excipients. The publication presented results of survey responses reporting the highest daily intake for each of the selected excipients and discuss ed the proper way to apply daily excipient intake values to safety - and toxicity -based test limits in compendial monographs. PF PF, proposed revisions to General Chapter <231> revisions were published to address concerns over loss of metals during ashing. The revisions became offic ial in S upplement 1 to USP 28-NF 23, p. 3295 . III. 2000- 2005 Revision Cycle The Pharmaceutical Analysis 6 E xpert Committee (PA6 EC) discussed the EI topic continuously throughout this cycle. The PA6 EC formed a subcommittee to focus on the topic in 2004. The PA6 EC proposed to explore other techniques and initiate d laboratory work to address a number of topics . PA6 EC focus ed their efforts on finding a temporary solution to the limitations of <231> and published various proposals in PF , summarized below. During this time they sought more general solutions that would result in a complete revision of the general chapter . The PA6 EC wanted to make use of the available advanced sample preparation and analytical techniques such as microwave digestion and ICP , respectively . During meeting #3 (Nov ember 13, 2003) , the PA6 EC propos ed to form a working group with representativ es from the Committee itself as well as other key stakeholders (IPEC, ACS, EPA, FDA, EP, and JP ). At this meeting, the PA6 EC also considered a letter from the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) that pertained to the harmonization proposal for General Chapter <231> Heavy Metals published in PF 28(5). In its response to the statement in the CDER letter that \" the Method II test did not recover mercury, \" the PA6 EC added a statement to <231> specifying that Method II did not recover mercury. Although the Expert Committee concluded that 4 | Page <231> should be eliminated, this work did not progress in the cycle pending further laboratory studies. PF 29(4) [July -Aug. 2003] page 1328\u2014(Attachment 9) An Method as an Alternative to Both USP <231> Heavy Metals and <281> USP Residue on Ignition, by Tiebang Wang. This Stimuli article demonstrated that a multi -element inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP -MS) method is a suitable alternative to both USP <231> Heavy Metals and USP <281> Residue on Ignition for drug substances, intermediates, and raw materials. Th e article stated that an ICP-MS m ethod, combined with a direct -dissolution sample preparation procedure, is simpler, faster, more sensitive, and element specific. It consumes less sample and provides semi - quantitative to quantitative results covering all elements of pharmaceutical interes t PF 30(5) [Sept. -Oct 2004] Metals <231> Test, by John Geary (PA6 EC ) In this Stimuli article , the PA6 EC proposed to withdraw Method II of General Chapter <231> due to a number of problems , with suggestions for continued use of Methods I and III. The article pr oposed an alternative procedure, Inductively Coupled Plasma/Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP/AES), to be approved for both Method I and Method III. This was the first time that a USP Council of Experts Expert Committee recommended abandonment of the existing <231>. PF 30(6) [Nov -Dec. 2004] p coupled plasma - Optical emission spectroscopy as an alternative to the heavy metals test , by M. Schenkenberger, and N. Lewen. This Stimuli article described the use of another spectroscopic technique, inductively coupled plasma- optical emission spectroscopy (ICP -OES), as an alternative to the compendial heavy metals test. ICP -OES offers many advantages over the compendial method. It is a rapid, multielement technique that can be used to assay for the following elements: antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), bismuth (Bi), cadmium (Cd), indium (In), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), and tin (Sn). Other advantages to the use of this technique include the fact that only a small quantity of sample is required, and it provides element -specific results. Combined with ICP -MS, these two instrument techniques became the basis for a proposed new general chapter <233>. Pending a new general chapter, the following revisions to <231> occurred in this cycle. In Process Revisions PF -Oct. revised to: A llow the use of pH meter to adjust pH in Methods 1 and I II A dd monitor solution in M ethod II Increase the amount of sample needed for testing 5 | Page PF 30(1) [Jan - Feb 2004] page 217\u2014(Attachment 1 3) Chapter <231> was revised to add monitor preparation in Method III. PF 30(2) [March - April 2004] p age 614\u2014(Attachment 14) Chapter <231> was revised to allow the option to use either pH meter or short -range pH indicator paper for pH adjustment. PF 30(3) [May - June 2004] p age 1004\u2014(Attachment 15) Chapter <231> was revised to include a Note in Method II regarding the inability of this method to recover mercury. PF 31(5) [Sept. - Oct 2005] p age 1435\u2014(Attachment 16) Method II was revised to adequately address the issues resulting from the official publication of the revised Method II in the First Supplement to USP 28 . Committee also indicated that they are working on developing a more robust method and this proposed revision is not the final solution to the issues related to Method II, but this proposal may address the concerns of stakeholders at present. Interim Revision Announcements USP 23 -NF 18 1995 IRA No. 20 p age No. 4 USP 29-NF 24 2006 IRA No. 3 page No. 747\u2014(Attachment 17) USP responded to the comments received through this IRA and reverted to the Heavy Metals text that appeared in USP 28- NF 23 page 2300 for Heavy Metals Method II. This change appeared in the Third Interim Revision Announcement to USP 29 -NF 24, which w as published in PF 32(3) and bec ame official on June 1, 2006. Committee indicated that they will keep searching for a more robust and practical method. Harmonization PF 27(3) [May 2002] page 1570\u2014Harmonization Stage 4 proposal published. IV. 2005- 2010 Revision Cycle The EI work of the PA6 EC was assumed by the General Chapters Expert Committee (GC EC) during this revision cycle. The GC EC considered the EI topic at each of its 14 meetings. At the beginning of the cycle ( 2005) , the Expert Committee formed the Heavy Metals Advisory Panel with expertise in analytical methodology and toxicology. The Advisory Panel met 15 times during this cycle. Advisory Panel members initiated work in their own laboratories to identify the best option for sample preparation as well as analytical measurement. While no standards were proposed, the GC EC emphasized the importance of improved EI testing based on extensive laboratory work . This work was summarized in the following Stimuli article: 6 | Page PF 34(5) Impurities: Heavy Metals \u2014(Attachment 18) This Stimuli article and allied comments became the basis for new general chapters numbered <232> and <233>. A digest of comments received on the PF 34(5) stimuli a rticle was posted on the USP website and culminated in Attachment 20 below . V. 2010- 2015 Revision Cycle In this cycle, t he Chemical Analysis Expert Committee (CA EC) assumed responsibility for the EI topic and considered the topic in all six of its meetings in the cycle to date. The Elemental Impurities Expert Panel continued the work of the Advisory Panel in the prior cycle and has met twice thus far in this cycle. Publications emanating from the work of the CA EC and associated Expert Panel are as follow s: PF -Feb. 2010] \u2014(Attachment s 21-22) Based on these publications and also the extensive prior work, the CA EC proposed three new chapters in this PF : <232> Elemental Impurities \u2014Limits ; <233>Elemental Impurities \u2014Procedures, and <2232> Elemental Contaminants in Dietary Supplements . Revisions to the proposed new general chapters based on public comment s appear ed in the following PF. PF General Chapters <232> and <233> No new information was provided in the comments received on these proposals . Therefore , the Expert Committee concluded two of the three general chapters (excluding <2232>, which was scheduled for balloting at a later date), which appeared with an official date of December 1, 2012 in: Second Supplement to USP 35 -NF 30, official date Dec ember 1, 2012\u2014 (Attachment 25) VI. ICH At the request of manufacturers seeking international harmonization, ICH agreed to form an Expert Working Group (EWG) to consider EI elements and limits. The EWG was formed in October 2009. The activity thus promoted the work of USP, focusing on impurity limits for medicinal ingredients and products. At this time, a pre -step 2 document is available for review to the EWG (See Addendum 4 for ICH Q3D 7 | Page proposed limits and USP limits). A Step 2 document is targeted for June 2013, and a Step 4 document is targeted for June 2014 in accordance with ICH procedures. Regional implementation will occur thereafter in accordance with national/regional procedures. USP staff observes the deliberations of the E WG. As the deliberations proceeded, USP made minor adjustments to all limits presented in <232> except for mercury .

Morecombe Chairman, Heavy Metals I ask Force The purposes of the collaborative study of the Heavy metals test were as follows: 1 To achieve greater uniformity in test methodology. 2. To reduce, if possible, the number of methods in current use. 3. To improve the precision, reproducibility, and methodology of the current procedures. 4. To eliminate the possibility of interference due to substances remaining from various manufacturing procedures (e.g., EDTA or similar complexing agents.) Discussion by the Task Force members of the Method I procedure specified by the FCC, NF, and USP for those articles readily soluble in water indicated that there was concern about the possibility of chelating agents present in Che sample leading to erroneous test results. Members of the Task Force were aware, for example, that EDTA is used in some manufacturing processes to remove iron and other metallic im- purities, but it was not known whether traces of this or other chelating agents could be found in the final products. It was realized that if any chelating agent were present, by accident, design, or through ignorance, in the sample, a low result would be obtained when the Heavy metals Method I procedure was employed. A second concern was raised with respect to the possibility of the sample itself serving as a complexing agent. A final concern dealt with the possibility of precipitate or color formation taking place during the specified pH adjustment. In recognition of these concerns, the Task Force agreed to focus attention first upon Method I and to evaluate the suitability of the other methods in turn, after completing a study of Method I. A three-tube monitor procedure was proposed by Grady (see elsewhere in this issue) as a simple way to determine interference due to chelation caused by either the sample itself or by added substances. It was recognized, however, that the proposed monitor procedure would not detect the presence of complexing agents present in amounts stoichiometrically equivalent or virtually equivalent to the heavy metals content, but it was felt that the possibility of such equivalence was sufficiently remote that it could be ignored at this time. Nevertheless, a variant of the three- tube procedure was developed (see next article) that was found to give satisfactory test results under these specific situations. Collaborative study of the three-tube monitor procedure was approved by the Task Force, and members of the Task Force were requested to evaluate the three-tube monitor procedure on five articles of their choice. Four members tested only articles of their manufacture, one member tested only purchased articles, and one member tested both manufactured and purchased articles. In all, 44 separate articles were evaluated and, by coincidence, 22 were articles for which the manufacturing history was known, while 22 were articles purchased on the open market. In general, testing was limited to a single lot of each article, although in some cases, replicate lots were tested. Copyright \u00a9 1975. by The United States Pharmacopeia! Convention.

B.The 33 articles listed below were found to be free of interference when tested by the three-tube monitor procedure: Ascorbic Acid, * ? Urea, USP The 11 articles found to show interferences by the three-tube monitor procedure were as follows: 1. Glucose, USP Twelve samples representing material from four producers were found to have interferences in that the monitor tube preparations showed little or no recovery of added lead. Four samples from a fifth producer showed no inter- ferences. The presence of an added substance in the failing samples is suspected but not yet confirmed. No difficulties were encountered in carry- ing out USP Method II on some of the samples, and no test failures were noted using this method. 2. Glutamic Acid Hydrochloride, NF The monitor tube preparation failed to show recovery of added lead, thus suggesting a complexation interference was present. In addition, a copious precipitate has been reported to develop after standing thirty minutes. 3. Nicotinamide, USP Four samples representing material from two producers were found to have interferences in that the monitor tube preparations showed little or no recovery of added lead. A fifth sample from a third producer showed no interference. The significance of this difference in results has not been determined. * Solubility problems have been reported.

Phenylpropanolamine Hydrochloride, NF Five samples, all from the same producer, were tested and all showed Inter- ference, as evidenced by low recovery of added lead in the monitor prepara- tions. The reason for the interference is unknown at this time. When tested by USP Method II, the samples all met the NF limit and there was excellent recovery of added lead. 5. Sodium and Potassium Citrates, USP-NF A producer reported formation of a yellow color in potassium citrate sample preparation, and this color interfered with the test. Further studies on this article are needed. Another laboratory found one lot of sodium citrate to interfere with recovery of lead but not another lot. b. Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, USP The monitor tube preparation failed to show the presence of added lead, thus suggesting presence of a complexation interference. 7. Sodium Aluminum Phosphate, FCC A producer reported that the specified pH adjustment resulted in precipitation of aluminum (presumably as the hydrous oxide) which appears to have scavenged the heavy metals from the solution, thus leading to low results when the solution is tested. Another laboratory, however, did not experience precipi- tation problems at the specified pH. 8. Sodium Cyclamate A producer reported that five samples showed interference due, presumably, to internal complexing with the sample since it was known that complexing agents were not used in the manufacturing process. USP Method II was found to be a suitable alternate procedure and excellent recovery was obtained on samples containing known amounts of added lead. 9. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, USP Two samples from one producer showed a greenish color in solution, and this color interfered with the proper estimation of the sample turbidity. A single sample from a second producer showed no recovery of added lead in the monitor preparation. 10. Sodium Potassium Tartrate, NF A precipitate was obtained when the pH was adjusted as specified, thus raising doubts as to the validity of the test procedure for this article. 11. Sorbitol Solution, USP One out of five samples tested, all of which were from the same producer, failed to show recovery of added lead in the monitor preparation. Further studies are needed to confirm the suitability of the Method I procedure. Discussion of Results While it must be emphasized that the results reported herein are preliminary and subject to change as further testing is carried out and reported, they indicate Copyright \u00a9 1975. by The United States Pharmacopeial Convention. Inc. All rights reserved.Pharmacopeial Forum STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Page 864 clearly that attention to the Method I uses is needed. If the 44 articles evaluated are truly representative of the 299 FCC, NF, and USP articles for which Method I is specified, there is an indication that revisions are needed for about 79 articles. At this time, it appears that the Method I difficulties fall into two categories: a misapplication of the method in that Method II would be a more appropriate selection, and a failure to appreciate the negative possibilities of metal complexation. Regard- less of the category, however, it is clear that further studies are needed before any specific general conclusions can be drawn as to the need for revision of the official procedures. Admittedly, one solution would be to delete Method I entirely and substitute a method calling for preliminary ignition of all samples, but this would be a costly and inefficient solution that surely can be bettered if all con- cerned will work together to propose a realistic, and simpler, solution. On this premise, therefore, the following recommendations are proposed: Recommendations 1. It is recommended that all articles now tested by Method I be evaluated by the three-tube monitor procedure to confirm the suitability of the method (i.e., no complexation due to the sample, no interfering colors, and no precipitation) for use with each article. Note: It is hoped that each producer of the articles involved will look at his products and report directly to the appropriate Director of Revision (Dr. D. Banes for NF and USP articles; Mr. Duarward Dodgen for FCC articles) concerning the suitability, or lack of suitability, of the method for use with his products. 2. It is recommended that the three-tube monitor procedure, with or without the zirconium modification, be given consideration as a replacement for the current Method I procedure. 3. It is recommended that all future monographs specify use of Method II for Heavy metals determinations unless adequate evidence, including the results of recovery studies, is presented to support use of a different procedure.

Chowhan, Chairman, Subcommittee on Excipients, USP Committee of Revision Introduction The following revisions of the National Formulary mono- graphs for Magnesium Stearate and Lactose are presented for comment. The revisions and comments presented in this article are based on discussions at the October 11-12, 1990, Magnesium Stearate/Lactose meeting at the USP headquarters and on discussions at the January 30-Feb- ruary 1, 1991, Joint Pharmacopeial Open Conference on International Harmonization of Excipient Standards in Or- lando, Florida. Copies of these revised monographs andcomments have been submitted to the European British Pharmacopoeia (BP), and Japa- nese Pharmacopoeia (JP) for review. Comments for all interested parties regarding these monographs are wel-comed by the 18H36O2), with substantially lesser amounts of magnesium salts of other fatty acids. The fatty acids are derived from edible sources. It contains not lessthan 4.1 percent and not more than 5.0 percent of Mg, calculated on the dried basis. The limits for Mg in the BP/EP are 3.8% to 5.0%, while in the JP, the limits are 3.9% to 5.1%. The NF limits are ex- pressed as MgO; this should be changed to Mg. The lower limit of Mg varies from 3.8% to 4.1%, and the upper limit varies from 5.0% to 5.1%. The BP/EP and the JP should consider tightening the limits to 4.1% to 5.0%. Description and solubility: Very fine, light, white powder. Is unctuous and odorless or has a very faint odor of stearic acid. Insoluble in water, in absolute alcohol, and in ether. Labeling\u2014Label it to indicate particle size distribution using different screens and to indicate the specific surface area. Particle size distribution and specific surface area are im- portant parameters for consideration. The methods for the determination of particle size distribution and specific sur- face area need further discussion. Identification\u2014 A: Mix 25 g with 200 mL of hot water, add 60 mL of 2 iV sulfuric acid, and heat the mixture, with frequent stirring, until the fatty acids separate cleanly as a trans- parent layer. Separate the aqueous layer, and retain it for Identification test B. Wash the fatty acids with boiling water until free from sulfate, collect them in a small beaker,and warm on a steam bath until the water has separatedand the fatty acids are clear. Allow to cool, and discardthe water layer. Melt the acids, filter into a dry beaker while hot, and dry at 100\u00b0 for 20 minutes: the solidifi-cation temperature of the fatty acids is not below 54\u00b0. B: The aqueous layer obtained from the separated fatty acids in Identification test A responds to the test for Mag- nesium (191). The identification tests in the NF, BP/EP, and JP are bas- ically the same. The methodology can be harmonized, if so desired. The main difference is in the solidification temper- ature of the fatty acids, 53\u00b0 vs. 54\u00b0. it is an indicationof the amount of unsaturated fatty acids, for harmonization, a temperature of 54\u00b0 rather than 53\u00b0 should be considered. If the gas chromatographic method is adopted for the Fatty acid composition determination, Identification test A be-comes redundant and should be deleted. Microbial limits (61)\u2014The total bacterial count does not exceed 1000 per g, and the test for Escherichia coli is negative. Only the NF requires a test for Microbial Limits. The ra- tionale for this requirement is that the final step involves aqueous precipitation, which could be a source of microbial contamination. Acidity or alkalinity\u2014Mix 1 g with 20 mL of carbon diox- ide-free water, boil for 1 minute, shaking continuously, cool, and filter. To 10 mL of the filtrate add 0.05 mL of bromothymol blue TS: not more than 0.05 mL of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid TS or 0.1 M sodium hydroxide TS is required to change the color of the solution. This test is official only in the BP/EP. For harmonization, it is important to determine the importance of the test. If needed, the proposal is to include it in the NF and the JP; otherwise to delete it from the BP/EP. Acid value of fatty acids (401): 195 to 210. This limit test is required by the BP/EP only. This require- ment should be considered only if a clear rationale can be found. Further discussions regarding the value of this re- quirement are needed for harmonization. If the gas chro- matographic method is adopted for the Fatty acid compo- sition determination, Identification test A becomes redundant and should be deleted. Loss on drying (731)\u2014Dry it at 105\u00b0 to constant weight: it loses not more than 6.0% of its weight. Products havingmore than 4.0% loss on drying must be labeled within \u00b1 0.3%. The loss on drying limit in the NF and the JP is not more than 4.0%, while in the BP/EP, the limit is 6.0%. The NF and the BP/EP specify drying temperatures of 105\u00b0 or 100\u00b0 to 105\u00b0, respectively, to a constant weight. The JP specifies drying at reduced pressure, over phosphorous pentoxide, for \u00a9 1991 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Pharmacopeial ForumSTIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESSPage 2420 Sept.-Oct. 1991 4 hours, in order to protect magnesium stearate from melting at 105\u00b0. What is the effect of melting on loss on drying determination? If none, why use different conditions? There is a great deal of controversy dealing with the Loss on dryingspecification and the lubrication properties of Magnesium Stearate. The proposal of 6.0% loss on drying upper limit with a labeling requirement for products having more than 4.0% loss on drying should help the harmonization effort. The conditions for the determination of loss on drying should also be discussed and harmonized. Solution A in the following tests for chloride and sulfate is prepared under Identification test A in the BP monograph for Magnesium Stearate, which reads as follows. \"To 5.0 g add 50 mL of ether, 20 mL of 2M nitric acid and 20 mL of distilled water and heat under a reflux condenser until dis- solution is complete. Allow to cool, separate the aqueous layer, and shake the ether layer with two 4-mL quantities of distilled water. Combine the aqueous layers, wash with 15 mL of ether, and dilute to 50 mL with distilled water (Solution A).\" Chloride (221)\u2014A 2-mL volume of Solution A diluted with water to 15 mL complies with the limit test for chlo- rides (250 ppm). The limit test for chloride is official only in the BP/EP. A clear rationale is needed if this limit test is to be included in the other compendia. Sulfate <221>\u2014A 0.3-mL volume of Solution A diluted with water to 15 mL complies with the limit test for sul- fates (0.3%). The limit test for sulfate is official only in the BP/EP. Sul- fate is an atypical inorganic impurity originating from certain production processes. Most commercial grades pass the 0.1% limit on sulfate. A proposal has been made to limit the sulfate level to 0.3%. Heavy metals, Method II (231): not more than 20 ppm. The BP/EP and the JP require a test for heavy metals, while the NF requires a limit test for lead. It is important to limit the metallic impurities. A limit test for heavy metals would limit all heavy metals, not just lead. In addition, the test method for lead requires hazardous reagents, potassium cyanide and ammonium cyanide. Therefore, the limit test forlead should be deleted from the NF monograph. The limit test on heavy metals and the 20-ppm limit in the BP/EP and the JP should be adopted, thus harmonizing the require- ments. Cadmium, lead, and nickel\u2014 Cadmium: not more than 3 ppm. Lead: not more than 10 ppm. Nickel: not more than 5 ppm. Determine the amounts of cadmium, lead, and nickel present by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry, using the standard addition technique. Prepare the test solution by transferring about 40 mg of Magnesium Stea- rate, accurately weighed, into a teflon bomb, adding 0.5 mL of a mixture of 65% nitric acid and 30% hydrochloric acid (5:1). Allow to decompose for about 5 hours at about170\u00b0, and then dissolve the residue in 5 mL of water. The following are the wavelengths, drying, ashing, and atom- ization conditions: Equipment Parameter (\u00b0C) 450Atomization 2,000283.3 110 450 2,000232.0 110 1,000 2,300 By far the largest amount ofstearates is used for technical applications, where purity is of less importance. A clear dif- ferentiation between the technical and pharmaceutical grades is therefore essential. The results of tests on 49 samples obtained from worldwide sources reported a high content of nickel (up to 215 ppm) and cadmium (up to 108 ppm) in some samples. Nickel is used as a catalyst in the hydrogenation process, and cadmium content is a result of cross-contam- ination. The Heavy-metals test allows neither the detection of nickel nor the quantification of cadmium. Therefore, it is proposed that specific limits be established for these ele- ments. Packaging and storage\u2014Preserve in well-closed con-tainers.Fatty acid composition\u2014 suitability preparation\u2014Transfer about 50 mg each of USP Stearic Acid RS and USP Palmitic Acid RS,accurately weighed, to a small conical flask fitted with asuitable reflux attachment. Add 5.0 mL of a solution pre-pared by dissolving 14 g of boron trifluoride in methanolto make 100 mL, swirl to mix, and reflux for 15 minutes until the solid is dissolved. Cool, transfer the reaction mix- ture to a 60-mL separator with the aid of chromatographicsolvent hexane, and add 10 mL of water and 10 mL ofsaturated sodium chloride solution. Shake, allow the mix- ture to separate, and discard the lower, aqueous layer. Transfer the hexane layer to a suitable flask by passing through a funnel containing about 6 g of anhydrous sodiumsulfate previously washed with chromatographic solventhexane. Test preparation\u2014Prepare as directed for System suit- ability preparation, using a 100-mL portion of Magnesium Stearate in place of the Reference Standards. Chromatographic system (see Chromatography (621))\u2014The gas chromatograph is equipped with a 254- nm detector and a 1.5-mm X 3-mm glass column that contains 15% phase G4 on support SI A. The column tem-perature is maintained at 165\u00b0 and the injection port and detector are maintained at about 210\u00b0. Helium is used asthe carrier gas at a flow rate of about 1.5 mL per minute.Chromatograph the System suitability preparation, and record the peak responses as directed under Procedure:the relative standard deviation for five replicate injections 1991 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Pharmacopeial ForumSTIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESSPage 2421 Sept.-Oct. 1991 is not more than 1.5%, and the resolution, R, between the methyl palmitate and methyl stearate peaks is not less than 2.0. Procedure\u2014Inject a volume (1 to 2 nh) of the Test preparation into the chromatograph, record the chro- matogram, and measure the responses for the major peaks. Separately calculate the percentages of stearic acid (Ci 8H36O2) and palmitic acid (C 16H32O2) in the portion of purified Magnesium Stearate taken by the same for- mula: \\00(rj/r t), in which r (- is the response of the indi- vidual peak from methyl stearate or methyl palmitate, asappropriate, and r t is the total of the peak responses of all of the fatty acid esters in the chromatogram. MagnesiumStearate contains not less than 40% stearate and a not less than 90% stearate and palmitate. Gas chromatography is certainly the method of choice for reliable characterization of fatty acid composition. It makes the more time-consuming Acid value of fatty acids test re- dundant. Therefore, it is proposed that this test replace the Acid value of fatty acids test. Reference standards\u2014USP Palmitic Acid Reference Stan- dard\u2014Dry over silica gel for 4 hours before using. USPStearic Acid Reference Standard\u2014Dry over silica gel for 4 hours before using. Assay\u2014Boil about 1 g of Magnesium Stearate, accurately weighed, with 50 mL of 0.1 TV sulfuric acid for about 30 minutes, or until the separated fatty acid layer is clear, adding water, if necessary, to maintain the original volume. Cool, filter, and wash the filter and the flask thoroughly with water until the last washing is not acid to litmus.Neutralize the filtrate with 1 TV sodium hydroxide to lit- mus. While stirring, preferably with a magnetic stirrer, titrate with 0.05 M disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate VS as follows. Add about 30 mL from a 50-mL buret, then add 5 mL of ammonia-ammonium chloride bufferTS 0.15 mL of eriochrome black TS, and continuethe titration to a blue endpoint. Each mL of 0.05 M di- sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate is equivalent to 1.2153 mg of Mg. The Assay method is titrimetric in NF, BP/EP, and JP. LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE Lactose Monohydrate is a natural disaccharide, obtained from milk, which consists of one glucose and one galactose moiety. Description and solubility: White, odorless powder, freely but slowly soluble in water; practically insoluble in alcohol. It may be crystallized or sieved, ground or powdered. Labeling\u2014Label it to indicate particle size distribution. Compendial methods for the determination of particle size distribution will be worked out. The three methods proposed by the suppliers are. Alpine Air Jet Sieve, Bo-Tap Sieve, and Laser instruments.One method of particle size distribution determination may not be adequate for all grades of lactose or for all powders. If screening methodology is the method of choice, at least three size fractions should be examined. The Alpine Air Jet Sieve method should be required for a screen mesh size of less than 270. Identification\u2014 A: Add 5 mL of 1 TV sodium hydroxide to 5 mL of a hot, saturated solution of Lactose Monohydrate, and gently warm the mixture: the liquid becomes yellow and finally brownish red. Cool to room temperature, and add a few drops of alkaline cupric tartrate TS: a red precipitate of cuprous oxide is formed. Identification test A is currently official in the NF mono- graph for Lactose. Similar tests are official in the BP/EP and the JP. B: Use the method for Identification test A in the BP monograph for Lactose, which reads as follows. \"Carry out the method for thin-layer chromatography, Appendix III A, using silica gel G as the coating substance and amixture of 50 volumes of 1,2-dichloroethane, 25 volumes of anhydrous glacial acetic acid, 15 volumes of methanol, and 10 volumes of water, measured accurately, as the mo-bile phase. Apply separately to the chromatoplate 2 nhof each of three solutions in methanol (60%) containing (1) 0.05% w/v of the substance being examined, (2) 0.05% w/v of lactose EPCRS and (3) 0.05% fructoseEPCRS, glucose EPCRS, lactose EPCRS and sucroseEPCRS. Dry the points of application thoroughly beforedeveloping the chromatogram. After removal of the plate,dry it in a current of warm air and repeat the development after renewing the mobile phase. After removal of the plate, dry it in a current of warm air, spray with a 0.5%w/v solution of thymol in ethanolic sulphuric acid (5%) and heat at 130\u00b0 for 10 minutes. The principal spot in the chromatogram obtained with solution (1) is similar in po- sition, colour and size to the spot in the chromatogram obtained with solution (2). The test is not valid unless thechromatogram obtained with solution (3) shows four clearlyseparated principal spots.\" Identification test B is official only in the BP/EP. This test eliminates the need for testing for glucose, sucrose, starch or dextrin, as required by the JP. The differential scanning calorimetry test, which is a spe- cific identification test for differentiating between alpha andbeta lactose, is not included in this proposal because at theJoint Pharmacopeial Open Conference, the consensus was that in pharmaceutical applications the differentiation be-tween alpha and beta lactose is not important. A proposal to replace identification tests A and B with an infrared spectroscopy (potassium bromide disc) test has been made. The advantages of this proposal are (1) preference of the registration authorities for a more specific test, (2) one reference standard is used instead of four, and (3), no chlor- inated solvents are needed for the test. Clarity and color of solution\u2014A solution of 1 g in 10 mL of boiling water is clear and odorless. Determine the ab- \u00a9 1991 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Pharmacopeial ForumSTIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESSPage 2422 Sept.-Oct. 1991 sorbance of this solution at a wavelength of 400 nm in 1- cm cuvettes. The absorbance of a 10% (w/v) solution is not more than 0.04. The NF, BP/EP, and JP use different concentrations of so- lution for this test. This can easily be harmonized. The other difference is visual or subjective examination of the color of the solution in NF and JP versus semiquantitative color matching with a reference standard solution in BP/EP. A quantitative determination of absorbance at 400 nm is def- initely desirable and is proposed. The limit on absorbance is necessary to control the maximum color allowed. The sources of turbidity and color are remnants of proteinaceous matter, remnants of yeast and molds, insoluble burnt matter, residual riboflavin from whey, etc. Acidity and alkalinity\u2014Dissolve 30 g by heating in 100 mL of carbon dioxide-free water, and add 10 drops of phenolphthalein TS: the solution is colorless, and not more than 1.5 mL of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide are required to produce a red color. The acidity and alkalinity requirement is designed to pre- vent production of lactose from sour whey and to limit the milk salts. The JP limit is too lenient. The NF limit is slightly more stringent than the BP/EP limit. It is proposed to use the NF limit for harmonization. Residue on ignition (281): not more than 0.1%. This test gives an idea of the purity of lactose. The limits in NF, BP/EP, and JP are the same. This may be a study case, where the terminology of the test method needs har- monization. The temperature of ignition should be harmo- nized. The ignition temperature of 600\u00b0 is preferred due to the possible loss of cadmium at 800\u00b0. Water, Method I (921): between 4.5% and 5.5%. The method should be modified in view of the fact that methanol is a poor solvent for lactose. Formamide improves solubility of polar substances and is therefore preferred for the determination of water in lactose. Formamide is a better solvent and is less toxic than dimethylformamide. Loss on drying (731)\u2014Dry it at 80\u00b0 for two hours: it loses not more than 0.5% of its weight. The water in lactose originates from the water of crystal- lization and free adsorbed water. The Karl Fischer titration is used for water of crystallization and loss on drying is used for free adsorbed water. The JP conditions of 80\u00b0 and two hours are adequate to determine the free and adsorbed water. In order to harmonize the differences between the NF, BP/ EP, and the JP, it is proposed to include water and loss on drying limits. Heavy metals (231)\u2014Dissolve 4 g in 20 mL of warm water, add 1 mL of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, and dilute with water to 25 mL: the limit is 5 ppm. It is important to limit the metallic impurities. The sources of these impurities are milk, whey, and the processing equip- ment. A limit test on heavy metals should limit all heavy metals {silver, arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, antimony, and tin). In addition, the test method for lead requires hazardous reagents: potassium cyanide and am- monium cyanide. Therefore, for the desired harmonization,it is proposed that the BP/EP change the requirements from lead to heavy metals and that the NF and the JP limits be used. Specific optical rotation (781): between +54.8\u00b0 and + 55.5\u00b0, calculated on the anhydrous basis, determined at 20\u00b0 in a solution containing 10 g of lactose and 0.2 mL of 6 TV ammonium hydroxide in each 100 mL. The terminology, specific optical rotation, optical rotation, and specific rotation, needs harmonization. It is proposed that the compendia adopt the term ' 'Specific Optical Rota- tion.\" In solution, lactose (alpha and beta) is subject to muta- rotation. The equilibrium theoretical value reported on page C-395 in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 61st edition, for lactose monohydrate at 20\u00b0 is + 52.3\u00b0. This cor- responds to + 55.1\u00b0 for anhydrous. Therefore, it is proposed that the compendia adopt a range of +55.1\u00b0 to +55.8\u00b0. However, the data from the lactose producers and one of the users do not justify a tighter specification. Therefore, it is proposed that the current NF specifications be adopted. Protein and light-absorbing impurities (851): Measure the light absorption of a 1% (w/v) solution in the range of 210 to 300 nm. The absorbance is not more than 0.25 in the range of 210 to 220 nm and is not more than 0.03 in the range of 270 to 300 nm. Only the BP/EP has the limit test, which is an important purity test to limit carmelization products, proteins and pro- teinaceous matter, and hydroxymethylfurfural (degradation product of lactose), and turbidity. It is proposed that the NF and the JP adopt this test. It is also desirable to lower the maximum absorption limit to 0.03 (between 270 and 300 nm from 0.07 as official in the BP/EP). Microbial limits (61)\u2014The total bacterial count does not exceed 100 per g, and the tests for Salmonella species and Escherichia coli are negative. This is an important test for lactose that is intended for pharmaceutical use. Since the test method described in In- ternational Standard ISO/DIS 6579 requires less time to per- form and requires less expensive test media, it has been referred to the Microbiology Subcommittee for considera- tion. It is proposed that the JP and BP adopt microbial limits. Packaging and storage\u2014Preserve in well-closed con- tainers. LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE MODIFIED Lactose Monohydrate Modified is obtained by a specifiedprocessing of Lactose Monohydrate. It may contain notmore than 20 percent of amorphous lactose. Description and solubility: White, odorless, free-flowing powder. Freely but slowly soluble in water; practically insoluble in alcohol. Labeling\u2014Label it to indicate the method of modification, particle size distribution, and specific surface area. \u00a9 1991 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Pharmacopeial ForumSTIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESSPage 2423 Sept.-Oct. 1991 Compendia! methods for the determination of particle size distribution need to be worked out. The three methods pro- posed by the suppliers are Alpine Air Jet Sieve, Ro-Tap Sieve, and Laser instruments. One method of particle size distribution determination may not be adequate for all grades of lactose or for all powders. If screening methodology is the method of choice, at least three size fractions should be examined. The Alpine Air Jet Sieve method should be required for a screen mesh size of less than 270. It was also proposed that a compendia! method for the determination of specific surface area should be worked out. Since lactose monohydrate is modified by different methods to perform a specific function, it was proposed that the label indicate the specific surface area and the process of modi- fication. Identification\u2014It responds to Identification tests A and B under Lactose Monohydrate. Loss on drying (731)\u2014Dry it at 80\u00b0 for two hours: it loses not more than 1.0% of its weight.

The addition of three Lactose Monohydrate, Lactose Monohydrate Modified, and Anhy- drous Lactose and the revisions proposed for Magnesium Stearate are based on comments and data received in re- ponse to the Stimuli article published on pages 2419-2423of PF 17(5) [Sept.-Oct. 1991]. Additional information isrequired before certain proposals, as indicated in this Brief- ing, can be adopted, and responses from interested partiesare invited. In the interest of international harmonization, a section on Description and solubility will be incorporated into eachmonograph after the Definition. This style change in themonograph format is subject to the approval of the DSDExecutive Committee. All questions and comments con- cerning the inclusion of the Description and solubility sec-tion within the monographs are welcomed. In the proposed Lactose Monohydrate monograph and by reference in the proposed Anhydrous Lactose monograph, the Labeling section has been revised from the one in theStimuli article to indicate that the nominal value as well as the test method used to determine the particle size distri- bution is to be labeled.

All Rights Reserved.Page 3592 July-Aug. 1992PHARMACOPEIAL PREVIEWS Pharmacopeial Forum Volume 18, Number 4 termination of particle size distribution needs to be finalized. The Stimuli Identification tests for these monographs have been replaced by an infrared (IR) spectroscopy test for the reasons stated in the Stimuli article. Verification that IR will distinguish the three types of lactose is required. The proposed Stimuli Residue on ignition test for Lactose Mono- hydrate and by reference in the proposed Lactose Mono-hydrate Modified and Anhydrous Lactose monographs re- mains unchanged. As written, a test temperature of 800\u00b0 isrequired. The EP method specifies a 600\u00b0 test temperature,thus possibly providing a more stringent test since the highertemperature used in the USP test could lead to the loss of volatile substances. Comments were received indicating thatif 600\u00b0 is employed as the ignition temperature, the residue is commonly greater than 0.1%. The Subcommittee felt that the 800\u00b0 test temperature should be retained until the ex-planation for these different results is known. Reader com-ment on this topic is invited. The proposed Stimuli Watertest remains unchanged. It was reported that methanol, notformamide, is the preferred solvent from a safety viewpointfor this test. A Water test has been added to the proposedAnhydrous Lactose monograph based on comments that the total water content value is needed in order to calculate the specific optical rotation on the anhydrous basis, and appar-ently some water is present that is not volatilized at 80\u00b0during the loss on drying procedure. The proposed test limit agrees with the water limit specified for anhydrous lactosein the current Lactose NF monograph. Comments were re- ceived regarding the lack of sensitivity and lack of specificityof the proposed Stimuli Heavy metals test. It was reported,however, that iron does react in the Heavy metals test, gen- erating color equal to approximately one-fifth the corre-sponding amount of lead. For example, 50 ppm of iron will give the same amount of color as a 10 ppm lead standard.On this basis, the proposed Heavy metals test with a limit of 5 ppm should sufficiently control the amount of metallic impurities in lactose. The Subcommittee is aware also thatthe Heavy metals test has proven to be satisfactory for many years, and has approved the proposed Heavy metals test for these monographs. However, the Subcommittee acknowl- edges the need to study this topic further, and welcomes the submission of proposals involving other procedures, notablyatomic absorption, for consideration for future revision. The proposed upper limit in the Specific optical rotation test waschanged from \u00b155.5\u00b0 to \u00b155.8\u00b0 based on comments thatthe range of \u00b154.8\u00b0 to \u00b155.5\u00b0 in the current NF Lactose monograph is too restrictive. The Organic volatile impur-ities test was previously proposed on page 3414 of PF 18(3) [May-June 1992], scheduled for the Eighth Supplement, and is republished in this proposal for completeness of the monograph. In the proposed Stimuli Protein and light-ab- sorbing impurities test, the absorbance limit in the range of 270 to 300 nm has been changed from 0.03 to 0.07. This change is based on data supporting the 0.07 maximum limitas being suitable for commercially available material. Theproposed 0.07 maximum limit conforms with the limit in thecurrent EP monograph for Lactose. The Labeling section of the proposed Lactose Monohy- drate Modified monograph has been revised to include la-beling of the nominal test values, as well as the test methodsused to obtain each of the indicated values. Compendialmethods for the determination of particle size distributionand specific surface area need to be finalized. The StimuliIdentification tests in this proposed monograph have beenchanged to the preferred infrared spectroscopy test for thereasons stated in the Stimuli article. The proposed Defini-tion specifies a limit of not more than 20 percent of amor-phous lactose. However, a method for determining the amor-phous lactose content has not been finalized by the Subcommittee. It has been suggested that a powder X-raydiffraction procedure may be best suited for this determi-nation with lactose since this method detects crystal changes in a relatively noninvasive manner and is really the most readily available technique in most companies, comparedwith solution calorimetry, helium pycnometry, and differ-ential scanning calorimetry. Differential scanning calori-metry would be a second choice, assuming that it is possibleto get the amorphous lactose to recrystallize quantitativelyas it is heated above the glass transition temperature. TheSubcommittee welcomes comments and suggested test pro-cedures on this topic. In the Magnesium Stearate monograph, the proposal to revise the Definition was a necessary consequence of theproposal to change Identification test B. The proposed lowerlimit for Mg was changed from 4.1 percent to 4.0 percent, on the basis of data from samples of worldwide sources. The proposed Stimuli Labeling section has been revised to in- dicate that the nominal values as well as the test methodsused to obtain the test values are to be labeled. The com-pendial methods for the determination of particle size dis- tribution and specific surface area need to be finalized. The Stimuli Identification tests have been revised to include agas chromatographic fatty acid composition test and to de-lete the solidification temperature test. Gas chromatography(GC) is reported to be the method of choice for the reliableand comprehensive characterization of the fatty acid fractionin magnesium stearate. As a consequence of this proposalto adopt the GC fatty acid composition test, the Stimuli Identification test for solidification temperature and theStimuli Acid value of fatty acids test, which provide limited and nonspecific information about the distribution of fattyacids present in magnesium stearate, will not be proposed. The test for Microbial limits is revised editorially. As statedin the Stimuli article, this test is included in the revision proposal because the final step in the production of mag- nesium stearate may involve aqueous precipitation, whichcould be a source of microbial contamination. The Acidity or alkalinity test suggested in the Stimuli article will not beproposed based on comments that the test is misleading andunnecessary. The current Loss on drying limit remains un- changed. The 6.0% limit suggested in the Stimuli draft wasan effort to harmonize with EP's current standard. EP nowhas agreed with the 4.0% limit. The proposed tests for Chlo- ride and Sulfate in the Stimuli draft will not be proposed based on comments that these tests are unnecessary and testfailures are not indicative of a poor production process. TheStimuli draft Heavy metals test will not be proposed because nickel, which is used as a catalyst in the hydrogenation pro-cess (a major contaminant found in technical grade), is notdetected by the Heavy metals test using the hydrogen sulfide 1992 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Pharmacopeial Forum Volume 18, Number 4PHARMACOPEIAL PREVIEWS Page 3593 July-Aug. 1992 method. In addition, other heavy metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, antimony, and tin cannot be quantified against a lead standard. For the reasons stated in the Stimuli article, it is proposed to delete the current Lead test and to replace it with the Stimuli test for Cadmium, lead, and nickel. It is noted that this proposed test specifies two different ashing temperatures. Clarification of this procedure, i.e., whether or not separate determinations are required, is needed. TheFatty acid composition test suggested in the Stimuli articlewill not be proposed. It has been replaced by the gas chro-matographic Identification test B procedure in the current proposal. The referenced Fatty Acid Composition proce-dure in this test was proposed on pages 3432-3433 of PF 18(3) [May-June 1992]. The Reference standards section of the Stimuli draft will not be proposed since these referencestandards are not needed in the current proposal. The pro- posed Stimuli Assay is revised to indicate that each mL oftitrant is equivalent to 1.215 mg, not 1.2153 mg, of Mg. This change is consistent with the text in the current Mag- nesium Salicylate monograph assay. The revisions presented in these proposals reflect the Com- mittee of Revision's efforts to develop harmonized mono- graphs for the subject articles. Issues requiring additional data and comments have been noted. The Subcommittee onExcipients invites comments regarding these revision pro-posals. 7L00120 (EXC) Add the following:RTS\u201410479-01 is a natural disac- charide, obtained from milk, which consists of one glucose and one galactose moiety.

On the basis of discussions and recommendations made at the USP Open Conference on Microbiology and Sterilization Issues (Marco Island, Florida, Nov. 29-Dec. 1, 1990), the MCB Subcom- mittee proposes that this general informational chapter be modified to provide a uniform guideline for the development and implementation of microbiological attributes to raw ma- terials, excipients, and nonsterile pharmaceutical products. The proposal includes a 2-tier system with appropriate alert and action levels and guidelines for the assignment of microbial attributes based on the source of raw materials (synthetic or natural) and, for nonsterile Pharmaceuticals, on the route of administration (inhalants, topical, vaginal, otic, nasal, rectal, or oral). 4M01300 to read: (1111 > MICROBIOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES OF NON-STERILE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS PHARMACEUTICAL RAW INGREDIENTS, EXCIPIENTS, DRUG SUBSTANCES, AND NONSTERILE DOSAGE FORMS GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Fow raw materials uood in making pharmaooutioal products arc sterile aa roooivod, and special treatment may bo required to render them miorobiologioally acceptable for use.

It is ossontial that ingredients and oompononta bo stored under oon ditions designed to deter miorobial proliferation. The nature and frequency of testing vary aooording to the product. Monographs for some artiolos require freedom from one or more 3pooios of selected indicator microorganisms suoh as Salmonella opooios, Esehcrichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus; and Pscudomonas acruginosa. For some artiolos, a spooifio limit on the total aorobio count of viable microorganisms and/or the total combined molds and yeasts oount is sot forth in the individual monograph; in those oases a requirement for freedom from spec ifiod indicator microorganisms may also bo included: The aig nifioanoo of microorganisms in non atorilo pharmaooutioal prod uots should bo evaluated in terms of tho use of the produot, the nature of the product, and the potential hazard to the user. Aloo taken into account is tho processing of tho produot in relation to an acceptable quality for pharmaooutioal purposes. \u2014It is suggested that certain categories of produota should bo tested routinely for total miorobial oount and for spooifiod indi oator miorobial contaminants, e.g., natural plant, animal, and some mineral produots for Salmonella spooios; oral solutions and suspensions for E.coli; artiolos applied topically for P. aeruginosa and S. aurcus; and artioloa intended for rootal, urethra!, or vaginal administration for yeasts and molds.

Chowhan, Chairman, USP Subcommittee on Excipients, W. Larry Paul, Liaison, USP Subcommittee on Excipients, Lee T. Grady, Director, USP Drug Standards Division, Suggested revisions for the international harmonization of the National Formulary monograph Magnesium Stea- rate were published as a Stimuli article in Pharmacopeial Forum 17(5) [Sept.-Oct. 1991]. Among these suggestions were the deletion of the current colorimetric Lead test andthe addition of atomic absorption tests for cadmium, lead, and nickel. These recommendations were based on testresults showing high levels of cadmium and nickel in somemagnesium stearate samples from worldwide sources. Limits of 3 ppm, 10 ppm, and 5 ppm for cadmium, lead, and nickel, respectively, were suggested. These sugges-tions were subsequently proposed as a draft under Phar- macopeial Previews in PF 18(4) [July-Aug. 1993] for the harmonized Magnesium Stearatemonograph. Comments received in response to the proposed limit tests for cadmium, lead, and nickel focused on the signif- icant capital costs of acquiring graphite furnace atomicabsorption spectrophotometers, the added number of an- alyst hours required to perform these tests, the costs ofhaving the tests performed by outside laboratories, and theneed for these tests from a toxicity standpoint. One cor- respondent inquired as to whether or not any specific tox-icity problems have been directly linked to magnesiumstearate contaminated with these metals. Another corre- spondent wondered what problems would be resolved ifthese new tests were implemented, presuming that com-mercially available material could meet the proposed lim- its. Based on the comments received, it was decided to review this issue from a toxicity/safety viewpoint. The review plan was to estimate the maximum daily intake of cadmium, lead, and nickel in a worst-case setting, i.e., under conditions of maximum daily dosing of three currently marketed pharmaceutical products that are for- mulated with above average levels of magnesium stearate containing the maximum proposed levels of cadmium, lead,and nickel. Based then on a comparison of these maximumdaily intake values with literature toxicity values for cad- mium, lead, and nickel, a decision can be made regardingthe need, from a safety/toxicity viewpoint, for includingthese tests in the Magnesium Stearate monograph. Literature toxicity values, provisional tolerable total in- take levels (PTTILs), and no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) obtained from the Federal Register and theEPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database are as follows:Lead (Pb): 75 /xg per day (25 fig per day for pregnant women)1 Cadmium (Cd): 10 fxg/kg per day (400 /ig/day)2 Nickel (Ni): 20 /xg/kg per day (800 Mg/day)2 The review data are shown in Tables 1 and 2. These results indicate that the worst case Cd-Pb-Ni daily intakelevels\u2014Capsule A containing 4% magnesium stearate\u2014are far below the reported PTTILs or NOAELs. The PbPTTIL for adults is over 100 times greater than the max-imum daily Pb intake level from Capsule A, and the PbPTTIL for pregnant women is over 35 times greater than the maximum daily Pb intake level from Capsule A (see Table 2). Likewise, the Cd NOAEL is over 1900 timesgreater than the maximum daily Cd intake level, and the Ni NOAEL is almost 2300 times greater than the maxi-mum daily nickel intake level. The California Environmental Protection Agency, through the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic EnforcementAct of 1986 (Proposition 65), has adopted an acceptabledaily intake level of 0.5 ng for Pb. This level representsthe NOAEL for Pb divided by 1000. Based on a 69.9-mg maximum daily magnesium stearate intake with Capsule A (Table 1), the Proposition 65 daily Pb limit of 0.5 jugcorresponds to 7.15 ppm (0.5 ng -^ 0.0699 g) for Pb inmagnesium stearate. A proposal to tighten the Pb limit in the Magnesium Stearate monograph from the current 10 ppm value to 7 ppm would, therefore, seem to be con- sistent with the Proposition 65 limit. It might also be ap- propriate to consider a more conservative limit of 5 ppm. In either case (7 ppm or 5 ppm), the current \"wet chem- istry\" procedure under the USP general test chapter Lead (251) should be sufficiently sensitive to be applicable to magnesium stearate. Five USP-NF monographs have one USP monograph, Calcium Car-bonate, has a Pb limit of 3 ppm, all determined by theprocedure under Lead (251). Reports of up to 108 ppm Cd and 215 ppm Ni in some magnesium stearate samples were submitted to the USP. The Cd content is reportedly a result of cross-contami- nation, and nickel reportedly may be present due to its use as a catalyst in the hydrogenation process. Even at these Cd and Ni levels, the Cd NOAEL is over 50 times greater than the 7.55 ng maximum daily Cd intake level (400 -j- 7.55), and the nickel NOAEL is also over 50 times greater than the 15.03 ng maximum daily nickel intake level (800 + 15.03) (Table 1). 1 The Pb value is based on the PTTIL proposed by FDA in the 2/4/94 Federal Register. 2 The Cd and Ni values in parentheses are values for a 40 kg \"adult,\" to simulate a worst-case situation. 1995 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.

Blake, IPEC HPMC Harmonization Task Force* Introduction One of the more complicated issues for those involved in the harmonization of the pharmacopeias is the resolution of the subtle differences in the general tests chapters. Some of these test procedures have been in use for decades and are required in the monographs for many different sub- stances. It is easy to assume that the methods are equiv- alent and, therefore, the results are the same regardless of which pharmacopeia is used; but this is not always a valid assumption. As the Merck & Co., Inc., representative on the Inter- national Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) task force for Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC), I was assigned the harmonization of heavy metals testing for HPMC. All of the compendial monographs refer to their respective Heavy Metals general test procedures. Theo- retically, the three pharmacopeias require testing for heavy metals by dissolving the metal salts and then precipitating them with a sulfide ion, which is compared colorimetricallyagainst a lead standard, similarly treated. Initially, it was assumed that the major difference between the methods was the source of the sulfide ion. All of the pharmacopeiasrequire ignition of HPMC as a step in the sample prepa-ration. Since the temperature used for the ignition of thesamples in the Pharmacopoeia of Japan (JP) and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) was the same, the initial pro- posal was to determine the equivalency of the USP and European Pharmacopoeia (EP) procedures for sample preparation and to compare the three color developmentprocedures, combining parts of each procedure to obtaina harmonized method. However, difficulties were en-countered with the EP procedure, which uses as a reference standard a lead standard that has been taken through the ignition step. The color of the \"ignited standard\" solutionwas essentially the same intensity as the sample and the blank. A more thorough investigation of the test metho- dologies ensued. Investigation To verify that the problem was not due to the differences in the colorimetric portion of the general test procedures, samples of another compound (sodium bicarbonate), which does not require ignition, were tested according to USP Heavy Metals Method /, JP Heavy Metals Method 1, and EP V.3.2.8 Heavy Metals Method A. Equivalent results were obtained. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM procedure D2363-79, \"Standard Test Methods for Hy- droxypropyl Methylcellulose\") recommends that the level * Merck Research Laboratories, Sumneytown Pike, WP78-106, West Point, PA 19486.of lead (heavy metals) in the final test solutions be 20 to40 ng in 40 mL of solution for visual detection of the sulfideprecipitate. The difficulties in determining the intensity of the EP reference standard indicated that the level of lead (Pb) in the EP standard solution was below this level of detection following ignition. An experiment was initiated to confirm the loss of metals during the ignition step. Spiked samples of HPMC were taken through the EP and USP ash procedures and quan- titatively analyzed by atomic absorption to determine the percent recovery of the metals. A Perkin Elmer PE40 In- ductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometer equipped with a suitable PC and autosampler was used for analysis of the sample and standard preparations. Spiked samples were prepared by weighing 200-mg samples of HPMC and adding a 1-mL aliquot of 10-, 20-, and 50-ppm standard solutions containing the following metals: tin (Sn), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), and copper (Cu). All reagents used were reagent grade or better. The USP samples were ig- nited at 550\u00b0C and the EP samples were ignited at 750\u00b0C;the methodology was according to the respective generaltest procedures, except that ash residues were dissolved in nitric acid and diluted to a volume of 10 mL. Standards,sample blanks, and reagent blanks were injected into the ICP along with the samples. Experimental details are given in Appendix 1; Table 1 is a summary of the average re-coveries. Conclusions It was concluded from this experiment that approxi- mately 50% of the metals may be lost during the ash pro- cess. The loss of metals is probably matrix-dependent, and because the procedures are very labor-intensive, recoveries could vary significantly among analysts. Note that mer- cury, which is one of the more toxic heavy metals, was not recovered from either set of samples. The difference be- tween the pharmacopeias in the handling of the reference standard in the general test methods is the basis for the different specifications for Heavy metals that are seen inthe monographs for many substances. A USP limit of 10ppm may be equivalent to the EP limit of 20 ppm. Because of the loss of metals during ignition, the validity of test results obtained with the current USP, JP, and EPgeneral test procedures is questionable. The data thus ob-tained should not be used to justify elimination of Heavy metals requirements in monographs. Additional Information The USP Method III wet digestion procedure should be able to detect some forms of mercury and provide betterrecovery of the other metals.

Consul- tation with several laboratories that routinely perform trace metal analysis confirms that a wet digestion procedure is preferred over ignition. Many laboratories are currently using microwave acid digestion techniques in sample prep- aration. Neither the EP nor the JP includes a wet digestion procedure at this time. Alternatively, if the pharmacopeias decide to retain the general test methods with sample preparation by ignition, spiked control samples should be added. (Appendix 2 is a proposed revision of the USP Method II.) In the pro- posal, the final test solution volumes have been reduced to 25 mL in order to bring the lead concentration to the optimum level for visual detection of the sulfide precipi- tates, as recommended in the ASTM method, considering the approximately 50% loss of lead, which experiments indicate occurs during ignition. Appendix 3 summarizes the changes in the method presented in Appendix 2 as compared to the pharmacopeial methods.It should be noted that improvements in testing may require that some of the Heavy metals limits be increased in the USP monographs that specify Method II. If pro- posals are made to tighten specifications to agree with the EP limits, manufacturers will need to conduct additional testing to confirm that they can meet tightened specifi- cations before they are changed, because previous data would not be applicable. Recommendations (1) USP Method III (wet digestion) should be added to the general test procedures in the EP and JP. (2) The Heavy Metals test procedures in which ignition is used, USP Method II, EP V.3.2.8 Method C, and JP Method 2, should be deleted, or revised to include a spiked control. (3) Spiked control samples should be taken through the general test procedures to validate the methodology for each monograph. (4) Atomic absorption analytical techniques should be in- cluded as an option. APPENDIX 1 Heavy Metals Verification by ICP Objective Results of previous experiments indicated that lead and other \"heavy metals\" may be lost during the ignition step that is required for \"heavy metals\" testing of HPMC. Spiked samples of HPMC were taken through the EP and USP ash procedures and quantitatively analyzed by atomic absorption to determine the % recovery of the metals.

Cool samples and add H 2SO 4 to USP samples and MgSO 4 solution to EP samples. 4. Heat gently on hot plate at a low temperature to avoid splattering. Increase heat as samples beginto char, emitting white fumes, then heat over a Bun-sen burner for 5 to 10 minutes to drive off some carbon and the remaining fumes. 5. Place in a muffle furnace at the specified temper- atures for approximately 1 hour. (Do not exceed 2 hours total ignition time.)6.

Also, the ICP was standardized with a standard that did not contain arsenic and thus gave erroneous readings due to noisy peaksand interference. The experiment was repeated the fol- lowing day (2/16/94) with higher concentrations of stan- dards.(2/16/94) The results of the duplicate injections were in good agree- ment. Standards placed early in the run read at the proper levels, but toward the end of the run they were reading higher (approximately 110% of the expected value). Therefore, the samples were calculated against the stan-dard placed near them in the autosampler.

This group ordinarily includes Ag, Hg, Pb, and Cu. The pro- gram on the ICP was set up to test all water samples for the traditional qualitative analytical groups I and II. These groups include all of the heavy metals except silver, which is tested for separately by precipitation with chloride ion, and the additional metals, Sn, As, Sb, Cd, and Bi. TheICP program functions better with all of the ions included in the standard. (2) The difference in recovery of the heavy metals is not significant, but recoveries are slightly better for most of the elements in spiked samples prepared according to theUSP ash procedure.(3) Mercury is lost in both procedures. (4) Of the remaining heavy metals, lead exhibits the low- est recovery level and is thus a good choice for the stan- dard. \u00a9 1995 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.

(6) This comparison was performed only once; the USP and EP procedures are both very labor-intensive. (7) Another potential sample preparation is to use Method II of the USP general test for Arsenic <211 >. Conclusion Approximately 50% of the metals are lost during the ashing process; therefore, a spiked 200-mg sample shouldbe taken through the same procedure as the sample, and used as the reference standard. The final concentration of the sample and standard solutions must be set at an op- timum level for color development in order to facilitate the determination. According to ASTM D2363-79 \"Stan- dard Test Methods for Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\" the optimum lead content in 40 mL should be between 20 and 40 ng for visual comparison.

Larry Paul, USP Division of Standards Development* Introduction Recommendations for replacing the current colorimetric Lead test in the National Formulary monograph on Mag- nesium Stearate with atomic absorption tests for cadmium,lead, and nickel were discussed in a Stimuli article, Mag-nesium Stearate\u2014Proposed Limits for Cadmium, Lead, and Nickel, in the January-February 1995 number of Pharmacopeial Forum. The article provided comparisonsof literature toxicity values for these metals with maximum daily intake values based on maximum daily dosing of a currently marketed pharmaceutical product formulated with an above average level of magnesium stearate. These comparisons were then used to make a recommendation, from a safety and toxicity viewpoint, regarding the needto include atomic absorption tests for these metals in theMagnesium Stearate monograph. To expand this review to other excipients, the USP in- itiated a survey of all official USP correspondents to obtain maximum daily intake data for 28 frequently used excip-ients selected by the USP Subcommittee on Excipients. The survey responses, representing the highest reported intake for each of the selected excipients, are presented in Table 1. During the review of the survey responses, con- cerns were raised about the proper way to apply the dailyexcipient intake values to the establishment of safety- andtoxicity-based test limits in the compendial monographs. In the discussion that follows, a hypothetical product that would be possible based on the survey responses is used to illustrate two ways to approach this issue. Individual Component Approach The hypothetical product contains at least four ingre- dients in a formulation so that one dose unit weighs over 2 grams. Based on the maximum daily dose for this for-mulation and the current limits specified under Heavy Metals <231 > or Lead (251) in the NF monographs for the four ingredients, the amount of lead provided in the worst case by each ingredient is as follows: ingredient A, 23.4 jug; ingredient B, 66.2 jug; ingredient C, 15.7 ixg; and ingredient D, 3.2 jig (Table 2). These four ingredients individually do not provide lead levels that exceed the 75 ixg per day provisional tolerable total intake level (PTTIL) for lead, as provided in the Federal Register. In the individual component approach to the establish- ment of lead limits, the lead limit for ingredient A, forexample, based on the 75 ng PTTIL and the maximumdaily intake of ingredient A in the formulation, would beslightly less than 0.001%, as opposed to the current ingre- dient A monograph lead limit of 0.0003%. However, if * W. Larry Paul, Ph.D., is the staff liaison to the 1990-1995 USP Subcommittee on Excipients.ingredient A containing this maximum 0.001% lead level is used in the formulation, there must be no detectable lead in any other component of the formulation. In reality, this is probably never the case. The total daily intake oflead from this formulation, based only on the above in- gredients, is 108.5 ixg in the worst case, which exceeds the 75 fig limit by 33.5 ng. Data used to calculate these values are shown in Table 2. Composite Component Approach A more appropriate approach to the establishment of lead limits appears to be the composite component ap- proach because this approach reflects the practical situ- ation where components may not be completely lead-free;and it also reflects the total amount of lead being consumedwhen the product is ingested. This seems to be consistentwith California Proposition 65, which specifies a total dailylead intake limit on a product-by-product basis. The com-posite component approach based on PTTIL levels requiresthe determination of the maximum amount of lead thateach component may contribute to the formulation withoutcausing the total lead level to exceed the limit of 75 ixgper day. In the survey-derived formulation, this value wouldbe 16.2 ng for ingredient A, based on the 75/108.5 ratio. This corresponds to a maximum allowable lead level of 0.0002% (2 ppm) for the ingredient A used in this for- mulation. This value is in good agreement with the lead limit of 0.0003% in the current ingredient A monograph.PTTIL-based values for the components of the survey-de-rived formulation are shown in Table 3. The limit obtained by this composite component ap- proach is dependent on the lead content in each component of the formulation. In the survey-derived formulation ex-ample, if totally lead-free ingredient B were used, for ex-ample, the resulting lead limit for the ingredient A com-ponent would increase from 0.0002% to 0.0005%; however,the 0.0002% limit represents the worst case, in which each of the four ingredients in the formulation contains the com- pendial limit of lead. When based on the California Proposition 65 require- ments, the limits obtained by the composite componentapproach are much lower. California Proposition 65 spec-ifies a limit of not more than 0.5 jug of lead per day perproduct. Based on this limit, the resulting lead limit forthe ingredient A component of the survey-derived for-mulation is 0.11 g or 0.000001% (10 ppb). This value is at or close to the lowest reasonably achievable detection limit with graphite furnace atomic absorption instruments.

Forum Volume 21, Number 6 Discussion Even if the hypothetical formulation referenced in this article provides more ingredient A daily than does any other pharmaceutical dosage form, it may not be appro- priate to base the ingredient A monograph lead limit solely on the amount of ingredient A in this specific productbecause the total amount of lead provided by all compo-nents of the product must be considered. The survey for- mulation may contain more ingredient A than any otherproduct, but, as shown in Table 2, the major source of lead in this product theoretically is ingredient B, not ingredient A. As mentioned previously, if totally lead-free ingredient B were used in the survey formulation, the allowable lead limit for the ingredient A component, based on PTTIL levels, would increase from 0.0002% to 0.0005%. The composite component approach was not taken in the January-February 1995 Stimuli article. Other com-ponents in the formulation could contribute, significantly perhaps, to the total lead, cadmium, or nickel in the for-mulation. Also, the Stimuli article states that \"a proposal to tighten the Pb limit in the Magnesium Stearate mono- graph from the current 10 ppm value to 7 ppm would, therefore, seem to be consistent with the Proposition 65 limit.\" This statement implies, as stated above in the dis- cussion of the individual component approach, that other components of the dosage form do not contain any meas-urable amounts of lead. The individual component approach and the composite component approach discussed in this article are primarilybased on provisional tolerable total intake levels. If either approach is used to determine daily lead limits, for ex-ample, based on a single pharmaceutical dosage form, this would seem to require that an individual not consume anylead from any other source during the day. This may notbe a realistic requirement. How meaningful is a total daily lead intake limit if the individual's lead intake from allindividual lead-containing sources is not monitored, con- trolled, and limited; and how meaningful is a single-sourcelead intake limit, i.e., for a specific food item, dosage form, etc., if the individual's total daily lead intake is not mon- itored, controlled, and limited? Another concern related to the presence of heavy metals in excipients is the potential effect of metallic impurities, notably iron, on the stability of a formulation. This phys-icochemical incompatibility concern is product formula-tion-specific. Company A, for example, is likely to have at least one product that is much more sensitive to ironcontamination than the rest of the company's products. Also, company A's formulation for a given product may be more sensitive to iron contamination than company B's formulation of the \"same\" product. If there are no toxicityconcerns associated with the presence of metallic impur- ities in a given article, should the control of the presence of these metallic impurities for physicochemical incom-patibility reasons, perhaps by graphite furnace atomic ab- sorption procedures, be within the purview of the com-pendia or be addressed through individual chemical supplier-pharmaceutical manufacturer purchase specifi- cations? The USP welcomes reader comments regarding the es- tablishment of compendial heavy metals limit specifica- tions, wet chemistry versus atomic absorption spectropho- tometry test procedures, the California Proposition 65approach, and related issues. Readers are invited to sub- mit their comments to Dr. W. Larry Paul, Division of Standards Development, USP headquarters. Table 1.

It should be noted that since November 1992 the USP has had a state- ment that the \"Sulphated Ash\" method of the EP is consid- ered to be equivalent to the \"Residue on Ignition\" method of the USP, except where noted in the monograph. The temper- ature specified in the JP proposal is that used in the EP method. Given this history, it is not anticipated that significant problems would arise should this method become official in the USP. However, it is important that manufacturers inform us of specific items where problems might be anticipated, so that monographs for these items can be revised, if necessary, to accommodate the new conditions.

Residue on Ignition/Sulphated Ash Test The Residue on Ignition/Sulphated Ash Test is a meth- od to measure the amount of residual substance notvolatilized from a sample when the sample is ignited inthe presence of sulfuric acid according to the proceduredescribed below. This test is usually used for determiningthe content of inorganic impurities in an organic substance,but in some cases, it is used for determining the amountof inorganic components in an organic substance or theamount of impurities in an inorganic substance volatilizableby heating. Procedure Ignite a suitable crucible of platinum, quartz or porcelain for 30 minutes at 600\u00b150\u00b0C, cool the crucible in a desiccator (silica gel) and weigh it accurately. Take the amount of test sample specified in the individualmonograph in the crucible and weigh the crucibleaccurately. Moisten the sample with a small amount (usually 1 mL) of sulfuric acid, then heat gently at a temperature as low as practicable until the sample is thoroughly charred.

Egan, Analytical Research Department, Merck Research Laboratories, Merck &Co., Inc. ABSTRACT A multi-element inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method has been demonstrated to be a suitable alternative to both USP Heavy Metals h231iand USP Residue on Ignition h281ifor drug substances, intermedi- ates, and raw materials. This ICP-MS method, combined with a direct-dissolution sample preparation procedure, is simpler, faster, more sensitive, and element specic. It consumes less sample and provides semiquantitative to quantitative resultscovering all elements of pharmaceutical interest and offers other advantages discussed herein. INTRODUCTION Metal or inorganic contamination of bulk drug sub- stances, intermediates, and raw materials may be introducedin many ways, e.g., from reagents, solvents, electrodes, re-action vessels, plumbing and other equipment used in the synthesis, as well as via exposure to airborne particles or from container-closure systems. Most importantly, metalsmay be introduced by the utilization of catalysts at varioussteps during the synthesis. Because metals can catalyze de- composition and are potentially toxic, the metal content of process intermediates and nal drug substances is widelymonitored. The United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) Heavy Metals h231iand similar tests provided in the European Pharmaco- poeia (Ph. Eur.) and the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) ( 1-3), consist of the precipitation of metal suldes from an aque-ous solution and the visual comparison of the color of thatpreparation to the color of a simultaneously and similarly treated standard lead solution. In order to obtain an aqueous solution for testing, ignition and combustion of the samplesin a muffle furnace is often required in a preliminary step. Inaddition, after one adjusts the pH and adds either freshly prepared hydrogen sulde or thioacetamide-glycerin base TS, the colors of the different metal suldes range fromwhite to yellow, orange, brown, and black ( 4), making the visual comparison with the dark brown-colored lead suldedifcult. Furthermore, apart from the colors of the formedsuldes, there is no information about the identities of the metals that caused the positive result. USP Residue on Ignition (ROI) h281i(5) and the similar sulfated ash limit test in Ph. Eur. also do not provide anyinformation about the identity of inorganic impurities in the samples. These tests consist of heating 1 to 2 g of thesample in a suitable crucible that previously has been ig-nited, cooled, and weighed until the substance is thoroughlycharred. The charred substance is then moistened by 1 mLof sulfuric acid, heated again until white fumes no longer areevolved, and ignited at 800 /C6258until the carbon is con- sumed. The residue is then cooled in a desiccator before itis weighed to determine the percentage of residue. Some-times this procedure must be repeated in order to get a con-stant weight of the residue. For USP Heavy Metals h231i, Pb, Hg, Bi, As, Sb, Sn, Cd, Ag, Cu, and Mo typically will respond, but for USP Residue on Ignition h281i, all elements that potentially react with sulfuric acid to form sulfat ed ash will respond. However, we observe that most of the time the alkaline and alkalineearth elements produce substantial amounts of sulfated ash. Although both methods are still widely accepted and used in the pharmaceutical industry, they are nonspecic, insen-sitive, time-consuming, an d labor intensive. USP Heavy Metals h231ihas been shown to be suitable only for a few limited elements and has not been shown to be equallysensitive to all. In our laboratory it frequently yields eitherlow recoveries or erroneous results. USP ROIh281iis not applicable to drug substances that are inorganic (e.g., so- dium) salts. In addition, each test consumes a minimum of1 to 2 g of sample, which can be a major problem when the quantities of the intermediates or the drug substances to be tested are limited. Attempts have been made to improve these pharmaco- peial methods to alleviate some of the limitations and short-comings, but no major improvements have been achieved(6-7). We have recently published an ICP-MS method as an alternative to USP Heavy Metals h231i(8) and now wish to provide justication to expand its use to also cover USPROIh281i. NEW TECHNOLOGY Since 1980 ICP-MS has emerged as a major and power- ful technique in elemental analysis ( 9), an area traditionally dominated by optical atomic spectrometry methods. In ap-proximately 10 years, ICP-MS has progressed from a lab-oratory experiment to commercial development and wide- lCorrespondence should be addressed to Tiebang Wang, Analytical Re- search Department, Merck Research Laboratories, P.O. Box 2000, THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 29(4) [July-Aug. 2003] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 1328 #2003 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision Processspread analytical application ( 10-16 ). This growth is fueled primarily by the fact that ICP-MS offers extremely low de- tection limits that range from sub-part per billion (ppb) to sub-part per trillion (ppt) detection limits for most elements. In most cases, these detection limits are 100 to 1000 timessuperior to those that can be routinely achieved by Induc- tively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). In addition, these detection limits are broadlyachieved for almost all elements across the periodic table. Furthermore, the simpler mass spectra versus the much more complex optical spectra of the elements make thistechnique a quick tool for automated qualitative, semiquan- titative, and quantitative elemental analysis. In view of the superior and broad detection capability of ICP-MS and also because of the limitations inherent in USP Heavy Metals h231i and USP Residue on Ignition h281i prescribed by USP and Ph. Eur., a multi-element surveytype ICP-MS method has been developed and employedat Merck as an alternative method. This method analyzes all sulde-forming and sulfate-forming elements plus other elements with greatly enhanced specicity, sensitivity,speed, precision, and accuracy. In addition, because only part-per-million (ppm) levels of metals of pharmaceutical interest will be noted and reported, data processing and in- terpretation are also extremely simple. In most cases, a 5-second glance at the raw data will reveal the answers to the corresponding equivalent USP limit tests\u2014that is, they pass or fail the limit tests for both heavy metals and ROIin a single run because more than 95% of the compounds tested contain no signicant amount of inorganic impurities. SAMPLE PREPARATION In addition to the extreme sensitivity and specicity of the ICP-MS method, the sample preparation scheme for the si- multaneous Heavy Metals andROI tests is also simple and straightforward. Experience of handling thousands of phar-maceutical samples reveals that at least 99% of these sam-ples are readily soluble in 80% (v/v) nitric acid solution. Onsome occasions, sonication may be needed to solubilize the samples or speed up their solubilization. In rare cases when samples do not dissolve, either a microwave digestion meth-od can be used or the USP Heavy Metals andROI tests can be carried out as usual. With the method proposed in thisarticle, each sample can be prepared and analyzed in lessthan 15 minutes after initialization of the instrument, pro- vided no microwave digestion is needed. By contrast, the USP Heavy Metals andROI tests may each take several hours or longer to perform for one sample, particularly whensample combustion/digestion is involved. Another advan- tage of the proposed method is that only about 10 to 100 mg of sample is consumed for both the Heavy Metals and ROI tests using the ICP-MS method. Furthermore, for potent compounds and other hazardous materials, the samples are denatured in 80% (v/v) nitric acidduring the sample preparation procedure, and the dissolved samples can be analyzed safely using the ICP-MS method. In contrast, to perform the USP Heavy Metals test and par-ticularly the USP ROItest, expensive and cumbersome con- tainment facilities are required during sample preparation.In most laboratories, this would render the USP Heavy Me- talsand ROI tests impractical for potent and hazardous compounds. METHOD PROCEDURE Instrumentation \u2014A Perkin-Elmer Elan AS-91 auto-sampler was used throughout this study. The instrumental conditions and general method parameters are listed in Table 1 . Sample Analysis \u2014After instrument warm-up (30-40 minutes), a two-point of analyzing the (80% nitric solu-tion) and the mixed 69-element calibration standard (20 mg/ L for all elements except Na, Si, P, K, Ca, and Fe, which are1000mg/L). All regulatory samples are spiked at a level equivalent to 10 mg/kg (10 ppm) of the metals that are sen-sitive to USP Heavy Metals h231iin solid sample (10 mg/L in solution). A spike recovery of 60-140% is required foreach element. To monitor the drift of the instrument, themixed 69-element standard (ICP-MS) is reanalyzed as a sample every 10 samples and at the end of the analysis. REPORTING RESULTS A) Heavy Metals Test\u2014 If those elements sensitive to the USP Heavy Metals test or the sum of these elements arefound to have a concentration of higher than 10 ppm, the sample should be reanalyzed for those specic elementsby a different atomic spectroscopic method such as ICP- AES and/or atomic absorption spectrometry. B) ROI Test\u2014 Results from the ICP-MS analysis will be used for the conversions from ppm cations to the equivalent USP ROIh281iunless a % ROIresult of higher than 0.05% is obtained. In this case, those elements with concentrationshigher than their corresponding Limits of Quantitation or 10ppm (whichever is larger) should be analyzed by a different atomic spectroscopic method (such as ICP-AES and/or atomic absorption spectrometry), and the results from theICP-AES and/or atomic absorption spectrometry will beused for the conversions from ppm cations to the equivalent USP h281iROI.STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 29(4) [July-Aug. 2003] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 1329 #2003 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessMETHOD VALIDATION Validation of the method for use as an alternative to the USP Heavy Metals h231itest was provided in our recent publication (8). That validation is also applicable for use of the method as an alternative for USP ROIh281i ,a n d the data will not be repeated here. In summary, the analysis of National Institute of Stan- dards and Technology (NIST) 1643d (Trace Elements inWater) standard reference material and the spiking experi- ments showed excellent to acceptable accuracy for a semi-quantitative method, with the exception of Fe (results shown inTable 2 ). The erroneously high data for Fe using both 54Fe and57Fe result from spectral interferences mainly from 14N40Ar,16O38Ar, and40Ar16O1H, which cannot be circum- vented with the current instrument capabilities. Spiked sam- ples also demonstrated acceptable method precision, andspiked blanks provided Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limitof Quantitation (LOQ) values that were below part-per-mil- lion (ppm) levels for all elements of pharmaceutical interest. The LOD and LOQ values are provided in Table 3 . Matrix effects and spectral interference \u2014Positive re- sults at moderate levels for some elements in the presence ofone or more other high-level elements should always be in-vestigated further for spectral interferences or by conrming the results with an alternative method such as ICP-AES or Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy(GFAAS). Matrix effects are minimized by running the calibration blank and calibration standard in the same matrix as in the samples and by dissolving a minimum amount ofsample in the solution to be analyzed (0.1% total dissolvedsolids), taking advantage of the extremely high sensitivity of the ICP-MS. Spectral interferences are monitored by using more than one isotope for the same element whenever pos-sible for some interference-prone low-mass elements. EQUIVALENCE OF THE ICP-MS METHOD TO USP h281iROI A demonstration of the equivalence of the ICP-MS meth- od and the USP h281iROI procedure was provided by the analysis of six typical drug substances by both methods. The results are given in Table 4 andTable 5 . The agreements are excellent. UTILIZATION OF THE METHOD A survey method that permits simultaneous qualitative to quantitative detection (depending on the elements and theconcentration levels) of up to 69 elements, including all those of pharmaceutical inte r e s t ,i nl e s st h a n1 5m i n u t e s would be viewed by some as a giant leap forward compared to traditional USP methods. The use of such a method,which employs a very sophisticated and expensive instru- ment, as an alternative to a seemingly economical wet chemical test that has been in use for decades would beviewed by others as technological overkill.We take a less extreme view and believe that because the equipment is already present in the laboratory to addressother very challenging analytical problems, its application to more mundane uses is simply good resource manage- ment. We have found that the extensive use of the ICP-MS for this elemental survey analysis does not degrade its capability for even more challenging tasks. CONCLUSION The proposed method uses direct dissolution of the sam- ples in 80% nitric acid solution combined with ICP-MS as the analytical tool. It is an attractive alternative method for both USP Heavy Metals h231iand USP ROIh281i.T h e availability of the ICP-MS in the laboratory offers much more rapid, sensitive, precise, simple, and element-specicanalysis. Furthermore, it con sumes far less sample and is safely applicable to potent compounds and other hazardousmaterials.

Geary* ABSTRACT USP General Chapter Heavy Metals h231ihas been the subject of discussion within the industry for several years, and its deciencies were discussed during a USP Open Conference that was convened in June, 2003 in Philadelphia, PA. This Stimuli article reviews a few of the problems with USP h231iand outlines the changes USP is considering for a future proposal. USP General Chapter Heavy Metals h231ihas been the subject of discussion within the industry for several years. Deciencies of the method were recently the topic of the USP Open Conference on Analytical Methods and GeneralUSP Topics that was held in June 2003 in Philadelphia. TheBasel Working Group on the Determination of Metal Traces presented a thorough discussion of the problems encoun- tered using h231ifor heavy metals screening. To summarize their paper, ''USP h231iwas never intended to be a univer- sal test for heavy metals as it is currently applied.'' Methods I, II, andIIIsuffer to some degree from the lack of specicity using colorimet ric detection. Not all heavy metals are detected by the procedure. The method is capableonly of detecting metals precipitated by sulde and thosethat produce a black or brown precipitate. The use of a 6008C ignition temperature causes loss of analyte, espe- cially mercury, and has been conrmed as a cause of false negative results.USP is proposing the following changes to Heavy Metals h231i:T h e Method II preparation using high-temperature ignition will be withdrawn. Methods I andIIIwill be con- tinued. Colorimetric detection for these preparations will becontinued, but an alternative method of detection, Induc-tively Coupled Plasma/Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP/AES), will be approved for both Method I andMethod III,which will permit the user to choose either method of detection. USP intends to seek additional alternatives to col-orimetric detection, such as x-ray fluorescence, atomic ab- sorption, and electroanalytical methods. These alternativeswill be proposed when sufcient data are available to attest to their effectiveness. *Correspondence should be addressed to John T.

All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessInductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy as an Alternative to the Heavy Metals Test Martha Schenkenberger*and Nancy Lewen ABSTRACT There has been growing concern regarding the use of the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) test for Heavy Metals, Method II h231i. A recent publication ( 3) describes the use of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP- MS) as an alternative to the compendial heavy metals test. USP recognizes that the current method utilizes dated technology and has proposed that modern spectroscopic techniques be us ed to perform the heavy metals testing of pharmaceutical ingredients. A general chapter on plasma spectrochemistry was proposed in Pharmacopeial Forum (4). This article describes the use of another spectroscopic technique, inductively couple d plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), as an alternative to the compendial heavy metals test. ICP-OES offers many advantages overthe compendial method. It is a rapid, multielement technique that can be used to assay for the following elements: antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), bismuth (Bi), cadmium (C d), indium (In), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), selenium (Se ), silver (Ag), and tin (Sn). O ther advantages to the use of this technique include the fact that only a small quantity of sample is required, and it provides element-specic results. INTRODUCTION Recent publications ( 1, 2, 3 ) have proposed the use of in- ductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as an alternative to the USP test for Heavy Metals, Method II h231i. Additionally, a general chapter on plasma spectro- chemistry was proposed in Pharmacopeial Forum (4). As a result, the authors propose an inductively coupled plas- ma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) method asa possible alternative to the compendial method in chapter h231i for heavy metals. This method would provide ele- ment-specic quantitative results for the following ele- ments: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), indium (In), tin (Sn),antimony (Sb), lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), silver (Ag), mercury (Hg), ruthenium (Ru), and molybdenum (Mo). Platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and selenium (Se) may also be deter-mined because these elements either are frequently used as catalysts or are sufciently toxic to warrant examination. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Accurately prepare a 1% solution of sample dissolved in a suitable solvent in an acid-washed volumetric flask. (A suit-able solvent is one that is capable of completely dissolving the solid sample and does not provide any analytical inter-ferences when introduced into the ICP-OES instrument.Additionally, a suitable solvent should be relatively non- volatile, such as deionized water, dilute nitric acid, dilute hydrochloric acid, or a solution of butoxyethanol and water[25:75].) If necessary, add an appropriate internal standard according to the guidelines detailed in the proposed generalchapter on plasma spectrochemistry in PF(4). Prepare working standard solutions that contain 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ mL each of As, Cd, In, Sb, Pb, Bi, Hg, Ru, Mo, Pt, Pd, and, if necessary, an appropriate internal standard accordingto the guidelines detailed in the proposed general chapter on plasma spectrochemistry ( 4). Dilute to volume with the same solvent used to dissolve and dilute the sample. Prepare a second set of working standard solutions that contain 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL each of Se and Ag and, if necessary, an ap- propriate internal standard according to the guidelines de- tailed in the proposed general chapter on plasmaspectrochemistry ( 4). Dilute to volume with the same sol- vent used to dissolve and dilute the sample. Using either an axial or lateral ICP-OES instrument, se- lect at least three wavelengths per analyte element. Follow the guidelines detailed in the proposed general chapter on plasma spectrochemistry in PF(4) for calibration and analysis. REFERENCES 1. Wang, T.; Wu, J.; Hartman, Jia, 23:867-890. 2. Blake, K.

All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision Process\u00a9 of PF 28(5) [Sept.-Oct. 2002]. On the basis of comments received, the use of a pH meter to adjust the pH in Method I and Method III is proposed. Situations in which the Monitor Preparation has a lighter color than the Standard Preparation have been reported. This problem could indicate that the pH is out of range, and external pH short-range paper indicators may not be accurate enough to detect this change. In addition to these changes, and tobe consistent with Methods I and II , a formula to calculate the amount of substance to be tested is added in Method III . Method II also reflects changes to the USP test appearing under the harmonization section (see page 1570 of PF 28(5) [Sept.-Oct 2002]). These changes are based on suggestions made in a Stimuli article by K. B. Blake entitled Harmonization of the USP, EP, and JP Heavy Metals Testing Procedures (see page 1632 of PF 21(6) [Nov.-Dec. 1995]). The Blake article concludes that the ashing process in Method II is responsible for a loss of as much as 100% of mercury content and up to 50% of the heavy metals present. Improvements in heavy metal limit determination by Method II are expected following the inclusion of a Monitor Preparation, an increase in the amount of sample, and a corresponding increase in the amount of lead in both the Standard Preparation and the Monitor Preparation . The Monitor Preparation is intended as a means of validating the use of Method 1I, with the instruction to proceed to Method III if the solution from the Monitor Preparation is less colored than the solution from the Standard Preparation . Comments regarding this proposal are invited and should be submitted by March 15, 2004. (PA6: H.

The USP 28 -NF 23 test has been used in industry for some time. The search continues for a more robust and practical method. This change will appear in the Third Interim Revision Announcement to USP 29 -NF 24 which will be published in Pharmacopeial Forum 32(3) and will become official on June 1, 2006. Should you have any questions, please contact Kahkashan Zaidi, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, 2012 USPC, Inc. the Revision Chapter on Inorganic Heavy Metals Chapter on Inorganic Heavy Metals USP Ad Hoc Advisory Panel on Inorganic Impurities and Heavy Metals and USP Staff* ABSTRACT In the ICH Q3A Impurities in Drug Substances guidance, impurities are classified as organic, inorganic, and residual solvents. Within the inorganic impurities classification, the metals listed in Table 1 are important to control in food, dietary supplements, and drug articles. Many toxic metal impurities found in pharmaceutical articles have been controlled for years by application of the Heavy Metals test described in USP-NF General Chapter Heavy Metals 231 . However, the procedures and the methods contained in 231 lack the sensitivity, specificity, and recovery to monitor properly the levels of these metals. A number of additional chapters for the control of specific metals and other inorganic impurities are contained in USP-NF . This Stimuli article proposes a new USP General Chapter for the control of inorganic impurities in drug and dietary supplement articles intended for use in humans. For the purposes of this article, inorganic impurity, metal, and element all refer to those elements listed in Table 1 . The proposed new General Chapter recommends procedures that rely on modern analytical technology and includes limits that are based on toxicity and exposure levels for the selected metals. The new General Chapter also introduces aperformance-based approach for the selection of the appropriate technology. This chapter is proposed to replace 231 and may impact other General Chapters that control metals. INTRODUCTION Among the category of inorganic impurities, metal impurities have long been monitored in food and drug articles intended for consumption by humans and other animals. For purposes of this General Chapter, drug articles include: drug substances andproducts (including natural-source and rDNA biologics) and excipients. Dietary supplements and their ingredients are alsoincluded, but other foods and food ingredients will not be addressed. Some metals may pose no significant health hazard atsufficiently low exposure levels, when present as certain complexes, at certain oxidation states, or in organic combinations. Thischapter should be considered a screening method to identify the presence of potentially hazardous elements. Where speciation of an element is important, further testing is necessary. In these cases, the monograph will include specific instructions forappropriate identification and control. The topic of speciation will not be covered further in this article. Some inorganic impurities are toxic at low levels, and these impurities should be monitored to ensure safety. Sources of inorganic impurities include those that are deliberately added to the process (e.g., catalysts), those that are carried through a process that isconducted according to good manufacturing practices (e.g., undetected contaminants from starting materials or reagents), thosecoming from the process (e.g., leaching from pipes and other equipment), and those that occur naturally (e.g., from naturallyderived plant or mineral sources). Regardless of source, the control of these impurities may be certified by a vendor, butpurchasers also must corroborate the absence of impurities before using these materials in a manufactured article. The General Chapters Expert Committee of the USP Council of Experts formed an Ad Hoc Advisory Panel on Inorganic Impurities and Heavy Metals to assist the Expert Committee in revision of General Chapter Heavy Metals 231 . As drafted by this Ad Hoc Advisory Panel and revised by the Expert Committee, the proposed revision specifies that the level of each inorganic impurity should not exceed the limit defined in Table 1 or otherwise specified in the individual monograph. This level is determined by concomitant comparison with a monitor solution and USP Reference Standard solution(s). The selection of an instrumental technique and a procedure for the evaluation of the inorganic impurities specified in Table 1 requires the evaluation of a large number of variables including, among others, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, compatibility, time, and cost. The method selected may include plasma spectrochemistry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, or any other method thatdisplays requisite accuracy (trueness and uncertainty) and established sensitivity and specificity. Meeting this requirement must bedemonstrated experimentally using the USP Reference Standard(s) . Any procedure that provides measurement values within \u00b1 20% of the certified concentration for each element in the appropriate USP Reference Standard(s) is considered to be an acceptable procedure to demonstrate compliance. A guide for the selection of a procedure is presented in Figure 1 . When a manufacturer does not have a preferred procedure, or when the preferred procedure does not meet criteria for performancedescribed above, proceed as directed in the remainder of this General Chapter.\u00a9 2012 USPC, Inc. 34(5) Stimuli to the Revision Process: Chapter on Inorganic Impurities: Heavy Metals http://www.usppf.com/pf/pub/data/v345/GEN_STIMULI_345_pf345-stim1.xml[12/7/2012 1:29:00 PM]Procedure\u2014 Determine the levels of individual inorganic impurities by the test, unless the individual monograph specifies otherwise. Reagents\u2014 All reagents used for the preparation of sample and standard solutions should be free of inorganic impurities in accordance with Plasma Spectrochemistry 730 .

Inductively coupled plasma-atomic (optical) emission coupled plasma-mass spectrometer. In addition, a closed-vessel microwave digestion system may be required for the preparation of test materials (see Figure 1 ). METHOD Sample PreparationDetermine the means of sample preparation using the flow chart in Figure 1 . The sample preparation scheme should provide sufficient sample loading to allow quantification of each element at the specified limit stated in the corresponding monograph or as stated in Table 1 . For closed-vessel microwave digestions follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures to ensure safe usage. Use utmost caution if concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used for the preparation of test articles, and review orestablish local procedures for safe handling, safe disposal, and HF-tolerant instrumental configurations. [ NOTE \u2014The specific details of the Sample preparation have not been included in this Stimuli article but have been developed by the Ad Hoc Advisory Panel. The decision to exclude the specific method details from the Stimuli article is based on the desire of the Ad Hoc Advisory Panel to receive feedback on the concepts proposed herein rather than on the specific method. Based on the feedback received,these details may be included in future chapter development. ] System Suitability Criteria \u2014 Method reporting limitThe method reporting limit (MRL) is defined as the lowest element concentration of a solution prepared in the working calibration standard matrix that can be experimentally determined to within \u00b1 30% of the prepared concentration. The sensitivity criterion forthe method is that the MRL is 0.5 \u00d7 the USP limit for each applicable element. Recovery The suitability of the sample preparation scheme must be demonstrated by preparation and analysis of a suitable USP Reference Standard and by spike recovery measurements of the specific test article according to 730 . The spiked test article solution will be referred to as a Monitor solution . The experimental concentration results shall be \u00b1 20% of the certified concentration for each required element in the analysis. The spike recovery results for the Monitor solution must be \u00b1 20% of the spike concentration for each element. Analysis of a suitable USP Reference Standard shall be included with the analyses of test articles and must be within \u00b1 20% of the certified concentration for each required element for the results to be considered acceptable.

Standard curve acceptance criteria must be met according to 730 . If the concentration of an element in the test article solution is determined to be greater than 110% of the highest calibration standard concentration, the test article solution should be appropriately diluted within the range of the standard curve and then re-analyzed. DriftTo monitor instrument drift, analyze a working standard solution at an intermediate concentration of each element immediately following standardization, following the final test solution, and during the analysis at a frequency of one working standard solutionanalysis per not more than 10 sample analyses during the analytical run. The check standard results should agree to within \u00b130% of the prepared concentration for each element. Reanalyze element results for test article solutions that are not bracketedwith results within the tolerance for the check standard.

The article focuses on four metallic elements of known toxicity: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). The Stimuli article presents literature studies, along with the specic rationale for the proposed limits. This article also references the EMEA guidance on metal catalysts as a basis for certain other elemental impurities and presents specic considerations regarding dietary supplement products. INTRODUCTION The objective of this Stimuli article is to provide ratio- nale in support of safe limits for certain elemental impu- rities in pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. For pharmacopeial purposes, elemental impurities are de- ned as elements that are found in the environment orthat are used or introduced in the manufacture of drug substances or excipients. The term elemental impurities is adopted here as an alternative to the ill-dened term hea- vy metals , and the highlighted elemental impurities in- clude various transition metals and metalloids. Inaddition to catalysts or reagents normally used in chem- ical synthesis, sources of elemental impurities in pharma-ceuticals could include minerals used in the manufacture of excipients, container-closure systems, and other pro- duct contact surfaces. Elemental impurities are those ele-ments that are not complete ly removed by practical manufacturing techniques and should be evaluated rela-tive to safety-based limits. The permissible daily exposure (PDE) values provided for each highlighted elemental impurity have been adopted from published evaluations by regulatory bodies. USP has considered the rationale for referencedoses (RfDs) published by the US Environmental Protec- tion Agency (EPA) ( 1) as well as PDEs listed in the Guide- line on the Specication Limits for Residues of Metal Catalysts or Metal Reagents (2). The EMEA guidance ac- knowledges that ''owing to wide variability of the nature,quality, and quantity of toxicological data amongst themetal elements of interest, it is not possible to employ a totally consistent approach.'' That is also the case for the PDE rationale highlighted below. To that end, USPwill advise EMEA of inconsistencies, if any are found, inthe data. METHODS FOR ESTABLISHING EXPOSURE LIMITS The PDEs ( mg/day) were derived from the most sensi- tive toxicological endpoint using a standard set of as-sumptions for the risk assessment:/C1510 g/day dose for drug products for calculation ofppm limits /C1550-kg person for extrapolation from animal data on a body weight-basis /C1570-year lifetime /C1510% bioavailability for extrapolation from the oral PDE to the parenteral PDE. Appropriate uncertainty factors were applied to the lowest no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or low-est observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). The applied uncertainty factors span orders of magnitude and are considered adequate to account for the proportion ofthe total acceptable daily exposure attributable to drug product relative to other sources of exposure (i.e., food, water). Thus, adjustments for relative source contribu-tion were not conducted. CLASS 1 ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES Arsenic (As) Introduction The natural abundance of arsenic in the Earth's crust is about 1.8 ppm. Arsenic will partly substitute for phos-phorus in biochemical reactions. The largest worldwideproduction of arsenic occurs in China. Arsenic is used in glass production, light-emitting diodes, and many other places. Toxicokinetics: GI tract (> 90%) and lungs; are dis-tributed primarily to the liver, kidney, lung, spleen, aorta,a n ds k i n ;a n da sm u c ha s8 0 %o fad o s ei se x c r e t e d mainly in the urine within 61 hours following oral dosing (3-5). Pentavalent arsenic is reduced to the trivalent form and then is methylated in the liver to less toxic methylar- sinic acids ( 4). Toxicological Effects Acute oral toxicity is characterized by GI and neuro- logical effects ( 6), and acute oral LD 50values range from about 10 to 300 mg/kg ( 4, 7).

All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision Processhave resulted in immunosuppression, ( 8) and hepato- renal effects ( 9-14 ). have enlargement with brosis 15, 16 ). Reduction in litter size, high male/female birth ratios, and fetotoxi- city without signicant fetal abnormalities have occurred following oral exposures ( 17-19 ). Parenteral dosing has resulted system abnormalities ( 20-23 ). Human Toxicology 1.The data reported in these studies show an increasedincidence of blackfoot disease that increases withage and dose. Blackfoot disease is a signicant ad- verse effect. The prevalences (males and females combined) at the low dose are 4.6 per 1,000 forthe 20-39 year group, 10.5 per 1,000 for the 40- 59 year group, and 20.3 per 1000 for the > 60 year group. Moreover, the prevalence of blackfoot dis-ease in each age group increases with increasing dose. However, a subsequent report indicates that the disease may not be due strictly to arsenic expo-sure ( 27). The data in Tseng et al. ( 25) also show in- creased incidences of hyperpigmentation andkeratosis with age. The overall prevalences of hyper-pigmentation and keratosis in the exposed groupsare 184 and 71 per 1000, respectively. The text states that the incidence increases with dose, but data for the individual doses are not shown. Thesedata show that the skin lesions are the more sensitive endpoint. The low dose in the study is considered a LOAEL. 2.The study by Cebrian et al. ( 28) shows an increase in skin lesions, 22% (64/296) at the high dose vs 2.2%(7/318) at the low dose in drinking water. The highdose was 410 mg/L and the low dose was 5-7 mg/L. For the dose estimates an average consumption of 3L/day was used. No data are given regarding the ar-senic exposure from food or the body weight of theparticipants. The 2.2% incidence of skin lesions in the low-dose group is higher than that reported in the Tseng et al. ( 25) control group, but the dose is lower (0.4 vs 0.8 mg/kg/day). 3.The study by Southwick et al. ( 29) shows a margin- ally increased incidence of a variety of skin lesions(palmar and plantar keratosis, diffuse insufciency in individuals exposed to arsenic. Expo-sure times are not clearly dened but are > 5 years,and dose groups are ranges of exposure. The inci- dence of skin lesions in this group is about the same as in the low-dose group from the Cebrian et al. ( 28) study. The incidence of abnormal nerve conduction in the control group is higher than that from the low- dose group in the Hindmarsh et al. ( 30)s t u d yd e - scribed below. The dosed group may or may not be a LOAEL because the study does not report statis- tically signicant effects in the dosed group com-pared to the control group. 4.This study ( 30) shows an increased incidence of ab- normal clinical ndings and abnormal electromyo-graphic ndings with increasing dose of arsenic.However, the sample size is small. Percentages of ab-normal clinical signs possibly attributed to As were 10%, 16%, and 40% at the low, middle, and high doses, respectively. Abnormal EMGs were 0%,17%, and 53% in the same three groups. The aver- age arsenic concentration of the low-dose wells was about 25 mg/L. The averages of the arsenic concen- tration in the middle- and high-dose wells were 70 and 680 mg/L, respectively. 5.Following is a summary of the dened doses in mg/ kg/day from the principal and (1) Tseng 24): NOAEL = 29): NOAEL = 0.9; LOAEL = none (equivocal Hindmarsh et al. ( 30): NOAEL = 0.7; LOAEL = 19 (equivocal effects at 2) An uncertainty factor of 3 is used to account for thelack of data to preclude reproductive toxicity as acritical effect and to determine whether the NOAEL of the critical study accounts for all sensitive individuals. Regulatory Assessment Both IARC and EPA classify inorganic arsenic as carcino- genic to humans. The EPA RfD for chronic oral exposures,0.3 mg/kg/day, is based on a NOAEL of 0.8 mg/kg/day and a LOAEL of 14 mg/kg/day for hyperpigmentation, keratosis, and possible vascular complications in a hu-man population consuming arsenic-contaminated drink-ing water. To address uncertainties in the data, EPA statesthat ''strong scientic arguments can be made for var- ious values within a factor of 2 or 3 of the currently rec- ommended RfD value.'' Conclusions Based on the similarity of the ndings, the oral RfD of arsenic is 0.3 mg/kg/day, and the recommended daily oral dose of 15 mg is based on a 50 kg person. Based on 10 g of drug product taken/day, a PDE of 1.5 mg/g (ppm) is derived. Under the assumption that the oral bioavailability is 10%, the parenteral PDE will be 1/10of the oral PDE (i.e., 1.5 mg/day), resulting in an accepta- ble limit of 0.15 ppm. Oral PDE: 0.3 mg/kg/day Oral Daily Dose mg/g (ppm) Parenteral Component Limit: 0.15 ppm. Cadmium (Cd) Introduction Cadmium is a naturally occurring metal that is used in various chemical forms in metallurgical and other indus- trial processes and in the production of pigments. Envi- ronmental exposure can occur via the diet and drinkingwater ( 31). It has an abundance of approximately 0.15 ppm in the Earth's crust.STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 299 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessToxicokinetics (ADME) Cadmium is absorbed more efciently by the lungs (30% to 60%) than by the GI tract, the latter being a sa- turable process ( 32). Cadmium is transported in the blood and is widely distributed in the body but accumu- lates primarily in the liver and kidneys (33). Cadmium burden (especially in the kidneys and liver) tends to in- crease in a linear fashion up to about 50 or 60 years ofage, after which the body burden remains somewhat constant. Metabolic transformations of cadmium are lim- ited to its binding to protein and nonprotein sulfhydrylgroups and various macromolecules, such as metal-lothionein, which is especially important in the kidneys and liver ( 31). Cadmium is excreted primarily in the urine. Toxicological Effects Acute oral exposures of 20-30 g have caused fatalities in humans. Exposure to lower amounts may cause GI ir- ritation, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea ( 31). An asymptomatic period of one-half to one hour may pre- cede the onset of clinical signs. Oral LD 50values in ani- mals range from 63 to 1125 mg/kg, depending on the cadmium compound ( 34). Longer term exposure to cad- mium primarily affects the kidneys, resulting in tubularproteinosis, although other conditions such as ''itai-itai''disease may involve the skeletal system. Cadmium invol-vement in hypertension is not fully understood ( 33). Regulatory Assessment A concentration of 200 mg Cd/g wet human renal cor- tex is the highest renal level not associated with signi-cant proteinuria ( 35). A toxicokinetic model can help to determine the level of chronic human oral exposure( N O A E L )t h a tr e s u l t si n2 0 0 mg Cd/g wet human renal cortex. The model assumes that 0.01% day of the Cd body burden is eliminated per day ( 35). Assuming 2.5% absorption of Cd from food or 5% from water, the toxicokinetic model predicts that the NOAEL for chronic Cd exposure is 5 and 10 mg/kg/day from water and food, respectively (i.e., levels that would result in 200 mg/g wet weight human renal cortex). Thus, based on anestimated NOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day for Cd in drinking water and an uncertainty factor (UF) of 10, an RfD of0.5 mg/kg/day (water) was calculated. [NOTE: A UF of 10 is used to account for interhuman variability to the toxicity of this chemical in the absence of specic data about sensitive individuals.] An equivalent RfD for Cd infood is 1 mg/kg/day. Both values reflect incorporation of a UF of 10. Using data from select environmental studies examin- ing the relationship of urinary cadmium and the preva- lence of elevated levels of biomarkers of renal function ATSDR issued the provisional Minimal Risk Level (MRL)for chronic cadmium exposure. The 95% lower con-dence limit of urinary cadmium dose corresponding to the probability to exceed in 10% the risk of low molecu- lar weight proteinuria has been estimated as 0.5 mg/g creatinine, assuming accumulation over a 55-year peri- od. This value corresponds to an intake of 0.33 mg/kg/day in females, for which, applying a safety factor of 3 for human variability ATSDR has set the MRL to 0.1 mg/ kg/day. Conclusions Using the ATSDR MRL as the Oral PDE: Oral PDE: 0.1 mg/kg/day. Oral Daily Dose PDE: 5 mg oral per day. Oral Component Limit: 0.5 mg/g (ppm) Parenteral Component Limit: 0.05 ppm. Lead (Pb) Introduction Lead occurs naturally as a sulde in galena. It is a soft, bluish-white, silvery gray, malleable metal with a melting point of 327.5 8. Elemental lead reacts with hot boiling acids and is attacked by pure water. The solubility of leadsalts in water varies from insoluble to soluble depending on the type of salt ( 36-38 ). Lead is a natural element that is persistent in water and soil. Most of the lead in the en- vironment is from anthropogenic sources. The mean concentration is 3.9 mg/L in surface water and 0.005 mg/L in sea water. River sediments contain about 20,000 mg/g, and coastal sediments contain about 100,000 mg/g. Soil content varies with the location, ran- ging up to 30 mg/g in rural areas, 3,000 mg/g in urban areas, and 20,000 mg/g near point sources. Human expo- sure occurs primarily via diet, air, drinking water, and in- gestion of dirt and paint chips ( 39-41 ). Toxicokinetics (ADME) The efciency of lead absorption depends on the route of exposure, age, and nutritional status. Adult humansabsorb about 10%-15% of ingested lead, but children may absorb up to 50%, depending on whether lead isin the diet, dirt, or paint chips. More than 90% of lead particles deposited in the respiratory tract are absorbed into systemic circulation. Inorganic lead is not efcientlyabsorbed through the skin, and consequently this route does not contribute considerably to the total body lead burden ( 42). Lead absorbed into the body is distributed to three major compartments: blood, soft tissue, andbone. The largest compartment is the bone, which con- tains about 95% of the total body lead burden in adults and about 73% in children. The half-life of bone lead ismore than 20 years. The concentration of blood lead changes rapidly with exposure and has a half-life of only 25-28 days. Blood lead is in equilibrium with lead inbone and soft tissue. The soft tissues that take up lead are liver, kidneys, brain, and muscle. Lead is not metabo- lized in the body, but it may be conjugated with glu-tathione and excreted primarily in the urine ( 40, 42, 43). Exposure to lead is evidenced by elevated blood lead levels. Toxicological Effects The systemic toxic effects of lead in humans have been well documented by EPA ( 42-48 ) and ATSDR ( 40), who extensively reviewed and evaluated data reported in the literature up to 1991. The evidence shows that lead is amultitargeted toxicant, causing effects in the GI tract, he-STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 300 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision Processmatopoietic system, cardiovascular system, central and peripheral nervous systems, kidneys, immune system,and reproductive system. Overt symptoms of suben- cephalopathic central nervous system (CNS) effects and peripheral nerve damage occur at blood lead levels of40-60 mg/dL, and nonovert symptoms, such as peripher- al nerve dysfunction, occur at levels of 30-50 mg/dL in adults. No clear threshold is evident. Cognitive andneuropsychological decits are not usually the focus of studies in adults, but there is some evidence of neuro- psychological impairment ( 49) and cognitive decits in lead workers with blood levels of 41-80 mg/dL ( 50). Although similar effects occur in adults and children, chil- dren are more sensitive to lead exposure than are adults. Irreversible brain damage occurs at blood lead levels /C21 100 mg/dL in adults and at 80-100 mg/dL in children. Death can occur at the same blood levels in children.Children who survive these high levels of exposure sufferpermanent severe mental retardation. Toxicology Studies As discussed previously, ne uropsychological impair- ment and cognitive (IQ) decits are sensitive indicators of lead exposure. Both neuropsychological impairment and IQ decits have been the subject of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in children. One of the earlystudies reported IQ score decits of four points at bloodlead levels of 30-50 mg/dL and one to two points at levels of 15-30 mg/dL ( 51). Detailed longitudinal studies have been conducted on children (starting at the time of birth) living in Port Pirie, Australia ( 52-57 ), ( 62-67 ). Various measures of cognitive performance have been assessed in these children. Stud-ies of the Port Pirie children up to 7 years of age revealed IQ decits in 2-year-old children of 1.6 points for each10-m g/dL increase in blood lead, decits of 7.2 points in 4-year-old children, and decits of 4.4 to 5.3 pointsin 7-year-old children as blood lead increased from 10to 30 mg/dL. No signicant neurobehavioral decits were noted for children, 5 years or younger, who lived in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area. In 6.5-year-old children, perfor- mance IQ was reduced by seven points in children whoselifetime blood level exceeded 20 mg/dL. Because of the large database on subclinical neurotoxic effects of leadin children, only a few of the studies have been included.EPA ( 42,48 ) concluded that there is no clear threshold for neurotoxic effects of lead in children. In adults, the cardiovascular system is a very sensitive target for lead. Hypertension (elevated blood pressure) islinked to lead exposure in occupationally exposed sub- jects and in the general population. Three large popula- tion-based studies have been conducted to study therelationship between blood lead levels and high blood pressure. The British Regional Heart Study (BRHS) ( 68), the NHANES II study and Welsh Heart Pro- gramme ( 73, 74) comprise the major studies for the gen- eral population. The BRHS study showed that systolic pressure greater than 160 mm Hg and diastolic pressuregreater than 100 mm Hg were associated with blood lead levels greater than 37 mg/dL ( 68). An analysis of 9933 subjects in the NHANES study showed positive cor-relations between blood pressure and blood lead among 12-74-year-old males but not females ( 69, 71 ), 40-59- year-old white males with blood levels ranging from 7 to 34 mg/dL ( 70), and males and females greater than 20 years old ( 75). In addition, left ventricular hypertro- phy was also positively associated with blood lead ( 75). The Welsh study did not show an association among men and women with blood lead of 12.4 and 9.6 mg/ dL, respectively ( 73, 74 ). Other smaller studies showed both positive and negative results. EPA ( 48)c o n c l u d e d that increased blood pressure is positively correlated withblood lead levels in middle-aged men, possibly at con-centrations as low as 7 mg/dL. In addition, EPA estimated that systolic pressure is increased by 1.5-3.0 mm Hg inmales and 1.0-2.0 mm Hg in females for every doublingof blood lead concentration. Regulatory Assessment EPA has not developed an RfD for lead because it ap- pears that lead is a nonthreshold toxicant, and it is not appropriate to develop RfDs for these types of toxicants. However, a maximum contaminant action level for lead of 15 mg/day was recommended for drinking water (40 CFR 141.80). In 2004, FDA set the maximum allowable level for lead in bottled water at 5 mg/L. Assuming an average water consumption of 2 L/day, the recom- mended RfD is 10 mg/day. Conclusions Assuming that the lead in the drug product will be ab- sorbed in a manner similar to that from water, the RfDdeveloped by FDA is used as the Oral Daily Dose PDE: Oral PDE: 0.2 mg/kg/day Oral Daily Dose mg/g (ppm) Parenteral Component Limit: 0.1 ppm. Mercury (Hg) Introduction Mercury is a naturally occurring element that exists in multiple forms and in various oxidation states. It is usedin a wide variety of products and processes. In the envir-onment, mercury may undergo transformations among its various forms and among its oxidation states. Expo- sure to mercury may occur in both occupational and en-vironmental settings, the latter primarily involving dietary exposure ( 76). Toxicokinetics (ADME) Mercury's ADME depend on its form and oxidation state (76, 77 ). Organic mercurials are more readily ab- sorbed than are inorganic forms. An oxidation-reduction cycle is involved in the metabolism of mercury and mer-cury compounds by both animals and humans ( 76). The urine and feces are the primary excretory routes. Theelimination half-life is 35 to 90 days for elemental mer-cury and mercury vapor and about 40 days for inorganicsalts ( 77).STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 301 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessToxicological Effects Ingestion of inorganic mercury salts may cause severe GI irritation, renal failure, and death with acute lethal d o s e si nh u m a n sr a n g i n gf r o m1t o4g( 76). Mercuric (divalent) are mercurous (monovalent) salts ( 77). Mercury is also known to induce hypersensitivity reactions such as contact dermatitis andacrodynia (pink disease) ( 78). Inhalation of mercury va- por may cause irritation of the respiratory tract, renal dis- orders, central nervous system effects characterized by neurobehavioral changes, peripheral nervous systemtoxicity, renal toxicity (immunologic glomerular disease),and death ( 76). Toxicology Studies Toxicity resulting from subchronic and chronic expo- sure to mercury and mercury compounds usually in-volves the kidneys and/or nervous system. The specic target and effect depend on the form of mercury ( 76). Organic mercury, especially methyl mercury, rapidly en- ters the central nervous system and results in behavioral and neuromotor disorders ( 76, 77). The developing cen- tral nervous system is especially sensitive to this effect, as documented by the epidemiologic studies in Japan and Iraq where ingestion of methyl mercury-contaminated food resulted in severe toxicity and death in adults andsevere central nervous system effects in infants ( 79-82 ). Blood mercury levels of < 10 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL corre- sponded to mild effects and death, respectively ( 79). Ter- atogenic effects due to organic or inorganic mercuryexposure do not appear to be well documented for hu- mans or animals, although some evidence exists for mer- cury-induced menstrual cycle disturbances andspontaneous abortions ( 76, 80, 83 ). A subchronic and chronic oral RfD of 0.1 mg/kg/day for methyl mercury is based on a benchmark dose of 1.1 mg/ kg/day relative to neurologic developmental abnormal- ities in human infants ( 1, 84). A subchronic and chronic oral RfD of 0.3 mg/kg/day for mercuric is based on glomerulonephritis chloride was identied ( 85). NOAELs were not available for oral exposure to inorganic mercury or methyl mercury. Regulatory Assessment EPA's existing RfD of 0.1 mg/kg/day is based on a poisoning episode in Iraq. Results for two large epide- miological studies in the Faroe Islands and SeychellesIslands have become available since the 1995 IRIS entry. The Faroe Islands study identied associations between in utero methyl mercury exposure and decits on a num-ber of endpoints, as did the New Zealand study. In con- trast, the Seychelles Islands study found little or no evidence of impairment. These studies underwent acomprehensive review by the National Research Council(NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences, along with a smaller study from New Zealand. NRC performed bench- mark dose (BMD) analyses of a number of neuropsycho-logical endpoints from each study. In the assessment described here, EPA used the NRC analyses as the basis for the derivation of an RfD for methyl mercury. Basedon BMD levels (lower limit on the BMD) for a numberof endpoints from the Faroe Islands study, as well as anintegrative analysis of all three studies, an RfD for 0.1mg/kg/day was derived. This included a total uncertainty factor of 10 for interhuman toxicokinetic and toxicody- namic variables. Conclusions The presence of methyl mercury in drug products is unlikely. Therefore, the EPA-recommended RfD for mer- curic chloride is used as the PDE. Oral PDE: 0.3 mg/day Oral Daily Dose mg/g (ppm) Parenteral Component Limit: 0.15 ppm. CLASS 2 ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES The limits for Class 2 elemental impurities are those of the EMEA Guideline on the Specication Limits for Residual Metal Catalysts for Metal Reagents (2). Dietary Supplement-Specic Issues Dietary supplements are composed of dietary ingredi- ents (herbs or other botanicals, minerals, amino acids, vi-tamins, and other substances used by humans tosupplement the diet) plus other inert components usedin their composition. The dietary ingredients from natu- ral sources are subject to contamination with elemental impurities from water, air pollution, or soil and other agri-cultural inputs. Processing procedures, such as extraction of plant parts and purication, can result in concentra- tion or dilution of the elemental contaminants. Dietarysubstances of synthetic origin may also be contaminated with elemental impurities that are derived from their manufacturing processes (catalysts and residual re-agents). Dietary ingredients of marine origin (such as sh oil or algal products) can accumulate methyl mercury chloride and cadmium, representing special cases. Limitsfor such exceptional dietar y ingredients should be ad- dressed in their specic monographs. Speciation of ar- senic and mercury is another issue of relevance for dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are regulated as a subset of foods and limits for contaminants set for food items are appli-cable. Major sources of exposure were considered at thetime of setting limits for dietary supplements, and these sources include the environment, drinking water, and food. Recent surveys of dietary supplement intakes ( 86) were also taken in consideration to apply a safety factorrelated to the number of dietary supplements taken by a sizable portion of the popul ation. Proposed limits for dietary supplements were derived from the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI), which is recommended by FAO/WHO. Average daily exposures ( mg/day) of each elemental contaminant fr om air, food, and drinking water were subtracted from the PTWI. From the remain-ing daily intake allowance, a range safety factor was used to account for multiple dietary supplement intakes wasused to calculate the PDE for dietary supplements. With this approach, the recommended limits are consistent with the limits proposed in Chapter h232ifor drugs andSTIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 302 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessElemental Impurities\u2014Comments and Responses AJ DeStefano, K Zaidi,aTL Cecil, GI and the ABSTRACT InPharmacopeial Forum (PF) 34(5) (September-October 2008) the Metal Impurities Advisory Panel of the USP General Chapters Expert Committee presented a Stimuli to the Revision Process article that proposed a new General Chapter to replace General Chapter Heavy Metals h231i. The new Chapter presented a table of elements that could be limited and new approaches to evaluate those elements. Subsequently USPC initiated and participated in an Institute of Medicine workshop and hosted a separate Heavy Metals Testing Methodologies workshop. These publicpresentations and discussion forums yielded a larg e number of specic comments and suggestions from the pharmaceutical and excipient industries as well as the toxicological and regulatory elds. The comments can bebroadly categorized into ten topics. This article prese nts a summary of these topics and the advisory panel's responses and approaches to incorporate the suggestions. ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES RECOMMENDATIONS Before presenting the comment topics and responses, we present the Advisory Panel's recommendations. These recommendations include the development of four new general chapters, two additional Stimuli articles, and an implementation strategy that involves a General Notices revision and a number of monograph revisions. General Chapters The General Chapter additions include: General Chap- terElemental Impurities\u2014Limits h232i, General Chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures General Chapter Elemental Contaminants in Dietary Supplements h2232i , and General Information Chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014 Other Elements h1232i (the name of h1232 iis subject to change). The rst three chapters are included in this PF, and the General Informational Chapter will be devel- oped over the course of the next few years. General Chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits h232i:The limits presented in this Chapter are based on in-depth re- view of the toxicological literature and discussions invol- ving several experts in metals toxicology. These limits are based on documented toxicity and regulatory recom-mendations and focus on the four most toxic and well- understood metals (Pb, Hg, As, and Cd). The Chapter also provides limits of metal catalysts that can be addedin the production of a drug substance or excipient. The metal catalyst limits are the same as those published by EMEA\u2014with the exception of iron and zinc, which werenot included due to their low toxicity. This Chapter alsodescribes three separate options for determination of compliance to the limits. These options are similar to those presented in General Chapter Residual Solvents h467i.General Chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures h233i: The panel has determined that the procedures describedin General Chapter Heavy Metals h231iare inadequate to provide the basis for control of the elements in h232iat their proposed limits. Instead, this chapter details two procedures and provides criteria for the approval of alter-native procedures for the measurement of elemental im- purities. The referee procedures, ICP-OES and ICP-MS with closed-vessel microwave digestion, are described.The choice of procedure, including the sample prepara- tion and instrument parameters, are the responsibility of the user. The performance criteria necessary to demon-strate that an alternative procedure is equivalent to the referee procedures for quanti tative determinations are described. General Chapter Elemental Contaminants in Dietary Sup- plements h2232 i:The limits presented in this Chapter are based on in-depth review of the toxicological literature of specic interest and impact to Dietary Supplements. These limits are based on documented toxicity and reg-ulatory recommendations, and focus on the four most toxic and well-understood metals (Pb, Hg, As, and Cd). This Chapter also describes three separate options for de-termination of compliance to the limits. These oral limits and their described options for compliance are similar to those presented in General Chapter h232i. Finally, this Chapter presents several procedures for speciation of specic elements of particular concern for dietary supplements. General Notices A revision is proposed to the General Notices to indicate that General Chapters h232iandh233iwill apply to all oral and parenteral articles in USP-NF . This revision is sim- ilar in content to that describing the residual solvents re- quirements. aCorrespondence should be addressed to: Kahkashan kxz@usp.org. bFor a list of the members of the Advisory Panel please see the Appen- dix.STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 306 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessStimuli Articles The Advisory Panel also recommended the develop- ment of two Stimuli articles. The rst (this article) dis- cusses the comments and responses of the panel, and the second, also in this volume of PF, presents the toxico- logical rationale for the limits presented in h232i. Implementation (General Notices and Monographs):The Advisory Panel recommends a staged approach tothe implementation of the new General Chapters. Stage 1 : After the initial presentation of the standards in this PF, the Panel recommends consideration by the ex- pert committee of a standard implementation period forthe General Chapters. Stage 2 : The Advisory Panel recommends the adoption of the General Notices revision, also in PF,w i t ha ne x - tended implementation date. They recommend that the committee consider an ofcial date that coincides with the ofcial date of the EMEA Metal Catalyst guide-line (Sept. 2013). Stage 3 : The Advisory Panel recommends that all of the references to General Chapter h231iHeavy Metals be re- moved from USP-NF monographs in a manner to coin- cide with the ofcial date approved for the General Notices revision. COMMENTS AND RESPONSES After reviewing all of the comments received to date, the authors have identied ten topics that encompass those comments. These topics include: Topic 1: Instrumental Details Topic 2: Implementation Topic 3: Specic Metals and Limits Topic 4: Using Residual Solvent ConceptsTopic 5: Scope (Dosage Forms, Foods, Dietary Sup- plements) Topic 10: Other Comments. In many cases, comments received from several sources are similar in nature. Therefore, individual com-ments are not specically identied in this section. In ad-dition to the comments received in response to the Stimuli article, the comments received at the two work- shops will also be addressed in this section. Topic 1: Instrumental Details Comment Summary 1.1: The instruments necessary to meet the limits described can be complicated, expensive, and application dependant. Some preparations may also be dangerous. Dening a single procedure, including re- agents, will not work for all applications.Number of Commenters: 22 Response: General Chapter h233i specically indicates that any procedure that is capable of meeting the criticalvalidation parameters can be used. The choice of proce-dure, including sample preparation, instrument type andconguration, and reagents used are at the discretion of the user. The standard assumes that the user has evalu- ated the risk-benet ratios of the available options andhas selected the most appropriate procedure for the user's application. The referee procedures have been val- idated using a number of samples and the risk-benetratios have been evaluated. Because these procedures will be used for substances and products that have not been evaluated by the advisory panel, verication is indi-cated and steps that may pose health hazards have been noted. The use of multiple procedures is within the scope of a user's application of the standard. Comment Summary 1.2: The instrumental require- ments should be linked to the critical validation require- ments and should be clearly dened. Number of 6 Response: The critical validation criteria necessary to de- ne an acceptable procedure are included in General Chapter h233iand are based on the requirements for val- idation of a limit test and quantitative impurity proce- dure as described in General Chapter Validation of Compendial Procedures h1225 i. Comment Summary 1.3: Several of the terms used in the proposal are confusing or are not well dened inthe text. There are also specic contradictions in the text regarding precision. Number of Commenters: 5 Response: The Advisory Panel has incorporated all of these comments in the draft Chapters. The confusing ter- minology has been removed, or terms have been better dened. The contradictions in the text have been re-solved, and the presentation has been rened to aid in understanding. Comment Summary 1.4: Clarication of expecta- dards, recovery details are requested. Number Commenters: 3 Response: General Chapter h233ihas added clarica- tions that incorporate each of these suggested improvements. Topic 2: Implementation Comment Summary 2.1: A change that affects many monographs\u2014as this change will\u2014should have an ex- tended implementation date.STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 307 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessNumber of Commenters: 2 Response: The details of the proposed implementation approach are provided above. The Advisory Panel has recommended an extended implementation period. Comment Summary 2.2: The development of this stan- dard should be as transparent as possible, and updates should be posted on the USP Web site. Number of Commenters: 5 Response: USP has added the progress of the develop- ment of this standard on the USP Web site in the Hot To- pics section. The standard has been discussed at several open forums, and the development has been as open aspossible. Comment Summary 2.3: The new standard should be a screening procedure that should not quantify individual elemental impurities. Number of Commenters: 2 Response: Although this standard may be used as a screen for impurities, it is designed to encompass the quantication of these impu rities. Because of the wide range of elements and acceptance criteria, the use of a true screening procedure is not practical. Comment Summary 2.4: The new standard should fo- cus on the big four with the addition of other elemental impurities at a later date. The new standard should belimited to those metals that are expected to be present or that were added as part of the process. Number of Commenters: 3 Response: The proposed chapters will focus on the big four and the metal catalysts dened in the EMEA guid- ance, except for zinc and iron. General Chapter h232i clearly differentiates between the big four and the otherelemental impurities in such a way that both can exist ina single Chapter. Comment Summary 2.5: Clarication of the expecta- tions for calculations and units for calculations are requested. Number of Commenters: 3 Response: General Chapter h232ihas incorporated clar- ications to each of these suggested improvements. Topic 3: Specic Metals and Limits Comment Summary 3.1: The limits should be based on toxicology and should include only those elements that have a likelihood of being present. The rationale for the limits should be developed transparently and presentedas a basis for the standard.Number of Commenters: 12 Response: The limits have been developed by a team of toxicologists from industry, academia, ATSDR, BfArM,and FDA. The rationale for the limits for the big four isincluded in a separate Stimuli to the Revision Process article elsewhere in this number of PF. Topic 4: Using Residual Solvent Concepts Comment Summary 4.1: A risk-based strategy like the one presented in General Chapter h467iis recom- mended. The Chapter should be referenced in the Gen- eral Notices a n ds h o u l dn o tb ea d d e dt ot h e monographs. Number of Commenters: 3 Response: General Chapter h232iapplies a risk-based approach like that of EMEA for Class 2 elements. The con- trol of Class 1 impurities is required, but the extent of testing and the timing of that testing are the responsibil- ity of the manufacturer. Although the Chapter does notrequire testing, it does require compliance for Class 1 im- purities, regardless of source. Comment Summary 4.2: Multiple options for the calcu- lation of amount of impurity present like that in General Chapter h467iResidu al Solvents should be used. Number of Commenters: 5 Response: Three options for the calculation of measured impurities and assessment of their compliance to the lim- its for a drug product are included in General Chapterh232i. Topic 5: Scope (Dosage Forms, Foods, Dietary Supplements) Comment Summary 5.1: To which articles do these standards apply? How about ophthalmics, food, preclini-cal supplies? Number Response: General h232iapplies products biologics, ophthalmics, parenteral nutrients, and excipi- ents. It does not apply to food or dietary supplements.General Chapter h2232i covers dietary supplements and dietary ingredients. Preclinical supplies are not cov-ered by a USPmonograph and are not within the scope of this standard. Comment Summary 5.2: This standard should replace all of the other procedures for inorganic impurities in- USP-NF , such as Residue on Ignition ,Lead,Aluminum ,So- dium ,Calcium , and others.STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 308 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Stimuli to the Revision ProcessNumber of Commenters: 2 Response: Although the Advisory Panel considered the change, they determined that it was not within the scope of this revision or Advisory Panel to make a recommenda-tion. USP will consider this proposal further. Topic 6: Reference Standards (RS) Comment Summary 6.1: Commenters presented strong arguments both for and against the development of USP RS materials. Number of Commenters: 7 Response: USP plans to develop standard mixtures that can be used in validation studies and for system suitabil- ity testing. USP currently has no plans to develop indivi- dual elemental impurity standards, but if a need is identied USP will consider developing such standards.When a USP standard is not available, a suitable NIST or NIST-traceable standard is recommended. Topic 7: Imminent Threat h231i Comment Summary 7.1: There is no need to improve this standard. It has worked for a long time, there is sig- nicant uncontrolled environmental exposure, and thetoxicity of these materials has not changed in the past 100 years. Number of Commenters: 5 Response: The Advisory Panel disagrees with these com- ments. The current procedures in General Chapter h231i no longer represent the state of the industry, and the lim- its in the individual monographs are inconsistent with the recommendations of US and international regulatoryauthorities. The current lack of protection from environ- mental exposure increases the need to control those tox- icants that are added with the intent of treating amedical condition or supplementing the diet. Although the toxicity of the elements has not changed in the past 100 years, our understanding of the detrimental effectsof some of these impurities has increased manyfold. Comment Summary 7.2: General Chapter h231iProce- dures I and IIIare still usable procedures. Allow their use as a screening test.Number of Commenters: 2 Response: Although the advisory panel considered these procedures of little value or to be an ineffective approach to the evaluation of the Class 1 impurities, provisions to allow their use have been included in General Chapterh233i . Where one of the procedures has been success- fully validated as described in the Chapter, then the procedure may be used for that application.Topic 8: Harmonization (EDQM, EMEA, MHLW) Comment Summary procedures should be harmonized with EMEA, EP, BP, and JP. Number of Commenters: 5 Response: General Chapter h232iincorporates the limits described in the EMEA guidance as Class 2 impurities. A representative of BfArM has participated on the AdvisoryPanel to ensure that the standards are kept in harmony, and representatives from both EP and JP attended the USP workshop on this topic. USP is discussing thesechapters with EP and JP as part of the PDG harmonization effort. The development of two chapters to replace h231i was executed on the advice of EP to allow an easier route to accomplish a harmonized standard. Topic 9: GMPs and USP Comment Summary 9.1: The control of these elemental impurities is maintained by cGMP compliance, so testingis unnecessary. Number of Commenters: 4 Response: The limits presented in General Chapters h232iandh2232 iare the maximum amount of elemen- tal impurities that may be present in a product or ingre- dient (depending upon application). The periodicity for testing, the extent of testing, and the elements includedin the testing are established at the discretion of the drug product or dietary supplement manufacturer. All prod- ucts are expected to comply with the standard. Topic 10: Other Comments Comment Summary 10.1: We support the improve- ments proposed by USP. Number of Commenters: 2 Response: The Panel appreciates the support of the com- menters. Thank you.Comment Summary 10.2: Several specic wording changes should be incorporated.Number of Commenters: 5 Response: The changes have been incorporated. Comment Summary 10.3: USP and FDA should work closely on this topic.Number of Commenters: 2 Response: FDA toxicologists and reviewers are members of the Advisory Panel. USP staff have discussed the revi- sions with FDA, and copies of the proposed text havebeen provided to FDA before publication in PF.STIMULI TO THE REVISION PROCESS Pharmacopeial Forum Stimuli articles do not necessarily reflect the policies Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] of the USPC or the USP Council of Experts 309 #2010 The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.

This proposed new general test chapter is the rst of two being developed to re- place the general test chapter Heavy Metals h231i; the second chapter is Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits h233i. The term elemen- tal impurities is used here as an alternative to the term heavy metals . The limits presented in this chapter are based on in- depth review of the toxicological literature and discussions in- volving several experts in metal toxicology. These limits, based on documented toxicity and regulatory recommendations, fo- cus on the four most toxic and best-understood metals: lead,mercury, arsenic, and cadmium. The chapter also provides lim-its of metal catalysts that can be added in the production of adrug substance or excipient. The metal catalyst limits are thesame as those published by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), *with the exception of iron and zinc, which because of their low toxicity were not included. The chapter also de- scribes three separate options for determination of compliancewith limits. These options are similar to those presented in thechapter Residual Solvents h467i. (GC: K. Zaidi.) RTS\u2014C79497Add the following: ~ h232iELEMENTAL IMPURITIES\u2014 LIMITS INTRODUCTION The objective of this chapter is to set limits on the amounts of elemental impurities in pharmaceuticals. The chapter applies to drug substances, drug products (including natural-source and rDNA biologics), and ex-cipients. Dietary supplements and their ingredients are addressed in chapter Elemental Impurities in Dietary Sup- plements h2232i . For articles that are designated ''For Veterinary Use Only,'' higher or lower levels for the per-missible daily exposure and concentration limit may be justied in exceptional cases, based on the actual dailydose, actual target species, relevant toxicological data, and consumer safety considerations. Elemental impurities addressed in this chapter are clas- sied as shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Elemental Impurity Classes Class Assessment Class 1 Elements should be essentially absent Known or strongly suspected human toxicants Environmental hazards Class 2 Elements should be limited Elements with less toxicity than Class 1 Elements deliberately added to an article Class 1 Elemental Impurities Compliance with the limits specied for Class 1 ele- mental impurities is required for all drug products, re- gardless of the likelihood of the presence of impurities.The presence of unexpected elemental contaminants, *See page 6 at http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/swp/ 444600enn.pdf.Pharmacopeial Forum Vol. 36(1) IN-PROCESS REVISION United States Pharmacopeial Convention All Rights Reserved.In-Process Revisionas well as that of impurities likely to be present, should be considered in determining compliance and planning therisk-based extent of testing. Class 2 Elemental Impurities In general, for Class 2 elemental impurities, the testing of drug substances, excipients, and drug products for el- emental impurities need be conducted only when these elements are added during the manufacture of the arti-cle.LIMITS OF ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES Class 1 Class 1 elemental impurities ( Table 2 ), because of their unacceptable toxicities or deleterious environmental ef-fects, should not be present in a drug substance, excipi-ent, or drug product. However, if their presence is unavoidable, their levels should be restricted as shown inTable 2 , unless otherwise stated in the individual monograph. Class 2 Class 2 elemental impurities ( Table 3 ) should be limited in drug substances, excipients, and drug products be- cause of their inherent toxicities. Table 2.

OPTIONS FOR DESCRIBING LIMITS OF ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES Three options are available when applying limits of el- emental impurities for orally dosed products. Parenteral products are covered separately (see Parenteral Products section below). Drug Product Analysis Option This option is generally applicable. The results ob- tained from the analysis of a typical dosage unit, scaled to a maximum daily dose, are compared to the Daily Dose PDE, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3 . Daily Dose PDE /C21measured value x (maximum daily dose) Individual Component Option For drug products with a maximum daily dose of NMT 10 g, the product meets the requirements when eachdrug substance and excipient meets the limits provided in the Component Limit column ( Table 2 and Table 3 ). If all drug substances and excipients in a formulation meetthe limits shown in the Component Limit, these compo-nents may be used in any proportion. No further calcu-lation is necessary. Summation Option This option can be used for drug products that are ad- ministered in doses other than 10 g/day or products inwhich any component of a product exceeds the applica- ble Component Limit. The Daily Dose PDE, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3 , can be used to calculate the concen- tration of elemental impurities allowed in a drug product. Apply this option by separately adding the amounts of each elemental impurity (in mg/day) present in each of the components of the drug product, using the followingequation: Result = S 1m(CM6WM) m = each ingredient used to manufacture the dosage form CM= element concentration in that component (mg/g) WM= weight of component in a dosage form (g) The sum of the quantities of each element/day should be less than that shown by the Daily Dose PDE in Table 2 and Table 3 for that element.Pharmacopeial Forum Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] IN-PROCESS REVISION 199 United States Pharmacopeial Convention All Rights Reserved.In-Process RevisionExamples Consider an example of the application of the Individ- ual Component Option and the Summation Option to the arsenic concentration in a drug product. The Daily Dose PDE is 15 mg/day, and the Component Limit is 1.5 mg/g (ppm). The maximum administered daily weight of a drug product is 5.0 g, and the drug product contains two excipients. The composition of the drug product and the calculated maximum content of arsenic areshown in Table 4 . Table 0.9 Excipient 1 0.9 1.0 0.9 Excipient 2 3.8 2.0 7.6Drug product 5.0 \u2014 9.4 Excipient 1 and the drug substance meet the Compo- nent Limit, but Excipient 2 does not. Thus, the Individual Component Option cannot be used. However, under the Summation Option , the drug product meets the Daily Dose PDE limit of 15 mg/day and thus conforms to the acceptance criteria in this chapter. Consider another examp le where the maximum ad- ministered daily weight of a drug product is 5.0 g, and the drug product contains two excipients. The composi- tion of the drug product and the calculated maximum content of arsenic are shown in Table 5 .Table 5 ComponentAmount in lation (g)Arsenic 1.5 Excipient 1 0.9 5.0 4.5 Excipient 2 3.8 5.0 19.0Drug product 5.0 \u2014 25.0 In this example, the drug product exceeds the limits in Table 2 , using both the Individual Component Option and theSummation Option . The manufacturer can test the drug product by using the Drug Product Analysis Option . If the level of arsenic in the formulation exceeds the Daily Dose PDE, the product fails to meet the impurity limits as described in this chapter. Parenteral Products Because of the presumption of 100% bioavailability of the elemental impurity during parenteral administration, versus the presumed 10% bioavailability via the oralroute, the Parenteral Component Limit and the Parenter- al Daily Dose PDE ( Table 2 and Table 3 ) are 10% of those for the oral route of introduction. To evaluate the limits for elemental impurities, one can apply the three options described above, using the Parenteral Component Limit instead of the Component Limit, and using the Parenter-al Daily Dose PDE instead of the Oral Daily Dose PDE. ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES For a presentation of the alternatives for testing, see the chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures h233i.T h e validation necessary will vary depending on the situation. For all three options described in Chapter h232iin the section Options for Describing Limits of Elemental Impuri-Pharmacopeial Forum 200 IN-PROCESS REVISION Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] United States Pharmacopeial Convention All Rights Reserved.In-Process Revisionties, it may be appropriate to use the section Limit Proce- dure Validation in Chapter h233i. However, for the Sum- mation Option in Chapter h232i, acceptable levels of validation must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Validation of a procedure using the Quantitative Proce- dure Validation in Chapter h233iis acceptable for all op- tions under all circumstances, and it is generallypreferred. The determination of the level of validationnecessary is at the discretion of the manufacturer and the competent regulatory authority. ~USP34 BRIEFING h233i Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures. This pro- posed new general test chapter is the second of two being de- veloped to replace the general test chapter Heavy Metals h231i; the rst chapter is Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits h232i. The pro- cedures described in Chapter h231iare inadequate to provide the basis for control of the elements in Chapter h232iat their proposed limits. This chapter describes the validation of two types of proce- dures, limit and quantitative, for the measurement of elementalimpurities and provides criteria for the approval of alternativeprocedures. The chapter also describes two referee procedures,inductively coupled plasma-atomic (optical) emission trometry (ICP-MS), both using closed vessel microwavedigestion. The choice of procedure, including the sample preparation and the instrument parameters, is the responsibility of the user. (GC: K.Zaidi) RTS\u2014C79498Add the following: ~ h233iELEMENTAL IMPURITIES\u2014 PROCEDURES INTRODUCTION This chapter describes analytical procedures for the evaluation of elemental impurities in USP for drug sub- stances and drug products (including natural-source and rDNA biologics); in NFfor excipients; and in the USP Dietary Supplements Compendium for dietary supple- ments and dietary ingredients (all drug articles). Two re-feree procedures are described. Criteria for the approvalof alternative procedures are also described. An alterna- tive procedure will require complete validation for each element of interest. In addition, a system suitability eval-uation using a USP Reference Standard or its equivalent should be demonstrated on the day of analysis. Alterna- tive procedures that meet the validation requirementsdescribed herein are considered to be equivalent to Pro- cedures 1 and 2. A decision-tree that can be used to guide a user to an appropriate alternative procedure ispresented in Figure 1 . The test requirement is specied inGeneral Notices or the individual monograph. Speciation When elements are present in certain complexes, oxi- dation states, or organic combinations, they may show more signicant toxicity than in other forms and may re- quire further testing and control. The determination ofthe oxidation state or organic complex or combination is termed speciation . Analytical procedures for speciation are not included in this chapter.Pharmacopeial Forum Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] IN-PROCESS REVISION 201 United States Pharmacopeial Convention All Rights Reserved.In-Process RevisionFigure 1. Elemental impurities decision tree. ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS The level of validation necessary to ensure that a pro- cedure is appropriate for its intended purpose\u2014that is, that it is acceptable\u2014will differ, depending on whethera limit test or a quantitative determination is necessary. The requirements for validation of an elemental impuri- ties procedure for either type of determination are de-scribed below.VALIDATION OF LIMIT PROCEDURES For elemental impurities, validation of a limit proce- dure should include accuracy, precision, and specicity. Following are acceptable validation parameters that al- low a procedure to be deemed appropriate as a limit pro-cedure:Pharmacopeial Forum 202 IN-PROCESS REVISION Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] Convention Reserved.In-Process RevisionAccuracy Control Sample\u2014 A preparation of certied reference materials for the element of interest at the indicated level Test Sample\u2014 A sample of material under test, spiked with certied reference materials for the element of inter- est at the indicated level, prepared in triplicate Acceptance Criteria\u2014Each Test sample provides a signal of intensity or value equivalent to or greater thanthat of the Control sample .[ NOTE \u2014The signal obtained must show a change from the value obtained compared to a blank determination.] The accuracy of the method must be determined by conducting studies with test ma- terials supplemented with known concentrations of eachelement at the appropriate acceptance limit concentra- tion. The test materials must be spiked before any sample preparation steps are taken. For example, if a test mate-rial is to be digested with a closed vessel microwave di- gestion apparatus, the material must be spiked before the digestion procedure. Precision for Instrumental Methods (Repeatability) [ NOTE \u2014Noninstrumental precision is demonstrated by meeting the Accuracy requirement above.] Test Samples: Six independent samples of the ma- terial under test, spiked with certied reference materialsfor the element of interest at the indicated level Acceptance Criteria: Relative standard deviation, NMT 20% Specicity Specicity (false-negative) for an element in the material under test will be deemed acceptable if accep-tance criteria for accuracy and precision are obtainedfor that element in the presence of other elements that,at their indicated limits, may interfere with the evalua-tion. Specicity (false-positive) must also show an ab- sence of signal for an element in the presence of otherelements that, at their indicated limits, may interfere with the evaluation. VALIDATION OF QUANTITATIVE PROCEDURES The following section denes the validation parame- ters for the acceptability of a quantitative procedure. Meeting these requirements must be demonstrated ex-perimentally, using an appropriate system suitability pro-cedure and reference material. Accuracy Control Sample 1: 0.5J, of the certied reference materials for the element of interest, where Jis the indi- cated limit Control Sample 2: J, of the certied reference ma- terials for the element of interest, where Jis the indicated limit Control Sample 3: 1.5J, of the certied reference materials for the element of interest, where Jis the indi- cated limit Test Sample 1: Sample of material under test, spiked with certied reference materials for the elementof interest at 0.5 J, where Jis the indicated limit [ NOTE\u2014 Prepare in triplicate.] Test Sample 2: Sample of material under test, spiked with certied reference materials for the element of interest at J, where Jis the indicated limit [ NOTE\u2014 Pre- pare in triplicate.]Pharmacopeial Forum Vol. 36(1) [Jan.-Feb. 2010] IN-PROCESS REVISION 203 United States Pharmacopeial Convention All Rights Reserved.In-Process RevisionTest Sample 3: Sample of material under test, spiked with certied reference materials for the element of interest at 1.5 J, where Jis the indicated limit [ NOTE\u2014 Prepare in triplicate.] Acceptance Criteria: Spike recovery: 80%-150% for the mean of three replicate preparations at each con- centration. The test materials must be supplemented be- fore any sample preparation steps. For example, if a testmaterial is to be digested with a closed vessel microwave digestion apparatus, the material must be spiked at the beginning of the digestion procedure. Precision REPEATABILITY Test Samples: Six independent samples of material under test, spiked with certied reference materials forthe element of interest at the indicated level Acceptance Criteria: Relative standard deviation, NMT 20% INTERMEDIATE PRECISION The effect of random events on the analytical precision of the method must be established. Acceptable experi- ments for establishing intermediate precision include performing the Repeatability analysis 1.On different days, 2.With different instrumentation, or 3.With different analysts. Note that executing only one of the three experiments listed is required in order to demonstrate intermediate precision. Acceptance Criteria: Relative standard deviation, NMT 25%Specicity Specicity (false-negative) for an element in the material under test will be deemed acceptable if accep- tance criteria for accuracy and precision are obtained for that element in the presence of other elements that may interfere with the evaluation, at their indicated lim-its. Specicity (false-positive) must also show an ab- sence of signal for an element in the presence of otherelements that, at their indicated limits, may interfere with the evaluation. Limit of Quantitation (Sensitivity)\u2014 Demon- strated by meeting the Accuracy requirement. REFEREE PROCEDURES 1 AND 2 Procedure and Detection Technique Procedure 1 can be used for elemental impurities gen- erally amenable to detection by inductively coupled plas-ma-atomic (optical) emissi on spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Procedure 2 can be used for elemental impurities gener- ally amenable to detection by inductively coupled plas-ma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Verication Before the initial use of a referee procedure, the analyst should ensure that the procedure is appropriate for the instrument and sample used. This is accomplished by procedure verication, as described in Verication of Com- pendial Procedures h1226 i. Sample Preparation Sample preparation is critical to the successful comple- tion of the evaluation. Use the flow chart in Figure 1 to determine the means of sample preparation.

[ NOTE\u2014 All liquid samples should be weighed.] Closed Vessel Microwave Digestion\u2014 This sample preparation procedure is designed for samples that must be digested. The procedure also applies to samples thatare not soluble in nitric acid. [ NOTE\u2014 Weights and vol- umes provided may be adjusted to meet the require- ments of the microwave digestion apparatus used, if proportions remain constant.] Sample Preparation\u2014 Dehydrate and predigest 0.5 g of sample in 5 mL of freshly prepared aqua regia.1Sulfuric acid may also be used as a last resort.2Allow the sample to sit loosely covered for 30 min in a fume hood. Add 10 mL more of aqua regia, and digest, using a closed vessel microwave technique. Microwave until digestion or ex-traction is complete. Repeat if necessary by adding 5 mL more of aqua regia. [ NOTE\u2014 Where closed vessel mi- crowave digestion is necessary, follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures to ensure safe usage.][ NOTE\u2014 In closed vessel microwave digestion, the use of concen-trated hydrofluoric acid (HF) is not recommended. How-ever, when its use is necessary, practice the utmost caution in the preparation of test articles, and review or establish local procedures for safe handling, safe disposal,and HF-tolerant instrumental congurations.] Reagents\u2014 All reagents used for the preparation of sample and standard solutions should be free of elemen-tal impurities, in accordance with Plasma Spectrochemis- tryh730i . Reagents should be commercial elemental stock standards that are National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST)-traceable, at a recommendedconcentration of 100 mg/mL or greater; or appropriate USP Reference Standards, as either single element ormultielement. Procedure 1: ICP-OES Sample Solution: Proceed as directed in Sample preparation above. When closed vessel microwave diges- tion is used, proceed as directed above, allow the diges-tion vessel to cool (add an appropriate stabilizer, such as gold at about 0.1 ppm, for mercury measurement), and dilute with Puried Water to 50.0 mL.

The following sampling procedures are the minimum considered applicable to vegetable drugs.Some articles, or some tests, may require more rigorous proce-dures involving more containers being sampled or more sam-ples per container. Gross Sample Where external examination of containers, markings, and la- bels indicates that the batch can be considered to be homoge-neous, take individual samples from the number of randomlyselected containers indicated below. Where the batch cannotbe considered to be homogeneous, divide it into sub-batchesthat are as homogeneous as possible, then sample each one as a homogeneous batch.

This revision to general chapter Elemental Impurities 232 is based on comments received during the public comment period. The Expert Panel on elemental impurities has reviewed these comments and is proposing revisions both to 232 and its accompanying general chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures 233 . Although these proposed changes do not materially impact the scientific content of these chapters, they are being published in PF to assure that the chapter requirements are clear to all users and to seek any final input. The Permissible Daily Exposure (PDE) limits presented in the proposed new general chapter 232 are consistent with the current early deliberations of the International Congress on Harmonization (ICH) Q3D expert working party on metal impurities. Changes by ICH Q3D to the PDE limits for the elements contained in this chapter will be managed as proposed changes to the chapter via existing USP revision processes, with corresponding changes to the implementation times if the limits decrease. The addition of elements to this chapter based on additions made by ICHQ3D will be managed similarly. However, any elements (and their accompanying PDE) included in the final ICH document that are less toxic than those included in chapter 232 will be incorporated in a future informational general chapter rather than in 232 . The previously published PF 36(1) revision to the General Notices and Requirements pertaining to the Elemental Impurities chapters (section 5.60.30) was deferred from USP 34-NF 29. Any change in the implementation date will be reflected in a General Notices revision. This proposal will be included on the official ballot when chapters 232 and 233 are considered for approval by the Expert Committee. (GCCA: K. Zaidi.)

The chapter applies to drug substances, drug products (including natural-source and rDNA biologics), and excipients. Dietary supplements and their ingredients are addressed in chapter Elemental Impurities in Dietary Supplements 2232 . For articles that are designated \"For Veterinary Use Only,\" higher or lower levels for the permissible daily exposure and concentration limit may be justified in exceptional cases, based on the actual daily dose, actual target species, relevant toxicological data, and consumer safety considerations. Elemental impurities addressed in this chapter are classified as shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Elemental Impurity Classes Class Assessment Class 1 Elements should be essentially absent Known or strongly suspected human toxicants Environmental hazards37(3) In-Process Revision: of 9 6/6/2011 9:29 A M Class Assessment Class 2 Elements should be limited Elements with less toxicity than Class 1 Elements deliberately added to an article Class 1 Elemental Impurities Compliance with the limits specified for Class 1 elemental impurities is required for all drug products, regardless of the likelihood of the presence of impurities. The presence of unexpected elemental contaminants, as well as that of impurities likely to be present, should be considered in determining compliance and planning the risk-based extent of testing. Class 2 Elemental Impurities In general, for Class 2 elemental impurities, the testing of drug substances, excipients, and drug products for elemental impurities need be conducted only when these elements are added during the manufacture of the article. LIMITS OF ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES Class 1 Class 1 elemental impurities ( Table 2 ), because of their unacceptable toxicities or deleterious environmental effects, should not be present in a drug substance, excipient, or drug product. However, if their presence is unavoidable, their levels should be restricted as shown in Table 2 , unless otherwise stated in the individual monograph. Class 2 Class 2 elemental impurities ( Table 3 ) should be limited in drug substances, excipients, and drug products because of their inherent toxicities. Table 2.

Parenteral products are covered separately (see Parenteral Products section below). Drug Product Analysis Option This option is generally applicable. The results obtained from the analysis of a typical dosage unit, scaled to a maximum daily dose, are compared to the Daily Dose PDE, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3 . Daily Dose PDE measured value x (maximum daily dose) Individual Component Option For drug products with a maximum daily dose of NMT 10 g, the product meets the requirements when each drug substance and excipient meets the limits provided in the Component Limit column ( Table 2 and Table 3 ). If all drug substances and excipients in a formulation meet the limits shown in the Component Limit, these components may be used in any proportion. No further calculation is necessary. Summation Option This option can be used for drug products that are administered in doses other than 10 g/day or products in which any component of a product exceeds the applicable Component Limit. The Daily Dose PDE, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3, can be used to calculate the concentration of elemental impurities allowed in a drug product. Apply this option by separately adding the amounts of each elemental impurity (in \u00b5g/day) present in each of the components of the drug product, using the following equation: Result = S1 m(CM \u00d7 W M) m = each ingredient used to manufacture the dosage form CM = element concentration in that component (\u00b5g/g) WM = weight of component in a dosage form (g)37(3) In-Process Revision: <232> ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES--LIMIT S http://www.usppf.com/pf/pub/data/v373/CHA_IPR_373_c232.html#CHA... 3 of 9 6/6/2011 9:29 A M The sum of the quantities of each element/day should be less than that shown by the Daily Dose PDE in Table 2 and Table 3 for that element. Examples Consider an example of the application of the Individual Component Option and the Summation Option to the arsenic concentration in a drug product. The Daily Dose PDE is 15 \u00b5g/day, and the Component Limit is 1.5 \u00b5g/g (ppm). The maximum administered daily weight of a drug product is 5.0 g, and the drug product contains two excipients. The composition of the drug product and the calculated maximum content of arsenic are shown in Table 4 . Table 4 Component Amount in Formulation (g) Arsenic Content (\u00b5g/g) Daily Exposure (\u00b5g/day) Drug substance0.3 3.0 0.9 Excipient 1 0.9 1.0 0.9 Excipient 2 3.8 2.0 7.6 Drug product 5.0 \u2014 9.4 Excipient 2 and the drug substance do not meet the Component Limit, but Excipient 1 does. Thus, the Individual Component Option cannot be used. However, under the Summation Option , the drug product meets the Daily Dose PDE limit of 15 \u00b5g/day and thus conforms to the acceptance criteria in this chapter. Consider another example where the maximum administered daily weight of a drug product is 5.0 g, and the drug product contains two excipients. The composition of the drug product and the calculated maximum content of arsenic are shown in Table 5 . Table 5 Component Amount in Formulation (g) Arsenic Content (\u00b5g/g) Daily Exposure (\u00b5g/day) Drug substance0.3 5.0 1.5 Excipient 1 0.9 5.0 4.5 Excipient 2 3.8 5.0 19.0 Drug product 5.0 \u2014 25.0 In this example, the drug product exceeds the limits in Table 2 , using both the Individual Component Option and the Summation Option . The manufacturer can test the drug product by using the Drug Product Analysis Option . If the level of arsenic in the formulation exceeds the Daily Dose PDE, the product fails to meet the impurity limits as described in this chapter. Parenteral Products Because of the presumption of 100% bioavailability of the elemental impurity during parenteral administration, versus the presumed 10% bioavailability via the oral route, the Parenteral Component Limit and the Parenteral Daily Dose PDE (Table 2 and Table 3 ) are 10% of those for the oral route of introduction. To evaluate the limits for elemental impurities, one can apply the three options described above, using the Parenteral Component Limit instead of the Component Limit, and using the Parenteral Daily Dose PDE instead of the Oral Daily Dose PDE.37(3) In-Process Revision: ELEMENTAL 6/6/2011 9:29 A MANALYTICAL PROCEDURES For a presentation of the alternatives for testing, see the chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures 233 . The validation necessary will vary depending on the situation. For all three options described in Chapter <232> in the section Options for Describing Limits of Elemental Impurities , it may be appropriate to use the section Limit Procedure Validation in Chapter <233>. However, for the Summation Option in Chapter <232>, acceptable levels of validation must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Validation of a procedure using the Quantitative Procedure Validation in Chapter <233> is acceptable for all options under all circumstances, and it is generally preferred. The determination of the level of validation necessary is at the discretion of the manufacturer and the competent regulatory authority. INTRODUCTION This general chapter specifies limits for the amounts of elemental impurities in drug products. Elemental impurities include catalysts and environmental contaminants that may be present in drug substances, excipients, or drug products.These impurities may occur naturally, be added intentionally, or be introduced inadvertently (e.g., by interactions withprocessing equipment). When elemental impurities are known to be present, have been added, or have the potential for introduction, assurance of compliance to the specified levels is required. A risk-based control strategy may be appropriate when analysts determine how to assure compliance with this standard. Regardless of the approach used,compliance with the limits specified is required for all drug products.The limits presented in this chapter do not apply to excipients and drug substances, except where specified in this chapter or in the individual monographs. However, elemental impurity levels present in drug substances and excipients must be known and reported. Dietary supplements and their ingredients are addressed in Elemental Contaminants in Dietary Supplements 2232 . For articles that are designated \"For Veterinary Use Only\", or for which veterinary administration is intended, the permissible daily exposures (PDE) presented in this chapter are applicable. However, higher or lower PDE andconcentration limits may be appropriate based on the daily dose, target species, relevant toxicological data, orconsumer safety impact. SPECIATION The determination of the oxidation state, organic complex, or combination is termed speciation. Each of the elemental impurities has the potential to be present in differing oxidation or complexation states. However, arsenic and mercury are of particular concern because of the differing toxicities of their inorganic and complexed organic forms.The arsenic limits are based on the inorganic (most toxic) form. Arsenic can be measured using a total-arsenicprocedure under the assumption that all arsenic contained in the material under test is in the inorganic form. Where the limit is exceeded using a total arsenic procedure, it may be possible to show via a procedure that quantifies the different forms that the inorganic form meets the specification. The mercury limits are based upon the inorganic ( 2 +) oxidation state. The methyl mercury form (most toxic) is rarely an issue for pharmaceuticals. Thus, the limit was established assuming the most common (mercuric) inorganic form. Limits for articles that have the potential to contain methyl mercury (e.g., materials derived from fish) are to be provided in themonograph. ROUTES OF EXPOSURE37(3) In-Process Revision: 5 of 9 6/6/2011 9:29 A M The toxicity of an elemental impurity is related to its extent of exposure (bioavailability). The Exposure Factor in Table 1 is used to modify the PDEs presented in Table 2 , column 2, based on the route of administration, assuming 100% bioavailability for the parenteral and inhalational routes. These limits are based on chronic exposure but exclude potential genotoxic effects. When carcinogenicity is suspected (e.g., arsenic in inhalation products), the limits should bemodified. [ NOTE\u2014 The routes of administration of drug products are defined in general chapter Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 1151 . ] Table 1. Exposure Factor Route of Administration Exposure Factor Oral (solids and liquids) 1 Parenteral (Injectables, implants, and 1 Inhalational (aerosols, inhalers, and gases) 0.1 DRUG PRODUCTS The limits described in the second column of Table 2 are the base daily dose PDEs of the elemental impurities of interest for a drug product taken by an adult patient according to indicated routes of administration. Exceptions for pediatric or other special populations that lower the PDE should be reflected in the limits in the appropriate monographs. Parenterals with an intended maximum dose of greater than 10 mL and not more than 100 mL must usethe Summation Option described below. Large Volume Parenterals The amount of elemental impurities present in a Large Volume Parenteral (LVP - daily dose greater than 100 mL) drugproduct must be controlled through the individual components used to produce the product. The amounts of elementalimpurities present in each component used in an LVP are less than the values included in the third column of Table 2 . Table 2.

The Modified Daily Dose PDE is calculated by multiplying the Daily Dose PDE values in Table 2 by the Exposure Factor from Table 1 for the elements in question. Modified Daily Dose PDE = Daily Dose PDE \u00d7 Exposure Factor Options for Demonstrating Compliance DRUG PRODUCT ANALYSIS OPTION The results obtained from the analysis of a typical dosage unit, scaled to a maximum daily dose, are compared to the Modified Daily Dose PDE.

Before products can be evaluated using this option, the manufacturer must validate that additional elemental impurities cannot be inadvertently added through the manufacturing process. DRUG SUBSTANCE AND EXCIPIENTS The presence of elemental impurities in drug substances and excipients must be controlled and, where present,reported. The acceptable levels for these impurities depend on the material's ultimate use. Therefore, drug productmanufacturers must determine the acceptable level of elemental impurities in the drug substances and excipients used to produce their products. The values provided in Table 3 represent concentration limits for components (drug substances and excipients) of drug products dosed at a maximum daily dose of 10 g/day. These values serve as default concentration limits to aid discussions between drug product manufacturers and the suppliers of the components of their drug products. [ NOTE\u2014 Individual components may need to be limited at levels different from those in the table depending on monograph-specific mitigating factors. ] Table 3.

Two referee procedures are described. Criteria for the approval of alternative procedures are also described. An alternative procedure will require complete validation for each element of interest. In addition, a system suitability evaluation using a USP Reference Standard or its equivalent should be demonstrated on the day of analysis. Alternative procedures that meet the validation requirements described herein are considered to be equivalent to Procedures 1 and 2. A decision-tree that can be used to guide a user to an appropriate alternative procedure is presented in Figure 1 . The test requirement is specified in General Notices or the individual monograph. Speciation When elements are present in certain complexes, oxidation states, or organic combinations, they may show more significant toxicity than in other forms and may require further testing and control.

Elemental impurities decision tree. ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS The level of validation necessary to ensure that a procedure is appropriate for its intended purpose\u2014that is, that it is acceptable\u2014will differ, depending on whether a limit test or a quantitative determination is necessary. The requirements for validation of an elemental impurities procedure for either type of determination are described below. VALIDATION OF LIMIT PROCEDURES For elemental impurities, validation of a limit procedure should include accuracy, precision, and specificity. Following are acceptable validation parameters that allow a procedure to be deemed appropriate as a limit procedure: Accuracy Control Sample\u2014 A preparation of certified reference materials for the element of interest at the indicated level Test Sample\u2014 A sample of material under test, spiked with certified reference materials for the element of interest at the indicated level, prepared in triplicate Acceptance Criteria\u2014 Each Test sample provides a signal of intensity or value equivalent to or greater than that of the Control sample . [NOTE\u2014 The signal obtained must show a change from the value obtained compared to a blank determination. ] The accuracy of the method must be determined by conducting studies with test materials supplemented with known concentrations of each element at the appropriate acceptance limit concentration. The test materials must be spiked before any sample preparation steps are taken. For example, if a test material is to be digested with a closed vessel microwave digestion apparatus, the material must be spiked before the digestion procedure. Precision for Instrumental Methods (Repeatability) [NOTE\u2014 Noninstrumental precision is demonstrated by meeting the Accuracy requirement above. ] Test Samples: Six independent samples of the material under test, spiked with certified reference materials for the element of interest at the indicated level37(3) In-Process Revision: <233> ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES--PROC... http://www.usppf.com/pf/pub/data/v373/CHA_IPR_373_c233.html#CHA.. A M Acceptance Criteria: Relative standard deviation, NMT 20% Specificity Specificity (false-negative) for an element in the material under test will be deemed acceptable if acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision are obtained for that element in the presence of other elements that, at their indicated limits, may interfere with the evaluation. Specificity (false-positive) must also show an absence of signal for an element in the presence of other elements that, at their indicated limits, may interfere with the evaluation. VALIDA TION OF QUANTITA TIVE PROCEDURES The following section defines the validation parameters for the acceptability of a quantitative procedure. Meeting these requirements must be demonstrated experimentally, using an appropriate system suitability procedure and reference material. Accuracy Control Sample 1: 0.5J, of the certified reference materials for the element of interest, where J is the indicated limit Control Sample 2: J, of the certified reference materials for the element of interest, where J is the indicated limit Control Sample 3: 1.5J, of the certified reference materials for the element of interest, where J is the indicated limit Test Sample 1: Sample of material under test, spiked with certified reference materials for the element of interest at 0.5J, where J is the indicated limit [NOTE\u2014 Prepare in triplicate. ] Test Sample 2: Sample of material under test, spiked with certified reference materials for the element of interest at J, where J is the indicated limit [NOTE\u2014 Prepare in triplicate. ] Test Sample 3: Sample of material under test, spiked with certified reference materials for the element of interest at 1.5J, where J is the indicated limit [NOTE\u2014 Prepare in triplicate. ] Acceptance Criteria: Spike recovery: 80%-150% for the mean of three replicate preparations at each concentration. The test materials must be supplemented before any sample preparation steps. For example, if a test material is to be digested with a closed vessel microwave digestion apparatus, the material must be spiked at the beginning of the digestion procedure. Precision REPEATABILITY Test Samples: Six independent samples of material under test, spiked with certified reference materials for the element of interest at the indicated level Acceptance Criteria: Relative standard deviation, NMT 20% INTERMEDIATE PRECISION The effect of random events on the analytical precision of the method must be established. Acceptable experiments for establishing intermediate precision include performing the Repeatability analysis On different days,1. With 9:30 A MWith different analysts.3. Note that executing only one of the three experiments listed is required in order to demonstrate intermediate precision. Acceptance Criteria: Relative standard deviation, NMT 25% Specificity Specificity (false-negative) for an element in the material under test will be deemed acceptable if acceptance criteria for accuracy and precision are obtained for that element in the presence of other elements that may interfere with the evaluation, at their indicated limits. Specificity (false-positive) must also show an absence of signal for an element in the presence of other elements that, at their indicated limits, may interfere with the evaluation. Limit of Quantitation (Sensitivity)\u2014 Demonstrated by meeting the Accuracy requirement. REFEREE PROCEDURES 1 AND 2 Procedure and Detection Technique Procedure 1 can be used for elemental impurities generally amenable to detection by inductively coupled plasma- atomic (optical) emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Procedure 2 can be used for elemental impurities generally amenable to detection by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Verification Before the initial use of a referee procedure, the analyst should ensure that the procedure is appropriate for the instrument and sample used. This is accomplished by procedure verification, as described in Verification of Compendial Procedures 1226 . Sample Preparation Sample preparation is critical to the successful completion of the evaluation. Use the flow chart in Figure 1 to determine the means of sample preparation. The sample preparation scheme should yield sufficient sample to allow quantification of each element at the specified limit stated in the corresponding monograph or chapter. [NOTE\u2014 All liquid samples should be weighed. ] Closed Vessel Microwave Digestion\u2014 This sample preparation procedure is designed for samples that must be digested. The procedure also applies to samples that are not soluble in nitric acid. [NOTE\u2014 Weights and volumes provided may be adjusted to meet the requirements of the microwave digestion apparatus used, if proportions remain constant. ] Sample Preparation\u2014 Dehydrate and predigest 0.5 g of sample in 5 mL of freshly prepared aqua regia.1 Sulfuric acid may also be used as a last resort.2 Allow the sample to sit loosely covered for 30 min in a fume hood. Add 10 mL more of aqua regia, and digest, using a closed vessel microwave technique. Microwave until digestion or extraction is complete. Repeat if necessary by adding 5 mL more of aqua regia. [NOTE\u2014 Where closed vessel microwave digestion is necessary, follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures to ensure safe usage. ] [NOTE\u2014 In closed vessel microwave digestion, the use of concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) is not recommended.

The chapter also describes criteria for acceptable alternative procedures. Alternative procedures that meet the validation requirements described herein may be considered equivalent to Procedures 1 and 2 for the purposes of this test. In addition, system standardization and suitability evaluation using applicable reference materials should be performed on the day of analysis. The requirement for an elemental impurity test is specified in General Notices and Requirements or in the individual monograph. By means of verification studies, analysts will confirm that the analytical procedures described herein, as well as alternative analytical procedures, are suitable foruse on specified material. Speciation The determination of the oxidation state, organic complex or combination is termed speciation . Analytical procedures for speciation are not included in this chapter but examples may be found elsewhere in the USP-NF and in the literature. Definitions Concentrated Acid: Concentrated ultra-pure nitric, sulfuric, hydrochloric, or hydrofluoric acids or Aqua Regia Matched Matrix: Solutions having the same solvent composition as the Sample solution. In the case of aqueous solution, matched matrix would indicate that the same acids, acid concentrations, and mercury stabilizer are used in both preparations.Target Elements: Elements with the potential of being present in the material under test. Target Elements must include lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium and should include any of those remaining elemental impurities presented in general chapter Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits 232 that are used in production of the material under test or the components therein. Target Elements should also include any other elements that may be added through material processing or storage or any elements whose presence may interfere with the operation of the analytical procedures. [NOTE\u2014 Exclusion of elements from the list does not exempt the user from compliance with the requirements described in Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits 232 or in this chapter. ] Target Limit or Target Concentration: The uppermost acceptance value for the elemental impurity being evaluated. Exceeding the target limit indicates that a material under test exceeds the acceptable value. The determination of37(3) In-Process Revision: <233> ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES--PROC... http://www.usppf.com/pf/pub/data/v373/CHA_IPR_373_c233.html#CHA.. . 7 of 12 6/6/2011 9:30 A M compliance is addressed in other chapters. [ NOTE\u2014 Target Limits can be approximated by dividing the Modified Daily Dose PDEs by the maximum daily dose for the Drug Product Analysis Option in 232 or the Daily Serving PDE divided by the maximum daily serving size in 2232 ] (see Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits 232 or Elemental Contaminants in Dietary Supplements 2232 ). J: The concentration (w/w) of the element(s) of interest at the Target Limit , appropriately diluted to the working range of the instrument. Appropriate Reference Materials: Where Appropriate Reference Materials are specified in the chapter, certified reference materials (CRM) from a national metrology institute (NMI, e.g., the National Institute of Standards andTechnology in the United States) or reference materials that are traceable to the CRM of a NMI should be used. COMPENDIAL PROCEDURES 1 AND 2 Procedure and Detection Technique Procedure 1 can be used for elemental impurities generally amenable to detection by inductively coupled plasma- atomic (optical) emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES or ICP-OES). Procedure 2 can be used for elemental impurities generally amenable to detection by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Before initial use, theanalyst should verify that the procedure is appropriate for the instrument and sample used (procedural verification) bymeeting the Alternative Procedure Validation requirements below. Sample Preparation Forms of sample preparation include Neat , Direct Aqueous Solution , Direct Organic Solution , and Indirect Solution . The selection of the appropriate sample preparation depends on the material under test and is the responsibility of theanalyst. When a sample preparation is not indicated in the monograph, an analyst may use any of the followingappropriately verified preparation procedures. Samples and blanks may be spiked with Target Elements where an analyte has limited solubility in the solvent system of choice. Standard solutions may contain multiple Target Elements. [ NOTE\u2014 All liquid samples should be weighed. ] Neat: Used for liquids or alternative procedures that allow the examination of unsolvated samples. Direct Aqueous Solution: Used when the sample is soluble in an aqueous solvent. Direct Organic Solution: Used where the sample is soluble in an organic solvent. Indirect Solution: Used when a material is not directly soluble in aqueous or organic solvents. Digest the sample using a closed-vessel digestion procedure, similar to the procedure provided below. The sample preparation scheme shouldyield sufficient sample to allow quantification of each element at the limit specified in the corresponding monograph or chapter. Closed Vessel Digestion: This sample-preparation procedure is designed for samples that must be digested in a Concentrated Acid using a closed-vessel digestion apparatus. Closed-vessel digestion minimizes the loss of volatile impurities. The choice of a Concentrated Acid depends on the sample matrix. The use of any of the Concentrated Acids may be appropriate, but each introduces inherent safety risks. Therefore, appropriate safety precautions should be employed at all times. [ NOTE\u2014 Weights and volumes provided may be adjusted to meet the requirements of the digestion apparatus used. ] An example procedure that has been shown to have broad applicability is the following: Dehydrate and predigest 0.5 g of primary sample in 5 mL of freshly prepared Concentrated Acid . Allow to sit loosely covered for 30 minutes in a fume hood. Add an additional 10 mL of Concentrated Acid , and digest, using a closed vessel technique, until digestion or extraction is complete. Repeat if necessary by adding an additional 5 mL of37(3) In-Process Revision: <233> ELEMENTAL IMPURITIES--PROC... http://www.usppf.com/pf/pub/data/v373/CHA_IPR_373_c233.html#CHA.. . 9:30 A M Concentrated Acid . [NOTE\u2014 Where closed vessel digestion is necessary, follow the manufacturer's recommended procedures to ensure safe use. ] Reagents: All reagents used for the preparation of sample and standard solutions should be free of elemental impurities, in accordance with Plasma Spectrochemistry 730 . Procedure 1: ICP-AES Standardization Solution 1: 2 J of the Target Element(s) in a Matched Matrix Standardization Solution 2: 0.5 J of the Target Element(s) in a Matched Matrix Sample Stock Solution: Proceed as directed in Sample Preparation above.

[ NOTE\u2014 Appropriate measures must be taken to correct for matrix-induced interferences (e.g., argon chloride interference with arsenic determinations. ] ALTERNATE PROCEDURE VALIDATION If a specified compendial procedure does not meet the needs of a specific application, an alternative procedure may be used (see General Notices 6.30). Alternative procedures must be validated and must be acceptable and therefore equivalent to the compendial procedures for the purposes of the test. The principles of validation are provided in general chapter Validation of Compendial Procedures 1225 . The level of validation necessary to ensure that an alternative procedure is acceptable depends on whether a limit test or a quantitative determination is necessary. The requirements for validation of an elemental impurities procedure for either type of determination are described below. Where this information differs from that presented in Validation of Compendial Procedures 1225 , the parameters and acceptance criteria presented in this chapter take precedence. Any alternative procedure that has been validated and meets the acceptance criteria that follow is considered to be equivalent to the compendial procedures for the purposes of this test. LIMIT PROCEDURES The following section defines the validation parameters for the acceptability of alternative limit procedures. Meetingthese requirements must be demonstrated experimentally using an appropriate system suitability procedure andreference material. Meeting these requirements demonstrates that the procedure is equivalent to the compendial procedure as a limit procedure for the Target Element . The suitability of the method must be determined by conducting studies with test materials supplemented with known concentrations of each Target Element of interest at the appropriate acceptance limit concentration. The test materials must be spiked before any sample preparation steps are performed.

Spiked Sample Solution 1: Prepare a solution of sample under test, spiked with appropriate reference materials for the Target Elements at the Target Concentration , solubilized or digested as described in Sample Preparation . Spiked Sample Solution 2: Prepare a solution of the sample under test, spiked with appropriate reference materials at80% of the Target Concentration for the Target Elements , solubilized or digested as described in Sample Preparation . Blank solution : A sample of material under test, solubilized or digested in the same manner as the Sample Solutions . Acceptance Criteria Non-Instrumental Procedures: Spiked Sample Solution 1 provides a signal or intensity equivalent to or greater than that of the Standard Solution. Spiked Sample Solution 2 must provide a signal or intensity less than that of the Spiked Solution 1. [ NOTE\u2014 The signal from each Spiked Sample is NLT the blank determination. ] Instrumental Procedures: The average value of the replicate measurements of Spiked Sample Solution 1 is equivalent to (\u00b110%) or greater than that of the average value obtained for the replicate measurements of the Standard Solution . The average value of the replicate measurements of Spiked Sample Solution 2 must provide a signal intensity or value less than that of the Standard Solution . [NOTE\u2014 Correct the values obtained for each of the spiked solutions using the Blank Solution. ] Precision for Instrumental Methods (Repeatability) [NOTE\u2014 Non-instrumental precision is demonstrated by meeting the Limit of Detection requirement above. ] Sample Solutions: Six independent samples of the material under test, spiked with appropriate reference materials for the Target Elements at the indicated levels. Acceptance Criteria Relative standard deviation: NMT 20% for each Target Element. Specificity The procedure must be able to unequivocally assess each Target Element in the presence of components that may be expected to be present, including other Target Elements , and matrix components. QUANTITA TIVE PROCEDURES The following section defines the validation parameters for the acceptability of alternative quantitative procedures. Meeting these requirements must be demonstrated experimentally, using an appropriate system suitability procedure and reference material. Meeting these requirements demonstrates that the procedure is equivalent to the compendialprocedure for the purpose of quantifying the Target Elements. Accuracy Standard Solutions: Prepare solutions containing the Target Elements at concentrations ranging from 50% to 150% of J, using appropriate reference materials. Test Samples: Prepare samples of the material under test spiked with appropriate reference materials before anysample preparation steps (digestion or solubilization) at concentrations ranging from 50% to 150% of J for each Target Element .37(3) In-Process ELEMENTAL MAcceptance Criteria Spike recovery: 70%-150% for the mean of three replicate preparations at each concentration. Precision REPEATABILITY Test Samples: Six independent samples of material under test [ NOTE\u2014 Taken from the same lot ] spiked with appropriate reference materials for the Target Element(s) at the indicated level. Acceptance Criteria Relative standard deviation: NMT 20% for each Target Element. RUGGEDNESS Perform the Repeatability analysis on different days, or1. with different instrumentation, or2. with different analysts.3. Executing only one of the three experiments listed is required to demonstrate ruggedness. Acceptance Criteria Relative standard deviation: NMT 20% for each Target Element. Specificity The procedure must be able to unequivocally assess each Target Element in the presence of components that may be expected to be present, including other Target Elements , and matrix components.

(A 1%-5% solution of aqua regia is used as a rinsing soluti on between analyses and as calibration blanks.) 2 Sulfuric acid should be used only when absolutely needed, for the following reasons: Upon addition of sulfuric acid, elements may be lost as a result of extreme exothermic reaction. The viscosity of sulfuric acid is higher than that of other acids, which affects the overall flow of solution.

Hence, thebulk density depends on both the density of powder parti-cles and the spatial arrangement of particles in the powder Precisionbed. The bulk density is expressed in grams per mL (g/mL)although the international unit is kilograms per cubic meter(1 g/mL = 1000 kg/m 3) because the measurements are made using cylinders.
