Delays in diagnosis and care result in: Needless suffering Increases in community spread Perpetuation of stigma and inequities Be prepared to evaluate patients with monkeypox symptoms while providing a welcoming and affirming care environment. Some examples of affirming care: Ask patients for their gender pronouns: \"What name and pronouns would you like us to use?\" or \"I would like to be respectful \u2014 how would you like to be addressed?\" Additionally, ask what terms they use for their bodies or specific body parts When taking a sexual history, consider saying: \"It's important for me to understand your medical history in detail to provide yo u the best health care possible.\" Avoid assumptions about patients' sexual orientation or the gender or gender identity of their partners. Avoid assumptions regarding the types of sexual activity (e.g., oral, anal, vaginal, or no sexual activity at all) that people e ngage in. Elicit this information with open -ended questions. DoNOT assume that a patient is at high risk on the basis of gender identity; rather, risk assessment should be based on each individual's sexual history. https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/clinicians/transforming- health/health -care -providers/sexual -history.htmlIfyou suspect -specimens.html NB:testing inpopulation with lowprevalence more likely tohave falsely positive results Notify health department and your facility's infection control team Can behelpful with contact tracing and identifying person eligible forpost -exposure prophylaxis Consider labs (10,000 tests/week) LRN labs (located within thestate public FDA cleared Commercial laboratory testing isnow available (70,000 additional tests/week) 40,000 testing capacity perweek using CDC NVO test 30,000 tests ofcommercial MPOX -specific laboratory test Current testing capacity isatleast 80,000 tests perweekTesting forSuspect MPX Cases Specimen type types through aresearch protocol Specifics ontheacceptable lesion specimen type accepted within theLRN and commercial laboratories (e.g., dryswab orswab inVTM orUTM) This isbased testing foranysuspect monkeypox patient Based onclinical presentation and/or thepositive predictive oftest results Other differentials should also be ifthere are noknown monkeypox epilinks or CPT formonkeypox testing isavailable atcommercial labs yet Each commercial labperforming testing may have their own CPT billing codes formonkeypox that canbeaccessed ontheir website byclinicians The company performing thetesting willbillprivate insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare Orthopoxvirus Results Interpretation There arenoother circulating orthopoxviruses within theUnited States that cause systemic disease Clinical care such asisolation recommendations should begin based onthe orthopoxvirus test result and should notwait onanyadditional viral characterization case of monkeypox Report within 24 hours: Positive or negative monkeypox or non-variola orthopoxvirus test resultsHealthcare Infection Prevention and ControlHealthcare IPC 101 - Monkeypox Have processes in place to rapidly identify transmissible infectious organisms at patient/resident presentation. Examples: screening algorithms or questions. Standard Precautions AND Personal Protective Equipment: Gowns, Gloves, eye protection, and N95 or higher -level respirator Place in single -person room with door closed (if safe to do so) ; dedicated bathroom Patient should wear a well -fitting mask as source control and have any exposed skin lesions covered when transported outside of the room. Aerosol generating procedures should be performed in an airborne infection isolation room ( AIIR), (negative pressure room) See next slide for additional IPC guidance. Notify Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Department or Designee To ensure appropriate IPC prevention measures are instituted and to monitor potential healthcare worker or patient/resident exposures. Notify Maine CDC at 1 -800- 821- 5821 Any confirmed case of monkeypox is immediately reportable to Maine CDC within 24 hours; and All monkeypox or non-variola orthopoxvirus test results (positive or negative) are reportable to Maine CDC within 24 hoursIdentify Isolate Inform U.S. CDC IPC guidance :https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/infection- control -healthcare.html Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Questions, contact MECDC.HAI@maine.govHealthcare IPC 101 - Monkeypox Cont. Environmental Considerations Cleaning/Disinfection : Standard cleaning & disinfection procedures using an EPA -registered hospital-grade disinfectant with an -viral- pathogens -evps -list-q Use wet cleaning methods if possible. Avoid activities that could resuspend dried material from lesions, e.g., use of portable fans, dry dusting, sweeping, vacuuming. Soiled Laundry (e.g., bedding, towels, personal clothing): Handle in accordance with recommended standard practices, avoiding contact with lesion material that may be present on the laund ry. Should be gently and promptly contained in an appropriate laundry bag and should never be shaken or handled in manner that ma y disperse infectious material. Waste management : West African Clade currently circulating based on testing. In general, manage waste as Regulated Medical Waste (RMW), Category B . If you have determined that patient has known epidemiological risk for the Congo Basin clade ( e.g., history of travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, or Gabon in the prior 21 days) , manage waste as Category A infectious substance pending clade confirmation. Duration of Precautions Minimally Isolation Precautions should be maintained until all lesions have crusted, those crusts have separated, and a fresh layer of healthy skin has formed underneath. For questions/consultations please feel free to reach out to Maine CDC. Exposure Management Utilizes a degree of exposure risk assessment, see: https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/monitoring.html U.S. CDC IPC guidance :https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/infection- control -healthcare.html Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Questions, contact MECDC.HAI@maine.govVaccinationVaccination Jynneos is an FDA -approved vaccine used to prevent monkeypox infection among at -riskindividuals 18 years and older. Made from a non- replicating virus, so Jynneos can be given to people with weakened immune systems, and those who are pregnant or who have other health conditions. Subcutaneous vaccine series with two -doses at 0 and 28 days (+/ -7 days). CDC recommends that the vaccine be given within 4 days from the date ofexposure in order to prevent onset of the disease. If given between 4-14 days after the date of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease, but may not prevent the disease. People who receive Jynneos are not considered vaccinated until 2 weeks after they receive the second dose of the vaccine.JYNNEOS Replication -deficient Vaccinia virus Licensed aspre- exposure prophylaxis forlaboratory and other personnel with occupational exposure toorthopoxviruses Booster doses recommended every 2years forthose with exposure tomonkeypox The only contraindication issevere allergy toavaccine component. Side effects include injection sitereactions; serious side effects arerare. The other vaccines oJYNNEOS typically may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines. This includes simultaneous administration of JYNNEOS and other vaccines on the same day, but at different anatomic sites if possible. See ACIP's general best practices andEpidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pink Book) for further information.(See Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines | CDC ) Given potential common risk factors for acquiring hepatitis A and monkeypox, those seeking Jynneos vaccine due to elevated risk factors should also be protected against hep A through co- administration with the hepatitis A vaccine.Antibody response with arenoefficacy data onPEP with JYNNEOS forthecurrent outbreak.

Maine may receive an additional 660 doses over the next two months. This supply includes 1 stand 2nddoses. We must balance the use of Jynneos for close contacts and for those at elevated risk of exposure. 44Vaccine Allocations Total Available Doses: Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Expanded Post Exposure Prophylaxis (Expanded PEP) Close contacts of confirmed cases of monkeypox infection Close contacts of unconfirmed cases of monkeypox infectionFor people who are possible close contacts not identified through public health investigations, and otherwise meet eligibility criteria **This planned vaccine allocation could change if Maine identifies confirmed cases in coming weeks, as priority will be given to close contacts of confirmed cases (i.e., PEP). If high cases are recorded, PEP++ may be paused, based on vaccine supply. Expanding Vaccine Eligibility and Access Current Jynneos eligibility is for: High -riskclose contacts of someone with monkeypox, OR Gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and/or transgender, gender non-conforming, or gender non -binary who have had multiple sexual partners Maine is also expanding the number of clinics that will offer the vaccine.Expanded PEP Vaccination Locations Location Clinic Name Augusta Maine Family Planning MaineGeneral -Horizon Clinic Bangor Maine Family Planning Ogunquit/Kennebunk Local Roots Health Care Lewiston Maine Family Planning Portland City of Portland MMP Gilman St. Clinic South Portland Greater Portland HealthTreatment Who to treat for monkeypox How to prescribe TPOXX Where to access treatmentTreatment Considerations forMonkeypox Many individuals infected with monkeypox virus have amild, self-limiting disease course intheabsence ofspecific therapy The prognosis formonkeypox depends onmultiple factors such as previous vaccination status, initial health status, and concurrent illnesses or comorbiditiesTreatment Considerations forMonkeypox Persons who should beconsidered fortreatment following consultation with CDC might include: Persons with severe disease (e.g., hemorrhagic disease, confluent lesions, sepsis, encephalitis, orother conditions requiring hospitalization) Persons who may beathigh riskofsevere disease: People with immunocompromising conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, etc.) Pediatric populations, particularly patients younger than 8years ofage Pregnant orbreastfeeding women People with ahistory orpresence ofatopic dermatitis, people with other active exfoliative skin conditions People with one ormore complication Persons with monkeypox virus aberrant infections that include its accidental implantation ineyes, mouth, orother anatomical areas where monkeypox virus infection might constitute aspecial hazard (e.g., thegenitals oranus)Clinical Considerations forTreatment and Prophylaxis inPeople with HIV People advanced HIVorwho arenotvirologically suppressed with antiretroviral therapy canbeatincreased riskofsevere disease related tomonkeypox virus infection Post -exposure prophylaxis antiviral treatments areavailable for persons exposed tomonkeypox orwith monkeypox virus infection Antiviral treatments have few interactions with antiretroviral therapy Vaccination with JYNNEOS isconsidered Oral capsule and IVformulations approved byFDA forthetreatment ofhuman smallpox disease inadults and pediatric patients under Animal Rule Efficacy based onstudies ofnon- human primates infected with monkeypox and rabbits infected with rabbitpox Safety evaluation in359 healthy adults (18-79years) Tecovirimat useforunapproved indications (i.e., uses notcovered bytheFDA- approved labeling) requires analternative regulatory mechanism (e.g., Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) orEmergency Use Authorization) https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2018/208627s000lbl.pdfDosing: oral <13 kg: Safety and efficacy not established 13 kg to <25 kg: 200 mg PO BID for 14 days25 kg to <40 kg: 400 mg PO BID for 14 days40 kg to <120 kg: 600 mg PO BID for 14 days120 kg: 600 mg PO TID for 14 days Take within 30 minutes after eating a full mealDosing: IV Use for patients weighing <13 kg OR if unable to take PO If IV treatment is necessary, conversion from IV to oral is recommended as soon as oral treatment can be toleratedIn patients receiving an IV infusion, give the first oral dose at the next scheduled IV dosing <3 kg: Safety and efficacy not established 3 kg to <35 kg: 6 mg/kg IV over 6 hr q12hr for 14 days;
