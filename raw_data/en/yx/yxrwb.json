[Jada Jackson](/author/227648/jada-jackson/)and [Medgina Saint-Elien](/author/228418/medgina-saint-elien/) Keeping your family safe is the highest priority and there's no better way to ensure your home is [ safe and clean](https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/a39038542/safely-cleaning-products-review/) than natural cleaning products. Many traditional cleaning solutions are full of harmful chemicals (many that are too difficult to pronounce) and incredibly harsh to use in your home. It's imperative to use cleaning products that are healthy, non-toxic, and\u2014whenever possible\u2014eco-friendly. \"Technology has advanced in the world of green chemistry dramatically in the past 10 to 15 years. It's now possible for eco-friendly products to match the performance of harsh conventional cleaning products, the L'AVANT Collective team shares.\" Finding trustworthy cleaning solutions can be tricky, but we reviewed [family-approved](https://www.housebeautiful.com/shopping/g37910969/family-approved-awards-2021/) products for every corner of your home. These lifesavers will easily become a staple in your home's regular cleaning routine! What to Look For - James Dudra, the co-founder of [Therapy Clean](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://therapyclean.com/__;!!Ivohdkk!x5E5sH2WMJCOZVItGLmsqVmFUeuL1GNSeSoN9wsdK2hDqofYAaORKIZYvKaBrBJI0_ca71Q$)explains, \"It's important to understand what is actually inside the product being used. Look for products that openly list all their ingredients on the label. In tandem, consumers can reference websites such as the Environmental Working Group as a guide to better understand what these materials are and their safety.\" - According to Kristi Lord and Lindsay Droz, the co-founders of [L'AVANT Collective](https://lavantcollective.com/pages/about), a visual cue outside of the label is the color of the cleaning product. \"If the soap or cleaning product is blue, yellow, orange, or any other color, that should be the first indication that the product may contain harmful ingredients. Color and dyes serve only for aesthetic reasons and do not aid in the performance of cleaning products.\" - What isn't listed is just as important as what is. \"Safer cleaning alternatives typically list whether they're free from parabens, phosphates, bleach, phthalates, dyes, and triclosan. These ingredients can be harsh skin irritants, give off harmful VOCs or harm our waterways,\" the duo explains. - \"Look for products certified by third-party agencies as this helps substantiate any \"green\" claims made on the label. Leading agencies include USDA BioPreferred, EPA SaferChoice, and Leaping Bunny,\" Dudra advises. The list below includes all-natural cleaners for sprucing up any furniture in your house after you finish your dusting to vegan cleaning solutions that you can actually customize yourself. The majority of these great options are refillable too, which is affordable and reduces waste. Below, we rounded up some of the best options for your home and family\u2014and the planet, too. Happy cleaning! Ingredients Found in Natural Cleaning Products:\"I think 'eco-friendly' cleaning products have gotten a bad reputation in years past because formulators were willing to skimp on performance for safety. Thankfully, there are more powerful ingredients with safer profiles that companies can integrate into their products,\" Dudra expresses. Decyl Glucoside: workhorse surfactant (soap) that is used in many hard surface cleaners Vegetable Glycerin: natural moisturizing properties for products that need to re-nourish surfaces Citric Acid: naturally found in citrus fruits such as lemons/limes. Used to help adjust pH Vinegar: natural solvent which can enhance cleaning power Essential Oils: used to enhance the cleaning experience and evoke positive emotions Coconut Oil: natural gloss agent in polishes Medgina Saint-Elien covers everything your home needs.
