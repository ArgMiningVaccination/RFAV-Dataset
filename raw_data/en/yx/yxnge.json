(k) The board may conduct an assessment of a licensee's, certificate holder's, or permit holder's fitness to practice pursuant to this chapter if it has disciplined the licensee, certificate holder, or permit holder three times in the last ten years as a re sult of an action for medical malpractice. The assessment shall include an examination of the licensee's, certificate holder's, or permit holder's entire history with respect to practice pursuant to this chapter and a one -day on -site visit to the licensee' s, certificate holder's, or permit holder's current practice location. The assessment shall be completed within six months of the third disciplinary action. As a result of its findings the board may take any action it deems necessary to reduce medical erro rs and promote patient safety, including revocation, suspension, or limiting the licensee's, certificate holder's, or permit holder's license, certificate, or permit or requiring additional clinical training, additional continuing medical education, procto ring, or referral to appropriate rehabilitation facilities.

The board may restore and reissue a license, certificate, or permit to practice under this chapter and, as a condition thereof, may impose any disciplinary sanction provided by this Code section. (n) Subsections (a) and (b) of this Cod e section shall be supplemental to and shall not operate to prohibit the board from acting pursuant to those provisions of law which may now or hereafter authorize other disciplinary grounds and actions for the board. In cases where those other provisions of law so authorize other disciplinary grounds and actions but subsections (a) and (b) of this Code section limit such grounds for action, those other provisions shall apply.

Short title This article shall be known and may be cited as the \"Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act.\" HISTORY: Code 1933, \u00a7 84 -901A, enacted by Ga. L. 1980, p. 82, \u00a7 1; Ga. L. 2009, p. 859, \u00a7 1/HB 509. \u00a7 43-34-121. Legislative intent (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the potential medicinal valu e of marijuana has received insufficient study due to a lack of financial incentives for the undertaking of appropriate research by private drug manufacturing concerns. Individual physicians cannot feasibly utilize marijuana in clinical trials because of f ederal governmental controls which involve expensive, time -consuming approval and monitoring procedures. (b) The General Assembly further finds and declares that limited studies throughout the nation indicate that marijuana and certain of its derivatives possess valuable and, in some cases, unique therapeutic properties, including the ability to relieve nausea and vomiting which routinely accompany chemotherapy and irradiation used to treat cancer patients. Marijuana also may be effective in reducing intra ocular pressure in glaucoma patients who do not respond well to conventional medications. (c) The General Assembly further finds and declares that, in enabling individual physicians and their patients to participate in a state -sponsored program for the in vestigational use of marijuana and its derivatives, qualified physicians and surgeons throughout the state will be able to study the benefits of the drug in a controlled clinical setting, and additional knowledge will be gained with respect to dosage and e ffects. (d) It is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this article to permit research into the therapeutic applications of marijuana and its derivatives in cancer and glaucoma patients. This would allow qualified physicians approved by the Pati ent Qualification Review Board created by Code Section 43 -34-124 to provide the drug on a compassionate basis to seriously ill persons suffering from the severe side effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatment and to persons suffering from glaucoma who are not responding to conventional treatment, which persons would otherwise have no lawful access to it. It is the further intent of the General Assembly to facilitate clinical trials of marijuana and its derivatives, particularly with respect to persons s uffering from cancer and glaucoma who would be benefited by use of the drug. (e) This article is limited to clinical trials and research into therapeutic applications of marijuana only for use in treating glaucoma and in treating the side effects of chemo therapeutic agents and radiation and should not be construed as either encouraging or sanctioning the social use of marijuana. Nothing in this article shall be construed to encourage the use of marijuana in lieu of or in conjunction with other accepted med ical treatment, but only as an adjunct to such accepted medical treatment.

ORTHOTICS AND PROSTHETICS PRACTICE \u00a7 43-34-190. Short title This article shall be known and may be cited as the \"Orthotics and Prosthetics Practice Act.\" HISTORY: Code 1981, \u00a7 43 enacted by Ga. L. 2002, p. 1273, \u00a7 1; Ga. L. 2009, p. 859, \u00a7 1/HB 509. \u00a7 43-34-191. Findings of General Assembly The General Assembly finds that the practice of orthotics and prosthetics in this state is an allied health profession recognized by the American Medical Association, with educational standards established by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. The increasing population of elderly and physically challenged individuals who need orthotic and prosthetic services requires that the orthotic and prosthetic professions be regulated to ensure the provision of high -quality services and devices. The people of this state deserve the best care available and will benefit from the a ssurance of initial and ongoing professional competence of the orthotists and prosthetists practicing in this state. The practice of orthotics and prosthetics serves to improve and enhance the lives of individuals with disabilities by enabling them to resu me productive lives following serious illness, injury, or trauma. Unregulated dispensing of orthotic and prosthetic care does not adequately meet the needs or serve the interests of the public. In keeping with requirements imposed on similar health discipl ines, licensure of the orthotic and prosthetic professions will help ensure the health and safety of consumers, as well as maximize their functional abilities and productivity levels. This article shall be liberally construed to best carry out these subjec ts and purposes. HISTORY: Code 1981, \u00a7 43 -34-191, enacted by Ga. L. 2002, p. 1273, \u00a7 1; Ga.
