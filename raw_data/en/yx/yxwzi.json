By integrating quick, simple practices into your day, you can create transformative moments of relaxation and rejuvenation. These easy \"sparks\" of yoga are widely accessible, regardless of age or fitness level, and no previous yoga experience is required. Join yoga therapist Carol Krucoff to learn \"Yoga Sparks,\" a series of micropractices designed to help you find comfort, peace, and joy in your body, mind, and spirit. These are drawn from the four main aspects of yoga: Postures, Breathing, Meditation, and Principles (such as honesty and contentment). This workshop will consist of both lecture and practice, so please wear comfortable clothes you can move in.
