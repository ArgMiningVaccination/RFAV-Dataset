Toward enhancing the quality of HPT, the investigator proposed and evaluated the data using the Quantitative Pathogenetic Index and Qualitative Pathogenetic Index. Usable symptoms were derived from the study. The medicine was suggested for the treatment of vitiligo, based on its known toxicological effects. HPT of a new medicinal substance, using the established parameters, to evaluate symptoms in healthy volunteers was carried out using a controlled experiment. Aims: The aim of the study was to conduct a HPT using the accepted and scientific guidelines to derive clinically usable symptoms. Material and Methods: A doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled homoeopathic pathogenetic trial was conducted in 22 volunteers (provers), out of whom 15 received Hydroquinone in 30C potency, thrice daily, for four weeks, while seven received the placebo. The volunteer's symptoms during the initial seven days of the runin period were carefully noted, and these were used as a filter, by elimination of the same symptoms in that volunteer during the verum phase. Thorough documentation such as Informed Consent Form, approval by the Ethics Committee, laboratory investigations, and safety and ethical measures, were taken care of. The volunteers were trained to write data in the prescribed diaries which was analyzed at the end. The investigator introduced Quantitative and Qualitative Pathogenetic Indices as parameters in the evaluation of the data derived from the HPT. Results: The HPT of Hydroquinone exhibited qualitatively distinct symptoms, which could be applied in clinical practice. Safe use was documented. An anecdotal study supported the proposed efficacy of Hydroquinone for the treatment of vitiligo and further exploration could be carried out. Conclusion: The HPT of Hydroquinone brought in qualitative symptoms. It was noted that a potentized preparation could produce many functional symptoms, but could not produce degenerative pathological symptoms such as vitiligo. The preparation could be used by the profession for vitiligo on the basis of its toxicological effects, supported by the anecdotal study. The Quantitative and Qualitative Pathogenetic Indices could further be used in future HPTs as a tool.

It causes reversible inhibition of cellular metabolism by affecting both the DNA and RNA syntheses [8] and can be considered a potent melanocyte cytotoxic agent with relatively high melanocytespecific cytotoxicity. [1] In turn, it produces loss of pigment, which is comparable with vitiligo. Two percent Hydroquinone is readily available over the counter in various cosmetic preparations in various countries. Evidence of improvement in the cases of hyperpigmentation with Hydroquinone (monotherapy) is usually observed in fourtosix weeks, with the improvement appearing to plateau at approximately four months. Concentrations as high as 10% can be compounded extemporaneously for refractory cases. [9] Hydroquinone : Known effects on humans and animals In animals, the acute oral toxicity (LD50) is 320 mg/kg in rats. Acute dermal toxicity (LD50): mg/kg in mammals. [10] The toxicological effects of hydroquinone on humans and animals are known and may be summarized as under:1. Hypopigmentation[1,2,4,7,11] 2. Skin irritation,[12,13] mild rash and burning,[12] and ulceration[11] 3. Exogenous ochronosis: [3,14] A condition where there is accumulation of homogentisic acid in the connective tissues 4. Longterm feeding of Hydroquinone to rats has led to aplastic anaemia, liver cordcell atrophy, and ulceration of the gastric mucosa [4] 5. A single high dose was reported to induce renal tubule necrosis in rats[4] 6. Cancer: Hydroquinone has been suspected to be a carcinogen.[15] In skin painting studies in mice, Hydroquinone was inactive as an initiator of skin carcinogenesis. Oral ingestion of Hydroquinone did not produce cancer of the stomach or bladder in a study on mice. [4] 7. Eyes: Conjunctivitis, k eratitis, and discolouration of the conjunctiva.[11,16] Causes eye irritation and possible burns. May cause redness, pain, blurring of vision and possible eye and cornea [13] damage.[11] 8. May cause dizziness, nausea, sense of suffocation, increased respiratory rate, vomiting, pallor, muscle twitching, cyanosis (bluish discolouration of skin due to deficient oxygenation of the blood), delirium, and collapse. May cause liver damage leading to jaundice. May cause harmful nervous system effects, including tremors and convulsions. [11]INTRODUCTION Hydroquinone is a phenol compound that is known to have melanocytespecific cytotoxicity,[1] used in conventional medicine as a topical therapeutic agent to lighten pigmentation on skin, in conditions such as melasma. [2,3] Based on the Law of Similars, the investigator used potentized Hydroquinone in many patients having vitiligo or hypopigmentation in 1998, and later, with encouraging results. Subsequently, a doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled homoeopathic pathogenetic trial was conducted to investigate this effects of the substance on healthy volunteers. General Information Hydroquinone is a type of phenol, which is an aromatic organic compound. [2] It can be considered a simple polyphenol. It is a white granular solid substance. Substituted derivatives of this parent compound are also referred to as hydroquinones. [2] Specifications Hydroquinone's chemical structure has two hydroxyl groups bonded to a benzene ring in a para position. Some specifications [4] of hydroquinone are as follows: Ballandstick model of the rotamer of hydroquinone[2,5]Structure of hydroquinone[2,6] Other names Quinol, Benzene1,4diol Chemical formula C6H4(OH)2 Molecular formula C6H6O2 Relative molecular g/100 mL (15\u00b0C), ethanol, and diethyl ether(Lewis, 1993) Vapor pressure 532 Pa at 150\u00b0C; relative vapor density (air=1), 3.81 (V erschueren, 1996) Flashpoint 165\u00b0C, closed cup (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 1992) Conversion factor mg/m3=4.5\u00d7ppm CAS Number 123319 Hydroquinone : Use in conventional medicine Hydroquinone is an important industrial chemical. It is an ubiquitous chemical, readily available in cosmetic and nonprescription forms as a skin lighten agent.

May cause r espiratory tract irritation. Inhalation may be fatal as a result of spasm, inflammation, oedema of the larynx and bronchi, chemical pneumonitis, and pulmonary oedema. Central nervous system effects may include confusion, ataxia (failure of muscular coordination), vertigo, tinnitus, weakness, disorientation, lethargy, drowsiness, and finally coma. May be harmful if inhaled. May cause burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Pure hydroquinone does not readily form a vapour at room temperature. The dust my cause irritation of the nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract. [11] 10.

[1719] Hydroquinone : A new medicine proposed in homoeopathy Hydroquinone (Investigational Product - IP) as a new homoeopathic medicine is proposed as a single constituent formulation based on the simple logic that since it has a capacity to produce hypopigmentation (comparable with leucoderma or vitiligo), it could be applied homoeopathically as a remedy to treat hypopigmentation or vitiligo; and some other conditions presenting with hypopigmentation. It has been understood that the application of the homoeopathic medicine is based on (1) Drug proving (2) Toxicological effects, and (3) Clinical use. There are a number of homoeopathic medicines, which are prescribed largely on the basis of their ability to produce certain symptoms or diseases; which may not have been proved in the pathogenetic trials. For example, the use of Tuberculinum in Tuberculosis, use of Arsenic in Cancer, use of Phosphorus and Nitric acid for vitiligo, and so on, where the said medicines have never produced the respective diseases in drug proving, but they are popularly used for those conditions based on their toxicology. Similarly, there are many remedies introduced on the basis of 'provings on the sick' (clinical provings), which have also served a useful purpose. [20] The proposed use of Hydroquinone is one such application of the homoeopathic principle, based on clinical proving, where the investigator has studied this preparation in a good number of cases of vitiligo. Of course, there will be indications besides vitiligo, based on the homoeopathic pathogenetic trial and other indications.HOMOEOPATHIC P A THO g ENETIC T RIA l O B j ECTI v E This protocol is designed to conduct a homoeopathic pathogenetic trial for evaluating the effects of potentized Hydroquinone on healthy human volunteers. MATERIA l AND METHODS The HPT of Hydroquinone was conducted by the author (Principal Investigator PI), through a doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled study, at the Life Force Research Center. The Life Force Research Center has a research staff of one principal investigator having 28 years of clinical practice (Hahnemannian style) and research experience; supported by five study members including four homoeopaths and one clinical trial expert, who had over 10 years of experience in research. The IP was prepared as per the homoeopathic potentization method. The drug was proved in 30c potency on 22 volunteers with a randomization ratio of 2:1, wherein, 15 volunteers were given IP and seven volunteers were given a matching placebo, according to a pregenerated (through a software) random number table. The study involved 4 females and 18 males, out of 22 volunteers, three females were on the drug and one female was on placebo. The dose and frequency of the investigational product was designed as 30C potency, six pills three times a day, for four weeks. The volunteers and investigator were blinded from the drug name and its allocation. The volunteers signed the Informed Consent Forms. The blind for randomization was maintained till the completion of the proving period. The proving volunteers were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as per the protocol of the Hydroquinone study. The volunteers were in the age group of 18 to 45 years, mean age being 26.5 years, from different walks of life, from different locations, such as urban and various suburbs of Mumbai, having a different socioeconomic status, and having different occupations, including homoeopathic students and homoeopaths. The volunteers underwent preobservation and postobservation investigations. Detailed present and past clinical histories of the volunteers were recorded in case record forms. Each volunteer had completed the intake of the doses as per the protocol schedule and the oneweek doses [Downloaded free from http://www.ijrh.org on Monday, September 22, 2014, IP: 120.63.246.244] || Click here to download free this journalShah: Hydroquinone : Homoeopathic Pathogenetic TrialIndian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy / Vol. 7 / Issue 2 / Apr-Jun 2013 50of placebo as a runin period. Each volunteer visited the Life Force Center for screening and six weekly followup visits. At each visit, the volunteers were examined by the PI and study doctors. The symptoms generated during the trial period were noted (up to six weeks) by the volunteers in the diary provided to them and they were crossexamined and the symptoms were elaborated by the proving master. The proving master (investigator) had compiled the data after decoding (opening the blind). Source Hydroquinone is available commercially in the pharmaceutical and research market, with a purity of about 99.5%. The inventor procured six grams of Hydroquinone. Vehicle Used for Dilution Sterile water for injection was used to prepare up to 10C potency. Subsequently, higher potencies were prepared using dispensing alcohol (alcohol content 90% v/v), especially for storage and dispensing purpose. Six grams of Hydroquinone was dissolved in 100 ml of water; 0.03 ml of solution was then mixed with 2.97 ml of water for injection (600 micrograms per ml) in a clean glass vial, using a micropipette, and labeled as HQM (Hydroquinone mother preparation). Potentization HQM was potentized using an electromechanical potentizer machine, with the following considerations: i. Machine st andardization W eight of arm: 7.5 kg Arm length: 55 cm Angle: 90 degr ees ii. F orce = Weight \u00d7 Gravitational acceleration =7.5 kg \u00d7 9.8 = 73.5 Newton iii. Impact: T orque (Moment of Force) iv. T orque = (tau) = = r \u00d7 F = 0.55 \u00d7 73.5 = 40.43 Nm v. Str okes: Number of strokes applied at each step of potentization was 10, which was counted with a digital device attached to the machine, avoiding human errors. It may be noted that even if there is a change in the above parameters while preparing any new preparation or potency, it is scientifically indicated to have the documentation in place. Uniformity of the impact is possible with the mechanical device, which can never be achieved with handmade potencies. Centesimal and Decimal Scale Potency Preparation HQM of 0.03 ml was mixed with 2.97 ml water for the injection (600 micrograms per ml) in a clean glass vial, using a micropipette, and labeled as Hydroquinone, for making Hydroquinone 1C potency. The proportion of 1: 99 was maintained; 0.03 mL of HQM 1C was then mixed with 2.97 mL water, and subjected to the above process of potentization to arrive at the the Hahnemannian multivial dilution method and labeled accordingly. Similarly, the decimal potencies were prepared using a 1: 10 ratio. The potencies were prepared, labelled, and safely stored for use. Placebo Identical (same size, shape, colour, taste) placebo pills provided were prescribed to the volunteers who were on placebo. Guidelines, Ethics, Compliance, and Approvals The HPT was based on the guidelines advocated by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, MD, in the Organon of Medicine, aphorisms 110145, [21] the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), Government of India, [22] and the European Committee for Homoeopathy (ECH) guidelines.[23] The project was reviewed and approved on 16 January, 2012, by the Institutional Ethics Committee, Homoeopathy India Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, constituted as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. [24] The requirements regarding the obligations of investigators as per the 'Guidance on Good Clinical Practice' as per the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Independent Ethics Committee (ICH) [25] were met with. The drug proving project has been registered (Number: CTRI/2012/03/002506) with the Clinical Trials RegistryIndia (CTRI), [26] set up by the ICMR's National Institute of Medical Statistics (NIMS).When writing the manuscript, data reporting has been done in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (RedHot) guidelines.

Due care was taken to confirm that every female volunteer had a negative pregnancy test, before sending her for Xray chest. Other investigations, if indicated, were done at the last visit. Inclusion, Exclusion and Withdrawal Criteria Preferably homoeopathic doctors or students, who had knowledge of drug proving, were included in the study. However, nonmedico participants were also included, after giving adequate training with regard to the proving and symptom recording method. Inclusion Criteria 1. Healthy volunteers of both sex es in the age group of 18 45 years without significant psychic or physical symptoms, confirmed by history and physical examination. A careful record of the volunteer's present health status, symptoms and reports was maintained in case record. 2. The ppersons who wer e trustworthy, able and ready to express and describe their experiences during the study. 3. V olunteers with no plans for important life changes like relocating, change of job, marriage, medical or surgical treatment. The usual habits and conduct of life continued. 4. V olunteers were in such a mental and legal that they were able to exercise fully their choice and written consent. 5. Their ECG and Xray reports were within normal limits. Exclusion Criteria 1. Curr ent medical treatments or Homoeopathy drugs in the preliminary observation period or during the study. 2. Consumption of pr escribed drugs (including Homoeopathy) in the past four weeks (to be judged by the PI). 3. Contraceptive pills in the past three months. 4. Sur gical treatment within the past two months. 5. Pr egnancy, breastfeeding. 6. P ersons suffering from allergic manifestations particularly pertaining to the respiratory system and skin should not be included in proving (to be judged by the PI).7. V olunteers with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism should not be included in proving. 8. V olunteers who are drug addicts should not be included in proving. Withdrawal Criteria (i.e. terminating drug proving) 1. If a volunteer has to be withdrawn because of a severe adverse event like accident or hospitalization, the data recorded until the event occurrence for such volunteers will be considered for analysis, depending on the investigators discretion, and the volunteers will be marked as 'withdrawal' 2. No r eplacement of withdrawn volunteers 3. V olunteer lost to follow up 4. V olunteer withdraws consent to continue in the drug proving study by himself/herself 5. If a volunteer experiences Serious Adverse Events or serious symptoms due to the drug proving. Cointerventions Volunteers were advised to continue the routine lifestyle and avoid any Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) or mainstream interventions. However, volunteers requiring any interventional treatment were documented. None of the volunteers required an antidote during the study period. Training Volunteers were trained to note down the symptoms in the diaries provided to them, as soon as possible. The proving coordinator was trained to study cases, review symptoms, and coordinate with the volunteers. Data Handling and Record Keeping Records have been maintained in the original handwritten diaries filled in by the volunteers. Data is organized in excel sheets and word documents, subsequently. RunIn Period, dose, and Repetition Every volunteer was given doses of placebo, six pills, three times a day, for one week, and observed for the symptoms. The first week was a runin period. The symptoms experienced during the runin period were documented carefully. Two volunteers produced the same symptoms during the runin period as well as after the intake of the medicine; these symptoms were not incorporated in the final analysis. The dose of six pills (30c potency), three times a day, was administered to every volunteer, for four subsequent weeks; unless there were severe symptoms or Serious Adverse Events (SAE).

However, the author proposes two more indices for enhanced evaluation of the data by accounting (a) the number of days and (b) strength of each symptom. The author has used these indices in the evaluation of three more HPTs (data not yet published). 1. Quantitative P athogenetic Index 2. Qualitative P athogenetic Index Qualitative Pathogenetic Index is an index where in every symptom is given a qualitative grade, namely, mild (+), moderate (++), severe (+++), and very severe (++++), for all organ locations. The Qualitative Pathogenetic Index [Graph 3] = Total number of symptoms for a particular intensity/ Number of volunteers contributing the symptoms/Number of days. As it can be seen in Table 1, the indices in the verum group are found to be higher than in the placebo group.

Blinding: Doubleblind, the participant and investigator were blinded. The blind for randomization was maintained till the completion of the proving period. The blind was opened post trial and verified by the volunteers for drug and placebo. (Score: 4) III. Inclusion and ex clusion criteria: Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly defined in the protocol. (Score: 4) IV . Criteria for selection of effects: Six criteria were defined: 1. All the symptoms produced during the runin period and if repeated by the same volunteer in subsequent weeks (first week, with placebo) were excluded. 2. Symptoms produced, if any, by the volunteers who were dropped out from study due to adverse events, symptoms of such volunteers were excluded. 3. Symptoms produced by placebo group, for five weeks and symptoms produced by volunteer on the drug were analyzed quantitatively as well as qualitatively. If the placebo and drug groups experienced the same symptom, they were evaluated on the basis of intensity and duration. For example, if the symptom of headache in the placebo group was reported to be of mild ( +) intensity, while of severe (+++) intensity in the drug group, it was not eliminated. 4. All symptoms were reported quantitatively, day wise, with duration and frequency, for example, dull headache with heaviness of head all over <14 pm associated with sleepiness. (Number of volunteer: 1) [9 + (day 22 for 2 3 hours)] 5. Ever y symptom described by the volunteers has been graded as +(mild), ++(moderate), +++ (severe) and ++++ (very severe). This method allowed qualification grading. 6. V olunteers who had exhibited some symptoms prior to the HPT , (as per the history), were eliminated, if the volunteer also exhibited same or similar symptoms as an effect of the medicine.Based on the above criteria, the MQI = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.

The symptoms were numbered as the main symptom, based on distinction within the particular organ/location, for example, Mind (heading) (1) Mind, irritability, (2) Mind, depressed (Main symptoms). The main symptoms were followed by subsymptoms, described in detail, (e.g. Mind (heading) (1) Mind, irritability (a) irritable by noise (b) irritable, when asked something (subsymptoms), and so on. The total number of symptoms was counted by eliminating the recurrence of the symptom as the main symptom. That is, in the cases where subsymptoms were observed, the counting of the main symptom was eliminated, and thus, the cumulative total number of symptoms (represented at the end of each heading in a square bracket, in bold) was considered for the calculation of different indices. Prominent and Clinically Applicable Symptoms Chief symptoms from the HPT may be shortlisted here: 1. Mind: [1++] Mood swing, anger, feels upset. No desire to do anything feeling sleepy 2. Head am Eyes [4++, 13++] Pain in eyes. Itching, rubbing, lachrymation 4. Ears Coryza, Running nose. <Cold discharge, sneezing 6. Thr oat, Larynx [18+, 19+] Dryness of throat (with irritation), >drinking water. 7. Chest (Number of volunteers: 1) [16+] Pain 8. Stomach [5+, 19+] Burning with acidic taste in mouth, in the morning. Thirst, drinks often with dryness in throat. Vomiting. 9. Abdomen [8+, 10++, 16+, 19+, 20+, 22+] iliac fossa. Fullness. <Afternoon 10. Urine [13+] Burning 11. Pain, mild stiffness, <morning 12. Sleep [18+, 24+++] Disturbed sleep. Feeling sleepy in the morning 13. Fever [10+, 22+] Fever, mild, before midnight14. Skin [9+, 13++, 16+, 22+] Face, acne, and red eruptions on cheeks. Itching. Deviations in Laboratory Reports One volunteer was found to have an increase in Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT) (normal range: 30 65 U/l) from 88 to 116, while another volunteer had a reduction in SGPT from 157 to 117. Both were clinically asymptomatic before as well as after the trial. There were no clinically significant changes after the HPT , with respect to complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, urine analysis and ECG. All pre and postinvestigation reports were documented. Safety Report Safety of volunteers was evaluated based on preinvestigation at screening and postdrug administration investigations. There were no adverse events reported during the proving period. DISCUSSION Hydroquinone, a homoeopathic potentized preparation was made with the substance being sourced with precise information of the chemical properties, using welldefined potentization parameters, inclusive of standardized force parameters applied in potentization; which would allow the making of standardized and reproducible homoeopathic medicine, now and in the future. A doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled HPT of Hydroquinone exhibited distinct symptoms, which could be applied in clinical practice. Hydroquinone (in potency) intake proved to be safe for the volunteers. Fourteen volunteers from the IP group (n = 15) produced 47 symptoms (numbers super scripted at end of last symptom under each system/anatomical part) in five weeks; the placebo group (n = 7) produced 17 symptoms in six weeks, while the runin period (n = 15) produced 26 symptoms in one week. It must be noted that symptoms with description of location, sensation, modality, and concomitants, along with the duration, days, and intensity, have been listed as subsymptoms. The volunteers (with prior training), coordinator, and principal investigator carefully noted and verified the intensity of each symptom, with every detail. The outcome was 47 symptoms produced by verum, which was quantitatively more than the symptoms produced in comparative groups, which could be [Downloaded free from http://www.ijrh.org on Monday, September 22, 2014, IP: 120.63.246.244] || Click here to download free this journalShah: Hydroquinone : Homoeopathic Pathogenetic TrialIndian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy / Vol. 7 / Issue 2 / Apr-Jun 2013 59appreciated by examining the higher intensity of symptoms in the verum group. Hydroquinone was selected for exploring its homoeopathic use based on the preknowledge that it has a capacity to induce hypopigmentation, and should, in turn, have a capability to treat the same. Also, the investigator used the potentized preparation of Hydroquinone in a series of patients having hypopigmentation (vitiligo), with encouraging and verifying results, calling for a larger clinical application. Careful appraisal of symptoms produced during the verum phase, placebo, and runin period was carried out observing the following filters in determining the prominence of symptoms. a. Those obser ved in more than one volunteer b. Those that lasted for a significant period c. Those, which wer e very intense, without the volunteer having experienced similar symptoms in the past one year; and without any apparent (causal) reason d. The symptoms should finally be compar ed with the symptoms based on the known effects of the source substance, which was adequately established. Crude Hydroquinone's effects on humans and animals is known; it produces skin irritation, rash, burning, gastritis, and ulceration, ochronosis, aplastic anaemia, and of course, vitiligo. It is exciting to document that the effects of an ultra small dose of potentized Hydroquinone in 30C potency, in a controlled trial, were comparable with that of its crude effects, such as skin rash, burning in epigastrium, vomiting, and earnosethroat irritation. Symptoms pertaining to the mind and dreams have not been found to be prominent. Similarly, symptoms of generalities have not been produced. The substance has produced a limited number of symptoms, as its effects on humans have also been found to be limited to certain symptoms. Its effects on blood related to aplastic anaemia and on the kidney, producing tubular necrosis, were obviously not reflected in the symptomatology; as the potentized dose would not produce pathological symptoms to that extent. It must be noted that Hydroquinone did not produce any hypopigmentation or vitiligo in the HPT . The investigator did not expect vitiligo as a symptom or sign as potentized dose is not expected to produce such pathological symptoms. It may be recalled that none of commonly used medicines for vitiligo, namely, produced vitiligo in drug proving. This common observation should also stimulate another discussion on, how important is it to conduct a homoeopathic pathogenetic trial for new substances having wellestablished pathogenesis or scope of action. The process of new homoeopathic drug discovery may be boosted by allowing the introduction of new medicines on the basis of known toxicological effects and clinical evidence, and not only on the basis of the homoeopathic pathogenetic trial. Clinically, based on the sphere of action of hydroquinone, its use may be explored in the cases of vitiligo, gastritis, peptic ulcer, upper respiratory tract affections, headache, aplastic anaemia, renal necrosis, and ochronosis. The Quantitative Pathogenetic Index and Qualitative Pathogenetic Index indices proposed and used here by the investigator, add a new dimension toward developing the method of qualitative and quantitative research in systematic reviews, aimed at minimizing the bias, and are not to be considered as mandatory in terms of application for the study of a HPT . CONC lUSION Hydroquinone was identified for exploring its effects on human volunteers in a homoeopathic, potentized dose. The potentization was carried out with documented force parameters. A doubleblind, randomized, placebocontrolled HPT , as per the accepted guidelines, with 15 volunteers and seven controls, with an initial seven days of runin period, led to 47 symptoms, quantitatively and qualitatively higher than the placebo groups; comparable with the toxicological symptoms, and with documented safety in the healthy volunteers, and thus, clinically usable data was generated. The Quantitative Pathogenetic Index and Qualitative Pathogenetic Index proposed by the investigator are important parameters, which may help in deciding the quality of data produced by the HPT . The HPT has produced clear symptomatology, which can easily be applied in clinical practice for a set of symptoms. As potentized preparations are known for not producing significant pathological symptoms such as vitiligo, it is seen that hydroquinone has not produced any hypopigmentation; which is not to be considered as a limitation of the trial. Further research on similar lines may help in [Downloaded free from http://www.ijrh.org on Monday, September 22, 2014, IP: 120.63.246.244] || Click here to download free this journalShah: Hydroquinone : Homoeopathic Pathogenetic TrialIndian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy / Vol. 7 / Issue 2 / Apr-Jun 2013 60homoeopathic drug discovery. Further clinical trials and evaluation can enhance the strength of the current experiment and its outcome.
