It is accompanied with yoga exercises that help move the entire toxins and liberate the body/mind from burdens of negative influences. It also helps keep the mind clear and clean and improves meditation and awareness. The method is also used as a preliminary purification to the spiritual practice, and especially the rejuvenation practices. Diet restriction During the retreat and cleansing therapy, one is not allowed to smoke, drink alcohol, eat meat, garlic, seafood, and egg. In short one should follow a pure vegetarian diet. Practice of cleansing therapy program First day: The diet should be free from animal products before starting the retreat and participants should fast during the first day (they can only drink water) Second day: After meditation, the participants begin to drink a mixed herbal decoction and they practice yoga exercises. According to their capacity, they should drink from one to five litres of the mixture, take a rest with warm clothes and from time to time do some exercise and movement.

It is an ancient method that improves the body strength, function of sensory and general organs, and prolongs life with Ciudlen pills (extracted essence of herbs and minerals).
