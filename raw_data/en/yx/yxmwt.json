APPLICATION TIMELINE The application timeline is unique depending on when you are prepared for and ready to pursue medical school. If you plan to apply directly after graduating from IWU, you will want to complete the prerequisite courses by the end of your junior year and apply during the summer before senior year. If you choose to take a gap year, you should complete your prerequisites by the end of your senior year and then apply the summer after graduation OR when you are ready. Students today are often waiting a year or more after graduation before applying to a health professions school. This does not put the applicant at a disadvantage. Many programs look favorably upon applicants who have taken an extra year or two to mature and gain work experience, and who can make a better decision regarding a career in a health profession; see \"Make the Most of Your Gap Year\" (https://students- residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/making-most-your-gap-year/).
