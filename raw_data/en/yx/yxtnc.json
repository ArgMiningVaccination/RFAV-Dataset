HISTORY OF VETIVER OIL USAGE Derived from the aromatic roots of the Vetiveria zizanioides (Linn) Nash. botanical, [Vetiver Essential Oil](/products/essential-oils/vetiver-essential-oil.html) has come to be known as both the \"Oil of Tranquility\" and \"The Fragrance of the Soil\" in India and Sri Lanka, due to its grounding, sensuous, and deeply calming scent. Vetiver belongs to the Grass family, and is sometimes referred to as Vetivert and Khus. Since ancient times, almost the entire Vetiver plant has been used for various applications including the making of perfumes, soaps, and cosmetics. Used in foods and drinks, Vetiver made a cooling beverage and sorbet flavoring. In tropical countries, Vetiver roots were traditionally used in the production of homemade evaporative coolers, which functioned as air conditioners before the inception of electricity. Due to their coolness, the roots were ideal for use in making grass mats. The process involved weaving the dried roots together with coir rope to make curtains, which were soaked in water before being hung in windows and doorways. As hot air passed through the cold, wet roots, the Vetiver curtains contributed not only cool air but they also exuded a comforting, alluring, earthy fragrance to the interiors of homes and functioned as insect repellants. Similarly, Vetiver grass mats were draped over cars to keep them cool as well. In India and Africa, Vetiver grass was thatched together to construct awnings, roofs, rugs, baskets, blinds, animal fodder and bedding, and other necessities for the home. To maintain cool temperatures for drinking water and to benefit from Vetiver's health-enhancing properties, the roots were placed in Muslin sachets and kept inside clay water pots. Since the Middle Ages, Vetiver Oil was most commonly used in scents. Its deep and woody aroma has come to be associated with masculine colognes, and it has come to be a main ingredient in a large percentage of men's fragrances. As early as the 12th century, the Vetiver herb and the essential oil obtained from its roots have been used around the world for their soothing, protective, and uplifting properties: In Ayurvedic practices, Vetiver Oil was respected for its spiritually inspiring aroma and for its remedial qualities. Accordingly, it was used to address countless health concerns including imbalances in psychosomatic temperament, arthritis and other joint disorders, muscular aches, headaches, fevers, loss of energy, heat strokes, and skin problems. During periods of high environmental temperatures, Vetiver Essential Oil's refreshing properties made it ideal for cooling high body temperatures. Vetiver Oil became an integral part of Ayurvedic massages for its additional abilities to strengthen the nervous system by sedating the senses and thereby reducing the stress and physical exhaustion linked to low immunity. Before marriages took place, brides were given a purifying massage with Vetiver Oil. Inspired by Ancient Chinese beliefs, Vetiver Essential Oil was used in traditional medicine to soothe and replenish dry skin, to balance the emotions, to ease negative feelings, to stimulate focus and energize the body, and to calm and cool the body. When patients suffered from a deficiency in their \"Yin,\" which often resulted in problems associated with the mind such as a dissociative state of depression, they were prescribed Vetiver Oil to use in meditation.

As illustrated, Vetiver Essential Oil is reputed to have many therapeutic properties. The following highlights its many benefits and the kinds of activity it is believed to show: - COSMETIC: Strengthening. AND HARVESTING QUALITY VETIVER OIL Vetiver is a tall, erect, rigid, fragrant perennial grass that belongs to the Poaceae (formerly called Gramineae) grass family. It shares many similarities in form and structure with other fragrant grasses such as Citronella, Lemongrass, and Palmarosa. It is also related to cereal crops such as Barley, Sorghum, Millet, Rye, Wheat, Maize, and Rice. Like other true grasses, the Vetiver plant has long, narrow blades that grow in tufts or bunches, and it is widely cultivated for the purpose of offering a protective border along roads, gardens, and between adjoining fields. Vetiver is indigenous to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Malaysia but is also cultivated in other tropical regions around the world, including Guatemala, Honduras, Brazil, Argentina, Haiti, Jamaica, Belgian Congo, Africa, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, India, China, and Australia. Although Vetiver prefers sandy loam or clay loam soil and climates that are tropical, sub-tropical, or Mediterranean, it can be established in various other soil types and climates. Vetiver can tolerate alkaline, highly acidic, or saline soil types as well as those with high levels of heavy metals, manganese, and aluminum. Vetiver is drought-tolerant and frost-resistant with an ability to endure temperatures as high as 50\u00b0C (122 \u00b0F) and as low as -10\u00b0C (14 \u00b0F); however, temperatures below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) cause the roots to become dormant while frost causes the shoots to become dormant or to die. The underground parts of the plant can endure the low temperatures and the plant may regrow with improving weather conditions. Vetiver can also thrive in regions that may have a minimum annual rainfall of 450 mm. With a sensitivity to full shade, Vetiver will experience slower growth if kept out of the sun. This is especially true of young plants. Vetiver grass may grow to be 5 ft. With a strong, complex, fibrous, and strongly scented root system that grows deep into the ground - deeper than some tree roots - Vetiver is reputed for its ability to hold topsoil in place, to restore damaged topsoil, to protect soil from erosion and infertility, and for its ability to conserve water. By drawing water into the soil, it enhances the soil's properties by stabilizing it, controlling weeds, acting as a natural insect repellant, sustaining soil moisture, replenishing depleted groundwater, reviving springs, and absorbing chemical toxins such as those found in pesticides and fertilizers. For various environmental problems around the world, Vetiver is an ideal solution: the depth of Vetiver roots means the plant is not easily extricated from the earth, and this strength has made Vetiver an ideal stabilizer for railway cuttings, due to its ability to prevent rockfalls and mudslides; in more than 100 countries, Vetiver is used to detoxify the environment with its phytoremediation properties; Vetiver is often found near embankments for its ability to slow the flow of water, block surface water runoff, and absorb pollutants and toxins in both the soil and the water. During propagation, Vetiver grass is planted by its root divisions or 'slips.' They are each planted into wet soil at a specific distance from each other in order to ensure that they will form a hedge in their first year of growth. If the soil is not wet at the time of planting, it is irrigated immediately after the slips have been planted. Vetiver produces flowers that are brownish-purple and that resemble young wheat heads. Generally, Vetiver is harvested between December and February, with the tufts often being manually dug up by their roots. For mechanical harvesting, a tractor-drawn mouldboard plough may be used to pull up the roots. Compared to manual harvesting, with this method the roots have a 15% higher recovery rate. Vetiver roots that are intended for essential oil production are harvested between 18 months to 2 years after the plant is cultivated. The timing of the harvest is significant, as the yield of the roots and the oil percentage varies, depending on environmental conditions; an early harvest yields a higher volume of essential oil, but this oil will be of low specific gravity, which also lacks the valuable high boiling constituents. If the roots are harvested after more than 2 years after being planted, the quality of the essential oil improves, but the oil yield will be substantially reduced. HOW IS VETIVER OIL EXTRACTED? Vetiver Essential Oil is steam-distilled from the roots and rootlets or \"rhizomes\" of the Vetiver plant. The processing method involves first separating the harvested roots from the aerial parts of the plant, then washing the roots thoroughly. Next, they are sliced to a shorter length to facilitate drying. They are dried in the shade for 1-2 days in order for the final oil to have an enhanced aroma. Drying the roots in sunlight results in a lower oil yield. Next, the roots are steam- or hydro-distilled to extract their oil. Once the distillate separates into an essential oil and a hydrosol, the oil is skimmed off and filtered. Similar to Patchouli and Sandalwood, Vetiver Essential Oil also improves with age, hence the decanted oil is allowed to age for several months - usually 6 - to allow the oil's green and earthy scent to become deeper, sweeter, and fuller. The resulting Vetiver Oil is thick and ranges in color from golden-brown to amber-brown to olive. It exudes a strong aroma that smells earthy, woody, and rich. Depending on its region of cultivation, Vetiver Oil may also have a sweet, smoky, or floral note. Its aroma has been described as being suggestive of the scent of Patchouli with a note of Lemon, and it has also been said to have the scent of woods and wetlands. USES OF VETIVER OIL The uses of Vetiver Oil are abundant, ranging from medicinal and odorous to cosmetic. Its many forms include oils, gels, lotions, soaps, shampoos, sprays, perfumes, and candles.
