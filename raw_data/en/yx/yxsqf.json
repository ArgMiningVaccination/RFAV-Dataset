Just Diagnosed Getting Prepared Having cancer surgery can bring up many emotions and questions. You may wonder about pain, changes to your body or future treatment. You may wonder how you'll manage responsibilities at home or work. It's common to have many feelings (such as anger, sadness, or hope), sometimes all in one day. Your healthcare team can help you find the support or answers you need. This first section has some of the most common concerns that patients are worried about. For more on emotional self-care and awareness, go to page 31 . Finances, insurance & drug coverage The cost of your surgery is covered by Alberta Health Care. But there are other costs that go along with your cancer treatment(s) that you may not have thought of. For example: How long you'll need to be off work for surgery and recovery. Your insurance coverage for some of the medicines used for treatment. Extra costs such as parking and hotels. You may be able to get help to pay for some of these costs. If you have concerns, it's important to speak to your healthcare team right away. They may be able to help you find the supports you need. Tips: Keep all of your treatment-related receipts (parking, travel, and accommodation) and write the reason on the receipts. You may be able to claim medical costs when you file your taxes. Ask your healthcare team what is covered. When your treatment plan is confirmed, and if you have Alberta Health Care, most of your treatments will be covered, but there could be extra costs. Call your insurance provider so you know what they cover and ask about the cost of extra coverage if you need it. Sometimes when you add medical coverage there is a waiting period before the coverage starts. Extra coverage may be helpful to cover the cost of things such as prostheses, medicines, transportation, and physiotherapy. Make a list of other costs such as childcare, lodging, and travel. Your healthcare team may be able to suggest services that cost less. Ask to see a resource social worker to help you find government financial support, including tax credits and caregiver employment insurance.A1 Need a place to stay during treatment? Calgary - call the Foothills Medical Centre Hostel at 403-944-1156 Edmonton - call the Patient and Family Resource Centre at 780-432-8456Just Diagnosed 2 Time off from work How much time off from work you will need depends on the type of surgery and any other treatments you may have. Ask your surgeon how long you will likely be off work. Your surgeon can provide a note for the time off you need for the surgery and recovery from surgery. If you need to have more treatment (systemic or radiation treatment), the oncologist managing your care will need to provide a note for the rest of the time off you need. If you need a letter from your doctor for work, we may ask you to fill out some forms first. Contact the Human Resources department at your workplace if you want to make a claim to either: Your work's disability insurance provider Service Canada (Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits) What else do I need to know? Ask your employer what documentation they need you to complete. Talk directly with your doctor about the forms you need completed and follow the instructions they give you. Doctors usually cannot complete these forms during clinic hours, but will ask you to leave them to complete and pick up at another time. Fertility and birth control Fertility is the ability to get someone pregnant or to get pregnant and carry a child to a healthy birth. Cancer and cancer treatment can sometimes damage the reproductive organs such as the ovaries and testicles. These changes can have short-term or long-term effects on your fertility. If you have ovaries, fallopian tubes or a uterus and the cancer has spread to these parts, they will have to be removed. This leads to permanent sterility (inability to have children). Cancer treatment can cause changes to the reproductive organs like: irregular periods, or it may stop monthly bleeding premature menopause decreased sperm quality, number and motility Before you start your treatment, check with your healthcare team to find out what your options are for preserving your fertility. 3 Just Diagnosed Remember to: Tell your healthcare team right away if you think you may be pregnant. Your surgery and treatment plans may need to be changed, depending on the type of cancer you have and the stage of your pregnancy. Use birth control. It is important that you do not become pregnant while having treatment. Ask your healthcare team about other types of birth control you can use. Think about your options for children in the future. If you want to preserve your fertility, you may need a referral to a fertility specialist. Talk to your healthcare team. A referral should be made early so it does not delay your cancer treatment. Learning about Abdominal Cancer What is cancer? Our body is made up of many cells. Healthy cells follow the \"rules\" when they divide and they know when to die. Cancer happens when cells start to grow out of control. When these cells grow and divide, they can form a lump called a tumour. Not all tumours are cancer. Some are non-cancerous (also called benign ). It might help to use the example of a garden: Cancer cellGood cellsA Healthy Body Imagine your body as a garden. The soil is your immune system, the good plants are your good cells, and the weeds are the cancer cells. When you're healthy, the good plants grow and the soil helps keep the weeds away. When the odd weed starts to grow, the body is able to get rid of it by itself. Cancer cellsGood cells A Body with Cancer Cancer cells are like weeds in your garden. Sometimes the body cannot get rid of the weeds and needs help. Healthy cells dividing:A2 Normal CellsCancer CellsJust Diagnosed 4 What body parts does abdominal cancer affect? It can be helpful to understand the parts of the abdomen (anatomy). You may want to circle or mark off the parts that are affected for you. Your Body The abdomen system has a number of organs, along with fat tissue, muscles and supporting ligaments. Check off or circle on the picture, the organs that are affected for you: stomach liver pancreas gallbladder spleen appendix small intestine large intestine (colon) People assigned female at birth have the following structures in their abdomen (unless already surgically removed): fallopian tubes ovaries uterus Check off (or circle on the picture) any that are affected for you. 5 Just Diagnosed Treatment for Abdominal Cancer Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) Cytoreductive Surgery is a major surgery that removes most or all of the visible cancer tumours from inside the abdomen, the lining inside the abdomen and any organs where the cancer may be growing. Organs that may need to be removed during surgery include: Spleen Gallbladder Female reproductive organs - ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus Appendix Omentum (a layer of fat inside the abdomen) Parts of the small and large intestine Your surgeon will review your options with you and help you make a plan that's right for you. The extent of your surgery depends on how much the cancer has spread. The surgeon begins by making an incision down the centre of the abdomen and then looks inside the abdomen to see if the surgery can proceed. Often, more cancer is seen during surgery than the scans show. Sometimes, the surgeon is unable to continue with the surgery. If the abdominal tumours are on vital blood vessels or on organs that cannot safely be removed, then the surgery is not possible. If the surgeon proceeds with the surgery, the surgical team removes all of the visible cancer and then treats you with heated chemotherapy. Heated Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) What is HIPEC? It is a procedure where chemotherapy is heated to between 40\u00b0C to 42\u00b0C and put into the abdomen. It is done while you are still in the operating room, after the surgeon has removed all the cancer cells they can see. The heated chemotherapy is circulated throughout the abdomen for 60 minutes. The solution is then removed and the incision is closed. It is sometimes called a heated chemotherapy bath.A3 Just Diagnosed 6 Why is it done? The HIPEC procedure is used to kill any remaining cancer cells that the surgeon cannot see. It has some advantages: Heating the chemotherapy drugs allows them to better enter and kill cancer cells. Giving the chemotherapy in the abdomen allows for a much higher drug dosage, because it is not absorbed by the body the same way as chemotherapy given into a vein (IV or intravenous chemotherapy). It has fewer side effects, such as hair loss, compared to IV chemotherapy. What chemotherapy will I get? The surgeon selects the chemotherapy drug for you based on your cancer type. Is HIPEC only given during surgery? No, depending on your diagnosis, you may need 4-5 more days of intraperitoneal chemotherapy . This is called Early Post-Operative Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (EPIC). If you need this, the surgeon will place a tube in your abdomen during your surgery. The surgeon will remove the tube after the EPIC treatments are finished. What types of cancer are these treatments used for? These combined treatments of surgery and heated chemotherapy are for certain types of cancer that either start to grow in the abdomen or spread (metastasize) to the abdomen. These include: Colorectal cancer Peritoneal mesothelioma Appendix cancer Gastric cancer Pseudomyxoma peritonei Ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer In addition to the surgery and HIPEC, you may need more chemotherapy treatments by IV (intravenous) before or after your surgery. 7 Just Diagnosed What are the potential risks and benefits? Your surgeon will talk with you about the specific benefits and risks to you. Any major medical procedure has risks and complications that can happen. Some possible risks include getting: an ostomy. A surgical opening from the small intestine or colon to the outside of the abdomen. A collection bag is placed over the opening called a stoma to collect the stool that will come out of the opening. Your surgeon will try to avoid giving you an ostomy, if possible. If you need to have an ostomy, a special nurse called an enterostomal therapist will teach you how to manage and care for your ostomy. a blood transfusion. The treatment team will try to avoid this, but depending on the amount of blood loss, you may need one. Will I be included in research studies or clinical trials? Clinical trials are studies that test different treatments or supports. Teaching and research is important, especially for rare cancers like peritoneal cancer. We will always speak with you and ask your permission before including you in any research studies. Who is part of my cancer surgery team? Before and after surgery you will be cared for in clinics and nursing units by professionals that have experience in caring for people undergoing CRS and HIPEC. These include: Pre-admission clinic Nursing units in hospital Intensive care unit The outpatient advanced gastro-intestinal (GI) malignancy or gynecologic oncology clinics Specialized nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, enterostomal therapists, and respiratory therapists will also participate in your care. In the operating room, a large team of specialized healthcare professionals will be involved in your care: 1 or 2 surgeons and their team of fellows and/or residents 3 nurses 1 or 2 anesthetists A chemotherapy perfusion specialist (to give you the heated chemotherapy) Respiratory team (to help you breathe well)Can I bank my own blood in case I need a transfusion? No. We cannot bank or store your blood. Just Diagnosed 8 B. Before, During and After Surgery in Hospital Getting Ready for Surgery This book is given out to all patients in Alberta. The information below is a guideline. Please follow any specific instructions for your surgery given to you by your local site. Learning about surgery It's important to review how you should prepare and recover from surgery in advance. Do this by reading: this book information on surgery at myhealth.alberta.ca/yoursurgeryjourney Knowing what to expect will help you prepare for your surgery journey . It's important to know: you have an active part in preparing for your surgery and recovery . you and your family are part of the healthcare team. the best time to plan for your recovery is before your surgery. Your healthcare team will be following the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Care Pathway. Following this pathway helps you prepare for surgery, feel better sooner, and recover faster. Nutrition Sometimes, abdominal cancer can affect how your body absorbs food or can increase the production of mucin (heavy proteins produced in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract). This may cause you to feel full after eating only a little. Cancer can also cause weight loss. If you have lost more than 10% of your weight within the last 6 months, it may be helpful to ask for a referral to a dietitian before you have surgery. Dietitians can help you make a plan to ensure that you are getting the nutrition you need which will help you recover better after surgery . Read the suggestions and tips in the diet and nutrition section on page 27 . Good nutrition is important both before and after surgery. Pre-Admission Clinic (PAC) The staff at the Pre-Admission Clinic (PAC) will call you. You may need to go in person for a consult. Either over the phone or in person, the PAC healthcare team will: ask questions about your health and medical history to make sure you can safely have surgery. explain how you can prepare for your surgery and what to expect in the hospital. arrange the tests that your doctors have ordered. These tests could include blood tests, ECG (a test for your heart), and chest x-ray.B19 Before, During & After Surgery ask you what medicines, vitamins, supplements, and herbal products you take. Tell you what medicine(s) to stop taking and when to stop taking them before your surgery . teach you about stomas and mark the area on your abdomen (if you need one). Note: a stoma is an opening through the skin and tissue in your abdomen to let waste leave your body if you cannot have a bowel movement through your rectum. Make sure you write down which medicine you can take and what medications you should hold for surgery or stop altogether. Write your notes in this book on page 11. Tests before surgery Your medical team may order some tests before your surgery date. These may include: Blood work Iron infusion (if you have low hemoglobin and iron levels) Chest x-ray, ECG Other special tests or consults if needed Surgery date and time It takes time after your clinic visit (where you gave your agreement/consent for the surgery), to get a surgery date. We will call you to tell you when your surgery is scheduled You will find out the time of your surgery the business day before (business days are Mondays -Fridays, not including holidays) Good to know: usually only 1 person can stay with you until you go to surgery. Visitor policies can change in different situations. Immunizations Some patients have their spleen removed as part of their abdominal surgery. If this occurs, you will be at a higher risk of getting certain infections after surgery. To help prevent these infections, you may be given a series of vaccinations before your surgery. Whenever possible, any or all vaccinations should be given at least 2 weeks before your surgery. If that is not possible, they can be given after surgery. Immunization information can be found online. Scan the code to get a copy. Take it with you to the public health clinic. Ask your surgeon what your hemoglobin and iron levels are. Write these numbers on My Plan ( page B ). If a yellow or blue band is put on your wrist, do not take it off . If you take it off, you will need to have another blood sample, which may delay your surgery . Immunization Protocol for Cytoreductive Surgery www.ahs.ca/cancertreatment > surgeryBefore, During & After Surgery 10 What you should do to get ready Plan for help and support Make sure you have someone to drive you to and from the hospital. You will also need help at home for 4-6 weeks after surgery. Prepare food Prepare and freeze meals ahead of time so you only need to re-heat the food once you're home. Stop smoking at least 2 weeks before If you can, it is best to stop at least 4 weeks before surgery. It prevents problems with your lungs after surgery and helps you heal faster. Talk to your doctor about ways to stop smoking. Stop drinking alcohol at least 7 days before If you can, it is best to stop all alcohol at least 4 weeks before surgery. Talk to your doctor if you need help cutting down or stopping. Exercise Try to be in the best shape possible before surgery. If you don't exercise or exercise regularly, start slowly. Short walks help to build strength. Increase the length of your walk as it gets easier. Plan your benefits, work or insurance forms Find out what's covered with your benefit plan and plan ahead for any work or insurance forms. Let your nurse and doctor know if you need forms completed. Talk about your pain medication If you already take prescription pain medication, tell your nurse and/or anesthesiologist. Keep taking your prescription pain medication as usual up to the morning of surgery, unless the PAC medical team gave you different instructions. After surgery, the pain medication or dose may have to be changed as your body heals and recovers from surgery. Stop using recreational drugs Stop using recreational drugs (such as cannabis or cocaine) before surgery. These drugs can have serious side effects when mixed with the medication used during surgery or the pain medication used after surgery. Your surgeon, nurse, and/or anesthesiologist need to know if you use recreational drugs\u2014they aren't there to judge. Get immunizations (including flu shots) in advance No immunizations within 14 days of your surgery. Do not shave Do not shave your abdomen or around your genitals. The surgical nurses will shave you if needed. 11 Before, During & After Surgery Medication instructions To help you remember, write your personal list and follow these instructions: 14 Days Before 10 Days Before 7 Days Before 2 Days Before 1 Day Before Day of Surgery Can I take my regular medication? Your surgeon, or the Pre-Admission Clinic nurses or doctors will tell you what medication you can take on the day of surgery.Before surgery, write the instructions you should follow here. Diabetes Management: If you are diabetic, get instructions from your doctor or from the doctors at the PAC appointment for your insulin or diabetic pills (metformin). Before, During & After Surgery 12 Day and Night Before Surgery Bowel preparation or cleansing You may need to clean out your bowels before surgery. Your surgeon or nurse will give you instructions if this is the case. Follow these closely. Write this on My Plan (page B). Antibiotics You may need to take antibiotics the day before surgery. Write this on My Plan (page B). Eating and drinking 24 hours before surgery: no smoking or drinking alcohol Follow the Eating and Drinking Before Surgery handout. Follow the instructions on your handout closely to make sure that your surgery is not cancelled. This is to prevent food or fluid going into your lungs (aspiration) during your surgery. Aspiration can be life-threatening! Scan the code to see the handouts or type this link in your browser: myhealth.alberta.ca/Alberta/Pages/Your-Surgery-Resources.aspx Confirming your time You should have already been told how to confirm your hospital appointment time. Make sure you know: The date of your surgery. What time you need to be at the hospital. Where to go when you get to the hospital. The best place to park.B2 What is a clear fluid? Jello\u00ae; strained broth/ consomm\u00e9 soup; clear fruit juices with no pulp (such as apple juice) Black tea or coffee (no milk or cream but sugar or sweeteners are okay) Pop, sports drinks such as Gatorade\u00ae, or water It does not include milk, cream, butter, cream soups or orange juice. 13 Before, During & After Surgery 12 2 3 33 32 2 45 6If you have to cancel your surgery, call your surgeon's office right away. Make sure you have your surgeon's office phone number ahead of time. Write it on My Plan (page A). If you can't reach your surgeon, call the hospital. Make sure you have the hospital's phone number ahead of time. Write it on My Plan (page A). Night before or morning of surgery Before you go to bed or the morning of your surgery: take a shower or bath (use the Chlorhexidine [CHG] 4% if you were told to) do not use any creams, lotions, or anything with a scent do not shave any area where your surgery will be wear clean pyjamas or clothes after showering do not wear make-up take off all jewellery and take out all piercings do not wear contact lenses Preparing your skin Showering the night before your surgery and washing well is very important to prevent infection. Even though the team will clean the area of your incision right before surgery, the products they use will work even better if your skin is already clean. Instructions for cleaning your skin Read all of the steps carefully before you start Shower with warm (not hot) water. Do not shave. Wash your face and hair as you normally would. Rinse. After washing your hair, follow the instructions to gently wash the rest of your body in order (1-6). Use the CHG 4% soap. Use regular soap if you have an allergy to CHG 4% or if you do not have the sponge. Try to leave the soap on for 3 minutes without rinsing. Then rinse well. 1. Neck, chest and stomach (abdomen). 2. Both arms and underarms (armpits). It is okay to leave nail polish, gel or acrylic nails on. Chlorhexidine (CHG) 4% (EZ Scrub) is a special soap to wash with, unless you are allergic or were not told to do this. Before, During & After Surgery 14 3. Both legs (front and back) to the top of the thighs. 4. Both hip areas and then the groin (the fold where the legs meet the body/trunk). Wipe all skin folds in the abdomen and groin well. 5. On the back from the hairline at the neck to the waist. 6. Buttocks and all folds in the buttock area. Do not apply deodorant, lotions, creams, or perfume after showering. Put on clean, dry clothing. If you are showering the night before, sleep in clean bed sheets. Day of Surgery Follow your medication instruction notes on page 11. What do I bring? What to bring on the day of your surgery (your Operating Room day): Alberta Health card and Blue Cross or other insurance card Photo identification (please make sure the information is correct) This book, along with any handouts you were given about your condition or surgery All your medication (in original containers) including inhalers, aspirin, vitamins, herbal and over-the-counter medications (a list from your pharmacy would be helpful) CPAP / BiPAP machine (if you use it, as it may be sent to the recovery room during your surgery) Proof of medical coverage (out-of-province residents only) Personal care items (the hospital is not responsible for lost items) Personal care items to bring: Items your surgeon has requested Walking aids such as a walker or cane (if you use one) Comfortable clothing, sleepwear, robe and slippers Ear plugs Hearing aids, eyeglasses, dentures and denture case Book, magazine or something else to keep you busy Notebook or journal Toothbrush, comb, hairbrush, deodorant, lip balm Personal directives (if you have one)Do Not Bring: anything of value (jewellery, credit cards) more than $20 cash a tablet or computer electrical appliances such as hair dryers or curling irons Bring these items in 1 small bag that has your name on it. Please leave these items with your support person who can give these to you after surgery.B3 Rules about using cell phones in the hospital are different on each unit. Ask your nurse before using your phone.15 Before, During & After Surgery At the hospital When you arrive at the hospital, a nurse will: Go through a list of questions with you. Ask you to change into a hospital gown. You may be given some medicine for pain and nausea with a sip of water before surgery. This is part of your Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care. Holding area You'll be brought to an area outside of the operating room (holding area) where you'll meet your surgical team: your anesthesiologist (the doctor who will give you medicine to keep you asleep during your surgery), surgeon, and nurses. While you're in the area outside of the operating room, a nurse will ask you questions from the Safe Surgery Checklist such as your name, surgery, birthdate, allergies, and what surgery you're having. You may be asked this more than once, which is normal. We do this to keep you safe. Waiting area Visitors may be restricted depending on the situation. If your support person is not able to wait for you in the waiting area, staff will call them to let them know when your surgery is finished and they can return. Operating room An operating room nurse will double-check your surgical information and take you into the operating room. The Safe Surgery Checklist will be repeated. The anesthesiologist will give you medicine (general anesthetic) to make you comfortable and keep you asleep during your surgery. Your surgery will take between 5 to 10 hours. Before, During & After Surgery 16 Procedures before and during surgery Staying warm. We want to make sure you are warm before and during surgery. We will give you a special warming gown. Intravenous (IV). An IV is started in your hand or arm by the nurse before you go to the operating room, or by the anesthesiologist in the operating room. It's used to give the anesthetic (sleeping medicine) and other medication you may need such as antibiotics. The IV is usually taken out once you are able to drink well after surgery . Bloodwork. You may need to have more bloodwork drawn. If needed, a person from the lab will come to you. Medication. You may be given medication before you go to the operating room or in the operating room before the surgery begins. You may need to continue taking this medication after surgery: IV antibiotics to protect against infection medications to prevent nausea and pain a small dose of a blood thinner (anti-coagulant) to prevent blood clots during and after surgery Air-Filled Stockings (Sequential Compression Device). You may wear compression stockings on your legs during and after your operation to promote blood flow in your legs and help to prevent blood clots. A machine inflates and deflates the stockings. They are taken off once you are walking around. Blood Transfusion. Not many people need a blood transfusion. Your surgeon will talk with you about this and get your consent before surgery. Bladder Catheter. A small tube (catheter) will be put into your bladder, through the urethra. It drains urine from your bladder so your bladder stays empty . The catheter is taken out soon after surgery. If you have trouble urinating after, you may need a catheter for a while longer.17 Before, During & After Surgery After Surgery (in Hospital) People usually go home 7-14 days after surgery. How long you stay in hospital will depend on the type of surgery and your recovery. After surgery, we will move you to the Recovery Room, where you will stay for 1-3 hours or you may go to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Visitors are not allowed into the recovery room. You'll stay there until your healthcare team decides it's safe for you to go to the hospital unit. Some people only need to stay in the ICU for a few hours, others may need to stay for a few days. What to expect You will probably feel sleepy and your throat may feel sore from the tube that was placed in it while you were asleep. This is normal. You may also have: an IV to give you fluid and some medicine (pain and nausea medicine will be given in pill form whenever possible). nasal prongs or an oxygen mask to help you breathe. a dressing (bandage) on your abdomen. It's important not to touch your dressing to allow for proper healing. 1 or more drains near the area where the incision was made. Drains take extra fluid away from below your incision. a catheter draining your bladder. If you did not have surgery to your bladder, the catheter should be removed within 2 days of the surgery. compression stockings (cloth or vinyl). These help to promote blood flow in your legs and help to prevent blood clots. If you have air-filled stockings called a Sequential Compression Device (SCD) , a machine inflates and deflates the stockings. They are taken off once you are walking around. Your nurse will regularly check your: Heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and blood oxygen level Dressing (bandage) Drains (if you have any) Pain and nausea levels Managing pain and nausea Managing pain and nausea are important. It helps you recover sooner because you will: Breathe and move better Find it easier to eat and drink Sleep betterB4 It is better for your body to get fluids through drinking rather than through an IV. Keep track of how much you are drinking so that your IV can be taken out as soon as possible.Before, During & After Surgery 18 Pain and nausea after surgery are normal. Your nurse will ask you to rate your pain and nausea from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain you can imagine). Tell your nurse when you're having pain or nausea. The amount of pain medicine will be adjusted as needed. Pain You may have pain from your incision or drainage tubes, abdominal cramping or back pain. The type of pain you have and how long it lasts is different for everyone. A feeling of stabbing pain may happen and it is normal. Even if you take your pain medicine regularly , it is normal to still feel some pain after surgery. We will give you pain medicine by IV, injection (needle), pill, or epidural pain pump (medications go into the area around your spinal cord) as needed while you're in the hospital. Nausea You may feel sick to your stomach after surgery. This is a common side effect of anesthetic, some pain medications, and chemotherapy. Tell your nurse if you are having nausea. We will give you medication to help relieve it. You may wake up from surgery with an NG tube (nasogastric tube) through your nose that drains your stomach. This tube should prevent you from vomiting, but you may still have nausea. If this happens, tell your nurse and we will give you medication to relieve it. Some patients experience nausea days or weeks after their surgery - even after they have started to eat again. This is part of the recovery period from major surgery and we will give you medication to help control it. Dressings and incisions Your incision (surgical cut) will be closed with small metal clips (staples) or stitches. You will have an outer gauze dressing (bandage) covering the incision. Gauze dressings usually stay on for 24 to 48 hours. Your surgeon will tell you when you can take your dressing off. The staples or stitches are usually removed before you go home. If they need to stay in longer, your surgeon or nurse will tell you when you should have them removed, usually by the surgeon or your family doctor .Another name for a \"stitch\" is \"suture\" Another name for \"dressing\" is \"bandage\" 19 Before, During & After Surgery Drains A drain is a small plastic tube inserted through the skin near the incision. It's stitched in place so it doesn't fall out. A small plastic suction container is attached to it. After surgery, it's normal for your body to make extra fluid in the area around your incision. The drains remove this extra fluid and blood. Removing the fluid helps with healing and lowers the risk of infection. Depending on the surgery you may not have any drains, or may have 1 or 2 drains in place. We will take these drains out when your surgeon decides they are no longer needed. The drain sites will heal within a few days after the drains are removed. Your nurses and doctors will check all incision and drain sites for signs of infection on a regular basis. Getting moving and doing leg exercises Be active as soon as possible. Moving and doing leg exercises will help you build strength, increase blood flow, prevent clots from forming and keep your lungs clear. Your nurse will help you get up to walk soon after surgery. Your healthcare team will work to get your tubes (IV, NG, catheter and drains) out as soon as possible, to make it easier for you to move. Work to: Move and stretch your legs Wiggle your toes Change position in bed (you can lie on your side or your back) Get up to sit in a chair Do basic leg exercises (see next page) Walk (2-3 times a day - ask someone to walk with you until you are steady on your feet) Increase your activity level gradually after surgery (no strenuous exercise) Keep track of how much time you are spending out of bed each day Leg Exercises Do these exercises 5 times each hour you are awake. These can be done lying in bed or sitting in a chair. Symptoms of a blood clot may include any of the following: swelling, redness, warmth to skin, pain to 1 or both legs, or shortness of breath. Let the medical team know right away if you have any of these symptoms. DO NOT massage your leg if you are having these symptoms. You could cause the clot to break off. Flex your feet up and down for 1 minute. Relax. Repeat.Make circles with your feet. Repeat in the other direction.Before, During & After Surgery 20 Compression Stockings You may wear special compression sleeves on your legs while you are in bed, to help prevent blood clots. The sleeves are connected to a machine to inflate and deflate often to promote good circulation in your legs until you are walking regularly. Activity After surgery you will feel very tired and may need to take rest breaks often. Your nurses will help you change positions in bed often to help your circulation and keep you comfortable. When you lift your head, it helps if you place your hands behind your head to support your neck and prevent any pulling on your incisions. If you can't do this, your nurse will help you. One day after surgery your nurse or physiotherapist will help you to sit at the side of your bed or in a chair, and also stand and go for a walk. Your activity will be increased until you are walking several times a day. Your healthcare team will encourage you to spend time in a chair. Deep breathing and coughing exercises It's important to do your deep breathing and coughing exercises if you have had an anesthetic and to prevent lung infections. Follow these steps 1 time every hour you are awake: Breathe in deeply through your nose. Hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds, and then breathe out slowly through your mouth. You will be able to breathe more deeply with each breath. Repeat again. Repeat again. This time, hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds. Cough 2 or 3 times in a row as you get rid of this breath. You may find it more comfortable to support your incision when you cough. You can do this by holding your hands or a pillow against your abdomen. Make sure you take normal breaths when you're not doing these exercises. Eating and drinking After major abdominal surgery, it might take some time before you are able to start eating and drinking again. During that time you will have intravenous (IV) fluids and may receive support such as intravenous nutrition. As part of your ERAS care, the healthcare team will work to getting you back to eating as soon as possible. This will depend on the type of surgery and how your gut (digestive system) is working. When you are allowed to eat, it is important to only eat as much as you feel like having. You will be able to start eating small amounts of solid food. It is important not to force yourself to eat if you do not feel well or have nausea. Let your healthcare team know if you have concerns about how much food you can take in.21 Before, During & After Surgery You may be given nutritional supplement drinks as part of your recovery. These will provide you with extra protein you need to heal. Your nutrition is an important part of healing. Read more on Diet and Nutrition (page 27 ). Bowel and bladder function Bowel function After major abdominal surgery, it might also take some time before you start passing gas and stool again. When your bowels start to work, they often produce air (farting/flatulence) and/or liquid stool (diarrhea). To help your bowels start to work again, we suggest you: chew gum (3 times a day) walk in the hallway (see Getting Moving and Doing Leg Exercises , page 19 ) When your bowels start to work, you may experience crampy abdominal pain. To help with the cramps: apply mild heat, such as from a warm blanket take short walks often (activity can help to move the gas out) Bladder function If you haven't had any surgery done to your bladder, we will remove your bladder catheter within 2 days after the surgery. Getting rid of the catheter will make it easier to get out of bed, which is very important for your recovery and will lessen the chance of getting an infection. If you have problems urinating (peeing) after your catheter is removed, let your nurse know right away. You need to measure your urine the first few times you get up to the bathroom. You will get a container to place in the toilet to collect the urine. If you have any problems, let your nurse know. Keep track of how many cups of fluids you are drinking in hospital and at home. Use a notebook or paper. Drink enough water each day to keep your urine pale yellow. Watch for signs of a urinary tract infection: pain and burning when you pee red/brown coloured pee cloudy or foul-smelling pee feeling like you need to go even after you have already gone to the bathroom feeling an urgent need to pee Before, During & After Surgery 22 Blood thinner medication You may be given a blood thinner (anti-coagulant) to help prevent blood clots. Your greatest risk for clotting is in the first 28 days after surgery. This medication is injected under the skin at least 1 time a day . You may have to keep taking this blood thinner after you go home. If that happens, you or a support person will be shown how to give the injection. It is important to take it as long as it has been prescribed for. This medication is expensive. Talk with your healthcare team if you have concerns or if you don't have a drug or health benefit plan. Ask your nurse for the booklets Self-Injection and Blood Clots and Cancer for more information. Getting Ready to Go Home Going home (Discharge) checklist Before you're sent home, your healthcare team will: review your discharge instructions with you. give you the date for your follow-up appointment or tell you when to call your surgeon's office to make your follow-up appointment. Write this on My Plan (page B). give you prescriptions for medicines to take at home and instructions on when you can take your regular medicines. make sure you can manage any new care needs, such as blood thinner injections. ask who will be helping you at home for the first 6 weeks after surgery since you will not be able to do heavy housework or lift anything over 10 pounds (4.5 kg). make a referral to home care if needed. Most people don't need home care. Talk to your healthcare team if you feel something on this list hasn't been done or you have other concerns. B523 Before, During & After Surgery C. At Home After Surgery The \"Do Nots\" after surgery (for 6 weeks) No vacuuming Ask about going back to work No driving while on pain medications No swimming or hot tubs (do not put your incision under the water) No lifting anything over 10 pounds (lbs) . It increases blood pressure and might cause your incision to open. Your Incision It's normal to be worried about seeing your incision (surgical cut) for the first time. You can reach out to your healthcare team, family, or friends to talk about the changes you see. Read more about body image and emotional health in the Living Your Best section on page 31. Daily checks It's important to check your incision(s) every day, especially during the first 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. It's normal for the surgical area to be a little swollen and bruised at first, but that will go away in a few weeks. There may be firmness under the incision. You will notice this \"healing ridge\" for many months. It will soften over time.C1 How much is 10 pounds (lbs)? At home: Average 3-month old baby Medium-sized bowling ball A full laundry basket Small microwave oven Small dog or medium- sized cat Most vacuum cleaners Large, filled garbage bag At the grocery store: Large watermelon Large bag of sugar or flour A sack of potatoes Two, 4-litre jugs of milk Three, 2-litre bottles of pop A holiday ham or turkey Sit on a couch to hold a baby or pet. Ask for help to lift items or buy smaller containers while you are recovering. If you are not sure if something weighs 10 or more pounds, do not pick it up. C2At Home 24 Incision care We usually remove the stitches or staples on your incisions before you are discharged from the hospital. If not, we will tell you when to have them taken out. W e may ask you to return to see your surgeon, or to see your family doctor, for this procedure. If your incision has Steri-strips on it, leave them on. As the incision starts to heal: the Steri-strips will start to curl up at the edges. You may trim the curled edges off carefully with scissors. Clean the scissors with soap and water first. Leave the rest of the Steri-strips on until they come off on their own or your surgeon tells you to remove them. When you are allowed to remove them, gently peel each end toward the middle until it comes off. They are easier to remove in the shower or right after you shower. A seroma is swelling caused by fluid building up in or around your incision area. This is normal and may feel like a lump a few days after surgery. In most cases, the fluid will absorb over time. See page 36 for Urgent Concerns and When to Get Help Follow-up Appointment Your follow-up care is an important part of your recovery. It will be unique to you and will depend on your diagnosis, surgery, and health. Phone your surgeon's office when you go home to arrange a follow-up visit. Be sure to write the follow-up appointment date and time on My Plan (page B). The appointment is usually scheduled between 4-6 weeks after you go home. Concerns or Complications See page 36 for Urgent Concerns and When to Get Help to find out when you should call or go into the emergency room. Pain or discomfort You'll probably feel some pain after your surgery. This is normal. Take your pain medicine as directed. If the medicine is upsetting your stomach, stop taking it and call your surgeon's office. If you're concerned about pain that doesn't stop or anything else you feel, talk to your doctor or nurse.C3 C425 At Home Medications You may require medications for pain, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, or other reasons when you are at home. Your surgeon and nurses will give you clear instructions on taking these medications. Some patients require blood thinner medication, as a pill or injection, when they go home. If you require this type of medication, we will give you teaching sessions and clear instructions on how to take it. Bowel problems or nausea Depending on the type of surgery you have and how much bowel is removed, you may experience different bowel problems. See page 36 for urgent and non-urgent concerns. Call to get advice if you are unsure or have new or worsening problems with constipation, diarrhea or nausea. At Home 26 Personal Care, Nutrition & Activity Showering and personal care You may shower 48 hours after your surgery unless you were told not to. When you are allowed to, having a shower is usually okay while you still have staples, stitches, Steri-StripsTM, sticky dressings or a drain. Do not swim or bath while you are healing. Wait for an additional 4 weeks after your incisions are completely healed. Follow these instructions: Incisions Drains When you shower, stand so that the water isn't falling right on your incision. When you bathe, do not put your incision(s) under the water. Rinse the incision area well (do not scrub), and gently pat it dry. Use warm, not hot water, so you don't get a burn. (The area around the incision(s) may be numb so you may not be able to feel if the water is too hot). If you have dressings, remove them before showering and apply new ones after. Hold the tubing of the drain in place while you are in the shower so it's not pulling against your skin. We recommend wearing a cloth belt around your waist. Secure the drain to the belt with a safety pin while you shower. Vaginal flow If you have had surgery on your uterus or ovaries, you can expect some vaginal flow or discharge that comes and goes for about up to 6 weeks after surgery . Use sanitary pads during this time. Do not use tampons \u2014 they may cause vaginal irritation or infection. Using products (liquids, lotions or creams) It is important not to use products on your incision until it is healed. These products may irritate healing tissue. Do not clean your incision with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. When your incisions are fully healed, you may use an unscented lotion. C527 At Home Driving Usually, people can start driving again 1-2 weeks after going home. Do not drive until you: are no longer taking pain medications that make you feel sleepy (such as narcotics or opioids like morphine, codeine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and others) can shoulder check without pain can hit the brake pedal for an emergency stop without pain feel stronger and comfortable Diet and nutrition Nutrition will improve your treatment outcomes and quality of life. Eat a healthy diet to give your body the energy to heal and to do your everyday activities. Choose a variety of foods: vegetables and fruits whole grain foods foods with proteinEat foods with protein to help you: heal and recover meet your protein needs maintain strength and muscle health keep your immune system healthy Protein and higher calorie foods Protein is especially important after surgery. Try to add a protein food source to every meal. It may also help to eat foods that are higher in energy (calories). Higher energy foods with protein: beef, pork, poultry, fish, and eggs milk, cheese, ice cream, and yogurt beans, lentils, nuts, nut butters, seeds, and tofu protein powders and nutrition supplement drinks Higher energy foods without protein: avocado, dried fruit, granola, and wheat germ margarine, butter, vegetable oil, salad dressing, mayonnaise, creamy sauces, gravy, and coconut milkAt Home 28 Slow stomach emptying Before and after surgery and chemotherapy treatment can temporarily slow how fast your stomach processes food. Common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and early fullness. These symptoms often go away in a few weeks. Things you can try: eat snacks between meals eat smaller meals more often (every 2 to 3 hours) limit fluids to 1/2 cup (125 mL) with a meal, or drink your fluids 30-45 minutes before or after meals Weight loss Eat enough so you do not lose weight. If you are losing weight, nutrition supplement drinks, puddings, or bars, such as Ensure\u00ae, Boost\u00ae, Resource\u00ae, and Carnation Instant Breakfast\u00ae can be a quick and easy way to add more nutrition to your intake. You may want to weigh yourself weekly after surgery to check to see that you are maintaining your weight. Special requirements A very small number of people go home with additional nutrition being given through a feeding tube into their stomach, or through a long-term IV line. The hospital may arrange homecare nursing services and the home enteral/parenteral nutrition program to help provide support at home. Food safety Always wash your hands with soap before preparing or handling food. Wash your vegetables and fruits with water before you eat them. This will help to remove any germs that are not visible. Proper handling, storage, and cooking of meat is also important. Raw meat can have bacteria that can make you very sick if you don't cook it or store it properly. Keep raw meat and fresh fruit and vegetables separate.If you want more information on what to eat, drink, or both, ask your healthcare team to speak with a dietitian. A dietitian can give you guidance and tips for healthy eating during your treatment, especially if you are losing weight. 29 At Home Activity and exercise Regular exercise before surgery and after your incisions have healed has many benefits. It can help: reduce fatigue and improve energy levels reduce your risk for blood clots reduce nausea boost your immune system lower your risk for falling by keeping you stronger improve your mood and help you feel better as treatment progresses Both rest and exercise are important to your recovery. You will be tired for several weeks to months after your surgery. During this time, limit your activity to walking, and limit the number of times you climb the stairs in a day. Let the way you feel guide you - when you start to feel tired, stop whatever you are doing and rest. Taking many rest periods throughout the day is more helpful than one long rest. Try to get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep at night. It's important to check with your surgeon first before you start any exercise program, go back to doing sports or do heavy housework (like vacuuming). Light activity, such as walking and light housework is okay. Remember, do not lift anything over 10 pounds (4.5 kg) for the first 6 weeks after surgery. It takes this long for your incision(s) to heal completely. If you have other health issues, check with your healthcare team before you start a new exercise program. Sexual Intercourse Ask your surgeon when it is okay to resume sexual intercourse. If you had surgery to any of your sex organs (uterus, vagina), your surgeon may ask you to wait longer (4-6 weeks after surgery).Studies show that exercise helps patients feel better \u2014 even something as short as a 10-15 minute walk. At Home 30 Tobacco products We know stopping the use of tobacco can be difficult and often takes several tries. By stopping your tobacco use after a cancer diagnosis, you can improve your health and body' s response to treatment, whether it's surgery, radiation treatment or systemic treatment. Studies show many important benefits of quitting the use of tobacco after a cancer diagnosis, including: A better chance of successful treatment Fewer serious side effects Faster recovery from treatment Decreased risk of the cancer coming back, or getting another cancer diagnosis Lower risk of infection Easier breathing More energy Better quality of life Cancer patients who quit tobacco say they feel better physically, emotionally, and have a better quality of life! Now is the BEST time to be tobacco free.

Living Your Best Appearance Body image It's normal to have questions and concerns about body image and sexuality. You may have unexpected feelings from the changes to your body from surgery or treatment. This is different for everyone. If you can talk about these feelings with your partner, family, and friends, you'll feel less alone when dealing with these changes. If you'd like more help, talk to: Someone in your community who you trust. Any member of your healthcare team. Emotional Self Care and Awareness It can be hard to talk about having cancer. Some people find it helpful to talk to friends and family. Speaking with others might help you: Understand the information better. Get the support you need. Create a support network. You may want to have 1 person keep others updated for you. Feel in control of your own treatment plan so you're comfortable asking questions. Difficult emotions often arise during cancer and its treatments. Psychologists and social workers offer counselling to patients and family members to help reduce emotional distress and explore coping techniques. They help with things such as communication, stress, coping with treatment side effects, mood changes, quality of life, body image or loneliness. Once you have a confirmed cancer diagnosis, you or your support persons can ask for a referral to the cancer counselling professionals (Psychosocial Oncology).D1 Read more at: www.ahs.ca/cancertreatment > Managing Side Effects > Sexual Health D2 For more information look in the Newly Diagnosed With Cancer Book or For contact information visit www.ahs.ca/ cancersupportivecare > Psychosocial OncologyManage Your Cancer Care 01 Newly Diagnosed with Cancer: Information and Resources to Help Patients and Families Be Active in their Cancer Care General Information Living Your Best Life With and Beyond CancerLiving Your Best 32 Anxiety What is anxiety? Anxiety is a feeling of worry, fear, or being nervous and is a normal feeling for patients and families to have when going through a cancer diagnosis. What are signs and symptoms of anxiety? Feeling restless, worried, or not able to relax Feeling moody or stressed Tense muscles Trouble sleeping Some people have strong anxiety which can cause anxiety attacks. You may feel: Feelings of doom Shortness of breath Dizziness and nausea Chest pains Heart palpitations (your heart feels like it is fluttering or pounding) What can I do to help my anxiety or depression? Find support: Talk to someone you trust and who is a good listener \u2014 friends, family or co-workers. Talk to a social worker about support programs at your cancer centre and in your community. Get professional help. Professional counsellors can help you learn new ways to manage your anxiety and worry. Focus on things that make you feel better. Think about the positive parts of your life and the things you can control. Spend time with people who make you laugh and avoid those who are negative. Get a good sleep \u2014 this can give you more energy and help you feel better emotionally. Exercise and take care of your body. It's a good way to help you feel better and improve your mood. Some people find writing in a journal or expressing their feelings through art can help. Try to limit or avoid alcohol because it can lower your mood. Try relaxation activities like listening to music, yoga, or deep breathing.People who learn about their cancer and treatment options may feel more in control and have less anxiety. Be ready for your appointments with a written list of questions, and bring a support person if you can. 33 Living Your Best Integrative and Complementary Therapies What are integrative and complementary therapies? These include different healing approaches and therapies not considered to be standard medical treatments. Standard medical treatments are scientifically-tested and researched and include treatments such as radiation, surgery, and systemic treatment (such as chemotherapy or hormone therapy). These treatments are used by doctors to treat people with cancer. Complementary medicine is used along with standard medical treatments. It is meant to help relieve symptoms or side effects, or boost emotional or physical health. Talk to your surgeon, oncologist or family doctor if you are thinking about using complementary therapies or if you have any questions or problems. Check with your pharmacist or registered dietitian to see if there are possible interactions with medications or supplements. Does my healthcare team need to know if I am using integrative or complementary therapies? Yes. Tell your doctor or nurse about anything you are taking or using. Some complementary therapies interact with other medicine you take and may make your treatment less effective. It's always best to talk to your healthcare team before you start any additional treatments or therapies. These include things like: pills injections vitamins herbal remedies massage acupuncture hyperbaric oxygen treatment cannabis Are there natural health products I can take during treatment? You can take a regular strength multiple vitamin and mineral supplement. Choose a brand that is made for your age group. The supplement should have small doses of a wide variety of nutrients (high doses are not recommended). We recommend that you do not use other natural health products for 1 month after you finish your treatments, and when possible, for 1 month before you start treatment.
