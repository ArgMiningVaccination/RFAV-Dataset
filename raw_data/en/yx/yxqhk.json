KidsHealth.org/classroomK to Grade 2 Personal Health Series Energy Balance Energy is what helps you do the things you like to do. When you eat or drink, energy goes into your body. And when you do things like run a race or draw a picture, you use up energy. To be healthy, you have to balance the energy your body takes in with the energy it uses up. The following discussion questions and activities will help your students understand what they can do to \"balance\" their energy.

Activities for Students Note: The following activities are written in language appropriate for sharing with your students. An Energy Balancing Act Objectives: Students will: Identify and explain the balance between taking in food and spending energy Describe and distinguish between healthy and non-healthy energy sources and high- and low-energy activities Materials: Chart paper Art supplies (colored pencils, markers, crayons) My Energy Balance handout (available at: KidsHealth.org/classroom/prekto2/personal/nutrition/energy_balance_ handout1.pdf ) Class Time: 40 minutes Activity: Energy balance is the balance your body needs between energy coming in (from what you eat and drink) and energy going out (for the things you do and the ways you move). For example, when you eat breakfast in the morning, your body takes in energy. How do you use that energy? What kinds of things does it allow you to do? Some foods give you more energy than others. It's important to eat foods from the different food groups so that your body gets the energy it needs. What kinds of healthy foods do you eat at breakfast? Lunch? Snack time? Dinner? (Teachers: Record student responses on chart paper.) Some activities use up more energy than others. For example, doing 20 jumping jacks gets your heart beating faster than cleaning your room. Jumping up and down is a high-energy activity, and cleaning your room is a low-energy activity. When you climb a set of stairs, you use more energy than when you take an elevator. What are some high- energy activities that you like to do? What are some low-energy activities that you like to do? (Teachers: Record student responses on chart paper.) Think about what you like to eat and what you like to do. How do you balance your body's energy? On the My Energy Balance handout, draw pictures of the foods you like to eat and the things you like to do. Circle the foods you eat that are healthy and draw a triangle around the activities you do that get your heart beating faster and use up lots of energy. Share your work with your class. Extensions: Use pictures from newspapers and magazines and your own drawings to create an \"energy balance collage.\" On one side, show the kinds of foods you like to eat that give you energy. On the other side, show the activities you like to do that use up energy. 1.K to Grade 2 Personal Health Series Energy Balance\u00a9 2006 The Nemours Foundation/KidsHealth.

Objectives: Students will: Identify healthy snacks Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of being active, and identify different activities that use energy Materials: Art supplies (colored pencils, markers, crayons)My Snack-and-Act Pact handout at: KidsHealth.org/classroom/prekto2/personal/nutrition/energy_ balance_handout2.pdf ) Class Time: 30 minutes Activity: Every day your body uses up lots of energy. Sometimes it needs to be \"refueled,\" and that's when a snack can come in handy. A snack does not have to be a bag of chips or a handful of cookies. In fact, foods that aren't so nutritious usually don't give you the energy you need. But healthy snacks, like an apple or a glass of milk, can give you just the right amount of energy you need to keep going! You're going to design your own Snack-and-Act Pact. First, make a list of some of healthy snacks you like. Then, design a 5-minute workout that gets your blood flowing! In each box, write or draw the action or movement you will do. Try to have a good mix of high-energy and low-energy activities, and be sure to give yourself time to catch your breath! When you're finished, share your workout routine with a partner. Test out each other's activities. How do they make you feel?
