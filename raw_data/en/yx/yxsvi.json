Sources of a food borne illness can be: -The food -The handler -The environment University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 5 Food Safety Steps to Food Safety: -Wash hands and surfaces often -Avoid cross contamination -Keep foods at safe temperatures Tools for food safety: -Food and refrigerator thermometers a refrigerator thermometer should read 40 degrees or less Cooking temperature for meat is 160 to 180 degrees Holding temperature is 140 degrees or greater -Hand soap -Clean cloth (replace daily) or paper towels -Beach solution (1/3 cup household bleach with 3 and 1/3 cups water) Food Safety University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 7 Food Safety Cutting boards: -Sanitize every time after cutting raw meat -Sanitize once weekly for other purposes -Sanitize by soaking in bleach solution for 2 minutes, rinse and air dry Do not cross -contaminate -Cutting boards and knives -Clean plates for cooked meat when grilling Check \"Sell By\" and \"Use By\" dates University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 8 Food Safety Fruit and vegetable handling: -\"Organic\" and \"natural\" produce needs to be handled in the same manner as all raw produce -- those terms have no relationship to the cleanliness of the product. -Do not purchase product pre -cut -Commercial rinses are not recommended as they have not been proven to be more effective than running water University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 9 Diet During Treatment Main goals during treatment -Maintain weight or have gradual weight loss if appropriate -Adequate protein intake -Adequate hydration -Try to eat as balanced a diet as possible University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 10 Does Sugar feed my cancer? -Yes and no -Controversy and Confusion Books and internet say, \"avoid\". Medical team says, \"eat what you want\". -Sugar in the form of glucose feeds every cell in our body Even if you did not eat sugar - or carbohydrates - your body would convert fat and protein to glucose -In general, however, large amounts of simple sugars are not recommended! University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 11 Glycemic index is a number that tells you how much a food will raise your blood sugar -The higher the number, the more quickly the carbohydrate in the food will raise your blood sugar -Usually, the more complex the food is (if it contains fiber, fat and protein) the lower the glycemic index will be. Does sugar feed my cancer? Research is showing that it is sugar's relationship to higher insulin levels and related growth factors that may influence cancer cell growth the most, and increase risk of other chronic diseases. Many types of cancer cells have plenty of insulin receptors, making them respond more than normal cells to insulin's ability to promote growth. Sugar Most Americans eat 22 tsp per day Guidelines from the American Heart Association: -Women: 6 tsp per day (25 g) of sugar to provide 100 calories -Men: 9 tsp per day (37g) of sugar to provide 150 calories per day University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 14 Increase intake of low glycemic foods like most fruits, vegetables, dried beans and dairy products. Choose foods as close as you can to their natural state Include protein with carbohydrates (Avoid naked carbohydrates) Limit intake of high glycemic foods like breads, refined cereals, potatoes, white rice and sweet beverages. Spread carbohydrate intake out Choose Fruit over juice Ketogenic Diet 4:1 ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein Typical day of total net carbohydrates in a day would be 9 grams This diet has compliance issues and has been \"liberalized\" to a Modified Atkin's Diet that would have 20 grams of net carbohydrate. Modified Atkin's Diet The Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) is a low carbohydrate, high fat, moderate protein diet. It is based on the induction phase of the Atkins diet originally designed for weight loss in adults. The purpose of the diet is to increase the body's dependence on fat rather than glucose for energy. This high fat diet causes the body to burn fat for energy. Modified Atkin's Diet Typical \"American\" Diet -Fat 30 -35% -Protein 10 to 35% -Carbohydrates to 65 Diet -Fat 65% -Protein 25 -35% -Carbohydrate 2 -5% Vegan diet In this diet you avoid ALL animal products There are degrees to vegetarians - -Lacto -vegetarian: diet includes dairy -lacto -ovo vegetarian: diet includes dairy and eggs -Pescatarian - includes plant foods and fish -Semi or partial vegetarian - includes plant foods and may include chicken or fish, dairy products or eggs. It does not include red meat. Vegan Diet Goal is a plant based diet So you could go vegan if you so desire but it is not necessary to do so. If animal products are eliminated from the diet vitamins and minerals to be aware of are: -Vitamin B12 -Omega 3 Fatty acids -Vitamin D - Protein -Iron - Calcium University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 20 Eating Problems Side effects of cancer and treatment can lead to: -Decreased appetite -Taste and smell changes -Dry mouth -Sore mouth and throat and trouble swallowing -Feeling fullness -Nausea, queasiness and vomiting -Diarrhea and constipation -Increased calorie and protein needs -Changes in emotions (anxiety, fear, depression) that can impact our desire to eat and how we feel A combination of some (or all) of these symptoms = weight loss University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 21 Weight Goal is to stabilize weight. If you need to lose weight at all, weight loss must be gradual. However the best time for intentional weight loss may be after treatment is complete . Significant weight loss would be more than 5% in a month or 7% in 3 months University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 22 Weight Concern with weight loss with treatment is that, there can also be a loss of lean body mass. Loss of lean body mass can increase fatigue, decrease tolerance to treatment and, and result in a decrease in quality of life. Lean body mass can be preserved by activity and by eating adequate calories and protein. University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 23 Maximizing Calories and Protein Think about what could be added to foods you are able to eat that would increase calorie/protein content of the foods Try to purchase higher calorie and protein options at the grocery store Consider incorporating oral supplements, smoothies or milkshakes Protein Protein should be the main focus! The amount of protein you need varies from person to person as it is based on weight Generally, a high protein diet for women might be >80 grams per day, whereas, for men the goal may be 100 grams per day University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 24 University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 25 Protein Animal protein has about 7 grams of protein per ounce Unfortunately, animal protein does not always appeal to individuals during treatment University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 26 Protein Often dairy products are sources of protein that are better tolerated 1 egg has 7 grams of protein \u00bc cup of cottage cheese has 7 grams of protein 8 ounce glass of milk, lactose - free milk or soy milk has 8 grams of protein University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 27 Protein Other options: -Plant proteins - such as beans, nuts, seeds. -Nutritional drinks such as Boost or Ensure Plus, Carnation Breakfast Essentials, Muscle Milk, Ensure Active (Ensure Clear) --Protein powders --Meal replacement bars such as Cliff, Balance, etc. --Homemade milkshakes and smoothies University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 28 What can caregivers do? Realize that tastes can change from day to day Keep a variety of food within easy reach Encourage eating small, frequent meals and snacks (ie. every 2 -3 hours) Offer gentle support --try not to push/force foods or get frustrated Try to work together to manage eating problems University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 29 Magnesium Medications, surgery and illness may increase magnesium losses from the body. Usually you will be given oral magnesium or IV magnesium to replete Magnesium is widely distributed in plants and animal foods Refined foods (ie. cereals) often fortified with magnesium University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 30 Magnesium Recommended daily amounts of Magnesium : Age Men Women 14-18 410 mg 360 mg 19-30 400 mg 310 mg 31+ 420 mg 320 mg University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 31 High Magnesium Foods Food Serving size mg All Bran Cereal \u00bd cup 110 Molasses 2 Tbsps. 100 Oatmeal 1 cup 61 Raisin Bran \u00bd cup 38 Brown Rice \u00bd cup 42 Avocado, Florida 1 medium 104 Spinach, boiled \u00bd cup 75 Pumpkin seeds 1 ounce 150 Brazil nuts 1 ounce 107 Tofu \u00bd cup 73 Wheat Germ 2 TBSP toasted 90 Almonds 1 ounce 80 Edamame \u00bd cup 50 Yogurt, plain 8 oz. 42 University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 32 Diet After Treatment Guidelines for diet after treatment Achieve and maintain a healthy weight -Calories consumed versus calories expended Maintain a healthy diet high in fruits and vegetables, and whole grains and low in red meat, processed meat, sugars, fats in an effort to control weight and avoid obesity Minimize alcohol intake -1 drink a day for women and 2 for men University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 34 Healthy Diet AICR Aim for meals made up of : -2/3 (or more) vegetables, fruits whole grains or beans -1/3 (or less) animal protein University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 36 Healthy Diet Focus on the \"Big Picture\" Keep diet \"empowering\" not a stress University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 37 Weight Changes Assess what your goal weight should be \u2014regaining all the weight lost during treatment may not be desired or realistic. Weight gain or loss should be managed with a combination of diet, exercise and behavioral changes. Body Mass Index -Goal is for BMI to stay above ~22 -What is range? -BMI -Overweight = -29.9 -Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater -Underweight = <18.5 University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 38 Weight Gaining weight following treatment may be a slow (and frustrating) process! -A goal of 2 to 4 pounds per month is realistic Remember, calorie needs may increase with fevers, infection, physical activity, GI problems or other issues. Supplement needs along with a Healthy Diet After treatment the Calcium and Vitamin D may need to be supplemented It is not mandatory to take any additional vitamins or minerals. A MVI is not necessary but some find comfort in it. Another popular supplement is Omega -3 University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 40 Calcium and Vitamin D Calcium and Vitamin D needs may be elevated for those on steroid therapy Calcium: -RDA for women from 19 to 50 is 1000mg per day -RDA for women > 51 is 1200 mg per day -RDA for men 19 to 70 is 1000 mg per day -RDA for men > 71 is 1200 mg -Tolerable upper limit is 2000 to 2500 mg per day Food sources of calcium include dairy products and green leafy vegetables - some products are fortified University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 41 Calcium and Vitamin D Vitamin D -DRI for men and women aged 19 -70 is 600 IU per day and if >70, 800 IU day -For those with Multiple Myeloma a study back in 2008 recommended intake of 1,000 IU per day of Vitamin D -Tolerable upper limit 4,000 IU per day Sources of Vitamin D include fortified milk, certain fish (salmon and tuna), egg yolks, fortified cereals and, of course, the sun. Vitamin D helps promote calcium absorption If your diet cannot or does not provide adequate amounts of calcium or Vitamin D, a supplement should be discussed with your healthcare team. University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 42 Calcium and Vitamin D If deficient in Vitamin D - calcium's protective effect potentially erased Estimating Vitamin D intake needs to incorporate both diet sources and sunlight exposure Vitamin D Sources: -Sun exposure ((UV)B) -Vitamin D containing foods -Vitamin D supplements University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 43 Vitamin D Deficiency is prevalent. Signs of deficiency could be dull persistent and generalized musculoskeletal aches and pains with fatigue or decrease in muscle strength Never hurts to get your levels checked. It is just a simple blood test.(25(OH)D want this level 30 -50nmol/L) Sometimes a prescription is called in for 50,000IU taken once weekly University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 44 Vitamin D Are you in the sun? Your body is usually able to get all the vitamin D it needs, if you regularly expose enough bare skin to the sun. 5-30 minutes of sun exposure between 10a and 3p at least 2 times per week to face, arms legs or back without sunscreen - usually lead to sufficient vitamin D synthesis . University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 46 Calcium and Vitamin D To calculate how much calcium is in this food you take the percent of calcium and add a zero. In this product a \u00bd cup serving provides 4% of your daily calcium need (based on 1000 milligrams per day), which is 40 milligrams. University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 47 Need for supplements? A general multivitamin is appropriate to take, but not mandatory When selecting a general multivitamin please ensure the product... -Contains No Iron (if you had a transplant) -Does not provide greater than 200% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) -Contains no herbs or other plant materials University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 48 Need for supplements? Be cautious when taking supplements! Usage of supplements and herbals raises concerns for: -Unexpected or unwanted interactions between preparations and prescribed medicines (i.e.. Echinacea if taking immunosuppressants , St. John's Wort specifically has many interactions with other medications) -Potential contamination -No true regulatory industry - products may contain ingredients not listed on the label Need for supplements? Proper nutrition can be obtained through whole foods, which often contains more nutrients than what can be found in a pill. If you choose to take pills/supplements please always speak with your healthcare provider. University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 49 University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 50 Omega -3 Fatty Acids Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA 's) -Alpha -Linolenic Acid (ALA) -Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) -Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Mediate the anti -inflammatory response/decrease inflammation Preserve muscle mass Purported Uses of -Cancer prevention -Cardiovascular disease -Colitis -Cystic fibrosis -Depression University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 51 Omega -3 Fatty Acids EPA and DHA found in fatty, cold water fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel & tuna and found in cod liver oil ALA found in plant sources such as dark, leafy greens, flaxseed, canola oil and walnuts Omega 3 Side Effects & Contraindications Side effects of capsules and oils: -Fishy aftertaste, loose stools and nausea after large doses Drug Interactions: -May increase the effect of anti -coagulant agents -FDA recommends: less than 3 gm per day as higher doses may increase the risk of bleeding **Typical recommendations is for no more than 1-2 gm per day during treatment** University H \\ospitals Seidman Cancer Center 52 Probiotics \"Good\" bacteria similar to the healthy bacteria in the digestive tract Helps increase stool regularity and decrease the length and severity of diarrhea Found in yogurt active cultures, cultured dairy products People with compromised immune systems should not take an over -the-counter probiotic supplements unless approved by your physician. University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 53 Gluten Free University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 54 -No connection between gluten and most cancers -Exception: Intestinal cancers in patients who have a true gluten intolerance or Celiac's disease -In fact, the more whole grains that are consumed, the lower risk of most cancers -May be needlessly avoiding healthy foods that are linked with lower risk for many chronic diseases Alkaline Diet -Humans require a tightly controlled pH level in the body (between 7.35 -7.45) \u2014making it slightly more alkaline -Based on the theory that suggests cancer cells thrive in an acidic environment but don't survive in an alkaline setting. -No human studies showing that alkaline diets can help prevent or treat cancer -Goal: 80% alkaline -forming and 20% acid -forming foods Meat, fish, dairy products, caffeine, sugar and salt most acid forming Fruits and vegetables most alkaline Grains and legumes slightly acidic but vary by type Bottom Line: Overall, diet is high in fruits and vegetables -- make protein choices lean and low fat University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 55 Organic In 1990 Standards were developed to establish uniform standards for production and handling of foods labeled organic. \"Organic agricultural practices cannot ensure that products are completely free of residues; however, methods are used to minimize pollution from air soil and water\" Organic National organic program - (NOP) -Part of the USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service -Has regulatory oversight for the organic standards Organic food does not use conventional pesticides, fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge, bioengineering or ionizing radiation Organic 12 most Genetically Modified Foods, genetically engineered, or transgenic MUCH CONTROVERSARY No mandatory labeling in the US - but over 60 countries do. Currently, if it is USDA organic - GMOs are not present GMO Prevalence of GMO crops: -94% of soybean -93% of -96% of cotton -Others: alfalfa, sugar beets, canola, papaya, zucchini, yellow squash Additional Resources American Institute for Cancer Research -www.aicr.org National Cancer Institute -www.cancer.gov The American Cancer Society -www.cancer.org Caring4Cancer -www.caring4cancer.com National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine -www.nccam.nih.gov National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements -www.ods.od.nih.gov Oncology Nutrition Practice Group of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics -www.oncologynutrition.org University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center 63 Any Questions????
