Within three months of the event, however, 56% of these patients experience personality changes including anxiety, depression, and other behavioral issues. In 2012, over 400,000 vets returned from Middle Eastern conflicts with diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Traditional therapies, including anti-anxiety, antipsychotic and antidepressant agents, often utilizing multiple units of each agent, do nothing to treat the underlying cause. A French research team, in 1985, lead by EE Baulieu, demonstrated that the neurosteroids pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, progesterone, and DHEA, are produced not only in the periphery, as orthodox medicine long believed, but are also generated in the intracranially. A failure of the cerebral neurosteroid mechanism leads to erratic brain transmissions, which in turn exacerbates mental health issues including depression, suicide, anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, and psychosis commonly witnessed in people living with post-traumatic stress disorder. In this lecture, we explore the role the neurosteroid hormones play in the face of traumatic brain injury, the consequences of their failure, the diagnosis of hormonal deficiencies and insufficiencies and treatment strategies to return the victim to a healthy premorbid hormonal state.

The theory states that every individual has a unique composition of humor by volume. That ratio forms what we call the 'temperament' in English or 'misaj' in Arabic. When this humor balance is disturbed, the body's homeostasis gets out of balance, leading to various diseases. The four senses of humor originate in the stomach and form the chyme. Our research finds a remarkable correlation between the ancient views of Unani doctors and the modern scientific understanding of the origins of the stomach pathogenesis. Understanding which stomach regions are affected before the symptoms occur may help prevent or cure the corresponding illnesses. Our presentation will show: 1. How a particular stomach region relates to the origin of a specific humor; 2. How the stomach blood supply affects humor' formation; 3. Correlations between stomach regions and individuals' temperament (misaj); 4. Identification and treatment of abnormal humor implicated in different pathologies. Treatment principles: 1. Simple imbalances are treated by normalizing humor qualities with either warming or cooling herbs; 2. Abnormal humors are treated by restoring them to original ratios. Complicated imbalances are treated by balancing one or more humor. Biography Yury Yuabov held a professorship position at the bioscience department of Tashkent Medical University since 1986. He started practicing Traditional Oriental Medicine over 25 years ago under the supervision of his mentor in Uzbekistan. He had received his MS in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from Tri-State College of Acupuncture and has published his research articles in more than 15 magazines.

To find the correct remedy, a practitioner must collect symptoms relevant to every organ and system, mind and body. Ideally, the evaluation should include both a physical examination and a holistic interview. In practice, the physical examination component is often neglected. This is a lost opportunity. As the homeopathic masters knew, a specific physical finding can be a decisive factor in distinguishing between candidate remedies. This talk will address symptomatology which can be elicited by a stethoscope, by pulse, or by ear: the heart rhythm. The lecture will include a discussion of various heart rhythms, interesting rubrics and remedies, and a case from the lecturer's own practice. Biography Janice Block is a medical doctor and integrative physician with over 20 years of experience in clinical medicine. She is the author of Cardiac Examination in Homeopathy: A practical approach to examination, in the tradition of the homeopathic masters. She has written multiple articles on integrative medicine for Connections Magazine, Nizat Magazine, and hpathy.com, and is a regular speaker for the Whole Health Forum, Israel.

Pain relief without detriment was sought using homeopathy. Homeopathy is a medical system of substance microdoses that are therapeutically indicated by characteristic symptom patterns. Its action is vitalistic, not biochemical; it does not incur noted client detriments. Its use was evaluated in a women's health clinical practice for the relief of endometrial pain in 12 women during Jan. 2009 - Oct. 2011. Premise: Emerging research correlates pain levels with nerve fiber quantity in an endometrial biopsy. Thus, homeopathy to relieve endometrial pain must match neuro affinity as well as typical dysmenorrhea and adhesions. Four homeopathics whose pathogenesis showed the characteristic triad (dysmenorrhea, for evaluation (Spigelia, Lilium tigrinum, Viburnum, Sabina). Method: 12 women consecutively presenting with the diagnosis of endometriosis were treated homeopathically and tracked for retrospective review. 8 received one of these four homeopathics, selected on characteristic symptom patterns. 4 received other homeopathics matched to constitutional state, without clear affinity to the symptom triad noted. Results: All 8 women treated with one of the four selected homeopathics reported marked, quantified, sustained reductions (avg 68%) in pelvic pain and analgesic use during and between menstrual cycles over the period of review; half noted longer cycle duration and shorter flow, reducing the frequency of menstrual pain. The 4 women who received other homeopathics reported improvement in other ways without relief from endometrial pain; all stopped homeopathic care.

Integrative Medicine | ISSN: | Volume 7October 17-18, 2018 | Las Vegas, USAInternational Conference on Complementary & Alternative MedicineHow to get the health benefits of cannabis without getting high Leta B Jussila Optimal Health and Fitness, USA Statement of the Problem: The use of cannabis is deeply embedded throughout history and once held an important place in medicine. Many famous and respected physicians used cannabis for many ailments and diseases. Although in the last century cannabis laws were driven by politics rather than by research, with an enormous amount of support for its wide variety of medicinal uses, there is now more research being conducted and a push for legalization. This capstone demonstrates the role Cannabis has had in Chinese Medicine's original pharmacopeia and to bridge gaps in cannabis-related knowledge. Through a substantial literature review of biomedical research and Chinese classical texts, I collected relevant information about Cannabis, including historical background and development of research. The study utilized the qualitative research method of systematic literature review synthesis. The grounded theory procedure of constant comparative analysis was further engaged to provide a means for systematically analyzing the data. The synthesis found that Cannabis may benefit many physiological processes in the body for many conditions and that the benefits far outweigh the side effects. Researchers have proven the medicinal effects of Cannabis and have discovered that cannabinoids play a fundamental role in regulating pleasure, memory, thinking, concentration, body movement, awareness of time, appetite, pain, and sensory processing (taste, touch, smell, hearing, and sight), and brain development. Because of this supporting literature, it's vital that anyone in the health field have the foundational knowledge for clinical application for cannabis as a therapeutic agent. This paper is intended to be a starting point for health practitioners to deepen their understanding of the history and benefits of cannabis. Biography Leta Jussila, known as Doctor Leta, is a Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, Certified Personal Trainer, Qi Gong Instructor and Practitioner of Higher Consciousness. She runs and owns a successful health and wellness company called Optimal Health and Fitness based in Santa Cruz for the past 13 years. Her Capstone was on the History and Therapeutic Benefits of Cannabis and CBD. She is a trusted source for Americans on behalf of Chinese Medicine in the U.S and continues to be an advocate for the widespread education of the Asian healing arts. She has an exceptional ability in helping individuals in an efficient and inspirational way. She loves to educate, empower and share her passion and gifts to the world. doctorleta@gmail.comLeta B Jussila, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 Integrative Medicine | ISSN: | Volume 7October 17-18, 2018 | Las Vegas, USAInternational Conference on Complementary & Alternative MedicineUpper cervical chiropractic, an alternative approach to traditional osteopathic manipulation: Case studies, efficacy and safety Devin Luzod Gentle Pain Care Center, USA Statement of the Problem: With the opioid epidemic on the rise, patients and doctors need safe, natural and alternative means to relieve spinal pain, disc problems and pinched nerves. Only 8.6% of adults in the United States utilize Chiropractic/ Osteopathic treatments. Researchers have reported that while traditional manipulation is largely a safe approach, injuries due to rotational and forceful thrusting maneuvers still occur in the clinical setting. The purpose of this lecture is to highlight a unique approach within the chiropractic profession, known as Upper Cervical Care.This non-manipulative, low-force approach to chiropractic has yielded a patient satisfaction rating of 9/10. In the largest published study, consecutive new patients from the offices of 83 upper cervical chiropractors were recruited. Clinical outcome measures included 1) Neck pain disability index (100-point scale), 2) Oswestry back pain index (100-point scale), 3) 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) for neck, headache, midback, and low back pain, 4) treatment satisfaction, and 5) Symptomatic Reactions (SR). Data were collected at baseline, and after approximately 2 weeks of care. A patient reaching sub-clinical status for pain and disability was defined as a follow-up score <3 NRS and <10%, respectively. A SR is defined as a new complaint not present at baseline or a worsening of the presenting complaint by >30% based on an 11-point numeric rating scale occurring <24 hours after any upper cervical procedure. Results: A total of 1,090 patients completed the study having 4,920 (4.5 per patient) office visits requiring 2,653 (2.4 per patient) upper cervical adjustments over 17 days. Three hundred thirty- eight (31.0%) patients had SRs meeting the accepted definition. Intense SR (NRS 8) occurred in 56 patients (5.1%). Outcome assessments were significantly improved for neck pain and disability, headache, mid-back pain, as well as lower back pain and disability (p <0.001) following care with a high level (mean = 9.1/10) of patient satisfaction. The 83 chiropractors administered >5 million career upper cervical adjustments without a reported incidence of serious adverse event. Conclusions: Upper cervical chiropractic care may have a common occurrence of mild intensity SRs short (<24 hours), and rarely severe in intensity; however, outcome assessments were significantly improved with less than 3 weeks of care with a high level of patient satisfaction. Biography At age 13 Devin Luzod told his parents he wanted to grow up and become a chiropractor, and his entire life has been a mission to help serve humanity and relieve those who suffer. After graduating Life Chiropractic University in 1999, he has built multiple clinics and trained dozens of doctors on the gentle, specific upper cervical chiropractic form of care. He is the head doctor at Spinal Care of Nevada located Summerlin, NV at 1930 Village Center Cir, H11 Las Vegas NV, and is also the clinic director at Gentle Pain Care Centers in Henderson, NV. drd@drdevin.comDevin Luzod, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 Integrative Medicine | ISSN: | Volume 7October 17-18, 2018 | Las Vegas, USAInternational Conference on Complementary & Alternative MedicineBiofield enhanced vitamin D3 research: Improved bone health activity in Mg-63 cell line preclinical trial Karen Byrnes Allen Phoenix Institute of Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture, USA The National Center of Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has recognized and accepted Biofield Energy Healing Treatments as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) health care approach. Human Biofield Energy is a subtle energy with a capacity to enhance biological processes and outcomes. This energy can be harnessed and transmitted by the gifted individuals into living and non-living things via the process of a Biofield Energy Healing Treatment or Therapy. In a 2017 research study using MG-63 cell lines, Karen Allen provided this Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely from the United States while the Vitamin D3 test samples were in the research laboratory of Dabur Research Foundation, near New Delhi, India. The Biofield Energy Treatment was administered remotely for 5 minutes, directed to the test samples under laboratory conditions. In this study, Karen Allen never visited the laboratory in person, nor had any contact with the test item and medium. The research results, published in Trends in Technical & Scientific Research May 2018, document beneficial impact of biofield energy healing treated Vitamin D3 on the strength and health of bone cells. The preclinical research shows: Over 190% increase in collagen levels compared to controls Over 154% increase in bone mineralization compared to controls These research results add to the growing body of clinical results confirming the efficacy of biofield energy as a therapeutic tool.

This number is projected to increase to more than 131 million by 2050, as populations age. The concern is that those dying with advanced dementia are often not seen as having a terminal condition and are less likely than others to be managed palliatively. Flower essences and aromatherapy can play a valuable role in calming the stressed, angry, demanding or fearful patient. Aromatherapy (the therapeutic use of pure plant essential oils) either applied in a lotion and absorbed by the skin or inhaled and absorbed into the lungs and nasal passages have been found to improve physical and mental health. Case studies show that aromatherapy with essential oil is a safe and effective treatment for clinically significant agitation in people with severe dementia. Aromatherapy is the fastest growing complementary therapy amongst caregivers. In the USA it has recently been recognized as a legitimate part of holistic nursing. Flower essences contain no biochemical component or aroma, but rather, carry the energetic signature of the plant, that may improve the quality of life and death. A limited number of clinical trials have concluded that aromatherapy does provide a potentially effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. It might be thought that aromatherapy providing a pleasing smell, but many patients with advanced dementia have lost their sense of smell. A number of recent, controlled studies have shown that aromatherapy can be useful in the management of patients with dementia: lavender (Lavandula angustifolia and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) are two essential oils of particular interest in this area. While lavender is the most widely used essential oil, there is great scope for exploring other oils in synergy with flower essences that may help with the palliative treatment of patients in a hospice or home setting in general. Biography Maggie Smith is an aromatherapist, flower essence practitioner, advanced energy healer, teacher, and lecturer. She has devoted her life to expanding her knowledge of flower essence therapy and aromatherapy in the palliative care treatment of Alzheimer's and dementia. She shares her energy healing gifts as a heart offering to help people of all ages. She formulates and produces aromatherapy and flower essence care products for Hospice organizations, as well as lecturing and facilitating staff training around the US. aroma@floweressencearomatherapy.comMaggie Smith, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: Notes: Integrative Medicine | ISSN: | Volume 7October 17-18, 2018 | Las Vegas, USAInternational Conference on Complementary & Alternative MedicineLyme disease, a modern epidemic, are we dealing with new super bugs in 21st century health, immunity and cellular terrain declining? Jack Miller Natural Health Sciences of Arizona LLC, USA Statement of the Problem: In the past 30 years many health conditions have arisen that were uncommon in previous times. Outbreaks of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the 80's (labeled the Yuppy flu), Fibromyalgia, and increasing prevalence of autoimmune conditions. A variety of causes were proposed, including viral infections such as EBV , CMV , HHV-6, etc, and these were researched and eventually eliminated. In more recent times, those suffering these conditions were eventually diagnosed with Lyme disease which has become very controversial within the medical community. One of the reasons for this controversy is that unless a patient has a major immune deficiency disease it is not expected that a bacterial infection such as Borrelia Burgdorferi (Lyme disease) can remain chronic. Y et cutting-edge lab tests such as PCR and Western blot antibody tests continue to prove that these suffering patients do in fact have active infection with BB and also with various other co-infections. Showing a situation where individuals are sick and debilitated, they have gone through the gamut of diagnostics with stacks of lab tests. In some case, they have been officially declared healthy by allopathic standards, even though clinically they may have virtually every symptom of Lyme disease, yet no medical condition has been diagnosed. When the patient finally gets positive lab tests for Lyme disease this may be rejected by the same providers that told them all along they were healthy. So the dilemma for them is they have both laboratory and clinical symptoms of Lyme disease and are still told they do not have it. As Naturopathic practitioners, our goal is simply to get people well controversies notwithstanding. We do this with a combination of cutting-edge health supporting therapies and support of the 4 main lifestyle factors, diet, exercise, sleep, and mental outlook. Biography Jack Miller is a naturopathic practitioner who owns Natural Health Sciences of Arizona, LLC in the Prescott, Arizona, and Las Vegas areas. He is certified through the American Naturopathic Certification Board. He is a professor of ACIM and has had the privilege through that organization to present with Dr. Mercola, Zac Bush MD, Jonathan Wright MD, Lee Erin Connealy MD, and other well-known holistic physicians. In addition, he has trained in Phoenix for 12 years under the tutelage of the renowned holistic physician William Lee Cowden MD. His primary field of knowledge is the holistic reversal of Lyme disease, Autism, Autoimmune disease, and heart disease. He offers extremely high-quality nutritional supplements, homeopathic remedies, natural oxygen therapies, and a variety of cutting-edge therapies and other protocols to assist with a wide variety of health challenges. nhs@nhsarizona.comJack Miller, Altern Integr Med 2018, Volume 7 DOI: Notes: Integrative Medicine | ISSN: | Volume 7October 17-18, 2018 | Las Vegas, USAInternational Conference on Complementary & Alternative MedicineThe passible mechanism of analgesic effect by Trametes Aim and Background: The Trametes versicolor (TV) with the several biological activities including immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, hypoglycemic, anti-oxidation, anti-bacterial and strengthen osteoporosis had been reported in previous studies. Hyperalgesia, which includes both acute and inflammatory processes, is characterized by an increased sensitivity to pain. Therefore, the anti-inflammation effect of TV may relieve the hyperalgesia. In an attempt to broaden the therapeutic application of TV , the formalin-induced hyperalgesia of rat will be a test animal model to explore the possible mechanisms of analgesia effect. According to previous explorations, the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) had a strong relative to the nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines such as TNF-alpha, interleukins production. Besides, the bioactivities of mushrooms phytosteroids, terpenoids and phenolic compounds also play important roles in the analgesic effects. Taken together, the hypothesis of mechanisms in analgesic effect by treated TV may be considered that impact the NO and cytokines production by the EPS or analgesic bioactivity components via anti-inflammation to cause an analgesic effect.

Results: 60 mothers completed the questionnaire and mothers age is 27 years (18.3%), length of stay in the U.S is 1-5 years (16.7%), married (100%), (45%) housewives, 53.3% full-time student with the bachelor degree or higher 46.7%. The household income is $30,000-$49,000. The decision about CAM is influenced mainly by family members (98.3%) and friends (70%). CAM is used for health conditions such as gastrointestinal, respiratory conditions, teeth pain, general body fatigue & pain. Common CAM therapies used are anise (68.4%), caraway (33.3%), mint (26.6%), and 78.3% mind and body methods use such as massage, prayers, exercise, & reciting prayers. Conclusion: The majority of mothers use herbs and dietary supplement frequently to manage child's health conditions, prevent diseases, or to maintain health. Mothers are the concern with frequency, dose, and safe dose for children and how to use these therapies for children. For these reasons, doctors should counsel as well as caution mothers about CAM therapies use and side effects, effectiveness and discuss preference to use such therapies to manage children health condition.

After seven months of therapy, image and laboratory exams follow up showed signals of healing. Pancreatic and hepatic enzymes that were high before the therapy, came up at normal levels. Ultrasonography didn't show nodules anymore. No more symptoms such as pain, diarrhea or vomiting. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: A ketogenic diet was adopted as an adjunct treatment in this case. It consists in the replacement of carbohydrates by healthy fats, which are converted to ketones, and in the intake of moderate amounts of high-quality protein to metabolize ketone bodies as an alternative fuel, when glucose availability is low. Findings: The dog in this study showed significant improvement and came back to her normal life and activities right at the beginning of the therapy. Today, she has a healthy happy and very active life. Although the study was done in a dog, it is known that a ketogenic diet is also effective in preventing and reducing cancer risks in humans. The ketogenic diet can provide anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic mechanisms, suggesting that tumor cells have reduced the ability to metabolize these ketone bodies for energy. It can offer hope against cancer, both for prevention and treatment. Conclusion: There are alternatives other than conventional medicine. Diet must be included on therapy plans either as an adjuvant or whenever possible as the main treatment. Nutrition plays an important role in the future of Medicine. Nontoxic metabolic therapy is effective and those interested in cancer prevention should know about this. Integrative Medicine conducted with criteria and responsibility leads to health and vitality for patients. Participants will know about this non-toxic alternative to help their patients and themselves.

Cs is used as a traditional medicinal plant by herb users in western Kordufan, Sudan. The results of preliminary phytochemical assessed showed that terpenoids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, and tannins are classes of chemical groups present in the pods of Ceratonia silique L. In addition, the results indicate that the Cs is rich in amino acids content especially essential amino acids, which contribute a large amount of total amino acids content (17), the most abundant amino acid was Proline followed by Aspartic acid. In contrast, Serine was the lowest amino acids, followed by phenylalanine. The pod's extracts were used in different serial dilutions (100, 80, 60, and 40%) using ethanol. The ethanol extracts were found to be active against microorganisms, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus, and Escherichia coli at concentration 100%, where they recorded zone of growth inhibition 10 mm which is considered active. In conclusion, the chemical content and the biological activities of the Ceratonia silique L pods extracts were found to be significantly affected. This study suggests that the locally grown carob cultivar are highly nutritious and can thus be considered as an alternative food source and alternative medicinal plant. Further, the medicinal properties of the phytochemical compounds of Cs need to be further investigated. Biography Nabaa has completed her PhD at the age of 40 years from Banha university, Egypt.
