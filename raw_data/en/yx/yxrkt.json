If you choose not to be included in the facility directory your location (unit, room number, telephone number), even your presence within the hospital, will not be given out to anyone who calls or inquires about you, including any member of the clergy. Also, no mail or flowers will be delivered to you. Upon admission, you determine what information, if any, is communicated and to whom it is given. For example, you may decide that no information is communicated to anyone, or perhaps you want to designate only one person to know about your care. You may also dictate how and where the hospital sends you written information, including follow-up appointments. If you have questions contact the Patient Relations Department at 860.972.1400 or 2.1400 from any hospital phone.advance d irectives You have the right to make healthcare decisions about the medical care you receive.

Hartford Hospital 7YoUr staY at Hartford Hospital You a re our partner in safety and Quality We want you and your family members to feel like true partners in your plan of care. Your care team wants you to feel confident to share any concerns or fears you experience. Patients that participate in their care as active partners often experience a more satisfying and successful hospital stay. Here are some ways that you can become actively involved in your care. patient safety: Keeping You safe Check Your Name braceletsCheck your name bracelet to make sure all your name and date of birth is correct. If something is incorrect or cannot be read, please tell your nurse. Your caregivers will frequently be asking you for your first and last name, as well as your date of birth. We ask you to tell us your name and date of birth and check your name bracelet to make sure that you are the correct patient prior to giving you medica - tions, drawing blood, giving you any treatment, and before taking you for a test. Colored wrist bands identify alerts Colored wrist bands are used to identify alerts on patients and reflect the standardized American Hospital Association colors: Yellow for fall risk Red for allergies Pink for limb restrictions (wristband goes on affected limb, all other bands are placed on arm opposite of affected limb) Blue for difficult airway Gray for Aspiration Precautions No Blood CBMS Patients (bloodless medicine)Medication safety In addition to your prescription medications, tell caregivers about all of the medications you are taking, including vitamins, over-the-counter drugs (aspirin , antacids, pain relievers, etc.) and herbal supplements or \"natural\" products. These can all have unwanted effects when combined with medications or anesthesia. Familiarize yoursel f with the name, color, size and dosages of the medications you are taking in the hospital. Ask questions about why you are on them, if there are any side-effects, and if there are any foods or activities you should avoid while on the medication. If you do not recognize a medication, question the nurse. Make sure staff checks your identifi - cation bracelet prior to giving you medications. Report any changes to your doctor or nurse Your doctor and nurse need to know about any changes in your condition or new symptoms to help make an accurate diagnosis and assist in managing any problems. If you feel that some - thing has changed in your condition, alert your caregivers. Alerting family and friends about your condition can help them advocate for you. They may also be able to alert medical staff to changes in your condition. If you feel that a caregiver has not addressed your safety concerns, please contact the nursing unit manager or the Patient Safety Office at 860.972.2625 or 2.2625 from any hospital phone.8 a Guide for p atients, f amily & Healthcare p rovidersYoUr staY at Hartford Hospital fall prevention: staying safe to prevent a fall: Wear the double-sided grip slippers or non-skid shoes when out of bed. Notify staff immediately if any fluid is spilled on the floor. Change position slowly when getting out of bed and wait a few moments before walking away from the bed or chair. Be aware of any tubes, drains, or equipment attached to your body that might cause you to trip. Do not use mobile objects such as IV poles, over-bed tables or unlocked wheelchairs to steady yourself. Request assistance with walking or getting up if you feel weak, dizzy, tired, or uncertain of your ability. Notify the staff immediately if you almost fall, but catch yourself. Your nurse assesses your risk of falling when you are admitted to the hospital and then at least daily. Fall precautions: If it is felt that you are at high risk of falling, you will be placed on the hospital's fall- prevention protocol. A triangle will be placed outside of your room and on your stretcher when in transit. A bracelet will be placed on your wrist. An exit alarm will be set. Never get up from the bed or chair without staff assistance. Call before you fall. Allow a staff member to remain with you while you are in the bathroom as this is where many serious falls occur. Never turn off your bed or chair alarm. Do not sit on the side of the bed as you may slip off; request that staff assist you to a chair instead.rest Keeping it quietOur HUSH (Help Us Support Healing) campaign was designed to keep the hospital as quiet as possible to support healing. Getting adequate rest is an important part of your recovery. We make every effort to ensure your comfort by minimizing noise. However, some unavoidable sounds that may occur include: Moving furniture/equipment LIFE STAR helicopter Emergency overhead pages Medical equipment hums, beeps or alarms Please let us know of noises that are disturbing your rest and we will try to address the source and correct the problem in a timely manner. If we cannot eliminate the noise, we will explore ways to reduce it. Feel free to ask for earplugs, an eye-masks and/or TV headphones for your comfort. Your Nutrition Patient mealsCaring Cuisine is our dining service for patients. Food and nutrition is very important to your health and healing. You will be visited each day by a food service coordinator who will help you make menu selections based on your personal preferences and the nutrition plan prescribed by your physician. You may speak to Food and Nutrition Services at 2.3663 between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. QUIET ZONEHartford Hospital is a Let's work together to help keep patient care areas quiet. H.U.S.H. Help Us Support HealingHartford Hospital 9Mobility is Medicine: Keeping You Moving Effects of extended bedrest Staying as active as possible while you are in the hospital is important to your health and function. Studies show that bed rest increases your risk for many preventable conditions such as pres - sure sores, constipation, pneumonia, blood clots and low blood pressure that can make you dizzy when you come to standing. It causes weakness and fatigue that can result in a decline in func - tion, putting you at risk of falling and making you more likely to need a rehabilitation facility upon discharge from the hospital. Progressive mobility while in the hospital To help build or maintain your strength, balance and endurance it is important that you take advantage of every opportunity to move during your hospital stay. Our staff will help you do this through our progressive mobility program: Each day your nurse or therapist will choose the level of activity that is appropriate for you and your condition. These levels may include: 0 Bedrest 1 Sitting fully upright (supported) 2 Sitting at the edge of the bed 3 Practicing standing at the side of the bed 4 Transferring to a bedside chair 5 Walking Along with your medications, tests, and treatments, mobility expectations will be included in your daily plan of care. If you need help to mobilize, you may be assisted by unit staff, rehabilitation special - ists, or trained mobility volunteers. Special equipment may be needed to help keep you and our staff safe as we help you move. We encourage you to walk with family members but only if it has been determined by staff to be safe. Lying in bed for prolonged periods can make you feel more tired and not eager to get out of bed. Small amounts of activity throughout the day are a great way to start. Each day try to do a little more. If you need help to walk do not feel like you are bothering staff by asking if someone will walk with you. Mobility is Medicine - Just as you would ask for medicine if you had a headache, look at getting up and moving as medicine for many parts of your body! Keeping You from Harm: preventing a Blood Clot Hospitalized patients are at increased risk of developing blood clots in their legs that can lead to more serious problems. Walking frequently and pumping your ankles while in bed are things you can do to improve your circulation and lessen your chance of this happening. Some patients may require compression devices that wrap around the legs and apply a gentle squeeze that helps to keep the blood in your legs moving. You can help yourself by allowing the staff to put these on your legs when recom - mended. You may also be given low-dose blood thinners to lessen the chance of blood clots forming while you are in the hospital. Your participation in this care is important. protecting Your s kin Skin injury can occur as a result of many factors associated with illness or surgery. Fortunately, you can lower your risk of skin injury by work - ing together with your care team in the following ways: While in bed, change your position (turn side to side) every 2 hours. The team will assist you if you are unable to turn on your own. While in a chair, shift your weight slightly every hour to relieve pressure. YoUr staY at Hartford Hospital 10 a Guide for p atients, f amily & Healthcare p rovidersYoUr staY at Hartford Hospital Your caregivers may also use other types of pain control like heat, ice, or assisted mobility. What works well for one person, may not work for another. So please tell us what has worked in the past for you. Your nurse will assess you to be sure your pain relief plan is working. One way to do that is to ask you about your pain intensity level, based on a 0-10 scale (see chart) , before and after an intervention for pain (such as pain medicine or an ice pack) . Please let your nurse know what your own \"comfort-function goal\" is - the number where your feel comfortable enough to function. When you feel the pain intensity is higher than your comfort-function goal, we will try to help you feel better. delirium a wareness Delirium is an abrupt change in thinking and is common during hospitalization especially for individuals with the following risk factors: age 65 or older dementia, stroke or head injury experience of delirium during previous hospitalizations a severe illness requiring ICU care. Please speak up if you or your hospitalized family member is experiencing a change in thinking or behavior. The symptoms that may occur are: thinking different from normal for that person fluctuating states of awareness (excessive sleepiness, restlessness/agitation; periods of normalcy) difficulty paying attention or focusing confusion and/or memory loss paranoia, suspiciousness or hallucinations. You know yourself best, as do the people who are closest to you. Delirium can be related to a medication reaction or new medical condition that needs attention. Once identified, your healthcare team will begin the process to deter - mine the possible causes for the change and start appropriate treatment. Our goal is to keep you safe, comfortable and functional until the delirium resolves. Pain Scale (0 - 10) 1-2 0 3-4 5-6 7-8 9-10 pain is present but does not limit activityCan do most activities with rest periodsUnable to do some activities because of painUnable to do most activities because of painUnable to do any activities because of pain All of our mattresses are made of special pressure reducing foam. You may require a special air mattress, chair cushion or heel elevation if you are at higher risk. Eat a balanced diet to maintain healthy skin and heal wounds. A barrier cream or spray and special under - pads may be used to protect your skin from urine, stool or drainage. Ask questions about your treatments and therapies so you understand them better. pain Management: Keeping You Comfortable If you are in pain or discomfort, please tell us. We want to help you to feel comfortable. Good pain control takes a partnership between you and your caregivers. Managing your pain will help you recover more quickly. We may not always be able to take all your pain away, but we usually can help to make it tolerable. Your caregivers will work with you to develop a pain relief plan. The plan may include pain medicine. Usually pain medicine is given as needed, so please ask your nurse if you feel you need it. The goal of the pain relief plan is for you to do things that will help you get better, such as taking a deep breath or going for a walk. Other goals include: chang - ing you from intravenous pain medicine to pills you can take as you transition your care from the hospital to home or a rehabilitation center. And for you to take pain medicine less often as you get better. Please tell your nurse if have any side effects from pain medicine like nausea, itching, constipation or drowsi - ness. Less medicine throughout the day, as you get better, will decrease most side effects.Hartford Hospital 11 YoUr staY at Hartford Hospital Providing patients with basic care needs can prevent some episodes of delirium. If you are visiting a patient who is at high risk for delirium there are things you can do to part - ner with the healthcare team. You can help by routinely offering food and drink if allowed, walking frequently with your loved one and keeping them involved in current events. Feel free to share with our team individual things that will help us to understand the person your loved one was prior to becom - ing ill. If your loved one is not able to speak for themselves be sure to fill out a \"Hartford Healthcare Cares About Me\" poster to help us personalize your loved one's care plan. infection p revention and Control Hand hygieneHand hygiene is the cornerstone of every infection prevention and control program. It is the first and foremost way to prevent infections, and is taken very seriously at Hartford Hospital. Every caregiver has taken a pledge to perform hand hygiene. Hand hygiene may be accomplished by using good old fashioned soap and water, or Purell\u00ae waterless hand sanitizer. All caregivers at Hartford Hospital are expected to perform hand hygiene before and after every patient encounter. Patients and visitors should also perform hand hygiene before eating, after using the bathroom or when entering or exiting the patient's room. Hand hygiene removes bacteria and viruses and prevents them from being transferred to you, your loved ones, other patients or caregivers. transmission-based precautions Certain bacteria or viruses are spread easily from person to person and are easily trans - ferred to the environment or equipment by an infected person. Depending on the type of bacteria or virus, they can be spread through the air by coughing or sneezing, by equipment or hands.When a patient is identified with one of these types of bacteria or viruses, certain precau - tions may be instituted to be sure they are not transferred to others. A sign will be posted by the entrance to the room to identify the type of protective equipment to be worn in the patient's room. It might instruct the caregiver to wear a mask, gown or gloves depending on the best way to stop the bacteria or virus from travel - ing. Hands must be washed before and after the equipment is worn. Help us stay true to our word - please remind us if we should ever forget to perform hand hygiene. If you or your family has questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call Infection Control at 860.972.0321 or 2.0321 from any hospital phone. integrative Medicine Integrative medicine is a division of the Cancer Center with hospital-wide and community services.

Hartford Hospital is an academic Medical Center Hartford Hospital is an academic medical center and major teaching affiliate of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, responsible for training the next generation of physicians. Hartford Hospital attracts top physicians who are committed to academic and medical excellence through their role as members of the hospital's teaching faculty. Keeping abreast of the latest medical developments and the most advanced technology are two benefits of our role as a respected teaching hospital. Our academic medical center prepares medi - cal graduates for practice in many accredited programs, including anesthesiology, cardiol - ogy, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pathology, pediatrics, and radiology. Graduate medical education is the final phase of training for physicians who have successfully completed medical school. Teaching hospitals are the heart of graduate medical education. Attending physicians provide supervised training and guidance for the medical school graduates, also known as resident physicians, in a hospital setting.Providing round-the-clock physician care Resident physicians, in training, function as part of the healthcare team to deliver the highest quality patient care under the supervision of practicing physician teachers. Upon your arrival, your resident physician, under the guidance of your physician, will review the history of your current illness and past medical history. A physical examination will be performed to substantiate previous findings and evaluate changes. Some of the questions and procedures may seem repeti - tive, particularly given the anxiety that comes from being hospitalized. Be assured that the resident is acting in your best interest, as an essential member of your healthcare team. Your resident physician will be in close touch with your physician to pro - vide updates on your condition. Frequently, this new information on your progress will speed your recovery. While the resident physician may not be able to answer all of your questions immediately, he or she will respond as soon as possible. Please remember that laboratory test results and consultations need to be evaluated by our attending physician, who has ultimate responsibility for your care.
