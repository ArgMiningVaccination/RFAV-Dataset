With the trademark dramatic storytelling techniques of The Planets and The Universe, Andrew Cohen and Chris Packham narrate the biography of the Earth, revealing the most epic moments from its history, from the first seconds of its existence to the arrival of its most incredible inhabitants, us. But humans take a back seat for this story as the Earth takes centre stage. We'll witness those moments where our planet's future hung in the balance in the face of massive bombardments from space, extreme changes in climate, the collision of whole continents and more, and we'll tell the story of how Earth's most incredible creations - life and intelligence - are set to have the same lasting impact on Earth's story as any meteorite or earthquake. This is the epic 4 billion year story of the place we call home.
