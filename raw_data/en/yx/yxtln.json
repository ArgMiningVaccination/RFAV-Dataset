Support for this publication provided by the John and Frances Beck Family Foundation2 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgNutrition Basics Food gives your child's body the fuel it needs for healthy body function, growth and development, and the energy to go about daily life. Providing your child with healthy foods and teaching your child healthy eating patterns can help them develop a good relationship with food that will serve them well throughout their lifetime. A HEALTHY EATING PATTERN for Children Ages 2 and Older Includes These Foods Limits These Foods A variety of vegetables Fruits, especially whole fruits Grains, especially whole grains Low-fat dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) A variety of proteins, such as seafood, lean meat, poultry (chicken, turkey), eggs, dairy, beans, peas, nuts and soy products Healthy fats, such as vegetable oil, avocado, nuts and seeds Saturated fat, trans fat Sodium (salt) Red meat Processed meats with nitrates or nitrites Added sugars, including sugary beverages Source: Based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, dietaryguidlines.gov Infants and children younger than age 2 have nutritional needs different from those of older children and adults. Discuss this with your child's pediatrician. If your child is an infant, visit www.nutrition.gov/topics/nutrition-life-stage/infants for more information. If your child is a toddler just beginning to walk, visit www.nutrition.gov/topics/nutrition-life-stage/toddlers for more information. NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 3Note for Parents of Children Receiving Cancer Treatment Cancer and cancer treatment may cause side effects that make it difficult to eat enough food to stay well-nourished. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) offers free nutrition consultations with registered dietitians who have expertise in oncology nutrition. Consultations are available to patients and caregivers of all cancer types. Visit www.LLS.org/nutrition to schedule a consultation. Building a Healthy Plate. The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate website is a useful resource to help you learn healthy eating patterns and how to build a \"healthy plate\" (meal) for your child and yourself. Visit https://www.myplate.gov/life-stages/kids for advice about what makes a healthy plate, along with games and activities for you and your family. Plant-Based Eating. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommends that at least two-thirds of the food on your plate should be plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans. Plant-based eating decreases your risk of disease by adding vitamins, minerals, fibers and phytochemicals (compounds that protect cells from damage which could lead to cancer). These may be difficult to get in adequate amounts if your meals are centered on animal protein. Use the following tips to encourage your child toward plant-based eating: Plan your child's meals around plant foods such as vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains, instead of meat and other animal products. Provide a colorful variety of vegetables and fruits to get the most nutrients. When including animal proteins (meat, poultry, seafood, eggs and dairy), opt for seafood, poultry and low-fat dairy. Limit red meat to no more than three portions or less per week. For example, a 3-year-old needs about 2 ounces of protein foods per day, so three portions of red meat equals about 6 ounces per week. When serving meat, avoid processed meats such as hot dogs, bacon and sausage. 4 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org Provide more plant proteins, such as beans, peas, lentils (legumes), and nuts and seeds. Try serving plant proteins instead of animal proteins for one or two meals a day. Nutrients. Nutrients are the substances in food that provide nourishment and support growth and healthy bodily functions. Nutrients can be divided into macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are nutrients that the body needs in large amounts and that provide the body with energy (calories). Protein, carbohydrates and fat are macronutrients. Micronutrients are nutrients the body needs in smaller amounts to support growth and healthy bodily functions. Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients. The best way for your child to get all the nutrients their body needs is by eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains and healthy fats.Q. Does my child need to take vitamins or supplements? A. Food is the best source for the vitamins and nutrients your child needs. However, during cancer treatment your child may have difficulty getting enough calcium and vitamin D, both of which are important to build strong bones. Ask your child's pediatrician or a registered dietitian if your child needs a multivitamin or some other supplement. Do not give your child any vitamins or supplements without consulting your child's pediatrician first. Some vitamins and supplements can interfere with cancer treatment.DIETITIAN TIPNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 5NUTRIENT BENEFITS FOOD SOURCES Carbohydrates Carbohydrates, (called \"carbs\" for short) provide the body with energy for physical activity. Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, beans, and some dairy products Fat Healthy fats provide energy, help the body absorb and transport vitamins, and protect organs.Vegetable oils, fatty fish, avocado, olives, seeds and nuts contain healthy fats. Note: Trans fat increases the risk of heart disease. Avoid trans fat when possible. Cakes, cookies, chips, fried foods, creamer and margarine often contain trans fat. Protein Protein acts as a \"builder.\" The body uses protein to build and repair tissues and to make hormones and enzymes that promote the body's daily functions.

Portions and Servings. A serving size is a standardized measured amount of food, such as the amount used for Nutrition Facts labels (see Understanding the Nutrition Facts Label on page 11). A portion size is the amount of food your child chooses to eat. It may be more or less than the posted \"serving size.\" Keep in mind that a toddler may only need a single serving of a food group per day. However, the serving can be split into several portions over multiple meals or snacks. For example, for a 3-year-old child, the daily recommendation may be 1 cup of vegetables per day. The child may eat 1/3 cup of cooked carrots at lunch, 1/3 cup of broccoli florets for a snack, and 1/3 cup of cooked spinach at dinner to meet the daily recommendation. Remember that recommendations are guidelines. Some days your child may eat more and other days they may eat less of certain foods, but guidelines offer good goals. Nutrition is cumulative, and your child's eating pattern over a week is more important than what they eat in a single day.

Visit the page for each food group to view the tables under the \"More About the Food Group\" heading. Keep in mind this is general guidance. Talk to your child's pediatrician and ask for a referral to a pediatric registered dietitian for personalized guidance. TEACHING HEALTHY HABITS Teaching your child to recognize and respect hunger and fullness cues helps them develop a good relationship with food and learn healthy eating patterns. Infants and toddlers are naturally good at showing hunger and fullness cues. They will cry or reach for food when hungry. When full, they will turn their heads. Respect your child's hunger cues. As your child grows, don't pressure them to \"clean their plate\" and don't restrict their intake of nutritious foods. You can teach moderation, but if your child says or shows they are hungry, offer a snack such as apple slices and peanut butter, carrots and hummus, or whole-grain crackers and cheese. Check in before and after meals to ask if your child is hungry or full to help them recognize how they feel.FOOD GROUP MYPLATE WEBPAGE ADDRESS Fruits www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/fruits Vegetables www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/vegetables Grains Proteins www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods Dairy www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/dairyNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 11Understanding the Nutrition Facts Label The Nutrition Facts label, found on all packaged foods, follows guidelines set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The label gives you information about the contents of the food in the package, which can help you make food choices for your family.

These labels do not meet the labeling requirements described in 21 CFR 101.9.) 12 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgServing Size. The top of the Nutrition Facts label tells you the serving size and the number of servings in the container or package. The serving size is not a recommendation of how much a person should eat or drink. It is a standardized measurement to make it easier to compare foods. To determine calorie or nutrient intake, be sure to consider the amount of the food actually served or actually eaten, which may be more or less than the serving size. For example, if a serving is one cup but you eat two cups, you need to double the amounts listed on the label to accurately measure what you ate. On some food products, the Nutrition Facts label may have two columns. One column shows information for a single serving. The other column shows information for the entire package. Calories. The next information on the nutrition label is the number of calories per serving. A calorie is a measurement of energy. Calorie information can help people manage their weight if they need to gain, lose, or maintain their body weight. The Nutrition Facts label is based on a 2,000 calorie- per-day diet. This is not a recommendation of how many calories an individual needs. A person's calorie needs may be either more or less than 2,000 calories. Young children may need less than 2,000 calories. However, teenagers may need more calories as their body goes through puberty. Children undergoing cancer treatment may need to consume more calories to give their body the energy it needs to recover from treatment. The number of calories a child needs each day depends on a lot of factors including: Sex Age Physical activity level Nutritional needs Q. How do I know if my child is a healthy weight? A. Children's weight and height are often plotted on a growth chart that compares the weight and height of children of the same age and sex. Pediatricians use this growth chart to help determine if your child is growing at a healthy rate. Children grow at different rates, so your child's growth over time is a better indicator of health than their weight or height at any given time. Talk to your child's pediatrician if you are concerned about your child's weight. Ask for a referral to a pediatric registered dietitian for personalized nutrition recommendations for your child.DIETITIAN TIPNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 13Ask your child's pediatrician or a registered dietitian for a daily calorie goal based on your child's specific needs. Calories are not the only important information on the Nutrition Facts label. The nutrient information is important too. A food that is high in calories may be a healthful food choice as long as it is also high in the nutrients your child needs. Nutrients and % Daily Value (DV). Based on a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet, the percent (%) Daily Value tells you the percentage of the recommended daily intake for each nutrient. For example, a food with 5% of the Daily Value of fiber provides 5% of the total fiber that a person consuming 2,000 calories a day should aim to eat each day. The amount your child needs of a specific nutrient may be either more or less than the recommended Daily Value. Ask your child's pediatrician or registered dietitian for guidance. Even if your child's nutritional needs are different from those shown on the Nutrition Facts label, you can still use the % Daily Value to determine whether a serving of a food is high or low in a nutrient. A low % Daily Value is 5% or less. Choose foods that are low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, added sugar, and sodium. Aim to eat less than 100% of the Daily Value for these nutrients each day. A high % Daily Value is 20% or more. Choose foods that are high in dietary fiber, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium. Aim to eat 100% of the Daily Value or more of these nutrients each day. Nutrients Without % Daily Values. The % Daily Values that are not listed on the label, those for trans fat and total sugars, for example, are not listed because there are no recommendations for the amount to eat per day. Aim to keep your child's intake of trans fats as low as possible. Trans fats are linked to increased risk of heart disease. Foods that may contain trans fats include baked goods, chips, fried foods, creamer, and margarine. Aim to keep your child's daily intake of added sugar below 25 grams (or 6 teaspoons), as recommended by the American Heart Association. Children younger than age 2 should not be given food with added sugar. Examples of foods that contain added 14 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgsugar include syrups and honey, sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, cookies, pies, dairy desserts, milk products, and sugar-sweetened cereals. For protein, a listed % Daily Value is only required if the food claims to be high in protein. Your child's protein needs will increase as they age. Factors such as sex, activity level and illness also affect their protein needs. Visit www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods for daily recommendations of protein foods by age. Children in cancer treatment may need more protein. Ask a pediatric registered dietitian for a more specific recommendation, if needed. Teaching Your Child Healthy Eating and Lifestyle Habits Children develop eating habits early in life and carry these habits into adulthood. All children can learn how to make healthful food choices. You can use the following strategies to teach your children healthy eating habits: Be a role model. Let your child see you eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and lean proteins. Introduce foods again, again and again. If your child does not like a certain food the first time you serve it, try again. Children may need to try a food many times before they enjoy it. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests that it may take up to 15 tries before a child accepts a new food. {However, do not force your child to eat specific foods. There are probably some foods that they do not like, and that's okay! Try to find foods in each food group that your child does enjoy. Encourage a colorful plate. Children often gravitate toward high-carbohydrate, starchy, or bland foods, Q. Should I make my child clean their plate? A. You may have heard when you were growing up that you should always finish all the food on your plate. You may be tempted to tell your child the same thing, but pressuring children to eat all the food on their plate does not improve their health or habits. Similarly, banning certain foods or labeling certain foods as \"bad\" also does not improve children's health or habits.* Children benefit most from learning to listen to their own body's hunger cues, eating when hungry and stopping once satisfied. Moderation and making nutritious food choices are much more beneficial than overconsumption or restriction. *Children with food allergies do need to learn to recognize and avoid foods that could cause an allergic reaction. DIETITIAN TIPNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 15such as chicken nuggets, macaroni, French fries and bread. Teach your child to eat a \"rainbow\" of foods\u2014not just brown or tan ones. Eating a variety of different colored fruits and vegetables is a good way to get many different healthy nutrients. Add extra vegetables to dishes your child already enjoys to increase their intake. For example, add chopped mushrooms, zucchini or carrots to spaghetti. Another option is to add pureed vegetables to different dishes. If you add pureed vegetables to a dish, include your child in food preparation and offer the same vegetables prepared whole or chopped on the side in case your child decides to try them. Make fruits and vegetables available. Leave whole fruits like apples or bananas out on a counter in a bowl for anyone to eat any time. Keep cut-up fruits and veggies in the fridge. If healthy snacks are readily available, it is more likely your child will eat them. Avoid buying packaged, processed snacks such as cookies, chips and candy. If they are available, your child will eat them and ignore other more nutritional options. Avoid using food as a reward. Foods used as rewards are typically candy or other desserts. These items often have little nutritional value and may take the place of other foods with more nutritional value, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and proteins. Use stickers or verbal praise to reward your child instead of food or candy. See Relationship with Food and Body Image on page 19. Eating meals together as a family is a valuable way to teach your child healthy eating and lifestyle habits. See Mealtimes on page 34. Hydration. Staying well-hydrated supports healthy body function and improves mood and energy. Children 1-3 years old need about 4 cups of fluid, preferably water, daily. Children 4-8 years old need about 5 cups of fluid daily. Older children and teens need about 7-8 cups of fluid daily. Your child's fluid needs can change based on their health and activity level. When it's hot outside, your child may need more water. Ask their pediatrician for a specific daily fluid goal. Q. What are sugar- sweetened beverages (SSB)? A. Sugar-sweetened beverages are drinks with added sugar. Companies market many beverages with added sugars to parents and children. These are often branded as \"fruit drinks\" or \"sport drinks.\" Sweetened teas, coffees, soda and energy drinks are also examples of SSBs. Check the Nutrition Facts label on your child's beverages and avoid those with added sugars. These drinks are also often high in calories with little nutritional benefit. DIETITIAN TIP16 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgFollow these tips to keep your child hydrated: Provide fluids for your child throughout the day instead of waiting until they are thirsty. Keep a cup or bottle of water in your child's sight at all times to remind them to drink. If your child does not like plain water, try sparkling water, flavored water, adding berries or slices of lemon, cucumbers or lime to water, or mixing water with a splash of 100% fruit juice. Food contains some fluid as well, but only fluids that are liquid at room temperature, such as popsicles, count toward your hydration goal. Soups are liquid at room temperature, but many soups contain a lot of salt. While fruit juice can be part of a balanced diet, it is not the best source of hydration. Fruit juice is not only high in calories, it also does not have the fiber of whole fruit. Encourage your child to eat whole fruits and follow these recommendations for 100% fruit juice: Source: American Academy of Pediatrics, https://www.aap.org Mouth Care. The mouth is the first place where food begins to turn into fuel. Teach your child good mouth care. Teach your child to brush their teeth at least twice a day, using a toothbrush with soft bristles and toothpaste. Brush for two minutes and make sure to brush every tooth. Gently floss teeth daily. You may need to help younger children floss. Take your child to the dentist for a checkup and cleaning at least once a year. Ask your child's dentist for specific recommendations for brushing, flossing and other aspects of mouth care. AGE DAILY RECOMMENDATION OF 100% FRUIT JUICE <1 year Do not provide juice unless your child's pediatrician recommends it. 1-3 years Limit juice to 4 ounces 4-6 years Limit juice to 4-6 ounces 7-18 years Limit juice to 8 ounces NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 17 Teach your child to avoid tobacco products. Tobacco products can cause gum disease and tooth loss. If your child is receiving cancer treatment, do the following: Before beginning any dental work, check with the members of the child's cancer healthcare team first. Dental work may not be safe for your child during cancer treatment, or extra precautions may be needed if dental work is necessary, especially if your child's blood counts are low. Ask your child's oncologist if it is okay for your child to floss. Low blood cell counts can increase the risk of infection and/or bleeding. If your child has braces, ask the oncologist if the braces need to be removed for a time during cancer treatment, to reduce the risk of infection. Find more information and resources about childhood dental care at www.mouthhealthy.org, a website of the American Dental Association. 18 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgExercise. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children age 6 and older have at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day. Active play is the best form of exercise. Active play may include jumping rope, riding a bicycle, swimming, dancing, playing at a playground and/or playing an organized sport. Y our child does not have to get the 60 minutes at one time. Activity can be broken up throughout the day. For example, 10 minutes walking to school, 20 minutes playing tag at recess, and 30 minutes at a martial arts class, would add up to 60 minutes for the day. Source: American Academy of Pediatrics, https://www.aap.org/ . The benefits of physical activity for children include: Reduced risk of diseases such as heart disease and diabetes Better growth, development and wellbeing Stronger mental health and self-esteem Improved focus at school Learning teamwork and sportsmanship in organized sports for all ages, and reduced smoking, drinking and drug use among teens in team sports Parents: playing with your children can also help you get your own recommended amount of physical activity! If your child has mobility difficulties, talk to your child's pediatrician about appropriate exercises. You can also ask for a referral to a physical therapist. AGE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 6-17 years60 minutes of physical activity every day, including muscle- and bone- strengthening activities at least 3 days a week 3-5 years 180 minutes of physical activity every day Toddlers 180 minutes of walking or unstructured free play Infants Interactive floor-based play several times a dayNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 19Relationship with Food and Body Image Many people have a complicated relationship with their body and with food. Often these complicated relationships begin in childhood. Modeling healthy behaviors is a wonderful way to help your child develop a healthy relationship with food and form a positive body image. Be conscious of how you talk about your own body in front of your child. Do not criticize your own body or others' bodies in front of your child. Do not criticize your child's body. Body size or appearance is not reflective of a person's character or worth. {If you hear your child criticize someone else's body, correct the behavior. {If you hear your child say something negative about their own body, ask \"Would you say or think something like that about a friend?\" Help your child learn to treat and think about themselves in the same way they would talk to or about someone they love. Monitor the media your child consumes. Encourage your child to avoid looking at images online and in magazines that make them feel bad about their own body or appearance. Be aware of the way you talk about food around your children. Eating broccoli doesn't make someone a good person. Eating candy doesn't make someone a bad person. This may seem obvious, but people often describe foods using words such as \"good,\" \"bad,\" \"clean,\" or \"sinful.\" There are no good or bad foods. Some foods may do a better job of fueling the body or providing the body with more nutrients than other foods. However, food choices do not reflect a person's character. Think about your own relationship with your body and food. If you struggle with your body image, you may find it helpful to speak to a therapist to work through your feelings. Ask your primary care doctor or health insurance provider for a referral to a therapist.20 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgEating Disorders. When children reach their preteen or teenage years, they often become more aware of their bodies. They may feel pressured to look a certain way or be a certain size. To achieve this, they may even try trendy diets, pills or supplements, excessive exercising, or other dangerous techniques to change their body. Visit the National Eating Disorders Association website at www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/warning-signs-and-symptoms to learn the warning signs and symptoms for an eating disorder. Remember that people of all body sizes can struggle with eating disorders. If you suspect your child is struggling with an eating disorder, talk to your child's pediatrician. Ask for a referral to a registered dietitian and/or therapist who specializes in eating disorders. NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 21Meal Planning Busy schedules and tight budgets may make it difficult to prepare nutritious meals. By meal planning, you can create healthy and balanced meals that are easy to prepare and budget-friendly. Follow these tips for meal planning: Plan ahead. As you plan your menu for the week, write down any groceries you will need to prepare each meal so you will only have to go to the grocery store once, and while there, don't buy foods you don't need. \"Shop\" your own pantry. Do not forget about the foods you already have at home. Do not let food go to waste by letting it expire before you use it. Before you go food shopping, check the expiration dates of the foods that you may already have. Keep it simple. You do not need to prepare a four- course meal for every dinner. In fact, you may not even need to cook at all. Visit www.pearlpoint.org/MealAndSnackIdeas for easy-to-make meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with minimal cooking required. Remember leftovers. Think about what food you will have left over after preparing a meal. Can you use that food for your next meal? For example, if you have roasted chicken for dinner, you could use the leftover chicken to make chicken soup or a sliced chicken sandwich for lunch the next day. This saves you money and time preparing food. Note\u2014leftovers can be safely stored in a sealed container in a refrigerator for about 2 to 4 days. See Leftovers on page 36 for more information. Use the Meal Planning Worksheet on page 38 and see the sample Grocery List on page 39 to get organized.TEACHING HEALTHY HABITS When planning a meal, try to choose dishes that everyone enjoys, but do not fall into the trap of being a short-order cook for your child by preparing completely separate meals just for them. Include your family by asking for their input. For example, would they prefer green beans or broccoli as a side dish? (Bear in mind that if your child has special dietary needs or food allergies, separate meals or dishes may be necessary.)22 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgLLS Health ManagerTM App. With LLS Health ManagerTM, you can use your phone to manage your child's daily health by tracking side effects, medication, food and hydration, questions for the doctor, grocery lists and more. You can also set up reminders to take medications and to eat and hydrate throughout the day. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager to download this free app. School Lunches. Healthy, satisfying lunches help fuel your child through afternoon classes, soccer practice, ballet class, piano lessons and other activities. Lunches prepared by your child's school can be a nutritious and inexpensive option. School lunches can provide hot meals and cold milk that are difficult to keep fresh for hours in a lunch box. NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 23 {Does your child qualify for free lunch? Ask the school administrator or visit https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp to learn more. If you do pack your child's lunch, let your child help plan those lunches. If kids help, they may be more likely to eat their lunch. Pack lunches safely. Use a soft, insulated lunch bag with an ice pack or frozen juice box to keep cold foods cold. The juice will thaw out and be ready to drink by lunchtime. Keep the bag out of direct sunlight. After school, wipe out the bag with a disinfecting wipe. Make lunchtime fun with colorful reusable food storage bags and containers. Include a note, a joke, a sticker or other little surprise for your child in the lunchbox. You can also use cookie cutters on sandwiches to make them into cool shapes. Some easy lunch ideas include sandwiches, wraps, fruit kabobs, raw veggies (carrots, cucumber, cherry tomatoes) and dipping sauce or hummus, yogurt, and crackers with cheese. Consider including a snack for after school if your child will be going to an activity or after-school program before coming home. Grocery Shopping Use the following tips to help you stock your pantry, refrigerator and freezer with nutritious foods. Shop with a List. Make copies of a standardized grocery list, which includes perishables, such as milk and bread. Add to it each week. Check your pantry, fridge and freezer to make sure you do not already have these items. Organize the list by the layout of your store so you can go through the store once without backtracking. See sample Grocery List on page 39.TEACHING HEALTHY HABITS Take your child with you to the grocery store occasionally. Allow them to select a new fruit or vegetable. By allowing your child to pick some items, they may be more likely to try a new food and might even enjoy it. 24 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgShop Safely. To keep your foods fresh and reduce the risk of foodborne illness, (see Food Safety and Risk of Foodborne Illness on page 26 for more information), follow these guidelines: Keep cold foods cold. When buying refrigerated or frozen foods, take steps to keep the foods at a safe temperature until you are able to put them in your own refrigerator or freezer. {Shop when the temperature outside is cooler (earlier in the day, for example). {Bring a cooler for cold food. {Choose room temperature items first. Pick out cold and frozen foods right before you pay. Check the \"sell by\" or \"use by\" date on products. Do not buy products with damaged packages or dented cans. Keep produce away from raw meat, poultry and seafood in your cart and bags. Wash reusable grocery bags regularly by wiping them down with disinfecting wipes. Shop Frugally. Use the following strategies to find discounts and ways to save money: Use coupons. Look online and in the newspaper for coupons. Check to see if your grocery store offers a loyalty program or coupons through a mobile app. Some brand- name specialty products can be costly, so visit the product's website for coupons, or contact the manufacturer. Ask for a rain check. Items on sale may sell out quickly. If this happens to you, ask for a rain check, usually available at the Customer Service counter. Some stores will allow you to purchase the item at the sale price once it is back in stock, even if the promotion has ended if you get a rain check at the time of the promotion. Check the top and bottom shelves. More expensive items tend to be on the middle shelves at (your) eye level. Compare these items with similar products on the top and bottom shelves. Buy generic to save money. (\"Generic\" foods are non-brand or store-brand items vs. big-name items.) Compare ingredients and the Nutrition Facts label to find similar products at a lower cost. Shop for seasonal produce (fruits and vegetables). Seasonal produce provides great nutrition and taste and is typically more budget-friendly than foods that are not in NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 25season.

LLS Health ManagerTM App. With LLS Health ManagerTM, you can use your phone to manage your child's daily health by tracking side effects, medication, food and hydration, questions for the doctor, grocery lists and more. You can also set up reminders to take medications and to eat and drink throughout the day. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager to download this free app. Shop in New Ways. There are ways to get your groceries without a typical trip to the grocery store. Try these other ways to shop: Check out food pickup and delivery services. Many grocery stores now offer pickup and/or delivery services. You send a list to the store ahead of time. A store employee then puts together your grocery order. Once your groceries are ready, you go to the store, and an employee loads them into your car. Some online retailers also offer food delivery services to your home. Ask if your grocery store offers nutrition services. Some stores offer complimentary nutrition services, such as consultations with a dietitian, supermarket tours and cooking classes. Visit farmers' markets. For local, fresh fruits and vegetables, find out of there is farmers' market in your town or nearby. Sometimes they are only open on one day of the week. Visit www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets for more information and to find one in your area. Join a Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. A CSA program gives you the opportunity to pay a local farm ahead of time for your share of produce. The farm gives you a box of fruits and vegetables at set intervals, usually weekly. Some CSAs also provide eggs, meat, or other farm products. Visit www.localharvest.org/csa for more information and to find a CSA in your area.26 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgFood Safety and Risk of Illness What is Foodborne Illness? Foodborne illness (\"food poisoning\") is any illness that results from eating contaminated food. Foodborne illness is most commonly caused by bacteria and viruses. The signs and symptoms of foodborne illness range from mild to severe and can include upset stomach, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Who is at Risk for Foodborne Illness? Anyone can get a foodborne illness, but some are more likely than others to become seriously ill. This includes children younger than 5 years old and children whose immune systems are weakened due to illness (such as cancer) or medical treatment. What Should You Do if You Suspect You or Your Child has a Foodborne Illness? Contact your primary care provider (PCP), your child's pediatrician or, if your child is receiving cancer treatment, their oncologist. Mark any recently eaten food or beverages as \"do not eat.\" Keep the containers in the fridge in case the healthcare team wants to test any of the potentially contaminated food. If you or your child experience vomiting or diarrhea, be sure to drink plenty of clear liquids (water, ginger ale, sports drinks, or electrolyte replacement drinks) to stay well-hydrated by replacing lost fluids. Do not take any anti-nausea or antidiarrheal medications without checking with a doctor. How Can I Protect Myself and my Family From Foodborne Illness? Practicing good food safety is the best way to decrease the risk of foodborne illness. The four main steps of food safety are illustrated below. CLEAN WASH YOUR HANDS AND SURFACES OFTEN.SEPARATE DON'T CROSS- CONTAMINATE.COOK TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE.CHILL REFRIGERATE PROMPTLY. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/keep-food-safe.htmlNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 27When preparing, eating and storing food, always follow these food safety guidelines. Wash your hands well, both before and after handling food. Wash your hands with running water and soap for at least 20 seconds. Do not forget to scrub fingernails and the backs of your hands. Disinfect food preparation surfaces both before and after cooking. Use an antibacterial kitchen cleaner and paper towels or bleach wipes. Wash or replace dish towels or sponges frequently. Keep raw and cooked foods separate. Do not reuse any utensils, cutting boards, plates or dishes once they have been touched by raw meat or eggs. Utensils, cutting boards, plates and dishes that have been used for preparing raw meats or eggs should be washed in hot, soapy water. Wash fruits and vegetables before peeling, cutting, or eating them. Rinse fresh produce under running water and rub gently to remove any dirt. (There is no need to use soap or a special wash.) Remove and throw away the outermost leaves of fresh produce such as lettuce and cabbage. Thaw foods safely. Do not thaw food at room temperature. Thaw in the refrigerator, soak in cold water, or thaw in the microwave. Once thawed in the refrigerator, ground meat, poultry and seafood should be cooked within 1-2 days. Red meat cuts should be cooked within 3-5 days. Food thawed by soaking in cold water or in the microwave should be cooked immediately. Cook food thoroughly and cook meats to the proper temperature. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature (see chart on page 28). Always store cold foods and leftovers as soon as possible or at least within 2 hours of purchasing or cooking. Label food (use a marker or pen) with a \"use by\" date if the packaging does not have an expiration date. Food in opened packages will go bad faster than foods in sealed packages. Visit www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts for guidelines by type of food. If you are unsure if something is safe to eat, remember, WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT. See Leftovers on page 36 for more information.

Persons who are not at high risk for food poisoning usually do not need to avoid the following foods, but it is good to be aware of them. Children who are at an increased risk for foodborne illness (cancer patients, for example) may be advised by their healthcare team to avoid these foods. High-risk foods include: Raw seafood dishes, such as sushi, sashimi or ceviche Runny or raw eggs, including foods that contain raw egg, such as cookie dough Unpasteurized beverages, such as unpasteurized juice or raw milk Soft mold-ripened cheeses and blue-veined cheeses, such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and blue cheese, or other soft unpasteurized cheeses {You may be able to find pasteurized versions of these cheeses; check the labels Raw sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts Ask the healthcare team for additional food safety guidelines if your child is immunosuppressed. For nutrition information for people receiving treatment, visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Food and Nutrition Facts. How Can I Teach my Young Children About Food Safety? Explain to your child the importance of food safety and the risk of illness. Here are simple things you can teach your child about food safety: Teach your children to wash their hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds by counting to 20 slowly or singing the ABC song while washing. Your children should wash their hands frequently, especially before eating, after using the bathroom, and after playing with pets or playing outside. Remind your child to keep food on the plate. Don't put food or snacks on surfaces such as counters, tables and floors that may be dirty. Even if it looks clean, it may not be. Always use clean plates and napkins. Tell your child to rinse fruits and veggies with water before eating. Rinsing fruits and vegetables helps remove any remaining dirt or germs. Give your children instructions on how to safely store food, such as always closing lids tightly or sealing bags. Do not leave any foods uncovered or out in the open. 30 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. org Let your child know where specific foods belong in your kitchen. For example, which foods need to go in the refrigerator and which foods go in the freezer. Remind your child to not leave cold foods or cooked foods out for longer than two hours and always be sure to completely shut the refrigerator and freezer doors. Teach your child that if something has a bad smell or has been in the refrigerator or pantry for a long time, it may not be safe to eat. Tell them to check the expiration date or ask an adult to check it for them. Also tell them that if they are unsure about a food, they should not eat it. \"When in doubt, throw it out.\" Even foods that don't look, taste, or smell bad can contain harmful bacteria. Tell your child not to eat chicken or ground beef that is still pink inside. The only way to know for sure if meat is cooked safely is to measure its internal temperature with a meat thermometer. However, if \"cooked\" meat still looks pink inside, it is possibly undercooked and unsafe to eat. Do not let your child eat raw cookie dough or other foods that may contain raw eggs. Visit www.fightbac.org/kidsfoodsafety to access the Partnership for Food Safety Education's Fight BAC!\u00ae for Kids, which offers resources including coloring and activity pages, to help kids learn about food safety. Food Allergies. A food allergy is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical condition in which your immune system overreacts to a typically harmless food. Food allergy reactions can range from mild to severe. Food allergies may start in childhood or later in adulthood. It is important that food allergies be confirmed by an allergist, a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies. After a food allergy diagnosis, it is vital to work with your child's healthcare team to learn how to protect your child and manage the allergy. Visit Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) at www.foodallergy.org for more information. Q. How can I reduce the risk of choking? A. Young children under the age of 4 are at a high risk of choking while eating. Before it happens, ask your doctor what to do if your child appears to be really choking. Meanwhile, take these steps to reduce your child's risk: Cut food into small pieces. Serve soft foods that are easy to chew and swallow. Supervise children during meals and snacks. Remove bones from fish, chicken and meat. Allow and encourage children to take their time while eating. Allow children to eat only when sitting upright. DIETITIAN TIPNUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 31 Cooking Cooking at home can help you save money and eat in healthier ways. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when cooking at home: Choose Healthier Cooking Methods. Prepare food by baking, slow-cooking, grilling, or broiling to limit fat. Avoid fried and greasy foods. Remember that not all fats are created equal. Your body needs some fat. Choose healthy fats, such as olive oil/canola oil, avocados, nuts and seeds. Pick Plant-Based Options. Swap out meat and other animal products for plant- based proteins. For example, Try sliced tofu in place of chicken. Use chopped mushrooms or cooked lentils in place of ground meat. You can also make a mixture of part ground meat and part mushrooms or lentils. Black beans, jackfruit and chickpeas are also good replacements for meat in a variety of dishes such as burgers and chili. Jackfruit can also be used in place of shredded meat, such as barbequed pulled pork.32 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgTry to build your meals around fruits, vegetables and beans instead of meat. Stock Up on Pantry Staples. Some items you will need for many dishes. For example, seasonings, cooking oil, low-sodium broth, and whole-grain brown rice are staples. See the sample Grocery List on page 39 to build a well-stocked pantry. Check Spices. Taste your food before serving to see if you need to add more seasoning. Typically, seasonings in recipes are just suggestions, so you can adjust them to your tastes. Remember that you can always add more spice or salt, but you cannot take it out. Food Safety Warning\u2014Do not taste dishes containing meat, poultry, fish, or seafood until the food has reached a safe internal temperature. See chart on page 28. Save Time. Cooking can be time-consuming, but everything does not need to be made from scratch. Here are a few ideas to save you time in the kitchen. Chop vegetables for multiple meals at one time. Save chopped veggies in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Search online for one-pot recipes to save on cleanup time. Use premade sauces and dressings. Check the labels for added sugar and sodium, and if you see high numbers, choose healthier options. Use frozen vegetable mixes as meal starters for dishes such as stir fries, soups or casseroles. Try microwavable brown rice for a quick and easy serving of whole grains. Use cooked rotisserie chicken as a source of protein in several dishes.TEACHING HEALTHY HABITS Let your children, at appropriate ages, help with grocery shopping, food preparation and meal planning. For example, let younger children pick out the produce at the store. Let older children help stir pots or measure spices. Your child will learn important life skills and gain a new appreciation for food. Picky eaters may even be more likely to try a new food if they have helped to prepare it.NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 33Manage Salt Content. Be aware of the salt content of your foods by reading the sodium content on the Nutrition Facts label. Source: Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025, dietaryguidelines.gov *The American Heart Association recommends adults move toward an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day. When cooking, some of your ingredients may already contain salt, so you may not need to add more. Here are more ways to lower your sodium intake: Limit or avoid smoked or cured foods, such as sausage, bacon and hot dogs. When buying canned items, look for \"no salt added\" or \"low-sodium\" on the label. {You can also rinse canned vegetables before cooking to remove added salt. Avoid flavored rice and noodles. Prepare plain rice and noodles and season them yourself. Avoid frozen vegetables that are pre-seasoned or have a sauce. Look for sodium-free seasoning mixes to try on meats and vegetables. Avoid processed foods and fast food, which are almost always high in salt. Choose Healthier Cooking Oil. The American Heart Association recommends choosing oils with less than 4 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon and no partially hydrogenated oils or trans fats. This includes the following budget-friendly oils: canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower. Blends of these oils are often called \"vegetable oil.\" Other oils like avocado or sesame oil can be healthy options, but they may be higher in price. Cooking sprays made with these oils are also a good choice. Reduce Added Sugar. As a general rule, sugar in most recipes can be decreased by 25 percent without greatly affecting taste or texture. For most baked desserts, AGE DAILY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SODIUM INTAKE 2-3 years Limit to 1,200 mg 4-8 years Limit to 1,500 mg 9-13 years Limit to 1,800 mg 14-18 years Limit to 2,300 mg*34 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgyou can use 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of 1 cup of sugar. If making this type of swap, reduce the amount of other liquids used in the recipe. Some people use no-calorie sugar substitutes made with stevia (extracted from the leaves of the stevia plant) or artificial sweeteners as an alternative to added sugars. There are concerns that artificial sweeteners, which include sucralose (Splenda\u00ae), saccharine (Sweet 'N Low\u00ae) and aspartame (Equal\u00ae), are linked to cancer. According to the the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is no strong evidence that links artificial sweeteners to cancer in people. Additionally, it is also unclear whether beverages with artificial sweeteners support weight loss. It is important to remember that sweeteners like agave, brown rice syrup, coconut sugar, honey, maple syrup, and molasses all add calories, just like refined white sugar or high- fructose corn syrup. Try New Recipes. You can find recipes in many ways. Ask family and friends for their favorite dishes. Check out cookbooks from your library. There are many recipes online; here are a few websites to start your search: American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR): www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/recipes/ Cook for Your Life: https://www.cookforyourlife.org/recipes/ (Filter Nutrition Services: www.pearlpoint.org/recipes Mealtimes Making healthy food choices is about more than just consuming food; it is also about enjoying food. Food brings people together, so try to make mealtimes enjoyable and fun for yourself and your family. Here are some tips: Sit down and eat as a family. Make regularly scheduled mealtimes a family priority. Eat at the table instead of sitting on the couch or in separate rooms. Put away electronic devices (mobile phones and tablets). Turn off the TV. Eat without distractions so you all can enjoy your food.NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 35 Encourage pleasant conversation while you eat.

Eating at Restaurants. Eating in a healthy way does not mean you cannot dine out and enjoy your favorite restaurants with your family. Moderation is key. Here are a few things to keep in mind when eating at restaurants: Check restaurant websites to look up the nutritional information of menu items beforehand. A little research before ordering can help you make healthy meal choices. Restaurant portions are often large. Pack half of the meal in a \"to-go\" box before eating, to limit the portion size. Be adventurous; try restaurants that serve foods that your children usually do not eat at home. Try the cuisine from another country or culture or order a vegetarian or vegan dish. Your child may find a new favorite dish that you can try to make at home. 36 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgLeftovers Leftovers are a great way to save time and money and cut down on food waste. When planning your meal in advance, remember to incorporate leftovers throughout the week. Follow these food safety guidelines for storing and reheating leftovers. Store Leftovers Safely. If you plan to make meals in advance or to use leftovers, make sure you store foods safely. Pack and refrigerate or freeze leftovers within 2 hours of cooking or sooner if possible. (Store foods within 1 hour if the outside temperature is above 90 \u00b0F.) Eat or discard refrigerated leftovers within 2 to 4 days or frozen leftovers within 3 to 4 months. Frozen foods will stay safe for a longer time, but they can lose moisture and flavor. If you are not sure whether something is safe to eat, remember, WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT. Label food (use a marker or pen) with a \"use by\" date if the packaging does not have an expiration date on it. Food in opened packages goes bad more quickly than foods in sealed packages. Visit www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts for more guidelines. Put foods with the soonest expiration date at the front of the fridge or shelves so that you will be more likely to use them. NUTRITION HANDBOOK FOR PARENTS l 37Reheat Leftovers Safely. Just as when you prepare a meal the first time, you need to practice good food safety when reheating leftovers to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. You can reheat frozen leftovers without thawing; however, it will take longer to heat the food all the way through to a safe internal temperature. Do not thaw food at room temperature. Thaw in the refrigerator, under cold water, or in the microwave. When reheating leftovers, be sure they reach 165\u00b0F as measured with a food thermometer. Check the temperature of the food in several places in case of cold spots. You can buy food thermometers in grocery stores. Reheat sauces, soups and gravies by bringing them to a rolling boil. Cover leftovers to reheat. This retains moisture and ensures that food is heated all the way through. When reheating in the microwave, cover and rotate the food for even heating. Check the temperature before serving hot foods to your child to avoid burns. Younger children will probably not check foods before touching them or putting them in their mouths. 38 l 800.955.4572 www .LLS. orgMeal Planning Worksheet Meal planning in advance is a great way to include a variety of healthy foods in your family's menus each week. A written meal plan can also remind you of leftovers to use for lunches or snacks later in the week. It takes the guesswork out of mealtimes.

It makes a good, quick lunch, or you can serve it with a salad for dinner. You can add any type of beans or fresh vegetables you like to the filling. Prep Time: 15 mins Total Time: 15 mins Servings: 2 servings KITCHEN GEAR Large plate Measuring cup Grater Measuring spoons Skillet Heatproof spatula Pot holders Serving plate INGREDIENTS 2 (10-inch) whole-grain tortillas 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Mexican-blend cheese 2 teaspoons vegetable oil Salsa, hot sauce, and/or plain yogurt for serving (if you like)INSTRUCTIONS 1. Put one tortilla on the large plate and sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded cheese over half of it. Try not to get the cheese too close to the edge of the tortilla. 2. Fold the tortilla over to make a half-moon shape. 3. Put the skillet on the stove and turn the heat to medium. When the skillet is hot, add 1 teaspoon oil. 4. Carefully, add the filled tortilla to the hot skillet and cook until the bottom is lightly browned and the cheese is gooey, about 2 minutes. Using the spatula, turn the tortilla over and cook another 2 minutes. Move the cooked tortilla to the serving plate. 5. Repeat with the remaining tortilla, cheese, and oil. Serve right away. FANCY THAT! Add any or all of these (1/4 cup total) to each tortilla when you add the cheese: Canned or cooked black beans Corn kernels Diced tomatoes or bell peppers Sliced or shredded cooked chicken Leftover cooked zucchini, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, or potatoes Baby spinach or kale www.LLS.org Reprinted with permission from the ChopChop Family, www.chopchopfamily.orgOATMEAL WITH FRESH FRUITBLACK BEAN CHILI If you've never had meatless chili before, you might be surprised by how incredibly good it is. The black beans make it dark and satisfying, and the spices add all that just-right chili flavor. Serve it as a baked potato topping, or in bowls with toppings of its own. (Kids Advisory Board member Chananya amps up the heat with a pinch of cayenne pepper.) Prep Time: 30 mins Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins Servings: 6 servings KITCHEN GEAR Cutting board Sharp knife (adult needed) Measuring cups Measuring spoons Large pot with lid Heatproof spatula Can opener Colander or strainer Pot holders INGREDIENTS 1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil 1 large onion, peeled and chopped 1 red bell pepper(any color), seeded and diced 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder) 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon chili powder 3 (15-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed 2 (15-ounce) cans diced tomatoes with their juice 3 cups cups water, plus more as needed 1 bay leaf SaltINSTRUCTIONS 1. Put the pot on the stove, turn the heat to medium-high, and add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and spices, cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are just getting soft, about 10 minutes. Stir the vegetables occasionally as they're cooking. 2. Turn the heat up to high, add the black beans, tomatoes and their juice, water, and bay leaf and bring to a boil (you'll know it's boiling when you see bubbles breaking at the surface). 3. Lower the heat to low and cook, partially covered (with the lid not quite all the way on) and stirring occasionally, until the beans are very soft and the chili has thickened, about 1 hour. If the chili gets too thick or starts sticking before it's done, add a little more water. Taste the chili. Does it need a pinch of salt or any more seasonings? Add it and taste again. 4. Fish out the bay leaf and throw it away. Serve right away with any or all of the toppings. FOR TOPPING Chopped fresh cilantro leaves Shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese Chopped scallions or red onions Sliced pickled jalapenos Diced bell pepper (any color) Plain yogurt or sour cream Lime wedges for squeezing www.LLS.orgCURRIED TOFU FINGERS The biggest tofu myth is that it has no taste. It quickly takes on the most delicious flavors. Serve this dish plain or with mango chutney* mixed with yogurt. Prep Time: 20 mins Total Time: 1 hr 10 mins Servings: 4 servings KITCHEN GEAR Cutting board Sharp knife (adult needed) Clean dish towel or paper towels Measuring spoons Baking pan with sides INGREDIENTS 1 (14-ounce) container firm or extra firm tofu 2 teaspoons canola oil 2 teaspoons sweet curry powder (or hot curry powder, if you like spicy) 1/2 teaspoon saltINSTRUCTIONS 1. Turn the oven on and set the heat to 450 degrees. 2. To drain the liquid** from the tofu, put a dish towel or 2 layers of paper towels on the cutting board, and put the tofu on top. Let it drain at least 20 minutes and up to one hour. 3. Repeat Step 2 using a dry towel or paper towel. Let drain 10 minutes. When finished, throw the towel in the wash. 4. Put the block of tofu on a cutting board and cut it into 4 long sections. Then cut each section into finger-size pieces. 5. Put the oil, curry, and salt on the baking pan and mix it around. Add the tofu pieces and gently roll them in the curry oil until all the sides are coated. 6. Once the oven temperature has reached 450 degrees, put the baking pan in the oven and bake until the tofu is just browned, about 30 minutes. Serve right away. NOTES *Chutney is a thick sauce, spicy or sweet, that you dip other foods into. **Tofu is really watery. You have to dry it out a lot before cooking it.

Love pecans? Use all pecans. More of a mixed-nut person? Use mixed nuts. Keep trying these bars with different ingredients: We also like toasted sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and/or pumpkin seeds in place of some of the nuts. We're not sure why, but every now and then, these don't turn out quite right \u2014 they're crumbly instead of firm. If this happens, use it as a fruit or yogurt topping and call it \"granola!\" Prep Time: 10 mins Total Time: 10 mins Servings: 16 pieces KITCHEN GEAR Cutting board Dinner knife 8 x 8-inch pan Wax or parchment paper Measuring cup Measuring spoons Medium-sized bowl Small bowl Large spoon Plastic wrap INGREDIENTS 1/2 cup lightly toasted nuts 3/4 cup dried fruit 3/4 cup quick-cooking oats 3/4 cup crispy-rice cereal 2 tablespoons unsweetened coconut 1/2 cup nut butter, including almond, peanut, or cashew 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup 1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractINSTRUCTIONS 1. Line the pan with wax or parchment paper and leave enough hanging so that you can use it to cover the bars later. (You will need a piece a little longer than twice the size of the bottom of the pan.) 2. Put the nuts, dried fruit, oats, rice cereal, and coconut in the medium-sized bowl and toss well. 3. Put the nut butter, honey, and oil in the small bowl and microwave until the nut butter is softened, about 30 seconds (depending on your microwave). Stir until smooth. Add the vanilla and stir again until smooth. 4. Pour the nut butter mixture into the medium bowl and mix with the large spoon until well combined. 5. Dump the mixture into the prepared pan and pat down as hard as you can. You want to make the bars solid (rather than airy). Using the overhanging wax paper, cover the bars completely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours and up to one week. 6. Cut into 16 pieces. NOTES To toast nuts: put them on a small baking sheet in a 350-degree oven until they are fragrant and look a shade darker, around 5 minutes www.LLS.org GARLICKY GREEN BEANS This is one of those amazing vegetable recipes that makes something so delicious you can't stop eating it \u2014 and you don't need to! This makes a great side dish for just about anything, and the beans are good at room-temperature or cold too. Prep Time: 20 mins Total Time: 30 mins Servings: 4 servings KITCHEN GEAR Cutting board Sharp knife (adult needed) Large skillet Measuring spoons Measuring cup Heatproof spatula or wooden spoon Pot holders INGREDIENTS 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 to 2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger root 1 pound green beans, washed and trimmed 1/4 cup cold water 1/4 teaspoon kosher saltINSTRUCTIONS 1. Put the skillet on the stove and turn the heat to low. When it is hot, add the oil. 2. Add the garlic and ginger (if using) and cook until they just start to color (they'll get a little bit golden), about 30 seconds. 3. Add the beans and stir until they are lightly coated with the oil. 4. Add the water, raise the heat to high, and cook until the pan is almost dry, about 6 minutes. 5. Serve right away.

Pour the smoothie into the glasses and serve right away, or cover and refrigerate up to 4 hours. Reprinted with permission from the ChopChop Family, www.chopchopfamily.org www.LLS.orgThis is a great, basic pan-cooked chicken recipe that we're fancying up with an optional glaze. If you want to use the chicken for something else \u2014 like to add to a white-bean chili or to top a salad or pasta dish \u2014 simply skip the glaze. Prep Time: 25 mins Total Time: 25 mins Servings: 4 servings KITCHEN GEAR Cutting board Plastic wrap Medium-sized skillet (not nonstick) Tongs or heatproof spatula Pot holders Measuring spoons Plate INGREDIENTS 4 small skinless, boneless chicken breasts (1 to 1 1/2 pounds) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil 1 tablespoon honey 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard (or whatever kind you like) SAFETY TIP : Make sure to wash your hands, and any kitchen tool and surfaces, with hot, soapy water after touching raw chicken. FANCY THAT! Make it Herby: Add 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, parsley, cilantro, or basil leaves to the glaze. Make it Spicy: Add 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes to the glaze. Make it Limey: Add the juice of 1 fresh lime to the glaze.INSTRUCTIONS 1. Put the honey and mustard on a plate and mix well. Set it aside. 2. Put the chicken, smooth side up, on the cutting board, season with salt and pepper and generously cover with plastic wrap. 3. Using the back of the skillet or a rolling pin, pound the chicken until it is the same thickness all over. (This will help it cook quickly and evenly.) 4. Put the skillet on the stove and turn the heat to high. When the skillet is hot, add the oil. When the oil is hot, carefully add the chicken and cook until golden on the outside and no longer pink on the inside, about 5 minutes per side. 5. Use tongs or a fork to add the chicken breasts to the honey-mustard mixture, and swirl around until they are coated on both sides. 6. Serve right away or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days. OR ELSE Swap in chicken thighs for the breasts, but plan to keep them in the pan a few minutes extra as they won't cook as quickly.HONEY-MUSTARD GLAZED CHICKEN BREASTS Reprinted with permission from the ChopChop Family, www.chopchopfamily.org www.LLS.org ENERGY BARS A crisp is a dessert made of fruit that is topped with a sweet, crumbly oat mixture and then baked. It makes a great addition to summer picnics and barbeques, but we love to eat it all year round. A crisp helps teach essential cooking skills such as measuring, mixing, and using the oven (which is an important skill for all baking). In the fall, use apples or pears. Spring strawberries and rhubarb make a pink and delicious sweet-tart crumble. Come summer, you can use berries, peaches, cherries, plums, or other stone fruits. If fresh berries are in season, use them. If you don't have fresh berries, that's okay! Frozen berries are available all year round in the supermarket, and you don't even have to thaw them before baking your crisp. Easy as pie \u2014 or crisp! Once you master Mixed-Berry Crisp, try another great fruity dessert: a Fruit Tart, which is like an easy, open pie.

Turn the oven on and heat it to 350 degrees. 2. To make the crisp: Put the flour, oats, walnuts, and salt in the bowl and mix well. 3. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil and maple syrup, mixing with a fork as you go. Mix until crumbly. 4. To make the filling: Put the berries and 1 tablespoon flour in the baking pan or pie plate and mix well. Top with the crisp mixture. Once the oven temperature has reached 350 degrees, put the pan in the oven and bake until the top is lightly browned and the berries are bubbling, 25-30 minutes. Serve hot, warm, at room temperature, or cold.MIXED-BERRY CRISP Reprinted with permission from the ChopChop Family, www.chopchopfamily.orgwww.LLS.org Roasted peppers make the summeriest pasta around. Just be sure to use the sunset-colored ones (red, orange, or yellow) so that your sauce will be nice and sweet. The sauce can also be served on rice, salmon, chicken, or any kind of burger.

Eating healthy foods helped me feel better during treatment and now eating healthy foods helps me grow, learn and play. Nutrition is all about food and how our bodies use the nutrients in food. Let's learn about nutrition together. To order a copy of Stars Will Twinkle, The Sun Will Shine , the 3-book story of Olivia's cancer treatment, parents and guardians can visit www.LLS.org/booklets or call an LLS Information Specialist at 800-955-4572 . I like to play outside with my dog, Rexy. What do you like to do for fun? Why is food important? Eating many different foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains and protein, gives your body what it needs to grow and be healthy. Food also gives you energy to learn and play. Just like how a car needs energy, like gas or a battery, to move, your body needs food so you can do all the things you do! Food Groups Your body works and feels its best when you get many different nutrients. You can get the most nutrients by eating foods from all of the food groups. What's your favorite food from each food group? FRUITS VEGETABLES PROTEINS DAIRYGRAINS Smart Snacking Tip: For a filling snack with a lot of nutrients, combine food groups. For example, try yogurt and berries, carrots and hummus, apple and almond butter, or cheese and whole-grain crackers. What's your go-to snack? What are nutrients? Nutrients are something in food that helps you live and grow. There are 6 major groups of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats provide energy (called calories). Most nutrients do several jobs, and many foods provide more than one nutrient. Look at some nutrients and the benefits they provide! Vitamin A Supports healthy eyes Fats Help the body absorb some vitamins and protect organsCalcium Builds strong bonesCarbohydrates Give you energyIron Creates healthy blood Vitamin C Helps keep you from getting sickFiber Helps you poop Protein Builds your musclesBuild a Powerful Plate 1) Fill at least half of your plate with colorful vegetables and fruits. 2) Choose whole grains such as whole wheat bread, oatmeal, quinoa, and brown rice. 3) Pick a protein. Try choosing more plant proteins such as beans, nuts or tofu. 4) Add dairy, such as cheese or a glass of milk.Something Sweet All foods can be part of a healthy way of eating, even sweets like cookies, candy and cake. Vegetables, fruits, proteins, grains and dairy provide the nutrients your body needs. Desserts and candy have little or no vitamins and minerals. Enjoy cake and candy on special occasions like birthday parties or holidays. It's fun to wait and celebrate with desserts on a special day! Parents and guardians can visit myplate.gov to learn more. Explore a World of Flavors Be adventurous! There are so many different foods and styles of cooking to try. Here are just a few examples of popular foods in other countries. Have you tried any of these foods before? What foods does your family typically eat? Try new foods and share your favorite foods with friends. Food can bring people together. What flavors do you like\u2014 spicy, sweet, salty, sour? What textures do you like\u2014crunchy, smooth, chewy? Yes, I'll ask my mom. I love to try new foods. Next week, you can come to my house for my mom's spaghetti. Do you want to come to my house for dinner? My dad is making tamales. It's a traditional Mexican food of cornmeal dough filled with meat or beans. What is a food you would like to try? What is a food you would like to share with a friend?Shepherd's Pie, United Kingdom Ground meat and vegetables topped with mashed potatoes Dal, India Lentils, onions, tomatoes and spices Empanadas, Spain and Latin America Pastries filled with meat, cheese, peppers or vegetables Jollof Rice, West Africa Rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables and meat Pho, Vietnam Soup of noodles, meat and herbs How Your Body Breaks Down Food Digestion is how your body breaks down food and absorbs nutrients.Taking Care of Your Mouth Your mouth is the first stop for food, so it is important to take good care of your mouth and teeth. How can you take good care of your teeth? Brush your teeth at least 2 times a day with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Brush for 2 minutes and make sure you brush every tooth. Floss once a day. Go to the dentist for a cleaning and checkup every 6 months. Small intestine With help from the pancreas , liver and gallbladder , the small intestine absorbs the nutrients in food. Large intestine Parts of food your body can't use end up in the large intestine. Any remaining water is absorbed, which leaves behind solid waste. The solid waste leaves your body when you poop. Esophagus Muscles move food down the esophagus and into the stomach. Stomach In the stomach, food mixes with gastric juices to break it down. Mouth Teeth and saliva begin to break down food so you can swallow it. Liver The liver makes a juice called bile that breaks down fats. Gallbladder The gallbladder stores bile until your body needs it. Pancreas The pancreas makes juices that break down fats, protein and carbohydrates. I like to add slices of strawberries to my water for a yummy treat! Move Your Body Exercise is all about moving your body. Along with eating nutritious foods, being active helps you stay healthy, build muscle, and feel good. Jumping rope, riding a bicycle, swimming, dancing and playing sports are all types of exercise. Get at least one full hour of exercise a day. What's your favorite way to move your body? Drink Lots of Water Did you know that over 50% of your body is water? Water helps your body absorb and use nutrients from food. It also flushes waste from your body. Your body needs water to stay healthy so you can feel your best.
