A systematic literature review of factors affecting outcome in older medical patients admitted to hospital. Age & Ageing 2004;33(2):110-5. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: The ACMEplus projec t a standardised syst em for measuring case-mix and out- come in older patients admitted to hospitals in different par ts of Europe for primarily 'medical' (i.e. not surgical or psychiatric) reasons. As a first step in this project, a systematic review wa s carried out to identify factors which had a significant influence on outcome in such patients. METHODS: The systematic search used Medline 1966- 2000, Cinahl 1982-2000, Web of Science 1981-2000, refer- ence lists of relevant papers and a hand search of Age and Ageing 1974-2000. A six-category grading system was devised to classify the 313 identified papers with regard to their relevance to the ACMEplus project, study design and power. The analysis of the 14 'category 1' papers is presented. RESULTS: The main areas of assessment of case-mix we re function, cognition, depression, illness severity, nutri- tion, social elements, aspects of di agnosis and demographic details. Statistically significant predictors, for the four outcome measures, listed below were: For length of stay: f unctional status score, illness severity, cognitive score, poor nutrition, comorbidity score, diagnosis or presenti ng illness, polypharmacy, age and gender. For mortality: functional status score, illness severity, cognitive sco re, comorbidity score, diagnosis or presenting illness, polypharmacy, age and gender. For discharge destination: func tional status score, cognitive score, diagnosis or presenting illness and age. For readmission rate: functi onal status score, illness severity, co-morbidity, polypharmacy, diagnosis or presenting illness and age. CONCLUSIONS: Factors affecting outcome in older medica l patients are complex. When looking at outcomes of hospital admission in older people it is important not just to look at routinely available statistics such as age, gender and diagnosis but also to take into account multifaceted aspects such as functional status and cognitive function Garcia-Perez L, Linertova R, Lorenzo-Riera A, Vaz quez-Diaz JR, Duque-Gonzalez B, Sarria-Santamera A. Risk factors for hospital readmissions in elderly patients: a systematic review. QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians 2011;104(8):Aug. ABSTRACT: Population ageing is associated with an in crease in hospital admissions. Defining th e factors that affect the risk of hospital readmission could identify i ndividuals at high risk and enable targeted interventions to be designed. This aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for hospita l readmission in elderly people. A systematic review of the literature published in English or Spanish was performed by electronically searching EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCI and SSCI. Some keywords were aged, elder, readmission, ri sk, etc. Selection criteria were: prospective cohort studies with suitable statistical analysis such as logistic regression, that ex plored the relationship between the risk of readmission with clinical, socio-demographic or other factors in elderly patients (aged at least 75 years) admitted to hospital. Studies that fulfilled these criteria were review ed and data were extracted by two reviewers. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies and prepared a na rrative synthesis. We included 12 studies: 11 were se- lected from 1392 articles identified from the electronic search and one additional reference was selected by manual review. Socio-demographic factors were only explanatory in a few models, while prior admissions and duration of hospital stay were frequently relevant factors in others. Morbidity and functional disability were the most common risk factors. The results demonstrate the need for increased vi gilance of elderly patients who are admitted to hospi- tal with specific characteristics t hat include previous hospita l admissions, duration of hospital stay, morbidity and functional disability Linertova R, Garcia-Perez L, Vazquez-Diaz JR, Lorenzo-Riera A, Sarria-Santamera A. Interventions to reduce hospital readmissions in the elderly: in-hospital or home care. A systematic review. [Review]. J Eval Clin Pract 2011;17(6):1167-75. ABSTRACT: RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Unplanned hospital r eadmissions of elderly people represent an increasing burden on health care systems. This burden could theoret ically be reduced by adequate preventive interventions, although there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of differ ent types of interventions. The objective of this system- atic review was to identify interventions that effectivel y reduce the risk of hospital readmissions in patients of 75 years and older, and to assess the role of home follow-up METHODS: We searched studies in MEDLINE, CINAHL , CENTRAL and seven other electronic databases up to October 2007, and we updated the MEDLINE search in Oct ober 2009. Clinical trials (randomized or controlled) 15 Resultat evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at r educing readmissions in elderly patients were selected. Quality was assessed using the SIGN tool and the in formation extracted is presented in text and tables RESULTS: Thirty-two clinical trials were included and they were divided into two groups: in-hospital interventions (17 studies) and interventions with home follow-up (15 studies). A positive effe ct of the intervention evaluated on the readmission outcome was found in three studies from the first group and in seven from the second group CONCLUSIONS: Most of the interventions evaluated did not have any effect on the readmission of elderly patients. However, those interventions that included home care co mponents seem to be more likely to reduce readmissions in the elderly. 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Linertova R, Garcia-Perez L, Vazquez-Diaz JR, Lorenzo-Riera A, Sarria-Santamera A.

This could be, theoretically, reduced by adequate preventive interventions. However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of different types of interv entions. The objective of this systemat ic review was to summarise available evidence on the effectiveness of interv entions to reduce the risk of unplanned re admissions in patients of 75 years and older and to determine the role of home care components. METHODS: We searched studies in MEDLINE, CINAHL , CENTRAL and seven other electronic databases up to October 2007 and updated the search in MEDLINE up to Oc tober 2009. Clinical trials (randomized or controlled) evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce readmissions in elderly patients compared to a control group were selected. Quality was assessed by the SIGN t ool. The extracted information was presented in text and tables. RESULTS: Thirty-two clinical trials were included and di vided into two groups: in-hospital interventions (17 studies) and interventions with home follow-up (15 studies). Thr ee studies from the first group and seven from the second group found positive effects of the eval uated intervention on readmission outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the evaluated interventions did not have any effect on readmissions of elderly patients. However, those interventions that comprised some kind of home care seem to be more likely to reduce readmis- sions in the elderly Intervensjoner i kommunen (1) Christensen M, Lundh A. Medication review in hospitalised patients to reduce morbidity and mortality. [Re- view]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013;2:CD008986. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Pharmacotherapy in the elderly population is complicated by several factors that increase the risk of drug related harms and poorer adherence. The concept of medication review is a key element in improving the quality of prescribing and the prevention of adverse drug events. While no generally accepted definition of medica- tion review exists, it can be defined as a systematic asse ssment of the pharmacotherapy of an individual patient that aims to evaluate and optimise patient m edication by a change (or not) in prescription, either by a recommendation or by a direct change. Medication review performed in adult hospitalised patients may lead to better patient out- comes OBJECTIVES: We examined whether the delivery of a medi cation review by a physician, pharmacist or other healthcare professional improves the health outcomes of hospitalised adult patients compared to standard care SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group's Specialised Register (August 2011); The Cochrane Central Re gister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 8; MEDLINE ( 1946 to August 2011); EMBASE (1980 to August 2011); CINAHL (1980 to August 2011); International Pharmaceutical ABSTRACTs (1970 to August 2011); and Web of Science (August 2011). In addition we searched reference lists of included trials and relevant review s. We searched trials registries and con- tacted experts to identify additional published and unpublished trials. We did not apply any language restrictions SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled tria ls (RCTs) of medication review in hospitalised adult patients. We excluded trials of outclinic and paediatric pat ients. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes included hospital readmission, emergency department contacts and adverse drug events 16 Resultat DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review author s independently included trials, extracted data and as- sessed trials for risk of bias. We c ontacted trial authors for clarification of data and additional unpublished data. We calculated relative risks for dichotom ous data and mean differences for conti nuous data (with 95% confidence inter- vals (CIs)) MAIN RESULTS: We identified 4647 references and incl uded five trials (1186 participants). Follow-up ranged from 30 days to one year. We found no evidence of effect on a ll-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.23) and hospital readmissions (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.16), but a 36% relative reduction in emergency depart- ment contacts (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46 medica tion review reduces mortalit y or hospital readmissions, but medication review seems to reduce emergency department contacts. However, the cost-effectiveness of this intervention is not known and due to the uncertainty of the estimates of mortality and readmissions and the short follow-up, important treatment effects may have been overl ooked. Therefore, medication review should preferably be undertaken in the context of clinic al trials. High quality trials with long follow-up are needed before medication review should be implemented Intervensjoner om elektronisk oppf\u00f8lging og monitorering (4) Bowles KH, the use of technology to provide healthcare over a distance. Telehomecare, a form of telemedicine based in the patient's home, is a comm unication and clinical information syst em that enables the interaction of voice, video, and health-related data using ordinary te lephone lines. Most home care agencies are adopting tele- homecare to assist with the care of the growing populati on of chronically ill adults. This article presents a summary and critique of the published empirical evidence about the e ffects of telehomecare on older adult patients with chronic illness. The knowledge gained will be applied in a discussion regarding telehomecare optimization and are- as for future research. The referenced literature in PubMed, MEDLINE, CDSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, CCTR, and CINAHL databases was searched for the years 1995-2005 using the keywords \"tel ehomecare\" and \"telemedi- cine,\" and limited to primary research and studies in English. Approximately 40 articles were reviewed. Articles were selected if telehealth technology with peripheral medical devices was used to deliver home care for adult patients with chronic illness. Studies where the intervention consis ted of only telephone calls or did not involve video or in- person nurse contact in the home were excluded. Nineteen studies described the effects of telehomecare on adult patients, chronic illness outcomes, prov iders, and costs of care. Patients and providers were accepting of the tech- nology and it appears to have positive effects on chroni c illness outcomes such as self-management, rehospitaliza- tions, and length of stay. Overall, due to savings from healthcare utilization and trav el, telehomecare appears to reduce healthcare costs. Generally, studi es have small sample sizes with diverse types and doses of telehomecare intervention for a select few chronic illnesses; most commonly heart failure. Very few published studies have ex- plored the cost or quality implications since the change in home care reimbursement to prospective payment. Fur- ther research is needed to clarify how telehomecare can be used to maximize its benefits among diverse adult chronic illness populations.

BMJ Open 2013;3(1):2013. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of a mult idisciplinary team including a pharmacist for systematic medication review and reconciliation fr om admission to discharge at hospital among elderly patients (the Lund Inte- grated Medicines Management (LIMM)) in order to r educe drug-related readmissi ons and outpatient visits METHOD: Published data from the LIMM project group were used to design a probabilistic decision tree model for evaluating tools for (1) a systematic medication reconciliation and review pr ocess at initial hospital admission and during stay (admission part) and (2) a medication report for patients discharged from hospital to primary care (dis- charge part). The comparator was standard care. Inpatient, outpatient and staff time costs (Euros, 2009) were cal- culated during a 3-month period. Dis-utilities for hospital readmissions and outpatient visi ts due to medication errors were taken from the literature RESULTS: The total cost for the LIMM model was 290 compared to 630 for standard care, in spite of a 39 interven- tion cost. The main cost offset arose from avoided drug- related readmissions in the Admission part (262) whereas only 66 was offset in the Discharge part as a result of fe wer outpatient visits and corr ection time. The reduced disu- tility was estimated to 0.005 quality-adjusted life-years (Q ALY), indicating that LIMM was a dominant alternative. The probability that the intervention would be cost-effect ive at a zero willingness to pay for a gained QALY com- pared to standard care was estimated to 98% 17 Resultat CONCLUSIONS: The LIMM medication reconciliation (at adm ission and discharge) and medication review was both cost-saving and generated greater utility compared to standar d care, foremost owing to avoided drug-related hospi- tal readmissions. When implementing such a review process with a multidisciplinary team, it may be important to consider a learning curve in or der to capture the full advantage Khan A, Malone M, Pagel P, Vollbrecht M, Chen H. Using the electronic medical record to identify seniors at high risk for readmission. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society Conference: 2011 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Geriatrics Society National Harbor, MD United States Conference Start: of Medicare beneficia ries are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The discharge process is complex and some seniors are more vulnerable during this time than others. Risk factors and strategies to reduce readmissions are well known. A beds ide tool derived from the el ectronic medical record may help identify vulnerable seniors in the hos pital. The electronic medical record \"case finding\" may enable the clinical team to target their efforts to reduce readmissions. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a real-time risk assessment tool embedded in the electronic medical record predict readmission to the hospital? Development of readmission risk tool: An extens ive literature search was performed to identify risk factors for readmission. The risk factors we re grouped into four categories. 1) Admitting diagnoses: congestive heart failure (CHF), psychosis, other vascular surgeries, chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disease states: CHF, diabetes shortness of breath, cirrhosis, leukemia, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, me tastatic cancer, malnutrition, acute respiratory failure, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension. 3) Demographics: hospital admission in prior 6 months, length of stay. 4) Social factors: functional status, insurance type, living situation and educati onal barriers. Based on these risk factors an automated score was generated ranging from 0- 20 and is available to the health care team during the hospital stay. We hypothesized that a higher score pr edicts increased risk for read mission. Validation of read- mission risk tool: Eighty-three patients age 65 years and above were reviewed in seven medical surgical units at three acute care hospitals in Milwaukee. Overall 30-day readmission rate was 20%. Forty four percent were high risk for readmission if a cut-off value score of 7 or more was used. Of these 30% were readmitted. Using a cutoff value of 7, sensitivity was 64%, specificity= 87%. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.6 and 0.9. CONCLUSION: This initial version of a real-time risk a ssessment tool embedded in the electronic medical record provides an inadequate prediction of readmi ssion to the hospital. The tool may be better at identifying those who are not at risk for readmission Lisby M, Thomsen A, Nielsen LP, Lyhne NM, Breum-Leer C, Fredberg U, et al. The effect of systematic med-ication review in elderly patients admitted to an acute ward of internal medicine. Basic and Clinical Phar- macology and Toxicology 2010;106(5):May. ABSTRACT: Elderly patients are vulnerable to medication errors and adverse drug events due to increased morbidity, polypharmacy and inappropriate interactions. The objective of this study was to investigate whether systematic medication review and counselling performed by a clinic al pharmacist and clinical pharmacologist would reduce length of in-hospital stay in elderly patients admitted to an acute ward of internal medicine. A randomized, controlled study of 100 patients aged 70 years or older was conducted in an acute ward of internal medicine in Denmark. In- tervention arm: a clinical pharmacist conducted systematic medication revi ews after an experienced medical physi- cian had prescribed the patients' medication. Information wa s collected from medical charts, interview with the pa- tients and database registrations of dr ug purchase. Subsequently, medication hist ories were conferred with a clini- cal pharmacologist and advisory notes recommending medica tion changes were completed. Physicians were not obliged to comply with the recommendations. Control arm: medication was reviewed by usual routine in the ward. Primary end-point was length of in-hospital stay. In additi on, readmissions, mortality, contact to primary healthcare and quality of life were measured at 3-month follow-up. In t he intervention arm, the mean length of in-hospital stay was 239.9 hr (95% CI: hr (95% CI: 137.6-339.6), which was neither a statistical significant nor a clinically relevant difference. Moreover, no differ ences were observed for any of the sec- ondary end-points. Systematic medication review and medica tion counselling did not show any effect on in-hospital length of stay in elderly patients when admitted to an acut e ward of internal medicine. 2010 Nordic Pharmacological Society Intervensjoner p\u00e5 sykehus om tilrette legging av behandling under og et- ter opphold (12) Bauer M, Fitzgerald L, Haesler E, Manfrin M. Hospital discharge planning for frail older people and their family. Are we delivering best practice? A review of the evidence. AND OBJECTIVES: This paper examined the avail able evidence concerning hospi tal discharge practices for frail older people and their family caregivers and what practices were most beneficial for this group BACKGROUND: Hospital discharge practi ces are placing an increasing burden of care on the family caregiver. Dis- charge planning and execution is significant for older patients where i nadequate practices can be linked to adverse outcomes and an increased risk of readmission DESIGN: Literature review METHODS: A review of English language literature publis hed after 1995 on hospital discharge of frail older people and family carer's experiences. RESULTS. Numerous factors impact on the hospital disc harge planning of the frail older person and their family carer's that when categorised focus on the role that di scharge planning plays in bridging the gap between the care provided in hospital and the care needed in the community, it s potential to reduce the length of hospital stay, the impact of the discharge process on family carer's and the need for a coordinated health professional approach that includes dissemination of information, clear communication and active support CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicates that hos pital discharge planning for frail older people can be im- proved if interventions address family inclusion and education, communication between health care workers and family, interdisciplinary communication and ongoing suppor t after discharge. Interven tions should commence well before discharge. Relevance to clinical practice. An awareness of how the ex ecution of the hospital discharge plan is perceived by the principal family carer of a frail older person, will allow nurses and others involved with the dis- charge process to better reconcile the family caregivers ' needs and expectations with t he discharge process offered by their facility. The research show s there is a direct correlation between the quality of discharge planning and re- admission to hospital. [References: 40] Bowman E, Sachs G, Emmett T.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES 1. To understand and appreciate the complexi ties challenging patients, caregivers, and health care providers alike in preparing frail hospita lized older adults to transition home from an acute hospitalization. 2. To gain an appreciation of the paucity of palliative care domains addressed in existing hospital- to-home care transitions literature. 3. To challenge all provider s invested in the care of hospitalized el derly adults to better incorporate pallia- tive care domains, especially those regarding care of the imminently dying and ethical / legal aspects of care, when designing future hospital-to-home transitional care programs. BACKGROUND. Transitional care programs focus on providi ng patients/families with resources/ support to regain function post-hospitalization and reduce readmissions. Hospital palliative ca re teams are often consulted for pa- tients imminently dying. These separate approaches overlook patients going home who aren't imminently dying, but have life-limiting chronic conditions with unmet palliative needs. Aim. Review literatur e on hospital-to-home transi- tional care programs for elderly to determine extent to which domains of palliative care are addressed. METHODS/Session Descriptions. Design: Structured content analysis of studies pub lished 1985-2008 using search terms: progressive patient care, hospital-to-home transitions. Strategy: De veloped structured scoring tool based on National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care \"Clinical Practice statis tics reported. CONCLUSION. We identified 1182 titles; 903 were eliminated (not meeting inclusion criteria) after inspection of titles/abstracts. 279 publicati ons were selected for independent review by authors EB/GS. Ultimately 83 articles met inclusion criteria, were analyzed and scored. Domains were identified 340 out of a possible 664 times (51.2%). Physical aspects was identified in all 83 articles and Soci al aspects in 82 (98.8%). Ethical/ Legal aspects was identi- fied in only 9 (10.8%) of all articles reviewed, and Care of Imminently Dying merely 6 (7.2%) times. Physical and Social aspects were scored with mean of 1.771 (SD 0.422) and 1.831 (SD 0.408), respectively.

A systematic review of nurse-assisted case management to improve hospital dis-charge transition outcomes for the elderly. Professional Case Management 2007;12(6):330-6. ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: This article reviews 15 clinical trials of nurse-assisted case management intended to improve posthospital transitions of elderly patients to other settings. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Hospitals. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: The trials were selected after a systematic search of the PubMed database for the period 1996 to 2006. RESULTS: Eight of the 15 interventions showed reduced hospital readmission rates and/or fewer hospital days. These findings were observed across patients with \"all c ause\" and heart failure, a variety of hospital types, and variations in the intervention. Reduct ions in the use of emergency departments were observed in 3 of the 11 studies investigating this. Lower expenditures were report ed by all 6 studies reporting such comparisons. IMPLICATIONS FOR CM PRACTICE: Home visits/continuous contact with patients, early postdischarge and fre- quent contacts, patient education, and the use of specializ ed nurses who could offer appropriate training and coach- ing were often credited as program strengths Comprehensive discharge planning and post-discharge support reduces hospital readmission in older peo-ple with congestive heart failure.

ABSTRACT: QUESTION: Does comprehensive discharge planning and pos t-discharge support reduce readmission rates for older people with congestive heart failure? Study desi gn: Systematic review with meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: 18 RCTs (N = 3304) met inclusion cr iteria. Comprehensive disc harge planning and post-discharge support significantly reduced re-admissi on rates compared with usual care (35% vs. 43%; p < 0.001 : see results table). There were no significant differenc es in mortality or length of hospital stay between groups (intervention vs. usual care-mortality 14% vs. 17%, p = 0.06; length of hospital stay 8.4 days vs. 8.5 days, p = 0.60). The intervention increased quality of life scores significantly more from bas eline compared with usual care (25.7%; 95%CI 11.0 to 40.4% There was no signi ficant increase in monthly medical costs per patient between groups (-$536, 95%CI $956 to -$115, for US trials). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In elderly people with c ongestive heart failure, comp rehensive discharge planning with post-discharge support significantly reduced readmission rates.

Effectiveness of early discharge planning in acutely ill or injured hospitalized older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BMC Geriatrics are asso ciated with prolonged hospital stays and hospital re- admissions. Early discharge planning may reduce lengths of hospital stay and hospital readmissions; however, its effectiveness with acutely admi tted older adults is unclear METHODS: In this systematic review, we compared the effectiveness of early discharge planning to usual care in reducing index length of hospital stay, hospital readmissions, readmission length of hospital stay, and mortality; and increasing satisfaction with discharge pl anning and quality of life for older adults admitted to hospital with an acute illness or injury.We searched the Cochrane Library, DARE, HTA, NHSEED, ACP, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Proquest and Theses, PubMed, of Science, SciSearch, PEDro , Sigma Theta Tau International's registry of nursing research, Joanna Briggs Institute, CRISP, OT Seeker, and several internet search engines. Hand-searching was conducted in four gerontological j ournals and references of all included studies and previous systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Where meta-analysis wa s not possible, narrative analysis was performed RESULTS: Nine trials with a total of 1736 participants were included. Compared to usual care, early discharge planning was associated with fewer hospital readmissions wi thin one to twelve months of index hospital discharge [risk ratio (RR) = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.69 - 0.90]; and lower readm ission lengths of hospital stay within three to twelve months of index hospital discharge [wei ghted mean difference (WMD) = -2.47, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = -4.13 - -0.81)]. No differences were found in index length of hos pital stay, mortality or satisfaction with discharge planning. Narrative analysis of four studies indicated that early discharge planning was associated with greater overall quality of life and the general health domain of quality of life two weeks after index hospital discharge CONCLUSIONS: Early discharge planning with acutely admitt ed older adults improves system level outcomes after index hospital discharge.

Comprehensive discharge planning with postdischarge support for older patients with congestive heart failure: a meta-analysis.[Erratum ap- pears in JAMA. may re duce readmission rates for older patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of comprehensive di scharge planning plus postdisc harge support on the rate of readmission in patients with CHF, all-cause mortality, lengt h of stay (LOS), quality of life (QOL), and medical costs DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to October 2003), the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (all years), Social Science Citation Index (1992 to October 2003), and other databases for studies that described such an intervention and evaluated its effect in patients with CH F. Where possible we also contacted lead investigators and experts in the field STUDY SELECTION: We selected English-language publications of randomized clinical trials that described inter- ventions to modify hospital dischar ge for older patients with CHF (mean age > or =55 years), delineated clearly defined inpatient and outpatient components, compared effica cy with usual care, and reported readmission as the primary outcome DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed each report, assigned quality scores, and extracted data for primary and secondary outcom es in an unblinded standardized manner DATA SYNTHESIS: Eighteen studies representing data fr om 8 countries randomized 3304 older inpatients with CHF to comprehensive discharge planni ng plus postdischarge support or us ual care. During a pooled mean obser- vation period of 8 months (range, 3-12 months), fewer inte rvention patients were readmitted compared with controls 21 Resultat (555/1590 vs 741/1714, number needed to treat 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64- 0.88). Analysis of studies reporting secondary outcomes found a trend toward lower all-cause mortality for patients assigned to an intervention compared with usual care (RR, 0. 87; 95% CI, 0.73-1.03; n = 14 studies), similar initial LOS (mean [SE]: 8.4 [2.5] vs 8.5 [2.2] days, P =.60; n = 10), greater percentage improvement in QOL scores com- pared with baseline scores (25.7% [95% CI, 11.0%-40.4%] vs 13.5% [95% CI, 5.1%-22.0%]; n = 6, P =.01), and similar or lower charges for medical care per patient per month for the initial hospital stay, administering the inter- vention, outpatient care, and readmissi on (-359 dollars [95% CI, -763 dollars to 45 dollars]; n = 4, P =.10 for non-US trials and -536 dollars [95% CI, -956 dollars to -115 dollars]; n = 4, P =.03, for US trials) CONCLUSION: Comprehensive discharge planning plus postdischarge support for older patients with CHF signifi- cantly reduced readmission rates and may improve health out comes such as survival and QOL without increasing costs Preyde M, Macaulay C, Dingwall T. Discharge planning from hospital to home for elderly patients: a meta-analysis. Journal of Evidence-Based Social Work 2009;6(2):198-216. ABSTRACT: In the present healthcare environment, budget cuts, staff shortages, and resource limita tions are grave concerns. The elderly in particular consume a considerable proportion of hospital re sources. Thus, the discharge planner's role, particularly with respect to elderly patients, is extrem ely important. In this systematic review recent (within the last 10 years) randomized, controlled or quasi-experimental trials of discharge planning (DP) from hospital to home of patients age 65 years or older were examined. The most important finding was the paucity of investigations by social work professionals. A second important finding was the lack of appropriate reporting of methods and results. Where data were provided, an effect size was computed for statistically significant results (overall mean d = 0.51, SD 0.35). Large effects were noted for patient satisfaction, while moderate effects were evident for patients' quality of life and readmission rates. The integration and evaluation of current knowledge in this field may inform further research and may lead to the advancement of clinical practice and new polic y development, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of patient care and the quality of patient outcomes. The implications for social work clini- cians and researchers are discussed Yu DS, Thompson DR, Lee DT. Disease management programmes for older people with heart failure: crucial characteristics which improve post-discharge outcomes. [Review] [77 refs]. Eur Heart J 2006;27(5):596-612. ABSTRACT: AIMS: Disease management programmes (D MPs) have evolved as an innovative clinical practice system to en- hance the discharge outcomes of older people with heart failure. Yet, clinical trials whic h have examined their effec- tiveness have reported inconsist ent findings. This may be explained by variat ions in the design of DMPs. The aim is to identify the characteristics of DMPs which are crucia l to reducing hospital readmission and/or mortality of older people with heart failure METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic computerized s earch was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials of the last 10 years, which examined the effects of DMPs on hospital readmission and mortality of older people with heart failure. The identified DMPs were classified as e ffective and ineffective, according to statistically signifi- cant changes in discharge outcomes. Twenty-one trials were identified, 11 (52.4%) of which reported DMPs improv- ing the discharge outcomes of older people with heart failure . The results indicate that an effective DMP should be multi-faceted and consists of an in-hospital phase of care, intensive patient education, self-care supportive strategy, optimization of medical regimen, and ongoing surveillance and management of clinical deterioration. Cardiac nurse and cardiologist should be actively in volved and a flexible approach should be adopted to deliver the follow-up care CONCLUSION: This study defines precisely the characteri stics of the care team and the organization content and delivery method of the DMP which are crucial to enhance the discharge outcomes of older people with heart failure.

Purpose: To assess HITH treatment, where it substitutes sub- stantially for inpatient treatment as measured by the inte rvention patients being in hospita l at least 25% or 7 days less than the control patients, on mortality, readmission rates, patient satisfaction and costs when compared with inpatient treatment. Data Sources: Medline, and Cochrane through 31 July 2008. Study Selection Randomised trials that compared HITH with hospital inpatient treatment Data extraction: Two authors independe ntly reviewed articles and extracted data. RESULTS: 55 studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall HITH treatment led to a reduction in mortality [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.81;95% confidence < 0.00001].The number needed to treat in HITH to prevent one death is 48. Patient and carer satisfaction was higher in HITH in 23/24 and 7/9 studies respectively while carer bur- den was lower in studies, though not signific antly [OR 0.00 (95% - 0.19, 0.19]. Dividing the stud- ies into tertiles according to average age of subjects revealed no significant diffe rences in mortality. CONCLUSION:HITH is associated with a reduction in mort ality, readmission rates, and costs, and an increase in patient and carer satisfaction but no change in carer burd en compared to inpatient treatment.

Impact of geriatric consultation teams on clini- cal outcome in acute hospitals: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BMC Medicine 2013;11(1):48. 725 ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Comprehensive geriatric assessment for ol der patients admitted to dedicated wards has proven to be beneficial, but the impact of comprehensive geriatric asse ssment delivered by mobile inpatient geriatric consulta- tion teams remains unclear. This review and meta-analysis aims to determine the impact of inpatient geriatric con- sultation teams on clinical outcomes of interest in older adults. METHODS: An electronic search of Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science and Invert for English, French and Dutch articles was performed from inception to June 2012. Three independent reviewers selected prospective cohort studies assessing functional stat us, readmission rate, mortality or length of stay in adults aged 60 years or older. Twelve studies evaluating 4,546 participants in six countries were identified. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the methodol ogical Index for Non-Randomized Studies. RESULTS: The individual studies show that an inpatient ger iatric consultation team in tervention has favorable ef- fects on functional status, readmission and mortality rate. None of the studies found an effect on the length of the hospital stay. The meta-analysis found a beneficial effect of the intervention with regard to mortality rate at 6 months (relative risk 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.85) and 8 months (relative risk 0.51; confidence interval 0.31 to 0.85) after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient geriatric consultation team interv entions have a significant impact on mortality rate at 6 and 8 months postdischarge, but have no significant impact on functional status , readmission or length of stay. The reason for the lack of effect on these latter outcomes may be du e to insufficient statistical power or the insensitivity of the measuring method for, for example, functional stat us. The questions of to whom IGCT intervention should be targeted and what can be achieved remain unanswered and require further research.Trial registration: CRD42011001420 (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO). 201 3 Ltd Halasyamani L, Kripalani S, Coleman E, Schnipper J, van WC, Nagamine J, et al. Transition of care for hos- pitalized elderly patients--development of a discharge checklist for of Hospital Medicine (Online) 2006;1(6):354-60. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Discharge from the hospital is a critical transition point in a patient's care. Incomplete handoffs at discharge can lead to adverse events for patients and result in avoidable rehospitalizati on. Care transitions are especially important for elderly patients and other high-ri sk patients who have multiple comorbidities. Standardizing the elements of the discharge process may help to address the gaps in quality and safety that occur when patients transition from the hospital to an outpatient setting METHODS: The Society of Hospital Medicine's Hospital Quality and Patient Safety committee assembled a panel of care transition researchers, process improvement experts, and hospitalists to review the literature and develop a checklist of processes and elements r equired for ideal discharge of adult pati ents. The discharge checklist was pre- sented at the Society of Hospital Medicine's Annual Meet ing in April 2005, where it was reviewed and revised by more than 120 practicing hos pitalists and hospital-based nurses, case m anagers, and pharmacists. The final check- list was endorsed by the Society of Hospital Medicine RESULTS: The finalized checklist is a comprehensive list of the processes and elements considered necessary for 23 Resultat optimal patient handoff at hospital disc harge. This checklist focused on medi cation safety, patient education, and follow-up plans CONCLUSIONS: The development of content and process st andards for discharge is the fi rst step in improving the handoff of care from the inpatient to the posthospital setting. Refining this checklist for patients with specific diagno- ses, in specific age categories, and with specific di scharge destinations may further improve information transfer and ultimately affect patient outcomes.

European Geriatric Medicine Conference: 8th Congress of the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society Brussels Belgium Conference Start: INTRODUCTION.- Older patients form a large proportion of the medical take and this is increasing. They are at highest risk of increased length of stay, adverse health ev ents and institutionalisation. Qualitative studies suggest elderly patients would prefer to be treated in theirownhomethan be admitted to hospital. Meta-analysis implies that Admission Avoidance Hospital at Home may be associated with better health outcomes than admission to hospital. We report the first 100 patients of a novel Age Speciali st Services Emergency Team (ASSET), multidisciplinary assessment and management in the patient's ow n home to avoid hospital admission. METHODS.- Patients referred to a bed bureaux for admission were offered Hospital at Home. This included review in their own home by a multidisciplinary team and consul tant geriatrician within one hour. We evaluated the impact of the ASSET team on hospital admission and 30 day outcomes. RESULTS.- One hundred consecutive patients (10% from nursing homes) were assessed by the ASSET team. Sixty-one percent were female andmeanagewas82 (range 60-98).Meanlength of staywas 4.9 days. Seventy-eight percent were able to be supported at home with only 20% being admitted to hospital. One patient died and one went into respite care temporarily. On assessing 30-day outcomes, 3% were still in hospital, 24% of patients had been readmitted to hospital with 68% supported at home and five had died. CONCLUSION.- A hospital at home team can significantly reduce the number of admissions to hospital. Outcomes at 30 days suggest the intervention is relatively safe Pasienter med slag (6) Kwan J, Sandercock P. In-hospital refs]. Stroke 2003;34(2):587-8. Kwan J. Care pathways for acute stroke care and stroke rehabilitation: From theory to evidence. Journal of Clinical Neuroscience 2007;14(3):March. ABSTRACT: Care pathways aim to promote evidence- and guideline-bas ed care, improve the organisation and efficiency of care, and reduce cost. In the past decade, care pathways have been increasingly implemented as a tool in acute stroke care and stroke rehabilitation. In the most recent Co chrane systematic review, which included three randomised and 12 non-randomised studies, patient management with stroke care pathways was found to have no significant benefit on functional outcome, and patient satisfaction and quality of lif e might actually be worse. On the other hand, it was associated with a higher proportion of patients receivi ng investigations and a lower risk of developing certain com- plications such as infections and r eadmissions. Overall, the ev idence supports the use of care pathways in acute stroke but not stroke rehabilitation. Future developments, including electronic care pathways, patient pathways, and pre-hospital care pathways for hyperacute stroke, w ill be discussed. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Risk-standardized hospital readmission rates are used as publicly reported measures reflecting quality of care. Va lid risk-standardized models adjust for di fferences in patient-level factors across hospitals. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature to identify models that compare hospital-level poststroke readmission rate s, evaluate patient-level risk scores predicting readmission, or describe 24 Resultat patient and process-of-care predictors of readmission after stroke. METHODS: Relevant studies in English published from J anuary 1989 to July 2010 were identified using MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and all Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews. Au thors of eligible publications re- ported readmission within 1 year after stroke hospitaliz ation and identified >=1 predictors of readmission in risk- adjusted statistical models. Publicati ons were excluded if they lacked primary data or quantitative outcomes, report- ed only composite outcomes, or had <100 patients. RESULTS: Of 374 identified publications, 16 met the inclusi on criteria for this review. No model was specifically designed to compare risk-adjusted readmission rates at the hos pital level or calculate scores predicting a patient's risk of readmission. The studies providi factors asso- ciated with readmission varied in stroke definitions, data sources, outcomes (all-cause and/or stroke-related read- mission), durations of follow-up, and model covariates. Few characteristics were consistently associated with read- mission. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified no risk-standardiz ed models for comparing hospital readmission perfor- mance or predicting readmission risk after and system-level factors associated with readmis- sion were inconsistent across studies. The current litera ture provides little guidance for the development of risk- standardized models suitable for the public reporting of hospital-level stroke readmission performance Prvu Bettger J, Alexander KP, Dolor RJ, Olson DM, Kendrick AS, Wing L, et al. Transitional care after hospi- talization for acute stroke or myocardial infarction: a systematic review. Ann Intern Med 2012;157(6):407-16. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Transitional care is a time-limited servic e to prevent discontinuous care and adverse outcomes, including rehospitalization. PURPOSE: To describe transitional care interv entions and evidence of benefit or harm in patients hospitalized for acute stroke or myocardial in farction (MI). DATA SOURCES: Cumulative Index to Nurs- ing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, Cochrane Da tabase of Systematic Reviews, and EMBASE, supple- mented with manual searches of refe rence lists of relevant studies and review articles (January 2000 to March 2012). STUDY SELECTION: 6 reviewers screened 5857 citations to identify English-language reports of trials or observational studies that compared trans itional care with usual care among adults hospitalized for stroke or MI and that reported patient, caregiver, process, or syst ems outcomes within 1 year of hospital discharge. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on study design, quality, populat ion, intervention characte ristics, and patient- and sys- tem-level outcomes were extracted by 3 revi ewers and confirmed by 1 additional reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: 62 articles representing 44 studies of transi tional care for either acute stroke (27 studies) or MI (17 studies). Four intervention types were studied: hospita l-initiated support ( n = 14), patient and family education ( n = 7), community-based support ( n = 20), and chronic di sease management ( n = 3). Most studies (68%) were of fair quality. Overall, moderate-strength evidence showed t hat hospital-initiated support reduced length of stay for patients who had a stroke, and low-strength evidence showed that it reduced mortality for patients who had an MI. Evidence about benefits of other interv entions and harms from transitional care services was insufficient. LIMITATIONS: Few studies had high-quality research designs . The usual care comparator was often poorly defined. Applicability to U.S. clinical pr actice was limited; only 6 studies we re conducted in the United States. CONCLUSION: Available evidence shows that hospital-init iated transitional care can improve some outcomes in adults hospitalized for stroke or MI. Finding additional transitional care interventions that improve functional out- comes and prevent rehospitalizations and adverse events is a high priority fo r the growing population of patients who have an MI or a stroke.

ABSTRACT: QUESTION: In patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke, do early supported discharge (ESD) services accel- erate return to home, improve patient outcomes, and reduce resource use? DATA SOURCES Studies were identifi ed by searching the Cochrane Stroke Group Specialised Register of Con- trolled Trials in April 2001 (which includes studies i dentified through searches of Medline, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, BIOSIS, SCISEARCH, and ot her databases; and handsearches of selected journals, conference proceedings, and books) and by contacting trialists STUDY SELECTION Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with stroke were included if they compared conventional hospital disc harge procedures with alternative services that aimed to accelerate patient discharge from hospital by providing rehabilitation and/or phy sical support in community settings (ie, ESD) DATA EXTRACTION Data were extracted on methods, par ticipants, interventions, and outcomes. Main outcomes were death, place of residence, and physical dependency. Secondary outcomes included, among others, resource 25 Resultat outcomes such as length of hospital stay and readmissions. Methodological quality of individual trials was assessed (concealment of allocation, intention to tr eat analysis, and blinding of outcome assessors) MAIN RESULTS Of the 9 trials that met the selection criteria, primary outcome data were only available for 4 (n=757, mean/median age ranged from 71-75 y). 3 trials involved units with a coordinated ESD team, which both planned and provided care, whereas the fourth trial had no coordinated ESD team, with care being planned and provided by a range of community stroke services. All 4 trials had concealed allocation to groups and blinded out- come assessment; follow up ranged from 92% to 98%. Meta-analysis of these 4 trials showed that the ESD and conventional care groups did not differ for death, combined death or institutional care, or combined death or de- pendency (table). Patients in the ESD group had a shorter init ial hospital stay than the conventional care group (4 trials, n=741, weighted mean difference -15 d, 95% CI -24 to -6), but did not differ for r eadmissions (2 trials, n=423, 22% v 22%) CONCLUSION In patients admitted to hospital with acut e stroke, early supported discharge may reduce length of initial hospital stay, but does not reduce death, combined death or institutional care, or combined death or depend- ency Stroke: prevention of readmission - Primary research (Project 2003.

Reviews in Cardiovas-cular Medicine 2006;7(SUPPL.#1):2006. ABSTRACT: Intrathoracic impedance monitoring (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) and implantable hemody- namic monitoring (IHM), which is under investigation, are promising tec hniques for the improved management of heart failure by detecting early changes in fluid status or hemodynamic congestion. R outine outpatient surveillance of intrathoracic impedance data from implanted devices may si gnificantly reduce the currently high rates of hospital admission/readmission for patients with heart failure. IHM systems may extend such monitoring capabilities. Both emerging approaches for monitoring patients with heart failure may alert clinicians (and possibly patients) to im- pending decompensation before symptoms appear. 2006 MedReviews, LLC Inglis SC, Clark RA, Cleland JGF, McAlister F, Stewart S.

A systematic review of telemonitoring for the manage-ment of heart failure. [Review] [51 Journal Failure 2003;5(5):583-90. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring allows a clinician to monitor, on a daily basis, physiological variables measured by patients at home. This provides a m eans to keep patients with heart failure under close supervision, which could reduce the rate of admission to hospital and accelerate discharge OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the application of telemedicine in the management of heart failure METHODS: A literature search was conducted on studies involving telemonitoring and heart failure between 1966 and 2002 using Medline, Embase, Cochrane Librar y and Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare RESULTS: Eighteen observational studies and six randomised controlled trials involving telemonitoring and heart failure were identified. Observational st udies suggest that telemonitoring; used ei ther alone or as part of a multidis- ciplinary care program, reduce hospital bed-days occupanc y. Patient acceptance of and compliance with telemoni- toring was high. Two randomised controlled trials suggest that telemonitoring of vital signs and symptoms facilitate early detection of deterioration and reduce readmission rate s and length of hospital stay in patients with heart fail- ure. One study also showed a reduction in readmissi on charges. One substantial randomised controlled study showed a significant reduction in mortality at 6 months by monitoring weight and symptoms in patients with heart failure; however, no difference was observed in read mission rates. Another randomised study comparing video- consultation performed as part of a home health care prog ramme for patients with a variety of diagnoses, suggested 26 Resultat a reduction in the costs of hospital care, which offset the co st of video-consultation. Patients with heart failure were not reported separately. One randomised study showed no difference in outcomes between the telemonitoring group and the standard care group CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring might have an important role as part of a strategy for the delivery of effective health care for patients with heart failure. Adequately powered mu lticentre, randomised controlled trials are required to further evaluate the potential benefits and cost-effect iveness of this intervention. JL, Figal DP, Garcia-Alberola A. A systematic review of the literature on home monitoring for patients with heart failure. [Review] [48 refs]. Journal of Telemedicine & Telecare 2006;12(5):234-41. ABSTRACT: We conducted a systematic review of the literature for a ssessing the value of home monitoring for heart failure (HF) patients. The abstracts of 383 articles were read. We excluded those in which either no home monitoring was done or only the technical aspects of the telemedicine application were described. Forty-two studies met the selection criteria. We classified the results into feasibility (technica l and institutional) and impact (on the clinical process, on patient health, on accessibility and acceptability of the heal th system, and on the economy). Evaluating the articles showed that home monitoring in HF patients is viable, giv en that: (1) it appears to be technically effective for follow- ing the patient remotely; (2) it appears to be easy to us e, and it is widely accepted by patients and health profes- sionals; and (3) it appears to be economically viable. Furthe rmore, home monitoring of HF patients has been shown to have a positive impact on: (1) the clin ical process, supported by a significant improvement of patient follow-up by adjustment of treatment, diet or behav iour, as well as hospital readmissions and emergency visits reduction; (2) the patient's health, supported by a relevant improvement in quality of life, a reduction of days in hospital, and a de- crease in mortality; and (3) costs resulting from the use of health resources.

ABSTRACT: is associated with high direct and indi rect costs to the patients and the healthcare system. This systematic review aims to analyze existing economic data to determine whether telemonitoring of patients with HF will result in decreased costs. The Scopus and PubMed databases were searched independently by two reviewers for journal articles that reported on an economic analysis (i.e., calcul ated monetary amounts or percentage change in costs) of a study using a HF telemonitoring system. On ly articles describing telemonitoring systems with a com- ponent of home physiological measurements were included. Elev en articles met the inclusion criteria, describing 10 different HF telemonitoring systems. Nine of the 10 studi es analyzed the direct costs to the healthcare system. All the studies found cost reductions from telemonitoring compared to usual care, which ranged between 1.6% and 68.3%. Cost reductions were mainly attributed to reduc ed hospitalization expenditures. Only one study discussed the impact of HF telemonitoring on direct patient costs. The study found a 3.5% lower travel cost for patients using telemonitoring compared to those in the usual care group. The single study that was found for indirect costs de- scribed the willingness to pay for telemedicine by patients with HF (55% of the patients with HF were willing to pay $20 to access telemedicine, and 19% were willing to pay $ 40). Available data from ex isting studies suggest that although HF telemonitoring will require an initial financial in vestment, it will substantially reduce costs in the long term, particularly by reducing rehospitaliz ation and travel costs.

Dimens Crit Care Nurs 2010;29(2):57-62. ABSTRACT: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic debilitating illness that a ffects millions of Americans each year. Patients with HF are faced with chronic physical symptoms, emotional stra in, and significant socioeconomic burden. Goals in the man- agement of HF are to slow the disease progression, decr ease symptom acuity, and prevent exacerbations that lead to hospital readmission. Management of HF remains a cha llenge for healthcare provider s. There is a fine balance between optimizing patient functioning and minimizing healthcare expenditures. Wi th the incidence of HF increasing annually, it is important to have effective disease m anagement strategies in place. In any disease management program, it is important to follow those guidelines outlined by evidence-based practice. The purpose of this system- atic review was to evaluate current evidence-based practice and determine what benefit exists of having an ad- vanced practice registered nurse assist in the management of patients with HF 27 Resultat Ponniah A, Anderson B, Shakib Pharmacists' role in the post-discharge manage- ment of patients with heart failure: A literature J Clin Pharm Ther 2007;32(4):August. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND and Objective: The incidence of heart failure is increasing in developed countries. In the aged pop- ulation, heart failure is a common caus e of hospitalization and hospital readmi ssion, which in conjunction with post- discharge care, impose a significant cost burden. Inappr opriate medication management and drug-related problems have been identified as major contributor s to hospital readmissions. In order to enhance the care and clinical out- comes, and reduce treatment costs, heart failure di sease management programmes (DMPs) have been developed. It is recommended that these programmes adopt a multi-di sciplinary approach, and pharmacists, with their under- standing and knowledge of medication management, can play a vi tal role in the post-discharge care of heart failure patients. The aim of this literature review was to assess the role of pharmacists in the provision of post-charge ser- vices for heart failure patients. METHOD: An extensive literature search was undertaken to identify published studies and review articles evaluat- ing the benefits of an enhanced medication management service for patients with heart failure post-discharge. RESULTS: Seven studies were identified evaluating 'outpati ent' or 'post-discharge' phar macy services for patients with heart failure. In three studies, services were de livered prior to discharge with either subsequent telephone or home visit follow-up. Three studies involved the role of a pharmacist in a specialist heart failure outpatient clinic. One study focused on a home-based intervention. In six of these studies, positive outcom es, such as decreases in unplanned hospital readmissions, death rates and greater co mpliance and medication knowledge were demonstrat- ed. One study did not show any difference in the num ber of hospitalizations between intervention and control groups. The quality of evidence of the randomized controll ed trials was assessed using the Jadad scoring method. None of the studies achieved a score of more than 2, out of a maximum of 5, indicating the potential for bias. Dis- cussion: The DMPs carried out by pharmacists have contribut ed to positive patient outcomes, which has highlighted the value of extending the traditional roles of pharmacists from the provision of profe ssional guidance to the delivery of continuity of care through a more holistic and direct approach. CONCLUSION: This review has demonstrated the effectiveness of pharmacists' interventions to reduce the morbidi- ty and mortality associated with heart failure. Howeve r, there is an on-going need for the development and evalua- tion of pharmacy services for these patients. 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Intervensjoner om bruk av retningslinjer og behandlingslinjer (1) Kul A, Milan E, Montag I, Vanhaecht K, Panella M.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Care pathways have become a popular tool to enhance the quality of care by improving patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient sa tisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources. We per- formed a disease specific systematic re view to determine how care pathways in the hospital treatment of heart fail- ure affect in-hospital mortality, length of in-hospital stay, readmission rate and hospitalisation cost when compared with standard care METHODS: Medline, Cinahl, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1985 to 2010. Each study was assessed independently by two reviewers. methodological quality of the included studies was assed using the Jadad me thodological approach for randomised cont rolled trials, controlled clinical trials and the New Castle Ottawa Scale for case-cont rol studies, cohort studies and time interrupted series RESULTS: Seven studies met the study inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review with a total sample of 3,690 patients. The combined overall results show ed that care pathways have a significant positive effect on mortality and readmission rate. A shorter length of hos pital stay was also observed compared with the standard care group. No significant difference was found in the hospi talisation costs. More positive results were observed in controlled trials compared to randomized controlled trials CONCLUSION: By combining all possible results, it can be concluded that care pathways for treatment of heart failure decrease mortality rates and length of hospital stay, but no statistically significant difference was observed in the readmission rates and hospitalisation costs. However, one should be cautious with overall conclusions: what works for one organization may not work for another because of the subtle differences in processes and bottlenecks 28 Resultat Intervensjoner p\u00e5 Veenendaal Effectiveness of self-management interventions on mortal- ity, hospital readmissions, chronic heart failure hospitalization rate and quality of life in patients with chron-ic heart failure: a systematic review. Patient Education & Counseling 2010;78(3):297-315. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: This review examined the effectiveness of self-management interventions compared to usual care on mortality, all-cause hospital readmissions , chronic heart failure hospitalization rate and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure. METHODS: A systematic review was performed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched between 1996 and 2009. Randomized controlled tria ls were selected evaluating self-management inter- ventions designed for patients with chronic heart failure. Outc omes of interest are mortality, all-cause hospital re- admissions, chronic heart failure hospitalization rate and quality of life. RESULTS: Nineteen randomized controlled trials were i dentified. The effectiveness of heart failure management programs initiating self-management interventions in patients with chronic heart failure indicate a positive effect, although not always significant, on reduction of numbers of all-cause hospital readmitted patients and due to chronic heart failure, decrease in mortality and increasing quality of life. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found that curr ent available published studies show methodological short- comings impairing validation of the effectiveness of self -management interventions on mortality, all-cause hospital readmissions, chronic heart failure hospi talization rate and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Further research should determine independent effects of self-management inter- ventions and different combinations of interv entions on clinical and patient reported outcomes Driscoll A, Worrall-Carter L, McLennan S, Dawson A, O'Reilly J, Stewart S. Heterogeneity of heart failure management programs in Australia. European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 2006;5(1):75-82. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Heart Failure Management Programs (HFMPs ) have proven to be cost-effective in minimising recurrent hospitalisations, morbidity and mortality. Howeve r, variability between the programs exists which could translate into variable health outcomes OBJECTIVE: To survey the characteristics of HFMPs th roughout Australia and to identify potential heterogeneity in their organisation and structure METHOD: Thirty-nine post-discharge HFMPs were identified fr om a systematic search of the Australian health-care system in 2002. A comprehensive 19-item questionnaire spec ifically examining characteristics of HFMPs was sent to co-ordinators of identified programs in early 2003 RESULTS: All participants responded with six institutions (15%) indicating that thei r HFMP had ceased operations due to a lack of funding. The survey revealed an uneven distribution of the 33 active HFMPs operating throughout Australia. Overall, 4450 post-discharge HF patients (medi an: 74; IQR: 24-147) were managed via these programs, representing only 11% of the potential caseload for an Au stralia-wide network of HFMPs. Heterogeneity of these programs existed in respect to the model of care app lied within the program (70% applied a home-based program and 18% a specialist HF clinic) and app lied interventions (30% of program s had no discharge criteria and 45% of programs prevented nurses administering/titrating medicati ons). Sustained funding was available to only 52% of the active HFMPs CONCLUSION: Inequity of access to HFMPs in Australia is evident in relation to locality and high service demand, further complicated by inadequate funding. Heterogeneity between these programs is substantial. The development of national benchmarks for evidence-bas ed HFMPs is required to address progr am variability and funding issues to realise their potential to improve health outcomes Duffy JR, Hoskins LM, Chen M.

A systematic meta-analysis of the efficacy and heterogeneity of disease management programs in congestive heart failure. J Card Fail 2006;12(7):554-67. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: We sought to systematically combine t he evidence on efficacy of disease management programs (DMPs) in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), to identify and explain heterogeneity of results from prior studies of DMPs, and to assess potential publication bias from these studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic literat ure search on randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of DMPs on CHF outcomes and performed meta-analyses and meta-regressions comparing DMPs and standard care for mortality and rehospitalization. We included 36 studies from 13 different countries (with data from 8341 patients). Our meta-analysis yielded a pooled risk differ ence of 3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1-6%, P < .01) for mortality and of 8% (95% CI 5-11%, P < .0001) for rehospitalization, both DMP. Factors explaining heterogeneity between studies included seve rity of disease, proportion of beta-bl ocker at baseline, country, duration of follow-up, and mode of postdischarge contact. No stat istically significant publication bias was detected. CONCLUSION: DMPs have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality for patients with CHF. The benefit of the intervention depends on age, severity of disease, guideline-based treatment at baseline, and DMP modalities.

Journal of Cardiac Failure Conference: 15th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Japanese Heart Failure Society, JHFS 2011 Kagoshima Japan is characterized by impaired exerci se tolerance, increased risk for readmission, and reduced sur- vival. Until recently, exercise was believed to be harmful for HF, and bed rest was recommended as a primary treatment for HF. However, recent studies have demonstrat ed that cardiac rehabilitation/exercise training (CR/ ET) with an appropriate exercise prescription effectively improv es exercise capacity without adversely affecting left ven- tricular function or plasma B-type nat riuretic peptide (BNP) levels in patient s with HF. In addition, an outpatient CR/ET program has been reported to successfully play the role of a disease management program to improve quality of life (QOL) and to reduce readmission for hospitaliz ed HF patients. Furthermore, recent meta-analyses and a large clinical trial (HF-ACTION) have indicated that ET programs improve long te rm prognosis (death/rehospita- lization) in HF patients. Despite the accumulated evidence of efficacy of CR/ET, a nationwide survey in Japan indi- cated that the implementation of outpatient CR/ET programs remains very low. CONCLUSIONS: CR/ET has become an important management modality of secondary prevention for HF, and therefore, CR/ET should be implemented more widely in the treatment strategy for HFto improve not only exercise capacity, but also QOL and long te rm prognosis of HF patients Gwadry-Sridhar FH, Flintoft V, Lee DS, Lee H, Guyatt GH.

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of multidisciplinary heart failure management programs on hospital admission rates METHODS: We identified studies through an electronic search and mortality using 8 distinct methods. Eligible stud- ies met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled clinic al trials of adult inpatient s hospitalized for heart failure enrolled either at the time of discharge or within 1 week after discharge; (2) heart fail ure-specific patient education intervention coupled with a postdischarge follow-up a ssessment; and (3) unplanned readmission reported. Four reviewers independently assessed each study for eligibility and quality, achieving a weighted kappa of 0.73 for eligi- bility and 0.77 for quality. For each study we calculated the relative risk for readmissions and mortality for patients 30 Resultat receiving enhanced education relative to patients receiving usual care RESULTS: A total of 529 citation titles were identified, of which 8 randomized trials proved eligible. The pooled rela- tive risk for hospital readmission rates using a random-effe model was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.91; P<.001; heterogeneity P = .25). There was no apparent effect on mortality (relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence inter- val, 0.72-1.34; P = .90; heterogeneity P = .20).

Effects of self-management intervention on health outcomes of patients with heart failure: a systematic review of randomized controlled ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization among adults over 65. Over 60% of patients die within 10 years of first onset of symptoms. T he objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of self-management interventions on hospital readmission rate s, mortality, and health-related quality of life in pa- tients diagnosed with heart failure METHODS: The study is a systematic review of randomiz ed controlled trials. The following data sources were used: MEDLINE (1966-11/2005), EMBASE (1980-11/2005), CINAHL database (to 11/2005), the Cochrane Central Trial Registry and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to 11/2005); article reference lists; and experts in the field. We included randomized controlled trials of self-management inter- ventions that enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who were diagnosed with heart failure. The primary out-comes of interest were all-cause hospital readmissions , hospital readmissions due to heart failure, and mortality. Secondary outcomes were compliance with treatment and quality of life scores. Three reviewers independently assessed the quality of each study and abstracted the results. For each included study, we computed the pooled odds ratios (OR) for all-c ause hospital readmission, hospital readmissi on due to heart failure, and death. We used a fixed effects model to quantitatively synthesize RESULTS. We were not able to pool effects on health-related quality of life and measures of compliance with treat- ment, but we summarized the findings from the relevant studies. We also summarized the reported cost savings results: From 671 citations that were identified, 6 random ized trials with 857 patients were included in the review. Self-management decreased all-cause hospita l readmissions (OR 0.59; (CI) to 0.80, = and heart failure readmissions 0.44; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71, P = 0.001). The effect on mortality was not significant (OR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.51, P = 0.76). A dherence to prescribed medical advice improved, but there was no significant difference in functional capabilities, symptom status and quality of life. The reported savings ranged from 1300 to 7515 dollars per patient per year CONCLUSION: Self-management programs targeted for patient s with heart failure decrease overall hospital read- missions and readmissions for heart failure.

Effectiveness of heart failure management programmes with nurse-led discharge planning in reducing re-admissions: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Int J Nurs Stud 2012;49(5):610-24. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a clinical condition with major socioeconomic burden. Scientists are trying to find effective solutions to eliminate the effects of the di sease and the current innovations in research address the introduction of HF management programmes (HF-MPs). OBJECTIVES: A meta-analysis was undertaken to estimate the effect of HF-MP with a nurse-driven pre-discharge phase on the outcomes of HF and all-cause re-admission. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed, Cumula tive Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Cochrane Library (reviews and clinical trials ) was performed to locate randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published in English language, which implement ed any HF-MP with discharge planning carried out by a nurse. Identified articles were fu rther screened for additional studies. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened relev ant abstracts or titles using a standardised pre- defined check list. Pilot studies, studies additionally asse ssing other conditions and studies that evolved technology utilities or included medication management beyond optimisation of therapy, were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Selected articles were thoroughl y screened and data of interest (characteristics and out- comes) were obtained. Quality assessment was done by two reviewers separately. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nineteen RCTs were selected for the me ta-analysis. The overall pooled effect (relative risk, 31 Resultat RR) of the intervention group compared with the control group was estimated by using a random effects analysis (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the outcomes of HF-r elated re-admission and all-cause re-admission. The overall the intervention. Metar egression analysis was performed while trying to explain the observed heterogeneity but none of the factors (environment, duration of follow-up, origin and complexity) were significantly related with the RR. No significant publication bias was obser ved regarding both HF and all-cause re- admission. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current meta-analysis highlight the potential of HF-MPs with nurse-driven pre- discharge interventions to r educe hospital re-admissions. Essential char acteristics or components of a successful HF-MP are still to be determined; thus more studies are required to solve this issue Lavenberg JG, Williams K, Behta M.

Clinical service organisation for heart fail-ure. heart failure (CHF) is a seri ous, common condition associated with frequent hospi- talisation. Several different diseas e management interventions (clinical se rvice organisation in terventions) for pa- tients with CHF have been proposed OBJECTIVES: To update the previously published review which assessed the effectiveness of disease manage- ment interventions for patients with CHF SEARCH METHODS: A number of databases were searc hed for the updated review: CENTRAL, (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and DARE, on The Cochrane Library, ( (1985-January 2009). For the original review (but not the update) we had also searched: Science Citation Index Expanded (1981-2001); SIGLE (1980-2003); National Research Register (2003) and NHS Economic Evaluations Da tabase (2001). We also searched reference lists of included studi es for both the original and updated reviews SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least six months follow up, comparing disease management interventions specifically direct ed at patients with CHF to usual care DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two revi ewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Study authors were contacted for further information where necessary. Data were analysed and presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) MAIN RESULTS: Twenty five trials (5,942 people) were in cluded. Interventions were cl assified by: (1) case man- agement interventions (intense monito ring of patients following discharge often involving telephone follow up and home visits); (2) clinic inte rventions (follow up in a CHF clinic) and (3) multidisciplinary interventions (holistic ap- proach bridging the gap between hospital admission and di scharge home delivered by a team). The components, intensity and duration of the interventions varied, as did t he 'usual care' comparator prov ided in different trials.Case management interventions were associated with reduction in all cause mortality at 12 months follow up, OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.91, but not at six months. No reducti ons were seen for deaths from CHF or cardiovascular caus- es. However, case management type interventions reduced CHF related readmissions at six month (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88, P = 0.007) and 12 month follow up (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.76). Impact of these interventions on all cause hospital admissions was not appar ent at six months but was at 12 months (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99, I(2) = 58%). CHF clinic interventions (for six and 12 month follow up) revealed non-significant reductions in all cause mortality, CHF related admissions and all cause readmissi ons.Mortality was not reduced in the two studies that looked at multidisciplinary interventions. However, bot h all cause and CHF related readmissions were reduced (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.72, respectively) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Amongst CHF patients who have previously been admitted to hospital for this condi- 32 Resultat tion there is now good evidence that case management type interventions led by a heart failure specialist nurse reduces CHF related readmissions after 12 months follow up, all cause readmissions and all cause mortality. It is not possible to say what the optimal components of thes e case management type interventions are, however tele- phone follow up by the nurse specialist was a common component .Multidisciplinary intervent ions may be effective in reducing both CHF and all cause readmissi ons. There is currently limited evi dence to support interventions whose major component is follow up in a CHF clinic Verdiani V, Nozzoli C. Heart failure: Preventing re hospitalizations by disease management programs. [Ital- ian]. Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease - Cardiac Series 2004;62(2):June. ABSTRACT: Chronic heart failure is a growing public health problem for prevalence, morbidity and costs. The major proportion of costs is attributable to rehospitalizations and many of these readmissions may be preventable. Since 1990, some investigators have tested a variety of disease management programs designed to improve quality of life, functional status and decrease rehospitalizat ions rates. We identified these studies by a computerized search of the MEDLINE database. The programs described reflected a wide variet y of methods and we categorized these programs recog- nizing the prevalent disease management approach. We reported the results of these trials about rehospitalizations and analysed a number of limitations that must be consider ed when determining their adoption into clinical practice Wakefield BJ, Boren SA, Groves PS, Conn VS. Heart Failure Care Management Programs: A Review of Study Interventions and Meta-Analysis of Outcomes. J Cardiovasc Nurs 2013;28(1):8-19. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND:: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to describe and quantify individual interventions used in multicomponent outpati ent heart failure management programs. METHODS:: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials between 1995 and 2008 were searched using 10 search terms. Randomized contro lled trials evaluating outpatient programs that addressed comprehensive care to decrease readmissi ons for patients with heart failure we re identified. Forty-three articles reporting on 35 studies that reported readmissions separately from other outcomes were included. Three investiga- tors independently abstracted primary st udy characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS:: In the 35 studies, participants included 8071 subj ects who were typically older (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [6.5] years) and male (59%). Using our coding scheme, t he number of individual interventions within a program ranged from 1 to 7 within individual studies; the most comm only used interventions were patient education, symp- tom monitoring by study staff, symptom monitoring by patients, and medication adherence strategies. Most pro- grams had a teaching component with a mean (SD) of 6.4 (3.9) individual topics covered; frequent teaching topics were symptom recognition and management, medication revi ew, and self-monitoring. Fewer than half of the 35 studies reviewed reported adequate data to be included in the meta-analysis. Some outcomes were infrequently reported, limiting statistical power to detect treatment effects. CONCLUSION:: A number of studies evaluating mult icomponent HF management programs have found positive effects on important patient outcomes. The contribution of the individual interventions included in the multicompo- nent program on patient outcomes remains unclear. Future studies of chronic disease interventions must include descriptions of recommended key program compon ents to identify critical program components Willey R. Managing heart failure: a critical appraisal of the literature. J Cardiovasc Nurs requires examinat ion of evidence-based re- search, which may lead to opportunities to improve on ca re transitions upon discharge fr om an acute care setting. This review was conducted to identify current literature in HF and disease management without focusing specifically on disease management programs. PURPOSE: : The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to better understand how to structure interventions for HF patients upon transit ion from the hospital to home and to outline critical re- search gaps. CONCLUSION: : Patients recently hospitalized for HF or at high risk for HF decompe nsation should be considered for comprehensive heart failure disease management (HFDM) and/or structured HF inte rventions. Level 1 evidence demonstrated positive benefits from HFDM programs, st ructured telephone support, and telemonitoring interven- an of contem porary multidisciplinary HF management. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: : Based on the evidence from th is critique, key features and recommendations are pro- vided. Also discussed is the State Action on Avoidable Rehospita lizations program, which may provide acute care centers in Massachusetts an opportunity to cr eate an ideal transition home for HF patients 33 Resultat Intervensjoner om organisering R, Wasem J, Neumann A, et al. [Cost-effectiveness of study nurses in the management of patients with heart failure. A systematic review]. [Review] [German]. Herz 2010;35(4):273-83. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Heart failure is currently one of the most common and cost-intensive diseases. Furthermore, high morbidity and mortality are distinctive for this disease. Therefore, new treatment programs are increasingly developed; especially the care of heart failure patients by specialized nurses (study nurses) represents a frequent new concept. This review gives a systematic ov erview of the cost-effectiveness of new treatment con- cepts with study nurses in comparison to the conventional care of heart failure METHODS: A systematic literature search in MEDLINE was performed for the period from 1995 till April 2008. The search strategy included terms from three essential areas re lating to the working subject: twelve search keys with regard to the clinical picture, 21 words concerning the inte rvention with study nurses, and 27 terms with reference to health economics. The literature selection was carried out on the basis of a priori defined in- and exclusion criteria. Economic evaluations based on ra ndomized controlled trials with a study dura tion of at least 6 months which were published in English or German were enclosed. An extraction of the relevant data as well as a qualitative synthesis of information were conducted RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were identified. With five of nine of the enclosed publicat ions, a statistically signifi- cant reduction of the number of all-c ause rehospitalizations was reported. Two of twelve publications showed a statistically significant decrease in mortality in favor of the intervention group. Twelve of 13 publications only report- ed the costs and effects of both groups separately. For the fi ve of nine publications with significant reductions of rehospitalization, an own calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) could be carried out based on the cost and effect data. It turned out an ICER of costs at the rate of 490 Euros up to savings of 7,330 Euros per prevented rehospitalization CONCLUSION: This systematic review shows an international trend that concepts for the care of patients with heart failure that involve study nurses are cost-effective. Fo r the German context there are no comparable data available Briffa TG, Kinsman L, Maiorana AJ, Zecchin R, Redfern J, Davidson PM, et al. An integrated and coordinat- ed approach to preventing recurrent coronary heart disease events in Australia. [Review] [32 refs]. Med J Aust 2009;190(12):683-6. ABSTRACT: Implementing existing knowledge about cardiac rehabilitat ion (CR) and heart failure management could markedly reduce mortality after acute coronary syndromes and re vascularisation therapy. Contemporary CR and secondary prevention programs are cost-effective, safe and beneficia l for patients of all ages, leading to improved survival, fewer revascularisation procedures and reduced rehospitalisati on. Despite the proven benefits attributed to these secondary prevention interventions, they are not well att ended by patients. Modern programs must be flexible, cul- turally safe, multifaceted and integrated with the patient's primary health care provider to achieve optimal and sus- tainable benefits for most R, Light-McGroary KA, Disch M.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES 1. Cite population characteristics of heart failu re patients that are at highest risk for 30- day hospital readmission. 2. Recall the presentati ons, diagnoses, and other contributing factors common for heart failure (HF) readmissions. Consider techniques to identify possible points of effective palliative care intervention. 3. Identify a plan using the application of acquired knowledge to address t he heart failure early readmissions in your institution, citing possible points of impact for palliative care. HF pati ents are chronically critically and eventually terminally ill patients. Sadly this progression comes as a surprise to ma ny of them. Early awareness of the potential for terminal and disabling illness is the key not only for end-of-life planni ng, but also for empowering these patients to maximize the time they have by embracing and engaging their disease on their terms. Pa lliative care has long been valued for the team's ability to enhance awareness and incorporation of the patient's goals and values into the care plan for personalized end-of-life decision making and/or planning. Engaging patients in the same manner for the purpose of disease management has the promise of im proving compliance, increasing empowe rment in control of their future, and, perhaps most importantly, reducing hopelessness in a popul ation of patients with the most prevalent terminal 34 Resultat illness on the planet. This presentation will review the literature regarding the im pact of palliative care interventions on care plans and readmissions in general. A specific focu s on discussion of the factors leading to readmission for the diagnosis of HF will attempt to identify those factors mo st likely to be causative-and those factors most likely to be amenable to influence of the benefit of early trajectory palliative care intervention. The mechanism and frame- work for assessment, engagement, and documentation of such encounters will also be presented for discussion. Findings from examination of HF patient patterns in our ow n institution will be presented. Projects in progress will be discussed as a resource for other institut ions to develop plans specific to the needs of t heir patient population. Facil- itated open discussion will offer an opportunity for collaboration to further these efforts Lambrinou E, Kalogirou F. The effects of advanced nursing interventions on patients with heart failure. European Journal of Heart Failure, Supplement Co nference: Heart Failure 2009 Nice France Conference Start: with chr onic diseases like Heart Failure (HF). Despite the recent pharmacological therapies the outcomes of patients wi th HF remain poor. The socioeconomic burden is huge and the scientific community aims to elimi nate the consequences of heart failure via the implementation of cost effective, non pharmacological management programs. Several models of such heart failure management programs have revealed a variety of outcomes. Purpose of this study is to present the effectiveness of a specific alliterative model of management programs that include inpatient discharge pl anning and/or education, c oordinated by a specialist nurse in HF. METHODS: Clinical trials that were published in MEDLINE t he last five years were pooled. The inclusion criteria were: nurse directed non-pharmacological strategies that included an in-patient discharge plan followed by tele- phone contacts and either home visits or clinical based follow up, or both. RESULTS: Eight randomized clinical trials were identified as eligible for the review. Three of the five strategies re- sulted in no beneficial effect of the management on the readm ission rates. Survival free of events was longer in the intervention group in one of the three studies examining t he time between rehospitalizations or death. Two studies measuring the length of stay as an outcome ended up with fewer days in hospital in the intervention group. Two of the studies measuring the quality of life of patients with HF demonstrated significantly higher scores in the interven- tion group, with one claiming short term improvement in qua lity of life. In another study no significant interaction between quality of life and group assignment was observed. In two of the studies that examined the cost of the pro- gram, this was characterized as cost effective. Patient satisfaction was studied by one of the trials and revealed a short-term improvement in the intervention group. T he most recent study showed no reduction in the endpoints including days of hospitalization or death. One of the studies tried to compare a strategy including both clinic and home-based intervention with those applying either a home or a clinic-based approach. These seemed to be equally effective. CONCLUSIONS: Management programs associated with discharge planning have demonstr ated a variety of re- sults. The structural heterogeneity of the programs coul d be a reason. Nevertheless, five of the strategies dis- cussed, can be characterized as effect ive. Further studies are needed in order to determine which model of disease management program is the most effective Intervensjoner knyttet til oppl\u00e6ring av pasienten (6) Anderson MA, Levsen J, Dusio ME, Bryant PJ, Brown SM, Burr CM, et al.

An integrated, systematic review of the literature was used as the research approach. A content analysis of the sample (31 research reports from the years 1986-2004) yielded mult iple factors associated with the hospital readmission of HF patients. Factors and their definitions were extracted, grouped into like categories, and eventually classified into 5 domains-demographic, physiologic, psychosocial, pati ent functioning, and resource utilization.

ABSTRACT: Individuals with chronic heart failure are a vulnerable gr oup of patients, with a poor prognosis and frequent hospital- 35 Resultat isations. Research shows that multidisciplinary educati on outpatient programmes for heart failure (HF) increases the quality of life of these patients and decreases mortality and re hospitalisation respectively. As a result of this re- search, the University Hospital Basel has developed and im plemented a multidisciplinary, nurse-led inpatient pro- gramme. The article describes the development and difficult ies of the programme from its beginning until the verifi- cation of its effectiveness. Based on a systematic review of the literature and principles of action research the pro- gramme was developed by a group of nurses specialised in HF and two physicians under the guidance of an Ad- vanced Practice Nurse student. The gr oup developed a patient pathway and guide lines describing education, skills training sessions for patients, as well as descriptions of responsibilities and tasks of the different members of the multidisciplinary team. To date, an individualised programme with informati on material and specific documentation is offered to patients who receive personalised recommendati ons before their discharge. For the nurses the imple- mentation of the programme was a new challenge of stru ctured counselling in their normal \"busy\" routine because of this challenge the nurse s needed continuing coaching Delgado-Passler P, McCaffrey R. The influences of postdischarge management by nurse practitioners on hospital readmission for heart failure. J Am Acad Nurse Pract 2006;18(4):Apr. ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this literature review is to examine advanced practice nurse (APN)-directed versus registered nurse (RN)-directed telemanagement pr ograms for heart failure patients. DATA SOURCES: Re- search articles identified thr ough CINAHL and OVID databases. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a di rected by an APN after hos pital discharge decreases the costs and frequent rehospitalizations associated with heart failure and improves the patient's quality of life. While APNs are more costly than RNs, it is important to underst and that this level of prov ider has a more significant impact on the outcomes of patients who use the services provided in the comprehensive discharge programs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: An APN-directed heart failure telemanagement program can reduce the rising healthcare costs that result from frequent readmissions. T hese programs can improve the quality of care given to heart failure patients while reducing the cost to the instit ution, the patient, and the healthcare system. When consid- ering the number of older adults hospitalized each year with heart failure, the potential patient benefits and savings to the healthcare system resulting from APN-directed telemanagement are substantial Janssen V, De G, V, Dusseldorp E, Maes S. Lifestyle modification programmes for patients with coronary heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. European Journal of Preventive Cardiology 2013;20(4):August. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification programmes for co ronary heart disease patients have been shown to effec- tively improve risk factors and related health behaviours, quality of life, reincidence, and mortality. However, im- provements in routine cardiac care over the recent year s may offset the incremental benefit associated with older programmes. PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of lifestyle modi fication programmes for coronary heart disease patients de- veloped over the last decade (19992009) by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: The study included 23 trials (involving 11,085 ra ndomized patients). Lifestyle modification programmes were associated with reduced all-cause mortality (summary OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.101.64), cardiac mortality (summary OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.171.88), and cardiac readmissions and non-fatal reinfarctions (summary OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.171.55). Furthermore, lifestyle modification programmes positively affected risk factors and related lifestyle behav- iours at posttreatment (M=10.2 months), and some of these benefits were maintained at long-term follow up (M=33.7 months). Improvements in dietary and exercise behaviour were greater for programmes incorporating all four self-regulation techniques (i.e. goal setting, self -monitoring, planning, and feedback techniques) compared to interventions that included none of these techniques. CONCLUSION: The evidence summarized in this meta-analys is confirms the benefits of lifestyle modification pro- grammes over and above benefits achieved by routine clin ical care alone. 2012 The European Society of Cardiolo- gy Richardson J. Efforts to improve heart failure discharge teaching in a veteran's administration hospital. Heart and Lung: Journal of Acute and Critical Care Conference: 8th Annual Conference of the American Association of Heart Failure Nurses, AAHFN 2012 Chicago, IL United States is costly in both dollars and patient outcomes. This di agnosis is the most common reason for hospital admissions and readm issions in the Medicare system. In addition nearly 50% of patients will die within the first year of their diagnosis. In 1998, the Ve teran's Health Administrati on (VA) developed a Quality En- 36 Resultat hancement Research Initiative (QUERI) focused on improv ing the quality of care provided and reducing the number of admissions due to HF. One of the specific targets of this initiative is encouraging patients to become active part- ners in their care. One way to accomplish this is to prov ide the HF patient with comprehensive, consistent and thor- ough discharge instructions. Increasingly, the responsibilit y for discharge teaching has fallen upon nurses. Providing these nurses with quality tools that meet established HF discharge teaching standards and with easily accessible templates to document their teaching in order to promot e HF discharge teaching and dec rease HF readmissions is the focus of this project. METHODS: Through the authors experience and observati ons as a staff nurse, and through informal peer-to-peer interviews with nursing staff on the medical-surgical unit at a mid-western VA hospital, inconsistencies with HF dis- charge teaching were identified as a po ssible reason for HF readmissions. Nurs es expressed frustration over the lack of a single, consistent source of teaching materials. A literature review was undertaken to identify patient teach- ing resources that included all core performance measur es promoted by the Joint Commission, American Heart Association and the VA. A booklet published by Channing Bete Co mpany, Learning to Live with Heart Failure: Self- Care Handbook, was identified as a resource that met r equirements and expectations. Adoption of this resource was approved by facility leadership and the author undertook one-on-one teaching with identified staff nurse \"cham- pions\" who conducted education and di sseminated information on the unit. Simultaneous discussions with facility information services staff were c onducted, and an electronic HF discharge t eaching template was developed. This template facilitates not only consistent and thorough discharge teaching, but also serves as a formal record of HF teaching and allows for data capture and reporting. RESULTS: The HF discharge teaching project was impl emented February 1, 2012. Staff nurses have expressed their appreciation of having these tools at their disposal, and informal patient in terviews reveal an increase in patient satisfaction with their knowledge level. Statistical data anal ysis measuring the impact of the project on HF readmis- sions is on going. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the impact of the project on HF readmissions, it is the belief of the author that imple- mentation of a consistent and comprehensive HF dischar ge teaching process will positively contribute to both pa- tient outcomes and staff satisfaction Vreeland DG, Rea RE, Montgomery LL. A review of the literature on heart failure and discharge education. [Review]. Crit Care Nurs Q 2011;34(3):235-45. ABSTRACT: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have proposed changes in the health care reimbursement for patients diagnosed with heart failure (HF) if readmission to a hospital occurs within 30 days of their discharge. The Joint Commission (TJC) has identified 6 key education topi cs for HF patients with their families that can result in decreased readmissions. Though the patient may be too ill, critical care nurses have an opportunity to begin the discharge education process immediately with families or ca regivers. This literature review discusses studies fo- cused on discharge education in general and then those studies specific to HF discharge education. This review re- ports on what is known or supported by evidence within 8 major topics. Fina lly, the discussion section summarizes the evidence for discharge education by answering 6 questions that address the \"who and when\" as well as the \"what\" of discharge education Andre hjerte-/karlidelser (4) Abdelaal E, Rao SV, Gilchrist IC, Bernat I, Shroff A, Caputo R, et al. Same-day discharge compared with overnight hospitalization after uncomplicated percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and meta-analysis. [Review]. Jacc: Cardiovascular Interventions 2013;6(2):99-112. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: This study evaluate outcomes of same-day discharge (SDD) following percutaneous coro- nary intervention (PCI) versus overnight hospitalization (ON) BACKGROUND: Although there are data on the safety and feasibility of SDD after PCI, ON continues to be preva- lent METHODS: The Cochrane search strategy was used to search the PubMed database, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for relevant literature. Thirteen studies (5 randomized and 8 observational) of SDD after uncomplicated PCI versus ON met inclusion criteria. Data were pooled usi ng a random effects model, and reported as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outco mes were incidence of total complications, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and rehospitalization within 30 days after PCI RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, involving 111,830 patients we re pooled. There was significant variation in the defi- nition of outcomes across studies. For total complications, the strategy of SDD compared with ON after PCI had an 37 Resultat estimated OR of 1.20 (95% CI: 0.82 CI: 0.27 to 1.66) in observational studies. Similar were found for MACE (randomized, OR: 0.99, 95% 95% to 3.98) at 30 days post PCI CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity ac ross published studies comparing SDD with ON. This, coupled with the low event rate and wide corresponding CIs, suggest that an adequately powered multicenter ran- domized trial comparing SDD with ON would require a very large sample size (>17,000). Until such a trial is com- pleted, SDD after uncomplicated PCI seems a reasonable appr oach in selected patients. Copyright 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Effi cacy of in-hospital multidimensional interventions of secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome a systematic review and meta-analysis. Circulation 2008;117(24):17 . ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND - Secondary prevention programs for pati ents experiencing an acute coronary syndrome have been shown to be effective in the outpatient setting. The effi cacy of in-hospital preventi on interventions administered soon after acute cardiac events is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether in-hospital, patient-level inte rventions targeting multiple cardiovascu lar risk factors reduce all-cause mortali- ty after an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS and RESULTS - Using a prespecified search stra tegy, we included controlled clinical trials and before- after studies of secondary prevention in terventions with at least a patient-l evel component (ie, education, counsel- ing, or patient-specific order sets) initiated in hospital with outcomes of mortality, readmission, or reinfarction rates in acute coronary syndrome patients. We classified the interventi ons as patient-level intervent met our inclu- sion criteria. The summary estimate of 14 studies revealed a re lative risk of all-cause mortality of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.92; n=37'585) at 1 year. However, the apparent benefit depended on study design and level of intervention. The before-after studies suggested reduced mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.90; CI, 1.44; n=99 deat clin inter- ventions including a provider- or sy stem-level intervention suggested reduced mortality compared with patient-level- only interventions. CONCLUSIONS - The evidence for in-hospi tal, patient-level interventions for secondary prevention is promising but not definitive because only before-after studies suggest a signi ficant reduction in mortality. Future research should formally test which components of interventions provi de the greatest benefit. 2008 American Heart Association, Inc de WC, Lauret GJ, Ricciardi W, Ferket B, Teijink J, Spronk S, et al. Lifestyle interventions in patients with coronary heart disease: a systematic review. Am J Prev Med 2013;45(2):207-16. ABSTRACT: CONTEXT: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is responsible for about 15% of all deaths worldwide and is identified as a top priority for decision makers. Both primary and sec ondary prevention are considered key strategies in the pre- vention of CHD. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of nonpharmacologic interventions with multiple lifestyle components in patients with established CHD in co mparison to usual care. For this reason, a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs were performed EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Cochrane Library, MEDL INE, and EMBASE databases were examined until March 31, 2012 (without start date) in order to identify studies addr essing patient-tailored multifactorial lifestyle interven- tions aimed at reducing more than one cardiovascular ri sk factor in patients with established CHD. Primary end- points were fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Se condary outcomes were overall mortality and cardiovascu- lar disease-associated hospital readmissions EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The search strategy yielded 14 unique RCTs, which were considered in the qualitative analysis. Nine of them contributed to the meta-analysis. A random effects model was used to pool the data. The meta-analysis showed a significant risk reduction of 18% (rel 0.82, 95% CI=0.69, cular undergoing multifactorial lifestyle interventions. Further, a nons ignificant reduction of nonfa- tal events, overall mortality and hospital readmissions was found CONCLUSIONS: Multifactorial lifestyle interventions aimed at improving modifiable risk fa ctors in patients with es- tablished CHD reduce the risk for fatal cardiovascular events. Therefore, they may have added value in secondary prevention of CHD. Copyright 2013 American Journal of Prev entive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Supplements Conference: 20th European Days - Annual Meeting of the French Society of Cardiology Paris France Con-ference Start: recommend pharmacologic and lifesty le interventions to reduce recurrence of events in patients with coronary and other atherosclerotic vascular di sease. Based on our systematic review of tested inter- ventions, we developed the ELIPS program, a multidimensi onal secondary prevention program targeting multiple cardiovascular risk factors for patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This programme targets an in- crease in prescription rates by physicians and/or long term medication adherence by patients. Objectives: To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ELIPS programme (M ulti-dimEnsionaL preventIon Program after Acute coro- nary Syndrome), which aims at improving quality of care of patients admitted to hospital with ACS in the Swiss set- ting. METHODS: A total of 2400 patients will be prospectively included in a multicenter study before and after the imple- mentation of the ELIPS program with a follow-up of 12 months. The primary outcome is a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina requiring rehospi talization, revascularization (per- at least 30 days after randomization), and stroke . The secondary endpoints are the isolated endpoints of the primary endpoint as well as cardiovascular mortality, and surrogate outcomes such as cardiovascular risk factor control at follow-up. Expected RESULTS: To demonstrate the benefits of the ELIPS progr am on recurrence rate of cardiovascular events. These results will certainly lead to a generalization of such programs in the field of atherosclerosis Lungesykdommer, astma (2) Banasiak NC, Meadows-Oliver M. pathways for the pediatric patient: ABSTRACT: of the most prevalent chil dhood chronic illnesses in the United States leading to nearly 190,000 pediatric hospitalizations yearly. In response to the increasing number of children with asthma being hospitalized, some institutions have developed and implem ented clinical pathways and are now reporting their find- ings in the literature. The purpose of this paper was to conduct an integrative literature review of studies using an inpatient clinical pathway for the management of pediatric asthma METHOD: Five research-based articles evaluating clinical pathways for t he management of inpatient pediatric asthma were included in this review. The integrative revi ew was conducted using the guidelines set forth by Ganong (1987) RESULTS: The results revealed that clinical pathways appear to be effective in reducing length of stay and hospital costs associated with inpatient pediatric asthma. The pathw ays were not as effective in reducing readmission rates or affecting clinical outcomes for patients such as incr easing asthma education, the us e of controller medications, spacers, and peak flow meters PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Although the pathways are effect ive in reducing hospitalization costs associated with asthma, there was little reported improvement in clinical outcomes. Nurses should ens ure that each pediatric asth- ma hospitalization provides an opportunity to promot e education about asthma. This approach may lead to de- creased asthma admissions and increased self and family m anagement of pediatric asthma. Future research should focus on the clinical outcomes of patients using the inpat ient pathways and also on the development of pathways to be used in outpatient settings that m anage pediatric asthma.

Journal of Asthma and Allergy Educators 2011;2(1):2011. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this integrative review is to describe and assess current research findings and summarize the rela- tionship between action plans and asthma exacerbations in children with asthma. Medline, CINAHL Plus with full text, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were searc hed as well as bibliographies of included studies. Three hundred eighty-five studies were identified. Thirteen studies were identified meeting inclus ion criteria. Eight studies com- pared asthma action plans (AAPs ) with no AAPs. Five studies compared peak flow AAPs to symptom AAPs. Of the 8 studies comparing AAPs with no AAPs, 5 studies concluded that the plans were beneficial to pediatric asthma. One study concluded that AAPs may increase risk for readmission to the hospita l. Another study concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that AAPs along with an educational pa ckage were beneficial in reducing mor- bidity in the subsequent 12 months for preschoolers. A th ird study concluded there were greater costs in the group 39 Resultat with AAPs without better out-comes. Of the 5 studies comparing peak flow AAPs with symptom AAPs, 3 studies found that AAPs are effective for pediatric patients but t here is no benefit of peak flow AAPs over symptom AAPs. Two studies found that peak flow meter use along with an AAP was a more effective way to decrease hospitaliza- tions. Data suggest that AAPs are benefic ial to pediatric asthma patients. Ei ther peak flow-based or symptom-based plans are effective in the control of asthma exacerbati ons. However, there does not appear to be evidence to sup- port the use of peak flow-based AAPs Comino E, Marks G, Daffurn K, Wilson S, Harris M. Randomised controlled trial of home based care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. BMJ 2002;325(7370):938. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate usefulness of limited community based care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmo- nary disease after disc harge from hospital. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial SETTING: Liverpool Health Service and Macarthur Health Service in outer metropolitan Sydney between Septem- ber 1999 and July 2000 PARTICIPANTS: 177 patients randomised into an intervention gr oup (84 patients) and a control group (93 patients) which received current usual care INTERVENTIONS: Home visits by community nurse at one and four weeks after discharge and preventive general practitioner care MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of patients' present ation and admission to hospital; changes in patients' disease-specific quality of life, meas ured with St George's respiratory questionnaire, over three months after dis- charge; patients' knowledge of illness, self management, and satisfaction with care at discharge and three months later; frequency of general practitioner and nurse visits and their satisfaction with care RESULTS: Intervention and control groups showed no differ ences in presentation or adm ission to hospital or in overall functional status. However, the intervention group improved their activity scores and the control group wors- ened their symptom scores. While intervention group patients received more visits from community nurses and were more satisfied with their care, involvement of general pr actitioners was much less (with only 31% (22) remembering receiving a care plan). Patients in the intervention gr oup had higher knowledge scores and were more satisfied. There were no differences in genera l practitioner visits or management CONCLUSIONS: This brief intervention after acute care improved patients' knowledge and some aspects of quality of life. However, it failed to prevent presentation and readmission to hospital Jeppesen E, Brurberg KG, Vist GE, Wedzicha JA, Wright JJ, Greenstone M, et al. Hospital at home for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) 2012;5(pp CD003573):2012. ABSTRACT: Hospital at home schemes are a recently adopted method of service delivery for the management of acute exac- erbations of chronic obstructive pu lmonary disease (COPD) aimed at reduc ing demand for acute hospital inpatient beds and promoting a patient-centred approach through adm ission avoidance. However, evidence in support of such a service is contradictory. To evaluate the efficacy of hospital at home compared to hospital inpatient care in acute exacerbations of COPD. Trials were identified from searches of electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Airways Group Regist er (CAGR). The review authors checked the refer- ence lists of included trials. The CAGR was search ed up to February 2012. The additional databases were searched up to October 2010. We consi dered randomised controlled trials where patients presented to the emer- gency department with an exacerbation of their COPD. Studies must not have recruited patients for whom treatment at home is usually not viewed as an re sponsible option (e.g. patients with an impaired level of consciousness, acute confusion, acute changes on the radiogr aph or electrocardiogram, arterial pH less than 7.35, concomitant medical conditions). Two review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extract- ed data for each of the included trials. Eight trials with 870 patients were included in the review and showed a signif- icant reduction in readmission rates for hospital at home co mpared with hospital inpatient care of acute exacerba- tions of COPD (risk ratio (RR)0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.59 to 0.99; P=0.04). Moreover, we observed 40 Resultat a trend towards lower mortality in the hospital at home group, but the pooled effect estimate did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07). For health-related quality of life, lung function (FEV1) and direct costs, the quality of the available evi dence is in general too weak to make firm CONCLUSIONS. Selected patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with acute exacerbations of COPD can be safely and successfully treated at home with support from respiratory nurses. We found evidence of moderate quality that hospital at home may be advantageous with respect to readmission rates in these patients. Treatment of acute exacerbation of COPD in hospital at home also show a trend towards reduced mortality rate when compared with conventional inpatient treatment, but t hese results did not reach statistical significance (mod- erate quality evidence). For other outcomes than readmission and mortality rate, we assessed the evidence to be of low or very low quality Ram FS, Wedzicha JA, Wright J, Greenstone M.

Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) (4) (pp CD003573), 2003 Date of Publication: 2003 2003;(Online):2003. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hospital at home schemes are a recently adopted method of service delivery for the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary dis ease aimed at reducing dem and for acute hospital in- patient beds and promoting a patient centered approach th rough admission avoidance. Ho wever, evidence in sup- port of such a service is contradictory. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of \"hospital at home\" compared to hospital inpatient care in acut e exacerbations of chronic obs tructive pulmonary disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Central Register of indi- vidual respiratory journals; bibliographi es of included trials were all searched and contact with authors was made to obtain studies. The most recent searches were carri ed out in August 2003. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only random- ised controlled trials were considered where patients pres ented to the emergency department with an exacerbation of their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies must not have recrui ted patients that are usually deemed obligatory admissions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independ ently selected articles for inclusion, evaluated methodological quality of the studies and abstracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies with 754 patients were included in the review. Studies provided data on hospital readmission and mortality both of which were not significant ly different when the two study groups were compared (RR 0.89; 95%CI 0.72 to 1.12 & RR 0.61; 95%CI 0.36 to 1.05, respectively). Both the patients and the carers pre-ferred hospital at home schemes to inpatient care (RR 1.53; 95%CI 1.23 to 1.90). Other reported outcomes included few studies. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: This review has shown that one in four carefully selected patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulm onary disease can be safely and successfully treated at home with support from respirat ory nurses. This review f ound no evidence of significant differences between \"hospital at home\" patients and hospital inpatients for readmission rates and mortality at two to three months after the initial exacerbation. Both the pat ients and carers preferred schemes to inpatient care Reishtein JL.

Exclusion criteria included patients with impaired consciousness, acute conf usion, acute pH<7.35, concomit ant medical conditions, or who attended the ED for social reasons. 2 independent reviewers assessed the metodological quality of studies us ing the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment (adequate, uncertain, or clearly inadequate)Ou tcomes: readmission to hospital, mortality, number of patients with acute COPD exacerbations, and costs MAIN RESULTS Of the 7 RCTs (n = 754) that met the se lection criteria, 6 had adequate allocation concealment, 41 Resultat and 1 had uncertain allocation concealment. HaH comprised care by a specialist nurse according to initial assess- ment in the ED (guided by the hospital medical team), and visits by a respiratory nurse until discharge from care. Inpatient care comprised usual treatment at the discre tion of the hospital medical team Meta-analysis was done using a fixed effects model. The HaH and inpatient groups did not differ for the number of patients readmitted to hospital or for mortality (table). 4 trials reported cost analyses: 2 found that HaH was less expensive than inpatient care (average savings per patient pounds 536, 95% CI pounds 532 to pounds 540), 1 found that the mean health service cost for HaH was approximately half of inpatient care ( pounds 867 v pounds 1405, p = 0.003), and 1 trial reported a savings of 201 bed days/year with HaH care CONCLUSION: In patients with acute exacerbation of ch ronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hospital at home does not differ from inpatient care fo r hospital readmissions or mortality Intervensjoner p\u00e5 sykehuset (3) Leonard B. Review: existing evidence does not support nurse led interventions in chronic obstructive pul- monary disease. Evidence Based Nursing 2006;9(2):56. ABSTRACT: In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are nurse led chronic disease management innova- tions more effective than usual care? METHODS Data sources: 16 English language and 8 Dutc h language citation databases (1980 to January 2005), conference proceedings of 7 respiratory associatio ns, and researchers and practitioners in the field STUDY SELECTION AND ASSESMENT: random ised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated clinical service inter- ventions or care packages aimed at improving the management of community dwelling patients with COED and were led, coordinated, or delivered by nurses. Trials that evaluated drugs, hospital at home or early discharge for acute exacerbations, or educational interv entions for healthcare providers, or tr ials with a minority of patients with COP) were excluded. Methodological quality of individual st udies was assessed using the Delphi list and the 5 point Jadad scale OUTCOMES: mortality, use of healthcare resources, activiti es of daily living (ADL), patients' health related quality of life (HRQOL), and corers' quaky of life MAIN RESULTS: 9 RCTs (n= 1428, mean age 63-71 y) and 1 systematic review that included 4 of the individual RCTs met the selection criteria. Methodological quality of the trials was generally low. 2 RCTs involved brief inter- ventions (about 1 mo in duration) after a hospital admissi on; 7 RCTs involved intensive or long term interventions (about 1 y in duration). 5 RCTs included home visits by a nurse, 1 RCT was exclusivel y clinic based, and 3 did not provide a clear description. The inte rventions used a case management approach and promoted self care, including education about medication and advice on smoking cessation, fitness, and identifying acute exacerbations. Meta- analysis of 7 long term or intensive in tervention trials showed no difference in mortality (table). The 2 RCTs on brief interventions showed no difference in hospital readmissions. Among the long term trials, 2 showed a reduction in readmissions favouring nurse led inte rventions, and 3 showed no difference. Me ta-analysis of 3 RCTs measuring HRQOL with the St George's respiratory questionnaire at 3-6 months of follow up showed no difference between groups (Cohen's d standardised difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.26). The evidence was insufficient or too weak to show an effect on patients' ADL or carers' quality of life CONCLUSION: Little or no evidence exis ts that nurse led chronic disease management innovations are more effec- tive than usual care in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Lodewijckx C, Sermeus W, Panella M, Deneckere S, Leigheb F, Decramer M, et al. Impact of care pathways for in-hospital management of COPD exacerbation: A suboptimal, and outcomes are poor. Care pathways are a possible strategy for optimizing care proc esses and outcomes. Objectives: The aim of the literature review was to explore characteristics of existing care pathways for in-hospital management of COPD exacerbations and to address their impact on performance of care proc esses, clinical outcomes, and team functioning. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for arti cles published between 1990 and 2010 in the electronic data- bases of Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Ma in inclusion criteria were (I) patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation; (II) implementation and evaluation of a care pathway; (III) report of original research, includ- ing experimental and quasi experimental designs, variance analysis, and interv iews of professionals and patients 42 Resultat about their perception on pathway effectiveness. RESULTS: Four studies with a quasi experimental desi gn were included. Three studies used a preG\u00c7\u00f4post test design; the fourth study was a non randomized controll ed trial comparing an experimental group where patients were treated according to a care pathway with a contro l group where usual care was provided. The four studied care pathways were multidisciplinary structured care plans , outlining time-specific interventions and respon- sibilities by discipline. Statistic analys es were rarely performed, and the trials used very divergent indicators to eval- uate the impact of the care pathways. The studies descri bed positive effects on blood sampling, daily weight meas- urement, arterial blood gas measurement, referral to rehabilit ation, feelings of anxiety, length of stay, readmission, and in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Research on COPD care pathways is very limited. The studies described few positive effects of the care pathways on diagnostic processes and on clinical outcomes. Though due to limited statistical analysis and weak design of the studies, the internal validity of resy kts is limited. Therefore, based on these studies the impact of care pathways on COPD exacerbation is inconclusi ve. These findings indicate the need for properly designed research like a cluster randomized cont rolled trial to evaluate the impact of COPD care pathways on performance of care processes, clinical outcomes, and teamwork Taylor SJ, Candy B, Bryar RM, Ramsay J, Vrijhoef HJ, Esmond G, et al. Effectiveness of innovations in nurse led chronic disease management for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systemat- ic ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of innovations in management of chronic disease involving nurses for patients with chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disease (COPD) DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials DATA SOURCES: 24 electronic databases searched for English or Dutc h language studies published between January 1980 and January 2005 REVIEW METHODS: Included studies described inpatien t, outpatient, and community based interventions for chronic disease management that were led, coordinated, or delivered by nu rses. Hospital at home and early dis- charge schemes for acute exacerbat ions of COPD were excluded RESULTS: We identified nine relevant randomised contro lled trials, most of which had some potential methodologi- cal flaws. All the interventions seemed to be variations on a case management model. The interventions described could be divided into brief (one month) and longer term (a round a year) or more intensive interventions. Only two studies examined the effect of brief interventions, thes e found little evidence of any benefit. Meta-analysis of the long term interventions failed to detect any influence on mortality at 9-12 months' follow-up (Peto odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.26) . There was evidence that the long te rm interventions had not improved pa- tients' health related quality of life, psychological well being, disability, or pulmonar y function. The evidence on whether long term interventions reduc ed readmissions to hospital was equivoca l, but the only study exclusively directed at patients on long term oxygen therapy reported a reduction in readmission. We identified several out- comes where little or no evidence was available; these included patients' sa tisfaction, self management skills, ad- herence with treatment recommendations, the likelihood of sm oking cessation, and the effect of the interventions on carers CONCLUSION: There is little evidence to date to suppor t the widespread implementation of nurse led management interventions for COPD, but the data are too sparse to ex clude any clinically relevant benefit or harm arising from such interventions.

Factors associated patients are at risk for unplanned readmissi ons due to the various complications they may experi- ence following surgery. The purpose of this report is to crit ically review the literature related to predictors of un- planned readmissions of cardiac surgery patients following disc harge from the hospital. A literature review was con- ducted from 1989 to 1999 using MEDLINE and CINAHL, with the following key words: cardiac surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, recovery, and readmission. The literature revealed that gender and race do have an effect on how well a patient will recover following cardiac surgery. It was also found that patients with longer lengths of stay due to complications were at greater risk for readmission following discharge from the hospital. There was no evi- 43 Resultat dence that decreased length of stay for this patient group l ed to a greater number of readmissions. Implications for nurses include the need for improved coordination of patient care and implementation of effective discharge plan- ning in high-risk patients. Additional research is needed to develop interventi ons to decrease readmissions of wom- en and African Americans and other racial groups specific to their particula r risk factors for readmission following cardiac surgery.

The use of coaching in the clinic al setting has implications for nurses in that it can be used to assess behav- iours, knowledge, and learning needs; pr ovide individualized education that is reflective of a patient's identified learning needs; collaborate with patients in setting goals; identify barriers and engage in problem-solving to over- come barriers; and create a specific plan for follow-up Magnus PC, Chaisson K, Kramer RS, Ross CS, Boss RA, Agha SA, et al. Causes of 30-day readmission after cardiac surgery in Northern New England. Circulation Conference: American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2011 Orlando, FL is a high rate of readmission within 30 days following discharge from a hospitalization for cardiac surgery. This is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost of care. A systematic review of the medical record could identify details of the process of care and causes of readmissi on that are actionable and could lead to a decrease in rates of readmission. METHODS. From our regional registry of open heart surg ery, we identified 268 consecutive patients readmitted within 30 days (mean=11 days) of their index procedure. Tr ained health professionals systematically abstracted the records of their index and readmission hospitalizations, info rmation that was merged to existing registry data. RESULTS. Readmitted patients had more comorbid conditions at the time of their index procedure and were more likely to have valve surgery (30.2% v 23.2%). Early follow-up appointments were recommended for all patients but variably scheduled (CT surgery 54.1%; PCP 1.1%). A minority of patients (23.1%) were seen as outpatients prior to their readmission. Infections (24%), effusions (20%), and rhythm disturbances (16%) were the most common prima- ry causes of readmission Common of causes of readmi ssion following open heart surgery is feasible. Our pilot study suggests that more attention to volume status and management of effusions c ould substantially decrease rates of readmission Pasienter som har gjennomg\u00e5tt en operasjon Senagore AJ, Delaney CP. Enhanced recovery pathways optimize health outcomes and resource utilization: A meta-analysis of Surgery Health care systems care to incr easingly complex and elderly patients. Colorectal surgery is a prime example, with high volumes of major proc edures, significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and 44 Resultat unplanned readmissions. This situation is ex acerbated by an exponential rise in costs that threatens the stability of health care systems. Enhanced recovery pathways (ERP) have been proposed as a means to reduce morbidity and improve effectiveness of care. We have reviewed the evi dence supporting the implementation of ERP in clinical practice. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched for randomized, controlled trials comparing ERP with traditional care in colorectal surgery. Systematic reviews and papers on ERP based on data published in major surgical and anesthesiology journals were critically reviewed by international contributors, experienced in the development and implementation of ERP. RESULTS: A random-effect Bayesian meta-analysis was per formed, including 6 randomized, controlled trials total- izing 452 patients. For patients adhering to ERP, length of st ay decreased by 2.5 days (95% credible interval [CrI] - 3.92 to -1.11), whereas 30-day morbidity was halved (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CrI, 0.36-0.73) and readmission was not increased (relative risk, 0.59; 95% CrI, 0.14-1.43) when compared with patients undergoing traditional care. CONCLUSION: Adherence to ERP achieves a reproducible improvement in the quality of care by enabling stand- ardization of health care processes. Thus, while accelera ting recovery and safely reducing hospital stay, ERPs op- timize utilization of health care resources. ERPs can and should be routinely used in care after colorectal and other major gastrointestinal procedures. 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved Ahmed J, Khan S, Lim M, Chandrasekaran TV, Macfie J. Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols - com- pliance and variations in practice during ro utine colorectal surgery. Colorectal Disease 2012;14(9):September. ABSTRACT: AIM Although there are numerous studies on the efficacy of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols in reducing length of stay, the long-term compliance to such protocols in routine clinic al practice has not been well documented. The aim of this study was to review the published literature on compliance to ERAS in patients under- going colorectal surgery in routine clinical practice. METHOD Medline, Embase and PubMed databases were sear ched to identify studies that focused on compliance to ERAS protocols during routine clinical practice. Fourteen studies fulfilled t he inclusion criteria and a total of 19 perioperative ERAS modalities were identified across these studies. RESULTS None of the studies used all 19 ERAS modalities wi thin their ERAS protocols. Compliance to the various modalities varied considerably between studies and, in general, was poorest during the postoperative period. The use of epidural had the highest compli ance (between 67 and 100%), whereas the use of transverse incisions (25%) had the lowest compliance. Length of stay in hospital ranged from 2 to 13days. Higher compliance was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay. However, reduced lengt h of hospital stay was associated with a high rate of readmission. CONCLUSION There is significant variation in the com ponents of, as well as in compliance to, ERAS protocols in daily practice. This may contribute to the observed variat ion between the studies in length of hospital stay. A stand- ardized and practically feasible ERAS protocol should be established in order to improve the implementation and optimal outcome. 2011 The Authors.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of enhanced recovery programmes in esophageal cancer surgery. Gastroenterology Conference: Digestive Disease Week 2013, DDW 2013 AIMS. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine the influence of enhanced recovery programmes (ERPs) on outcomes after esophageal cancer surgery. METHODS. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Clin icalTrials.gov were sear ched for studies on outcomes of esphagectomy in enhanced recovery programme or fast-track programmes. The primary outcome measure was post-operative duration of hospital stay (LOHS), and se condary outcome measures were selected based on inclu- sion in two or more studies. Statistical analysis was perfo rmed using odds ratio (OR) as the summary statistic. RESULTS. Five studies totalling 854 patients with esophageal cancer were analysed. LOHS was significantly short- er after ERP, when compared with controls (CON, standar dised mean difference SMD -0.51, 95% confidence inter- val to -0.35, P < .00001), but with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2=96%, P < .00001). ERP was associated with less operative morbidity (P < .0001), oper ative mortality (30-day mortality, p=0.020), and fewer anastomotic leaks (p=0.010). ERP was not associated with a higher incidence of pulmonary complications (p=0.560) or more frequent readmission to hospital (p=0 .800). Conclusion. Multimodal, standardised approaches to perioperative esophagectomy care was feasible, and cost effective 45 Resultat Hall T, Dennison A, Bilku D, Metcalfe M, Garcea G. Enhanced recovery programmes in hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery: A systematic review. HPB Conference: 10th World Congress of the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Paris France Conference Start: recovery programme' (ERP) refers to multi-modal strategies aiming to streamline peri-operative care pathway s, to maximise effectiveness and minimise costs. Whilst the results of ERP in colorectal surgery are well-repor ted; there have been no reviews examining if these concepts could be safely applied to Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic (HPB) surgery. This systematic review aims to appraise the current evidence for ERP in HPB surgery. METHODS: A Medline literature search 'panc reatic' or 'hepatic'. The primary end- point was length of postoperative hospital stay. Secondar y end-points were morbidity, mortality and readmission rate. RESULTS: Ten articles were retrieved describing an ERP. ERP protocols varied slightly between studies. A reduc- tion in length of stay was a consistent finding following t he incorporation of ERP when compared to historical con- trols. This was not at the expense of increased rates of readmission, morbidity or mortality in any study. CONCLUSION: The introduction of an ERP in HPB surgery appea rs safe and feasible. Currently, many of the prin- ciples of the multi-modal pathway are derived from the co lorectal ERP and distinct differences exist which may im- pede its implementation in HPB surgery Lemmens L, van ZR, Vanhaecht K, Kerkkamp H. Systematic review: indicators to evaluate clinical pathways for review on clinical pathways fo r gastrointestinal surgery was performed. The aim was to study indicators that are used to evaluate these clinic al pathways and to study which effects of clinical pathways are reported METHODS: A search was performed for the period from January 2000 to November 2006 in MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. The Leuven Clinical Pathway Compass was used to categorize the indicators reported in literature RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were selected, of whic h 16 were controlled studies. The studies assessed most frequently complication rates, re-admissions, mortality and length of stay. More specific indicators like time to start defecation and time to return to enteral feeding were repo rted as well. None of the studies reported adverse effects in any of the domains of the Clinical Pathway Compass CONCLUSION: Clinical pathways for gastrointestinal surger y can enhance efficiency of care without adverse effects on outcome. Specific indicators to evaluat e these clinical pathways are time to return to enteral feeding and time to defecate. Furthermore, additional to complication rates, number of re-admissions, mortality and length of stay, indi- cators such as the number of re-operations, pain score s and intensive care unit admi ssion can be assessed to mon- itor effectiveness and patient safety of the clinical pathways.

Int J Colorectal Dis 2012;27(12):1549-54. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date meta-analysis exploring the safety and efficacy of enhanced recovery programs after colorectal resection METHOD: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane database sear ches were performed for relevant studies published be- tween January 1966 and April 2012. All randomized controlled tria ls on fast track (FT) colorectal surgery were re- viewed systematically. The main end points were short-term morbidity, length of primary postoperative hospital stay, length of total postoperative stay, readmission rate, and mortality RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials with 852 pati ents were included. The total length of hospital stay difference (95% confidence interval ), -1.88 interval), 0.69 (0.51, 0.93), p=0.01] were significantly reduced in the enhanced recovery group. There was no statistically significant difference in readmi ssion (risk ratio (RR) 0.90; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.53, p=0.69) and mortality rates (RR 0.40 to 2.57, p=0.97) 46 Resultat CONCLUSION: Results suggested that enhanced recovery after surgery pathways can be able to reduce the length of stay and complication rates after major colorectal sur gery without compromising patient safety.

The goals of this review were to identify how recovery is measured in studies of ERAS pathways and provide recomm endations for the design of future studies. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was conducted. Eligible studies must have described an ERAS pathway conforming to est ablished consensus guidelines. Prospective studies of ERAS pathways for abdominal surgery published between 2000- 2011 were considered. Two independent reviewers evaluated 981 citations for eligibility and extracted data from the eligible studies. All outcomes were recorded and classified as per the Wilson-Cl eary model. This model links clinical variabl es to quality of life by classifying out- comes on a continuum of increasing complexity beginning with physiologic variables and progressing through symp- tom status, functional status, general heal th perceptions and finally overall quality of life. The phase of recovery measured was defined as early (until discharge from recove ry room), intermediate (from recovery room discharge until hospital discharge) and late (from discharge until return to baseline). RESULTS: Fourteen randomized trials and 35 prospective cohort studieswere included. Themost common \"recov- ery\",outcome reported was duration of hospitalization, wh ich was reported in all studies. Other frequently reported outcomes included complications (90 %) and hospital readm ission (76 %). Biologic outcomes were reported in 63 % of studies including time to return of gastrointestinal functi on (49 %), changes inpulmonary function(18 %), (10 %), changes inbodycomposit ion(6 %)and immunologicmeas ures (12 %). Outcomes pertaining to symp- toms were reported less commonly (49 % of studies) and included: pain (39 %), fatigue (27 %), nausea (21 %), analgesia use (12 %) and sleep disturbance (6 %). Functi onal outcomes, including mobilization (31 %), ability to perform activities of daily living (6 %) and return towork (8 %) were uncommonly reported (41 %of studies).Quality of life was reported in only 12 %of studies. Baseline asse ssment of reported outcomes were reported in 39 %. All studies reported in-hospital outcomes (i ntermediate phase of recovery)while only 37 %reported post discharge (late) outcomes other than complications or readmission. CONCLUSION: Themost commonly reported outcome of ERAS pathways was duration of hospitalization. Patient- centered outcomes like functional status and quality of life,wh ich reflect important dimensions of recovery, were rarely reported. Future studies of ERAS pathways shoul d include more patient-centered outcomes to better esti- mate recovery, particularly those o ccurring after discharge from hospital Oles M, Fitzgerald JEF, Stewart J, Maxwell-Armstrong C, Acheson A. Enhanced recovery for can- cer surgery: Improving post-Discharge support. Colorectal Disease Conference: 4th Annual Meeting of the European Society of Coloproctology Prague Czech Republic Conference Start: Recovery protocols are increasingly facilitat ing early hospital discharge. Recent meta-analysis of clinical trials indicates higher readmi ssion rates than traditional care, although fa ctors precipitating this are unclear. This study investigated community practitioners' experi ences of enhanced recovery following colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. METHOD: Patients identified from pros pective cancer registry at regional teaching hospital from January 2007 to September 2008. General Practitioners (GPs) of survivors contacted retrospectively wi th 8-item questionnaire as- sessing knowledge and experience of caring for enhanced recovery patients. RESULTS: 187 patients underwent enhanced recovery CRC su rgery. 128 unique GPs contacted; response rate = 69 (53.9%). 91.3% were not aware of enhanced recovery protocols. Major postoperative problems encountered: infection (13.0%), inadequate communication from hospital (36.2%), inadequate nursing resources (15.9%). 27.5% of respondents felt they had inadequate facilities to deal with enhanced recovery patients. Extra facilities required: improved nursing resources (44.9%). 40.6% of respondents stated communication issues as main factor hindering patient care. Key themes: need for detailed/prompt discharge plan and contacts for surgical team. CONCLUSION: Given little knowledge of enhanced recovery after discharge, surgical teams should educate and improve communication with community practitioners in or der to provide better postdi scharge support to minimize readmissions 47 Resultat Rawlinson A, Kang P, Evans J, Khanna A. A systematic review of enhanced recovery protocols in colorectal surgery. Colorectal has been with a complication rate of 15-20% and mean post- operative inpatient stays of 6-11 days. The principles of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) are well estab- lished and have been developed to optimise peri-operative care and facilitate discharge. The purpose of this sys- tematic review is to present an updated review of peri-oper ative care in colorectal surgery from the available evi- dence and ERAS group recommendations METHODS: Systematic searches of the PubMed and EmbaseTM databases and the Cochrane library were con- ducted. A hand search of bibliographies of identified studi es was conducted to identify any additional ar ticles missed by the initial search strategy RESULTS: A total of 59 relevant studies were identifi ed. These included six randomised controlled trials and seven clinical controlled trials that fulfilled the inclusion criter ia. These studies showed reducti ons in duration of inpatient stays in the ERAS groups compared with more traditional ca re as well as reductions in morbidity and mortality rates CONCLUSIONS: Reviewing the data reveals that ERAS pr otocols have a role in reducing post-operative morbidity and result in an accelerated recovery following colorectal sur gery. Similarly, both primary and overall hospital stays are reduced significantly. However, the available evidence s uggests that ERAS protocols do not reduce hospital readmissions or mortality. These findi ngs help to confirm that ERAS prot ocols should now be implemented as the standard approach for peri-operative care in colorectal surgery Varadhan KK, Neal KR, Dejong CH, Fearon KC, O, Lobo DN. The enhanced recovery after sur-gery (ERAS) pathway for patients undergoing major elective open colorectal SUMMARY: BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway is to at- tenuate the stress response to surgery and enable rapid recove ry. The objective of this meta-analysis was to study the differences in outcomes in patients undergoing major el ective open colorectal surgery within an ERAS pathway and those treated with conventional perioperative care. METHODS: Medline, Embase and Cochrane database sear ches were performed for relevant studies published between January 1966 and November 2009. All randomized cont rolled trials comparing ERAS with conventional perioperative care were selected. The outcome measures st udied were length of hospital stay, complication rates, readmission rates and mortality. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials with 452 pati ents were included. The number of individual ERAS ele- ments used ranged from 4 to 12, with a mean of 9. The length of hospital stay [weighted mean difference (95% confidence interval): inter- val): 0.53 (0.44, 0.64)] were significantly reduced in t he enhanced recovery group. There was no statistically signifi- cant difference in readmission and mortality rates.

Two independent reviewers assessed studies for inclus ion and exclusion based on methodological quality criteria prior to undertaking data extraction. Summary estimates of treatment effect s using a fixed effect model were produced with RevMan 1.0.2, using weighted means for length-of-stay data and re lative risks of morbidity, mortality and readmission rates RESULTS: Analysis of four papers including 376 patients dem onstrated primary and total length-of-stays (primary + readmission length-of-stay) to be signifi cantly reduced (P < 0.001) with ER programmes [weighted mean differences of -3.64 days (95% confidence interval, -3.75 days (95% CI-5.11 to -2.40)]. Analysis of controlled clinical trial data showed morbidity rates to be reduced and readmission rates increased. These trends were not seen amongst the randomized controlled trial dat a. There were no differences in mortality rates CONCLUSION: Enhanced recovery programmes after colorect al resections reduce lengt h-of-stay and may reduce 48 Resultat 30 days morbidity and increase 30 days readmission without increasing mortality.

Enhanced recovery pathways after surgery for oe- sophageal cancer: Promising results, limited evidence and the absence of minimally invasive surgery. Surgical Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques Conference: 20th International Congress of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, EAES 2012 Brussels Belgium Conference BACKGROUND: The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ER AS) programme represents a multimodal approach that aims to restore the functional capacity of surgical patients to their pre-morbid state more effectively and faster than conventional peri-operative regimes. Ai ms: To evaluate the feasibility of enhanced recovery (ER) protocols in pa- tients undergoing surgery for oesophageal cancer and assess their effect on the outcomes of this complicated pro- cedure that has historically been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A systematic review of the relevant literature published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Collaboration Library in English language during the last 20 years. RESULTS: Six studies were identified, four of which we re retrospective case-series and two prospective compara- tive ones with historical controls (Lev el of evidence 3). The median length of hospital stay (LOS) for patients in the ER groups in all studies varied between 7-10 days (range 5-98 days) with median mortality rate 0.65% (range 0%- 4.4%) and median overall complication rate 26% (range 18% -45%). The readmission rate, reported in two studies only, was in the order of 4%. Between the two comparative studies, the earliest one did not demonstrate any differ- ence in LOS, morbidity or mortality rates between the ER group and control, whereas the most recent study showed statistically significant benefit in all above outcomes in fav our of the ER group. The role of minimally invasive ap- proach was not evaluated because patients in a ll studies were operated via open approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence underpinning the use of ER protocols in oesophageal surgery is currently limited and of low quality. The preliminary results are promising, indicating that implementation of ER for these patients is feasible and can achieve short hospital stay with acceptable morbidity and mortality. More robust evidence, in the form of randomised controlled trials, is required, including, in particular, the role of minimally invasive oesophagectomy Zhuang CL, Ye XZ, Zhang XD, Chen BC, Yu Z.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery programs in colorectal surgery aim to attenuate the surgical stress response, reduce complicat ions and shorten hospital stay OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of enhanced recovery after surgery programs in colorectal surgery in comparison with traditional care DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were electronically searched (date range, January 1966 to July 2012) STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials were selected that compared enhanced recovery after surgery programs with traditional care in elective colorectal surgery INTERVENTION: Articles were reviewed independently by 2 reviewers, who extracted the data and assessed the quality of the included studies. The outcome measures we re analyzed, and the quality of evidence for each out- come was assessed by using the Grading of Recommendat ions Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were primary and total postoperative hospital stay, readmission rates, total postoperative complications (inc luding general and surgical co mplications), and mortality RESULTS: Thirteen studies (total, 1910 patients) were incl uded in the meta-analysis. In comparison with traditional care, enhanced recovery after surgery programs were associ ated with significantly decreased primary hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -2.44 days; 95% CI, -3.06 to -1.83 days; p stay -2.39 days; 95% CI, -3.70 to -1.09 (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58-0.86; p = 0.0006), and general complications (relative risk, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.82; p < 0.0001). No signifi- cant differences were found for readmission rates, surgical complications, and mortality LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the risk of bias in most included studies CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced recovery after surgery program s are safe and effective, and increased implementation is justified for perioperative care in colorectal surger y.

Enterostomal therapy nu rsing in the Canadian home care sector: what is its value? Journal of Wound, Ostomy & Continence Nursing 2010;37(1):53-64. ABSTRACT: Approximately one-third of all home care patients have wound care needs. Home care patients tend to be older and have multiple chronic diseases rendering them at ri sk for developing wounds and impairing their ability to heal wounds. Enterostomal therapy (ET) nurs es have expertise in wound, ostomy , and continence care, and were re- cently recognized by the Canadian Nurses Association as a specialty practice. We completed a systematic review in order to identify and synthesize evidence about the value of ET nurses in the Canadian home care sector, focusing on wound care. A literature search was conducted, using 9 computerized library databases. Eight articles were identified for review; each was analyz ed using qualitative content analysis. Tw o themes emerged from our analysis: (1) assessing the outcomes of ET nurse involvement in cli ent care and (2) methods for using ET nurses' expertise. Within these themes, the benefits of ET nurses working in home care were identified: (1) a decreased number of visits, (2) reduced wound-healing times, (3) successful heali ng, (4) reduced cost of wound care, (5) greater support for nurses and families, (6) fewer emergency department visi ts, (7) fewer hospital read missions, (8) increased inter- est in education in wound care among other nurses, and (9 ) standardized protocols for wound care. Although only 8 studies were located for this review, their findings provi de evidence that ET nurses' c ontributions to wound care are not only positive but also necessary in the home care sector Pintar PA. An intrepreneurial innovative role: integration of the clinical nurse specialist and infection pre-vention professional. Clin Nurse Spec 2013;27(3):123-7. ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: Hospital quality and financial sustainability re ly on reducing healthcare-associated events/infections, length of stay, and readmissions. This project focused on designing an integrated role for the clinical nurse special- ist (CNS) and the infection prevention professional (IPP) to proactively manage the deliv ery of evidence-based prac- tice to high-risk surgical patients BACKGROUND: The healthcare industry is in the midst of a paradigm shift driven by changing health policy focus- ing on quality indicators, patient satisfaction, and lowering costs. Coupled with these indicators is the expectation and responsibility to provide evi dence-based practice at all levels of the healthcare continuum. This paradigm shift places healthcare facilities in a very competitive atmos phere as they rally for the revenue of a fixed payer mix DESCRIPTION: A literature search using CINHAL, P ubMed, and the CNS national listserve databases was com- pleted to identify if there was any previously written info rmation available on an integrated role of the CNS/IPP. An online business plan template was used to communicate t he significance, implications , and return on organizational investment to practice with establishing this role. Chr onic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, conges- tive heart failure, and colonization with multidrug-resist ant organisms can place patients at an increased risk for developing a surgical site infection or complications. The CNS/IPP will proacti vely manage these risk factors, includ- ing the patient and family in a preventive care model to manage the acute inpatient high -risk surgical patient. Care management will include coordinated, collaborative, and consul tative follow-up by the CNS/IPP in the acute care, long-term care facilities, and home settings INNOVATION: The infection prevention skill set brings a le vel of clinical expertise that makes a unique CNS. The IPP is immersed in using epidemiologica l principles that examine the impact of comorbidities and the added risk that can contribute to developing a surgical site infection. This CNS/IPP in corporates the CNS Spheres of Influence Model and the Association of Professionals in Infection Prevention Competency Model. This combination advanced practice nurse uses a nurse-managed model of care focus ed on patient/family education, prevention, and self-care management. Therefore, this specific and specialized practice will bring value to the organization by improving fi- nancial outcomes through reducing infections , readmission rates, and length of stay OUTCOME: By providing this level of focused care, pati ent satisfaction will improve and system financial stability will be supported by decreasing hospital readmissions, length of stay, and other hospital-acquired conditions that the surgical candidate is prone to developing CONCLUSION: The critical juncture in healthcare is pr oviding opportunities for inno vation by examining the CNS role and considering the feasibility of pai ring it with the infection preventioni st skills. This pairing provides an un- precedented opportunity to improve patient outcomes across t he continuum of care. This provider has the ability to influence the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality indicators in a positive way by using implementa- tion science to partner with system/organization stakeholders that focuses on prevention rather than reactive care processes 50 Resultat IMPLICATIONS: The dynamic trends in healthcare continue to drive \"intrepreneurial,\" innovative, and creative ways of thinking; provide clinical practice that has the ability to perform nimbly; and maintain a proactive vision to provide quality care to a diverse patient population. This CNS/IPP role meets the dynamic proactive planning that will shift with patient, system, and nursing needs to deliver cost-effe ctive managed care to improve the health of our patients Intervensjoner knyttet til tidsramme for behandling J-M.

Were considered as criteria applied to surgical procedure (mean operative time , conversion rate to open surgery, the severity of appen- dicitis); Day Case Surgery (unexpect ed consultation, hospital readmission rate s, reoperation, mean LOS), mean lost time injury and mean delay before coming back to work. Patient satisfaction was recorded too. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2011, 11 studies were dealing with DCA (retrospective (n = 6), prospective (n = 4) or case-control study (n = 1). 814 adults were subject ed to Day Case appendectomy. 129 (15.8%) were discharged within 12 hours, 459 (56.4%) within 24 hours and 226 (27.8%) within 72 hours. The surgical technique was consid- ered as feasible for any approach i.e. laparoscopic one or open one. The conversion rate to open surgery was 5.37%, mean operative time was 46.14 minutes. The charac teristics of DCA are unexpected consultation rate of 3.16%, hospital readmission rate of 2.01% and reoperation's rate of 0.63%. The mortality rate was null, overall mor- bidity was 4.17%., and patients satisfaction 91.2%. Mean lost time injury was 3 days whereas mean delay before coming back to work was 8. CONCLUSION: The few data reported in these 11 articles , mainly from retrospective studies, suggest that Day Case appendectomy may be feasible but the absence of cl ear definition about delay bef ore discharge avoid con- cluding. To propose Day Case appendectomy to the gener al population, large prospective studies are needed Dabare GDV, Patel VM, Zacharakis E. Fast track upper gastrointestinal surgery-a systematic review. Surgi- cal Endoscopy and Other Interventional Techniques Conference: 20th International Congress of the Euro-pean Association for Endoscopic Surgery, EAES 2012 Brussels become ubiquitous in colore ctal surgery and is gaining acceptance in several other surgical specialities. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of fasttrack gastric, hepatic, oesopha geal and pancreatic surgery. METHODS: A review performed by sear ching EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library between 1950 and November 2011. The search strategy included the keywords: fast track, enhanced recovery, multimodal rehabilitation, multimodal optimization and mult imodal perioperative care. We included all original stud- ies and classified them according to the 17 evidence-based fast-track inte rventions proposed by the Enhanced Re- covery After Surgery Group. The primary endpoints were the number of implemented interventions, median length of hospital stay (LOS), readmissions, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: 13 studies reporting on a total of 1621 patients were found; 2 randomised control trials and a case- series in gastric surgery, 2 case-control studies and a case-series in hepatic surger y, 2 case-series in oesophageal surgery 2 case-control studies and 3 case-series in pancr eatic surgery. The highest number of fast inter- ventions trialled in gastric, hepatic, oesophageal and pancreatic surgery were 13, 15.5 and 12 respectively. In all types of upper gastrointestinal surgery studies demonstrat ed a reduction in median length of stay ranging from 2-6 days. The studies did not show an increase in readmission rate, morbidity and mortality with fast-track care. CONCLUSIONS: Initial studies show that fast-track surger y is feasible in upper gastr ointestinal surgery, and may reduce length of stay. However, high quality studies are r equired to determine the safety of fast-track programmes in upper gastrointestinal surgery 51 Resultat Gouvas N, Tan E, Windsor A, Xynos E, Tekkis Fast-track vs standard care in colorectal Int J ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Fast-track (FT) protocols accelerate patient's recovery and shorten hospital stay as a result of the optimization of the perioperative care they offer. The aim of this review is to examine the latest evidence for fast- track protocols when compared with standar d care in elective colorectal sur gery involving segmental colonic and/or rectal resection MATERIALS AND METHODS: All randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials on FT colorectal surgery were reviewed systematically. The main end points were s hort-term morbidity, length of primary postoperative hos- pital stay, length of total postoperative stay, readmission rate, and mortality. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two observers RESULTS: Eleven studies were eligible for analysis (four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven controlled clinical trials (CCT)), including 1,021 patients. Primar y hospital stay (weighted mean difference -2.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.24 to -1.46 days, P < 0.00001) and total hospital stay (weighted mean difference -2.46 days, 95% CI -3.43 to -1.48 days, P < 0.00001) were significantly lower for FT programs. Morbidity was also lower in the FT group. Readmission rates were not significant ly different. No increase in mortality was found CONCLUSIONS: FT protocols show high-level evidence on reducing primary and total hospital stay without com- promising patients' safety offering lower morbidity and the same readmission rates. Enhanced recovery programs should become a mainstay of elective colorectal surgery Gurusamy K, Junnarkar S, Farouk M, Davidson BR. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the safety and effectiveness of day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The British Although day-case laparoscopic cholecystect omy can save bed costs, its safety has to be estab- lished. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of day-case surgery compared with overnight stay in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials addressing the above i ssue were identified from The Cochrane Library trials register, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded and reference lists . Data were extracted from these trials by two independent reviewers. For each outcome t he relative risk, weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference was calculated with 95 per cent conf idence intervals based on av ailable case analysis. RESULTS: Five trials with 215 patients randomized to t he day-case group and 214 to the overnight-stay group were included in the review. Four of the five trials were of low risk of bias. The trials recruited 49.1 per cent of patients presenting for cholecystectomy. There was no significant difference between day case and overnight stay with re- spect to morbidity, prolongation of hospital stay, readmi ssion rates, pain, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and return to normal activity and work. In the day-case group 80.5 per cent of patients were discharged on the day of surgery.

We ana- lysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random -effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the relative risk, weighted mean differenc e, or standardised mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available case-analysis MAIN RESULTS: Five trials with 429 patients randomis ed to the day-case group (215) and overnight stay group (214) were included in the review. Four of the five tria ls were of low risk of bias regarding randomisation and follow up, but all lacked blinding. The trials recruited 49% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy. The selection criteria varied, but most included only patients without other diseases . The patients were living in easy reach of the hospital and with a responsible adult to take care of them. On the day of surgery, 81% of day-case patients were dis-charged. The drop-out rate after randomisation varied from 6.5% to 12.7%. There was no significant difference be- tween day-case and overnight stay group as regards to morb idity, prolongation of hospital stay, re-admission rates, pain, quality of life, patient satisfacti on and return to normal activity and work AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Day-case elective laparoscopi c cholecystectomy seems to be a safe and effective intervention in selected patients (with no or minimal system ic disease and within easy reach of the hospital) with symptomatic gallstones. Because of the decreased hospital stay, it is likely to save costs. [References: 43] Heiying J, Leng Q, Gong W. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the safety profile of fast-track sur- gery for colorectal surgery. Central European Journal of Medicine 2013;8(4):August. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of fast-track surgery (FTS) compared to standard care in elective colorectal surgery involv ing segmental colonic and/or rectal resection. of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on FTS for colorectal surgery were analyzed with the Cochrane systematic review. Database retrievals of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was were conducted, together with two published FTS meta-analyses. Two reviewers inde- pendently assessed the quality of the studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. A metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5 software. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this st udy, including 13 articles in English and 2 articles in Chi- nese, of which 7 were RCTs and 8 were CCTs. The over all rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were lower compared to patients who underwent the conv entional treatments (conventional treatment group or con- trol group) in the RCTs but tended to increase in the CCT s. There were no statisticall y significant differences be- tween the FTS group and the control group regarding il eus, anastomotic leakage, abdom inal distention, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and infection of the incisional wound. CONCLUSION: The overall rates of morbidity and readmi ssion in the FTS group were similar or even lower com- pared to the control group in RCTs, with an increasing tr end in the CCTs. Further discussion is needed as to why the results of the RCTs were not repeated in the CCTs, es pecially with regard to the causes of readmission. It should also be determined whether an earl y discharge might cause a delay in t he diagnosis of some complications, and thereby the occurrence of serious complications. If a num ber of severe complications occurred due to an early discharge, the value of FTS would be in question. 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg Spanjersberg WR, Reurings J, Keus F, van Laarhoven CJ. Fast track surgery versus conventional recovery strategies for colorectal surgery. [Review]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2):CD007635, 2011 2011;(2):CD007635. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In recent years the Enhanced a fter Surgery (ERAS) postoperative pathway in (ileo- care and ng postoperative complications, has be- come more common OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effectiveness and safety of the ERAS multimodal strategy, compared to conven- tional care after (ileo-)colorectal surgery. The primary research question was whether ERAS protocols lead to less morbidity and secondary whether length of stay was reduced SEARCH STRATEGY: To answer the research question we en tered search strings cont aining recovery\" into major databases. We also hand searched references in identified reviews concerning ERAS SELECTION CRITERIA: We included published randomised clin ical trials, in any language, comparing ERAS to conventional treatment in patients with (ileo-) colorectal disease requiring a resection. RCT's including at least 7 ERAS items in the ERAS group and no more than 2 in the conventional arm were included DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data of included trials were independently extracted by the reviewers. Anal- yses were performed using \"REVMAN 5.0.22\". Data were pooled and rate differences as well as weighted mean 53 Resultat differences with their 95% confidence intervals were ca lculated using either fixed or random effects models, de- pending on heterogeneity (I(2)) MAIN RESULTS: 4 RCTs were included and analysed. met hodological quality of included studies was considered low, when scored according to GRADE methodology. Total num bers of inclusion were limited. The trials included in primary analysis reported 237 patients, (119 ERAS vs 118 conv entional). Baseline characteristics were comparable. The primary outcome measure, complications, showed a si gnificant risk reduction for all complications (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72). This difference was not due to reduc tion in major complications. Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the ERAS group (MD -2.94 days; 95 % CI -3.69 to -2.19), and readmission rates were equal in both groups. Other outcome parameters were unsuitable for meta-analysis, but seemed to favour ERAS AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quantity and especially qualit y of data are low. Analysis shows a reduction in overall complications, but major complications were not r educed. Length of stay was reduced significantly. We state that ERAS seems safe, but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify imple- mentation of ERAS as the standard of care. Within ERAS protocols included, no answer regarding the role for min- imally invasive surgery (i.e. laparoscopy) was found. Fu rthermore, protocol compliance within ERAS programs has not been investigated, while this seems a known problem in the field. Therefore, more specific and large RCT's are needed Spelt L, Ansari D, Sturesson C, Tingstedt B, Andersson R. seri es of multimodal concepts that may reduce surgical stress and speed up convalescence after surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate FT pro- grammes for patients undergoing hepatopancreatic surgery METHODS: PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library dat abases were searched for studies of FT vs. conven- tional recovery strategies for liver and pancreatic resections RESULTS: For liver surgery, three cohort studies were included. Primary hospital stay was significantly reduced after FT care in two of the three studies. There were no si gnificant differences in rate s of readmission, morbidity and mortality. For pancreatic surgery, three cohort studie s and one case-control study were included. Primary hospital stay was significantly shorter after FT care in three out of the four studies. One study reported a significantly de- creased readmission rate (7% vs. 25%; P= study showed lower morbidity (47.2% vs. 58.7%; P < 0.01) in favour of the FT group. There was no di fference in mortality between the FT and control groups CONCLUSIONS: FT rehabilitation for liver and pancreatic surgic al patients is feasible. Future investigation should focus on optimizing individual elements of the FT programme within the context of liver and pancreatic surgery. 2011 International Hepato-Panc reato-Biliary cholecystectomy indications and patients' [Review] [9 refs]. International Journal Of Surgery 2008;6:Suppl-8. ABSTRACT: AIM OF THE STUDY: To review the current indications, to establish predictive factors of success and the safety of LC as a day-surgery procedure METHODS: Randomized clinical trials were s earched on PubMed between January 2000 and June 2008 using \"laparoscopic cholecystectomy\", \"day-surgery\" as keywords RESULTS: A total of 20 trials was identified and analyzed. The indications for LC in day-surgery unit were sympto- matic and chronic cholelitiasis duct stones; acute chol ecystitis and pancreatitis were excluded. The trials considered as inclus ion criteria: ASA score, BMI, social aspect and the preopera- tive workout included: abdominal US, liver function tests and routine preoperative tests, while the results considered the reasons for hospital stays and for readmission and m easured patient satisfaction; some trials included analyze of costs of LC as day-surgery procedure the role of the surgeon's experience DISCUSSION: The present study confirms that day-surgery LC is safe and feasibility in selected patients; serious complications are rare and most frequently prolonged hos pital stay and the readmission are connected with minor and more easily controlled complications or social r easons. Outpatient surgery requires careful planning and prepa- ration in order to reach acceptable pati ents' satisfaction: preoperative workout is extremely imports allowing to re- duce errors selection. Considering surg ical training, it has been demonstrated that in the centres in which the train- ees are involved in day-surgery LC there not significant di fference in terms of number of complications, patient out- comes, prolonged stay and readmission. The adequate contro l of pain, nausea or vomiting is essential component in day-case LC service and it is possible at home after LC CONCLUSION: Day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy is f easible with an acceptable discharge rate and level of 54 Resultat patient satisfaction. The success depends on appropriate pat ient selection and on well-trained staff and skilful oper- ative technique together with sa fe anaesthesia. [References: 9] H, Agrawal S.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study is to revi ew published literature on day-case laparoscopic Coch rane library was searched by using the medical subjects headings \"ambulatory surgical procedures \" and \"fundoplication\" with further free text search and cross references. All articles on planned day-case laparo scopic fundoplication that described patient selection criteria, same-day dis- charge, complications, and readmissions were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen cohort studies were included in this review. Ten were on planned same-day discharge with a 93% (739 out of 792) success, 4% (34) complicati on, and 5% (39) readmission rate. Three studies were on planned 23 hour discharge with a 98% (571 out of 583) succe ss, 4% (25) complications, and 1% (5) re-admission rate. Nausea, pain, fatigue, and pneumothorax were the commonest causes for over night admission. Dysphagia and pain were the main reasons for readmission.

The aim of this study is to review the pub- lished literature on same-day LAGB. Systematic search was performed in Medline, Embase and Cochrane library using the medical subjects headings term s \"ambulatory surgical procedures\" and \"bariatric surgery\" with free-text search and cross-references. All articles on same-day LAGB which described patient selection criteria, same-day discharge and complications were reviewed. Da ta were extracted by two independent reviewers. One randomized controlled trial and five cohort studies were incl uded in this review. The patients' age ranged from 18 to 73 years, body mass index ranged from 32.7 to 79 and ASA grade ranged from 1 to 3; 2,534 out of 2,549 (99.41%) patients could be discharged on the same day. Pain, naus ea and dysphagia were the co mmonest causes for over- night admission. Two out of the six studies reported t hat 1,982 out of 1,984 (99.9%) could be discharged within 23 h; 34 out of 2,549 (1.33%) patients developed early comp lications. No deaths have been reported in these studies. Five out of the six studies mentioned that 12 out of 2, 181 patients (0.55%) were readmitted. Dysphagia was the main reason for re-admission. LAGB is safe and feasible as a same-day procedure in selected patients. Early com- plications and re-admissions are infrequent. 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC Vaughan J, Gurusamy KS, Davidson BR. Day-surgery versus overnight stay surgery for cholecystectomy is used to manage symptomatic gallstones. There is considerable controversy regarding whether it should be done as day-sur gery or as an overnight stay surgery with regards to patient safety OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of day-surgery versus overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patient- oriented outcomes such as mortality, severe adverse events, and quality of life SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-B iliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL ) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and mRCT until September 2012 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised clinical tria ls comparing for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, irre spective of language or publication status DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independent ly assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fix ed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or st andardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat or available case analysis MAIN RESULTS: We identified a total of six trials at high risk of bias involving 492 participants undergoing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay laparoscopic c holecystectomy (n = 253) for sympto- matic gallstones. The number of participants in each tria l ranged from 28 to 150. The proportion of women in the trials varied between 74% and 84%. The mean or median age in the trials varied between 40 and 47 years.With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short-te rm mortality. However, the trial stated that there were 55 Resultat no deaths in either of the groups. We inferred from the other outcomes that there was no short-term mortality in the remaining trials. Long-term mortality was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (4 tr ials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day-surgery versus 1/200 (0.5%) in the overnight stay surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09). There was no significant difference in quality of life betw een the two groups (4 trials; 333 participants; SMD no significant diff erence between the two groups regarding the secondary out- comes of our review: pain (3 trials; 175 participants; MD 0.02 cm visual analogue scale score; 95% CI -0.69 to 0.73); time to return to activity (2 trials, 217 participants; MD -0.55 days; 95% CI -2.18 to 1.08); and trial, 74 participants; MD -2.00 days; 95% CI -10.34 to 6. 34). No significant difference was seen in hospital readmis- sion rate (5 trials; 464 participants; 6/225 in the day-surgery group versus 5/239 (2.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group (rate ratio 1.25; 95% CI 0.43 to 3.63) or in the proportion of people requiring hospital readmissions (3 trials; 290 participants; 5/136 (weighted the day-surgery group versus 5/154 (3.2%) in overnight stay surgery group; RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60). No significant difference was seen in the proportion of failed discharge (failure to be discharged as planned) between the two groups (5 trials; 419 partici- pants; 42/205 (weighted proportion 19.3%) in the day-surgery group versus 43/214 (20.1%) in the overnight stay surgery group; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.41). For all outcomes except pain, the accrued information was far less than the diversity-adjusted required inform ation size to exclude random errors AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Day-surgery appears just as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecys- tectomy. Day-surgery does not seem to result in improvement in any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. The randomis ed clinical trials backing these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). More randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of day-surgery laparoscopic chol ecystectomy on the quality of life as well as other outcomes of patients Wind J, Polle SW, Fung Kon Jin PHP, Dejong CHC, von Meyenfeldt MF, Ubbink DT, et al. Systematic review of enhanced recovery programmes in colonic surgery. Br J Surg 2006;93(7):July. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Fast track (FT) programmes optimize perioper ative care in an attempt to accelerate recovery, reduce morbidity and shorten hospital stay. The aim of th is review was to assess FT programmes for elective seg- mental colonic resections. METHODS: A systematic review was performed of all random ized controlled trials and cont rolled clinical trials on FT colonic surgery. The main endpoints were number of appli ed FT elements, hospital stay, readmission rate, morbidity and mortality. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by three observers. RESULTS: Six papers were eligible for analysis (three ra ndomized controlled and three c ontrolled clinical trials), including 512 patients. FT programmes contained a mean of nine (range four to 12) of the 17 FT elements as denned in the literature. Primary hospital stay (weighted mean difference - 1.56 days, 95 per cent confidence inter- val (c.i.) - 2.61 to - 0.50 days) and morbidity (relative risk 0. 54, 95 per cent c.i. 0.42 to 0.69) were significantly lower for FT programmes. Readmission rates were not significantly different (relative risk 1.17, 95 per cent c.i. 0.73 to 1.86). No increase in mortality was found. CONCLUSIONS: FT appears to be safe and shortens hospital st ay after elective colorectal surgery. However, as the evidence is limited, a multicentre randomized trial s eems justified.

Current status of fast-track recovery pathways Journal of the Pancreas 2009;10(6):November ABSTRACT: CONTEXT: Pancreatic surgery is often associated with si gnificant morbidity, thus requiring high level of peri- operative care and long hospital stay. Multi-modal \"enhanced re covery\" or \"fast-track\" pathways have recently been introduced, aiming to expedite patient recovery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence underpinning the use of fast-track pathways in the peri-operative care of patients undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery. RESULTS: The available evidence is limit ed, consisting of three re trospective studies that report median length of hospital stay between 7 and 13 days. No significant diffe rence has been noted in re-admission or 30-day mortality rates between fast-track patients and historical controls, but there is a trend for higher overall complication rate for the fast-track groups. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an enhanced recovery pathway is feasible and can achi eve shorter hospital stay and reduced costs, with no increase in re-admission or peri- operative mortality rates. There is, however, conflicting evidence on the physiological mechanisms that contribute to accelerated patient recovery.

Are readmission rates by how psychiatric services are organized?. [Review] [43 refs]. Nordic Journal of Psychiatry 2002;56(1):23-8. ABSTRACT: A transition is taking place in the organi zation of psychiatric services. The lengt h of stay in hospitals is reduced and partly replaced by treatment and care in the community. The readmission rate is proposed as one indicator to ana- lyse the effectiveness of this transition. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to ascertain whether re- admission rates differ with different service systems. T he search yielded 77 articles, of which 28 were selected on the basis of aims and objectives of the articles. The results show that approximately 50% of all patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals are previously admitted patients. Longer length of stay, appropriate discharge planning, and follow-up visits after discharge predicted fewer readmi ssions, whereas the quantity and quality of community care did not seem to have any impact on readmission rates. On t he basis of the analysis of the literature review it is con- cluded that readmission rates are not a suitable indicator of quality of care in psychiatric hospitals. Readmission rates may, however, be an important tool in the pl anning of mental health services. [References: 43] Penn DL, Waldheter EJ, Perkins JA. Psychosocial treatment for first-episode psychosis: A research update. Am J Psychiatry 2005;162(12):December. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: This article reviews research on psyc for fi rst-episode psychosis. METHOD: PsycINFO and MEDLINE were systematically sear psychosocial tions for first-epi sode psychosis. RESULTS: Comprehensive (i.e., multielement) treatment approaches show promise in reducing symptoms and hospital readmissions, as well as impr oving functional outcomes, although few rigorously controlled trials have been conducted. Individual cognitive behavior therapy has shown modest efficacy in reducing symptoms, assisting indi- viduals in adjusting to their illness, and im proving subjective quality of life, but it has shown minimal efficacy in re- ducing relapse. Some controlled resear ch supports the benefits of family interventions, while less controlled re- search has evaluated group interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive psychosocia l interventions early in psychosis may be beneficial across a variety of domains and can assist with symptomatic and functional reco very. More randomized, controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions, parti cularly for multielement, group, and family treatments inpatient substance abuse treatment: a national study of VA programs. Med Care 1994;32(6):535-50 . ABSTRACT: This study examines program determi nants of one aspect of VA inpatient s ubstance abuse treatment program per- formance. Performance was measured by the ratio of a pr ogram's readmission rate to the expected rate for pro- grams with similar patients. Six-month readmission rates in 101 VA treatment programs were analyzed. Preliminary analyses indicated that patient differ ences across programs accounted for 36% of the variance in readmission rates. Program differences accounted for 47% of the variance in case-mix-adjusted readmission rate. Among program factors selected through a literature review, better t han expected readmission performance was associated with having fewer early discharges, a longer intended treatment duration, more patient participation in aftercare, more family or friend assessment interviews, and treating more patients on a compulsory basis. Performance was not related to stress management training, patient attendance at more self-help meetings during treatment, staff charac- teristics, or average staff costs per patient day. The findi ngs indicate that treatment retention, duration, and in- creased aftercare may be targeted to reduce high readmission rates. Last, there were only small differences in the model over 30, 60, 90, and 365 day follow-up interval s, suggesting substantial stability of the findings Vigod SN, Kurdyak PA, Dennis C-L, Leszcz T, Taylor VH, Blumberger DM, et al. Transitional interventions to reduce early psychiatric readmissions in adults: Systematic review. Br J Psychiatry 2013;202(3):March. 57 Resultat ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Up to 13% of psychiatric patients are read mitted shortly after discharge. Interventions that ensure successful transitions to community care may play a key role in preventing early readmission. AIMS: To describe and evaluate interventions applied during the transition from in-patient to out-patient care in pre- venting early psychi atric readmission. METHOD: Systematic review of transitional interventions among adults admitted to hospital with mental illness where the study outcome was psychiatric readmission. RESULTS: The review included 15 studies with 15 non-ov erlapping intervention components. Absolute risk reduc- tions of 13.6 to 37.0% were observed in statistically signi ficant studies. Effective intervention components were: pre- and postdischarge patient psychoeducation, structured needs assessments, medication reconciliation/education, transition managers and in-patient/out-patient provider co mmunication. Key limitations were small sample size and risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Many effective transitional intervention components are feasible and likely to be cost-effective. Future research can provide direction about the specif ic components necessary and/or sufficient for preventing early psychiatric readmission.

This paper reviews literature on research about involuntary outpatient commitment and suggests qu estions and methods for future research METHODS: Literature describing research studies of involuntary outpatient commitment, located by searching MEDLINE and following up references cited in relevant articl es, was reviewed with attention to patient characteris- tics and diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes measures RESULTS: Involuntary outpatient commitment appears to provide limited but improved outcomes in rates of rehospitalization and lengths of hospital stay. Variability in community treatment makes interpretation of other types of outcome difficult. Few studies spec ifically identify results among patients with severe and persistent mental ill- ness CONCLUSIONS: No studies have examined the extent to which outpatient commitment affects compliance and treatment when essential community services such as ca se management are consistently and aggressively provid- ed, nor have studies controlled for potentially confounding factors such as treatment and nontreatment effects, in- cluding informal coercion. A randomized trial of involunt ary outpatient commitment shoul d be useful in evaluating the effectiveness of this type of intervention. [References: 42] Rosen A, Bond GR, Teesson M. Review: intensive case management for severe mental illness reduces re-hospitalisation when previous hospital use has been high. Evidence Based Mental Health 2008;11(2):45. ABSTRACT: QUESTION: What factors affect the efficacy of intens ive case management in reducing rates of hospital re- admission for people with severe mental health illness? OUTCOMES:Time in hospital (mean days per month) METHODS Design: Systematic review of randomised cont rolled EMBASE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL inception to January STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: Randomised controlled tr ials (RCTs) comparing intensive case management (allocated case manager with caseload of 20 people) to standard care (community mental health team or outpa- tients) or low intensity management (caseload of >/= 20 peopl e), for community dwelling people with severe mental 58 Resultat health illness (schizophrenia or other sim ilar disorder, depression with psychosis, or bipolar disorder). Exclusions: trials with acute crisis team intervention or control c ondition involving hospital-based care. A random effects meta- regression was used to examine the relation between hospita l stay and covariates. Covariates included: trial size, year of study, country of study, baseline hospital use, sim ilarity of the intervention to assertive community treatment (assessed using \"team membership\" and \"team structure\" sub scales on the Index of Fidelity of the Intervention to Assertive Community Treatment), degree of case management in control group. Analyses were conducted initially without consideration of baseline hospi tal use as a covariate, and then repeated in only those trials where baseline hospital use was available. Mean hospita l use in the control group was also used as an alternative covariate to baseline use MAIN RESULTS: Twenty nine trials were found which asse ssed mean hospital stay per month. Overall, intensive case management significantly reduced mean days in hospital per month (pooled effect:-0.46; 95% CI-0.84 to-0.08; p = 0.019), however there was significant heterogeneity between centres and trials. Intensive case management was most effective in trials when there was a high level of hospitalisation at baseline (regression coefficient:-0.23; 95% CI-0.36 to-0.09), or when hospital use was high in t he control group (regression coefficient:-0.31; 95% CI-0.59 to-0.03) Organisation of intensive case teams more closely to the assertive community treatment model also affect- ed the success of intensive interventions, with each one point increase in team organisation associated with fewer days in hospital per month (regression coefficient:-0.44; 95% CI-0.72 to-0.17; p = 0.002) CONCLUSIONS Intensive case management is most effectiv e for reducing hospital stay per month in people with severe mental illness when they have previously requir ed a high amount of hospital care. The benefits are less when hospital use has previously been low. Team organisation is the most important factor of assertive team man- agement model Durbin J, Lin E, Layne C, Teed M. Is readmission a valid indicator of the quality of inpatient psychiatric care? J Behav Health Serv Res 2007;34(2):April. ABSTRACT: Early return to hospital is a frequently measured outcome in mental health system performance monitoring yet its validity for evaluating quality of inpatient care is unclear. This study reviewed research conducted in the last decade on predictors of early readmission (within 30 to 90 days of discharge) to assess the association between this indica- tor and quality of inpatient psychiatric care. Only 13 studi es met inclusion criteria. R ESULTS indicated that risk is greatest in the 30-day period immediately after discharge. There was modest support that attending to stability of clinical condition and preparing patients for discharge can protect against early readmission. A history of repeated admission increases risk, suggesting that special efforts are required to break the revolving door cycle. The authors identified a need for more standardization in measurement of client status at discharge and related care processes, more intervention studies on discharge pr actices, and studies of the effect of community care on early readmission. 2007 National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare Steffen S, Kosters M, Becker T, Puschner B. Discharge planning in mental health care: a systematic review of the estimate the efficacy of di scharge planning interventions in mental health care from in-patient to out-patient treatment on improving pati ent outcome, ensuring community tenure, and saving costs METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis identifi ed studies through an electroni c search on the basis of de- fined inclusion and exclusion criteria and extracted data RESULTS: Of eleven studies included, six were randomised c ontrolled trials, three were controlled clinical trials, and two were cohort studies. The discharge planning strategies used varied widely, most were limited to preparation of discharge during in-patient treatment. P ooled risk ratios were 0.66 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.84; P < 0.001) for hospital readmission rate, and 1.25 (1.07 to 1.47; P < 0.001) for adherence to out-patient treatment. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were -0.25 (-0.45 to -0.05; P = 0.02) for mental health outcome, and 0.11(-0.05 to 0.28; NS) for quality of life CONCLUSION: Discharge planning intervent ions are effective in reducing r ehospitalisation and in improving adher- ence to aftercare Ruud T, objectives of this study were to review the literature on alternatives to traditional treatment of acute mental disorders and to describe the effects of thes e interventions. The main emphas is is on crisis resolution teams (CRT) because there are governmental plans to impl ement these in all Norwegian community mental health centres 59 Resultat MATERIAL AND METHODS: The reviewed literature is based on a search for randomiz ed controlled studies that compare the effect of standard emergency treatment with alternative emergency servic es. Quasi-experimental stud- ies of crisis resolution teams were also included RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: The identified alternativ e interventions were: emergency residential/domestic care, emergency day centres, and crisis resolution teams (or assertive/out-reach/mobile crisis teams). Studies of acute day hospitals showed that this treatment is associ ated with reduced hospitalisation, faster recovery and re- duced costs compared with treatment in traditional hospital ac ute wards. Because of insufficient research, it was not possible to draw CONCLUSIONS on the effects of residential or domestic care. We identified six rand omized controlled studies and four quasiexperimental studies of Crisis Resolution Teams. These studies indicate that Crisis Resolution Teams or other forms of assertive homebased mobile/outreach treatmen t, is an acceptable alternat ive to hospitalization for many patients. The clinical effect of such treatment seems to be comparable with traditional treatment, and are associated with reduced hospitalizations and rehospitaliz ations, and with reduced costs. None of the reviewed treatment can replace traditional acute hospital treatment. Although studies of alternatives to acute hospitalization have congruent results, there are few studies and methodologi cal weaknesses make it difficult to draw firm scien- tific CONCLUSIONS about the effect of such interventions.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Inpatient treatment is an expensive way of ca ring for people with acute psychiatric disorders. It has been proposed that many of those currently treated as inpat ients could be cared for in acute psychiatric day hospi- tals.Objectives: To assess the effects of day hospital vers us inpatient care for people with acute psychiatric disor- ders.Search METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2010) which is based on regu- lar searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycIN unpublished stud- ies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of day hospital versus inpatient care, for people with acute psy- chiatric disorders. Studies were inelig ible if a majority of participants were under 18 or over 65, or had a primary diagnosis of substance abuse or organic brain disorder.Data collecti on and analysis: Two review authors inde- pendently extracted and cross-checked data. We calculated ri sk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We calculated weight ed or standardised means for continuous data. Day hospital trials tend to present similar outcomes in slightly different formats, ma king it difficult to synthesise data. We therefore sought individual patient data so that we could re-analyse outcomes in a common format. MAIN RESULTS: Ten trials (involving 2685 people) met the in clusion criteria. We obtained individual patient data for four trials (involving 646 people). We found no difference in the number lost to follow-up by one year between day hospital care and inpatient care (5 RCTs, n = 1694, RR 0.94 CI 0.82 to 1.08). There is moderate evidence that the duration of index admission is longer fo r patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (4 RCTs, n = 1582, WMD 27.47 CI 3.96 to 50.98). There is very low evidence that t he duration of day patient care (adjusted days/month) is longer for patients in day hospital care than inpatient care (3 RCTs, n = 265, WMD 2.34 days/month CI 1.97 to 2.70). There is no difference between day hospital care and i npatient care for the being readmitted to in/day patient care after discharge (5 RCTs, n = 667, RR 0.91 CI 0.72 to 1.15). It is likely that there is no difference between day hospital care and inpatient care for being unemployed at the end of the study (1 RCT, n = 179, RR 0.88 CI 0.66 to 1.19), for quality of life (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.01 CI -0.13 to 0.15) or for treatment satisfaction (1 RCT, n = 1117, MD 0.06 CI -0.18 to 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Caring for people in acute day hosp itals is as effective as inpatient care in treating acutely ill psychiatric patients. However, further data are still needed on the cost effectiveness of day hospitals Nordentoft M, Jeppesen P, Petersen L, Bertelsen M, Thorup A. The rationale for early intervention in schiz- ophrenia and related disorders. Early Intervention in Psychiatry 2009;3(SUPPL.#1):2009. ABSTRACT: AIM: To examine the rationale and evidence supporti ng an early intervention approach in schizophrenia. METHODS: A selective literature review was conducted. RESULTS: During the onset of schizophrenia, there is oft en a significant delay between the emergence of psychotic symptoms and the initiation of treatment. The average dur ation of untreated psychosis is around 1-2 years. During this period, brain function may continue to deteriorate and social networks can be irreversibly damaged. Studies have consistently linked longer durati on of untreated psychosis with poorer outcomes and this relationship holds even after controlling for the potential confounding variable of premorbid functioni ng. In Norway, the early Treatment and Intervention in PSychosis study demonstrated that durat ion of untreated psychosis is amenable to intervention with the combination of educational campaigns and specialized early detecti on units substantially decreasing the 60 Resultat period from onset of symptoms to treatment initiation. Fu rthermore, recent evidence fr om the randomized controlled OPUS and the Lambeth Early Onset trial studies have lin ked phase-specific early inte rventions to improved out- comes spanning symptoms, adherence to treatment, como rbid drug abuse, relapse and readmission. Some bene- fits persist after cessation of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention in schizophrenia is just ified to reduce the negative per sonal and social impact of prolonged periods of untreated symptoms. Furthermore, phase- specific interventions ar e associated with improved outcomes, at least in the short term. Further research is needed to establish the optimum duration of such pro- grammes.

[Review] 2008 2008;(1):CD000384 ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In high income countries, over the last th ree decades, the length of hospital stays for people with serious mental illness has reduced drastically. Some argue th at this reduction has led to revolving door admissions and worsening mental health outcomes despite apparent co st savings, whilst others suggest longer stays may be more harmful by institutionalising people to hospital care OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and service outco mes of planned short stay admission policies versus a long or standard stay for people with serious mental illnesses SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophr enia Group's register of trials (July 2007) SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised trials comparing planned short with long/standard hospital stays for people with serious mental illnesses DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data i ndependently. For dichotomous data we calculated rela- tive risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a fixed effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) wher e appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated fixed effects weighted mean differences (WMD) MAIN RESULTS: We included six relevant trials. We f ound no significant difference in hospital readmissions be- tween planned short stays and standard care at one year (n=651, 4 RCTs, RR 1.26 CI 1.0 to 1.6). Short hospital stay did not confer any benefit in terms of 'loss to follow up compared with standard care (n=453, 3 RCTs, RR 0.87 CI 0.7 to 1.1). There were no signific ant differences for the outcome of 'l eaving hospital prematurely' (n=229, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.3 to 1.8). More post-discharge day ca re was given to participants in the short stay group (n=247, 1 RCT, RR 4.52 CI 2.7 to 7.5, NNH 3 CI 2 to 6) and people from the short stay groups were more likely to be employed at two years (n=330, 2 RCTs, RR 0.61 CI 0.5 to 0.8, NNT 5 CI 4 to 8). Economic data were few but, once discharged, costs may be more for those allocated to an initial short stay AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effects of hospital care and t he length of stay is important for mental health poli- cy. We found limited data, although outcomes do suggest that a planned short stay policy does not encourage a 'revolving door' pattern of admission and disjointed care for people with serious mental illness. More large, well- designed and reported trials are justified. [References: 47] Nath SB. Review: Short stay hospitalisation does not increase readmissions compared with long stay. Evi-dence Based Mental Health 2008;11(4):124 ABSTRACT: QUESTION: How effective is planned short stay hospitalis ation compared with long st ay (standard) hospitalisation for people with severe mental illness? OUTCOMES: Death, service outcomes (including hospital readmission), gl obal and mental function METHODS: DESIGN: Systematic review DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Schizophrenia group trial regi ster was searched in July 2007. In addition, refer- ence lists of relevant papers were hand searched, papers ci ting included studies were i dentified using SciSearch, and authors of the main studies were c ontacted to identify unpublished research STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: RCTs comparing planned short-term versus long- term/standard hospitalisa- tion for people with schizophrenia, related disorders or \"severe/chronic mental diso rders/illnesses\" were includ- ed. RCTs randomising all acute psychiat ric admissions were not included in the meta-analyses. Studies where more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up were ex cluded from analyses. In intention-to-treat analyses people leaving studies early were assumed to have had a negative outcome, except for in the mortality analyses. Two re- 61 Resultat viewers appraised search RESULTS, judged study quality and extracted data. Stat istical heterogeneity was assessed visually, and using chi squared tests and the I2 statistic MAIN RESULTS Six RCTs met inclusion criteria, including a total of 2030 participants. Four studies were carried out in the US and 2 in the UK, and all 6 RCTs were carried out before 1980. Follow-up period was 12-26 months. Aver- age duration of long and short stays varied between studies, wi th short stays ranging from 10.8 to 25 days, and long stays ranging from 28 to 94 days. There was no significant difference in deaths from a ll causes between groups (1 RCT, n = 175; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.8). Results for mental state could not be pooled because standard devia- tions were not reported. One study assessed mental stat e on two different scales in a subset of participants, and found no difference in the proportion of people whose mental state had not improved on either scale. There was also no significant difference between short and long stay in hospital readmissions at one or two year follow up (one year: 4 RCTs, n = 651; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.6, I2 = 62.4%; two years: 2 RCTs, n = 229; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.4, I2 = 62.4%). Short stay significantly reduced dela yed discharges compared with long stay (3 RCTs, n = 404; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9; I2 = 0%). Patients who had short stays received more post-discharge day care (1 RCT, n = 247; RR 4.52, 95% CI 2.7 to 7.5). Short stay reduced the proportion of people who were unemployed, of un- known employment status, or unable to housekeep at two years compared to long stay (2 RCTs, n = 330; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8; NNT 5, 95% CI 4 to 8) CONCLUSIONS Few studies addressing the relative efficacy of short and long stay admissions for serious mental illness were identified. The evidenc e did not suggest that a short st ay policy increased readmissions Intervensjoner om pa sientoppl\u00e6ring (12) Bustillo JR, Lauriello J, Horan WP, Keith SJ. The psychosocial treatment of schizophrenia: An update. Am J Psychiatry 2001;158(2):2001. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to update the randomized cont rolled trial literature of psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia. METHOD: Computerized literature searches were conducted to identify randomiz ed controlled trials of various psy- chosocial interventions, with emphasis on studies published since a previous review of psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia in 1996. RESULTS: Family therapy and assertive community treatm ent have clear effects on the prevention of psychotic relapse and rehospitalization. However, these treatment s have no consistent effects on other outcome measures (e.g., pervasive positive and negative symptoms, overall so cial functioning, and ability to obtain competitive em- ployment). Social skills training improv es social skills but has no clear effe cts on relapse prevention, psychopathol- ogy, or employment status. Supportive employment pr ograms that use the place-an d-train vocational model have important effects on obtaining competitive employment. Some studies have shown improvements in delusions and hallucinations following cognitive behavior therapy. Prelimi nary research indicates that personal therapy may im- prove social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively simple, long-term psychoeducational family therapy should be available to the majority of persons suffering from schizophrenia. Assertive community training programs ought to be offered to patients with frequent relapses and hospitalizations, es pecially if they have limited family support. Patients with schizophrenia can clearly improve their social competence with social skills training, which may translate into a more adaptive functioning in the community. For patients interested in working, rapid placement wi th ongoing support offers the best opportunity for maintaining a regular job in the co mmunity. Cognitive behavior therapy may benefit the large number of patients who continue to experience disabling psychotic symp toms despite optimal pharmacological treatment Duncan E, Best C, Hagen S. Shared decision making interventions for people with mental health conditions. Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) (1) (pp CD007297), 2010 Date of Publication: 2010 2010;(Online):2010. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: One person in every four will suffer from a diagnosable mental health condition during their life course. Such conditions can have a devastating impact on the lives of the individual, their family and society. In- creasingly partnership models of ment al health care have been advocated and ens hrined in international healthcare policy. Shared decision making is one such partnership approach. Shared decision maki ng is a form of patient- provider communication where both parties are acknowl edged to bring expertise to the process and work in part- nership to make a decision. This is advocated on the basis that patients have a right to self-determination and also 62 Resultat in the expectation that it will increase treatment adherence. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of provider-, consume r- or carer-directed shared dec ision making interventions for people of all ages with mental health conditions, on a range of outcomes incl uding: patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and health service outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched: the Cochrane Central Regi ster of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2008), EMBASE (1980 to November 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to November 2008), CINAHL (1982 to November 2008) , British Nursing Index and Archive (1985 to November 2008) and SIGLE (1890 to September 2005 (database end date)). We also searched online trial registers and the bibliographies of relevant papers, and contacted aut hors of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled rolled before-and-after studies (CBAs); and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of interventions to increase shared decision making in people with mental health conditions (by DSM or ICD-10 criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on recruitment METHODS, eligibility criteria , sample characteristics, interventions, outcome measures, participant flow and out- come data from each study were extracted by one author and checked by another. Data are presented in a narra- tive synthesis. MAIN RESULTS: We included two separate German studies involving a total of 518 participants. One study was undertaken in the inpatient treatment of schizophrenia and the other in the treatment of people newly diagnosed with depression in primary care. Regarding the primary ou tcomes, one study reported stat istically significant in- creases in patient satisfaction, the ot her study did not. There was no evidence of effect on clinical outcomes or hos- pital readmission rates in either study. Regarding secondar y outcomes, there was an indication that interventions to increase shared decision making increased doctor facilitation of patient involv ement in decision making, and did not increase consultation times. Nor did t he interventions increase patient comp liance with treatment plans. Neither study reported any harms of the intervention. Definite c onclusions cannot be drawn, however, on the basis of these two studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No firm conclusions can be drawn at present about the effects of shared decision making interventions for people with ment al health conditions. There is no evi dence of harm, but there is an urgent need for further research in this area Glynn SM, Cohen AN, Niv N. New challenges in family interventions for schizophrenia. Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics 2007;7(1):January. ABSTRACT: This review first outlines the rational e and research base supporting the devel opment of family interventions for schizophrenia. The over-riding principles guiding effective family interventi ons for schizophrenia are then presented, along with the key components (engagement, assessment, educ ation, communication skills training and problem- solving) shared by most family programs in schizophrenia. Meta-analyses demonstrating the efficacy of family inter- ventions in reducing relapse and rehos pitalization in schizophrenia are then di scussed, along with issues regarding minimal duration of effective treatment, differential benefit s of single and multiple family modalities and mixed evi- dence for the maintenance of treatment effects after termi nation. The benefits of participation in family-organized, nonprofessional support and education programs are then descri bed. Finally, three issues meriting further study are outlined. 2007 Future Drugs Ltd Leucht S. Psychoeducation and shared decision making as a way to reduce non-compliance in mental dis-orders. European Neuropsychopharmacology Conference: 11th ECNP Regional Meeting St Petersburg Federation very important issue in the pharmacol ogical treatment of schizophrenia. This is not a ''yes or no'' phenomenon. We often think in a dichotomous way about compliance in the sense that patients are either ad- herent or not, but probably com-pliance is rather a continuum. Some patients are fully adherent and others refuse medication in general, but most patients are probably somew here in the middle, they are partially compliant, i.e. they sometimes forget to take the medication or they ta ke 'drug holidays'. Studies based on medication refills have, however, shown that even small gaps in taking medication ar e associated with increased rates of hospitalisation. In one of these trials even a small medication gap betwe en 1 and 10 days doubled the number of patients hospital- ised. It also seems that the introduction of the atypical antipsychotics has not dramatically changed the problem of non-compliance. In another large pharmacy-based study, in the atypical group patients did not have medication available because they did not even go to the pharmacy fo r an average of 110 days per year. This number of days was only slightly higher in the typical antipsychotic group (125 days per year). There are a number of factors that contribute to noncompliance, reduced cognitive capabilities, substance abuse, denial of the illness, side-effects etc. Importantly, doctors play animportant role in patient s non-adherence, as well, a phenomenon that has been called ''doctors' non compliance''. In a study from approximately 15 years ago psychiatrists in German state hospitals were asked about how long patients with several episodes of schizophrenia should receive maintenance treatment with an antipsychotic. Surprisingly, there was little consensus either bet ween the different hospitals or within the same hospital, because even in the same hospita l doctors had very different opinions abo ut this issue. As this study was carried out at a time when guideline recommendations were just being made available, a recent study from our 63 Resultat group tried to replicate the findings usi ng a slightly different design. 50 doctors and 100 of their patients were asked about the guideline recommendation on duration of aintenanc e treatment. The theoretical knowledge on the dura- tion of mainte-nance treatment was clearly improved. For 75% of their patients the doctors knew the guideline rec- ommendation. However, they communicated the correct recommendation to only 33% of their patients and when the patients were asked about what the doctors had recommended to them, the answer was correct in only 11% of the patients. When it comes to patient non-compliance depot medication is an obvious ly useful tool to enhance adherence, because medication intake is assured and bec ause the doctor immediately knows when the patient stops taking the medication. But there are also a number of psychotherapeutic interventions that have been investi- gated. The first one is compliance therapy, a method bas ed on motivational interviewing combined with cognitive behavioural components. Unfortunately, after the promisi ng results of an initial RCT, subsequent RCTs could not confirm the adherence improving effects of this strategy . The second important option is psychoeducation. Psycho- education-usually performed by means of a few group se ssions-can be provided for both patients and their rela- tives. The effects of this intervention have been demonstr ated in various studies and meta-analyses. Nevertheless, there is a problem of resources. A survey in all Germ an speaking countries showed that only 21% of patients and only 6% of relatives took part in psychoeducation in 2003 (1). One of the reasons is that although psychoeducation is relatively easy to apply, busy doctors and nurses do not have the time to establish their own programme. There-fore, novel approaches try to establish 'peer-to-peer' psychoeducation. Here, psych oeducation is provided by pa- tients for other patients or by relatives for relatives of other patients. This may help to increase the available re- sources. Furthermore, pilot studies have shown that one of the major advantages is the credibility of the peer mod- erators. If another patient or a family member runs t he sessions, their recommendati ons can be more credible for the participants than if the sessions are run by health pr ofessionals. Finally, the concept of ''shared decision making'' has recently been introduced. Shared decision ma king lies somewhere between the standard ''paternalistic model'' and so-called ''informed choice''. The ''paternalistic model'' assumes that the doctor knows what is best for the patient and he makes a recommendation. The role of the patient is to adhere to the recommendation, while the doctor is fully responsible. In some countries ''informed c hoice'' is for example used for vaccination recommenda- tions before travels to tropical countries. All the necessary information is provided to t he travellers who must decide himself whether they want to be vaccinated or not. Shared decision is somewhere in the middle: patients are well informed about the available options so that they are able to participate in a ''decision talk'' with the doctor. Both share the responsibility for the decision. A first cluste r-randomised trial has been carried out in Germany and found in the acutephase that participants in the shared decision maki ng group felt significantly more involved (2). At long- term follow-up there was a trend of fewer rehospitalisations (3). These data suggest that shared decision making is a promising concept in schizophrenia that should be further developed and in vestigated.

Effectiveness of psychoeducation for schizophrenia is family inclusion necessary? Schizophre-nia Research Conference: 2nd Schizophrenia International Research Society Conference, 2010 Flor-ence Italy Conference adopted but insufficiently evaluated interven- tion for patients with schizophrenia. So far, meta-analytic data has demonstrated efficacy for PE as part of a broader family intervention and for PE-focused in terventions that include family members. Whether PE directed solely at patients is also effective remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate short- and long-term efficacy of PE-focused interventions with and without inclusion of families with regard to relapse, symptom-reduction, kn owledge, medication adherence, and functioning. We included randomized cont rolled trials comparing PE to standard care or non-specific interven- tions. Among the 2952 publications identifi ed by a keyword procedure in relev ant scientific data-bases, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies were coded with regard to methodology, participants, interventions and validity. Effect sizes were integrated using the fixed effects model for homogeneous effects and the random effects model for heterogeneous effects. RESULTS: Independent of treatment modality, PE produced a medium effect at post-treatment for relapse and a small effect size for knowledge. PE had no effect on symptoms, functioning and medication adherence. Effect sizes for relapse and rehospitalizati on remained significant for 12 months after treatment but failed significance for longer follow-up periods. Interventions that included families we re more effective in reducing symptoms by the end of treatment and in preventing relapse at 7-12 month follow- up. Effects achieved for PE directed at patients alone were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the additional effort of in tegrating families in PE is worthwhile and the potential mechanisms by which treatment benefits from family-inclusion are discussed Lincoln TM, Wilhelm K, Nestoriuc Y. Effectiveness of psychoeducation for relapse, symptoms, knowledge, adherence and functioning in a meta-analysis. Schizophr Res 2007;96(1-3):232-45. ABSTRACT: Psychoeducation (PE) for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders is widely adopted but insufficiently evaluat- ed. So far, meta-analytic data has demonstrated effica cy for PE when interventions include family members. 64 Resultat Whether PE directed solely at patients is also effective re mains unclear. The current meta-analysis evaluates short- and long-term efficacy of PE with and without inclusion of families with regard to relapse, symptom-reduction, knowledge, medication adherence, and func tioning. Randomized controlled trials comparing PE to standard care or non-specific interventions were included. A literature search in the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Medline re- trieved 199 studies for closer examinat ion, of which 18 studies, reporting on 19 comparisons, met the inclusion crite- ria. These studies were coded with regard to methodology, pa rticipants, interventions and validity. Effect sizes were integrated using the fixed effects model for homogeneous effects and the random effects model for heterogeneous effects. Independent of treatment modality, PE produced a m edium effect at post-treatment for relapse and a small effect size for knowledge. PE had no effect on sympto ms, functioning and medication adherence. Effect sizes for relapse and rehospitalization remained si gnificant for 12 months after treatm ent but failed significance for longer follow-up periods.

Training to recognise the early signs of recur-rence in schizophrenia. Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) 2013;2(pp CD005147):2013 . ABSTRACT: Schizophrenia has a lifetime pr evalence of less than one per cent. Studies hav e indicated that early symptoms that are idiosyncratic to the person with schizophrenia (early wa rning signs) often precede acut e psychotic relapse. Early warning signs interventions propose that learning to detect and manage early warning signs of impending relapse might prevent or delay acute psychotic relapse. To com pare the effectiveness of early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual involving and not involving a psychol ogical therapy on time to rel apse, hospitalisation, func- and positive symptomatology. Search databases included the Coch rane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2007 and May 2012) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identifi ed studies were reviewed for inclusion. We inspected the UK National Research Registe and contacted relevant pharmaceutical co mpanies and authors of trials for addi- tional information. We included all randomised clinical tria ls (RCTs) comparing early warning signs interventions plus treatment as usual to treatment as usual for people with schizophrenia or other non-affective psychosis We assessed included studies for quality and extracted data. If more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up, the study was excluded. For binary outcomes, we calculated st andard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the correspond- ing 95% confidence intervals (CI), for continuous outcomes, we calculat ed mean differences (MD) with standard errors estimated, and for time to event outcomes we ca lculated Cox proportional hazar ds ratios (HRs) and associ- ated 95 % CI. We assessed risk of bias for included studi es and assessed overall study quality using the GRADE approach. Thirty-two RCTs and two cluster-RCTs that random ised 3554 people satisfied criteria for inclusion. Only one study examined the effects of early warning signs inte rventions without additional psychological interventions, and many of the outcomes for this review were not reporte d or poorly-reported. Signifi cantly fewer people relapsed with early warning signs interventions than with usual care (23% versus 43%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79; 15 RCTs, 1502 participants; very low quality evidence). Time to relapse did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs, 550 participants; very low quality evidence). Risk of re-hospitalisation wa s significantly lower with early warning signs interventions compared to usual ca re (19% versus 39%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; 15 RCTS, 1457 participants; very low quality evidence). Time to re-hospitalisation did not significantly differ between intervention groups (6 RCTs; 1149 participants; very low quality evidence). Participants' satisfaction with care and economic costs were inconclusive because of a lack of evi dence. This review indicates that early warning signs interventions may have a positive effect on the proportions of people re-hospita lised and on rates of relapse, but not on time to recurrence. However, the overall quality of the evidence was very low, indicating that we do not know if early warning signs interventions will have similar effects outsi de trials and that it is very likely that further research will alter these estimates. Moreover, the early warning signs interventions were us ed along side other psychological interventions, and we do not know if they would be effe ctive on their own. They may be cost-effective due to re- duced hospitalisation and relapse rates, but before mental health services cons ider routinely providing psychologi- cal interventions involving the early re cognition and prompt management of early warning signs to adults with schiz- ophrenia, further research is required to provide evidence of high or moderate q uality regarding the efficacy of early warning signs interventions added to usual care without additional psychological in terventions, or to clarify the kinds of additional psychological interventions that might aid its efficacy. Future RCTs should be adequately-powered, and designed to minimise the risk of bias and be transparently reported. They should also systematically evaluate re- source costs and resource use, alongside efficacy outco mes and other outcomes that are important to people with serious mental illness and their carers Pitschel-Walz G, Leucht S, Bauml J, Kissling W, Engel RR. The effect of family interventions on relapse and rehospitalization in schizophrenia--a meta- studies were meta-analytically ex amined regarding the effect of including relatives in schiz- ophrenia treatment. The studies investigated family interv ention programs to educate relatives and help them cope better with the patient's illness. The patient's relapse rate , measured by either a signi ficant worsening of symptoms or rehospitalization in the first years a fter hospitalization, served as the main study criterion. The main result of the meta-analysis was that the relapse rate can be reduced by 20 percent if relatives of schizophrenia patients are in- cluded in the treatment. If family interventions continued for longer than 3 months, the effect was particularly marked. Furthermore, different types of compr ehensive family interventions have similar RESULTS. The bifocal approach, which offers psychosoc ial support to relatives and schizophrenia patients in addi- 65 Resultat tion to medical treatment, was clearly superior to the medica tion-only standard treatment. The effects of family inter- ventions and comprehensive patient interv entions were comparable, but the comb ination did not yield significantly better results than did a treatment approach, which focused on either the patient or the family. This meta-analysis indicates that psychoeducational interventi ons are essential to schizophrenia treatment Pitschel-Walz G. Family psychoeducation. Schizophrenia Research Conference: 2nd Schizophrenia Interna- tional Research Society Conference, SIRS 2010 Italy have shown that family interventions are e ffective in reducing the rehospitalization rates in patients with schizophrenia. Besides medication, family interventions are considered an important part of the state-of-the-art treatment in modern treatment guidelines for schizophrenia. Most of the family intervention programmes studied can be classified as psychoeducational with cognitive behavioral therapy as BACKGROUND. Family psychoeducation s hould provide carers with informati on and therapeutic support to better cope with their relative's mental ill ness and with their own illness-related problems. In a meta-analysis on the effec- tiveness of Lincoln found that only psyc hoeducational interventions that included families and were not focussed on t he patients alone achieved significant RESULTS. On consideration of the ev idence base for family psychoeducation in schizophrenia, there still exists an enormous gap between scientific findings and clinical reality. Fewer than 10% of family carers of patients with schizophrenia receive any support or family psychoeducati on. Therefore psychiatric practitioners should put in a variety of efforts to provide these effective and much appr eciated interventions. New st udies investigate the chal- lenges of dissemination, effects of various family interv ention programmes in different cultural settings, peer-to-peer programmes or interventions for special target groups like families of patients wi th co-occurring substance abuse Rummel-Kluge C, Kissling W. Psychoeducation in schizophrenia: new developments and approaches in the field. Current Opinion in Psychiatry 2008;21(2):168-72. ABSTRACT: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarize the literature on psychoeducation in schizophrenia published during the past year; this literature shows that pragmatic approaches and new adaptations have been developed. RECENT FINDINGS: The current literature indicates that studies on psychoeducation in schizophrenia in real-world settings show results comparable to those in experiment al settings; brief psychoeducati onal interventions may have long-term effects on relapse and rehospitalization rates; and combining diagnoses may be helpful for new, short psychoeducational formats, but also for smaller hospital s with too few patients with the same diagnosis for group psychoeducation. Peer-to-peer education programs for families and patients have been developed, and culturally sensitive topics, the patients' perspective, quality-of-lif e issues and sex aspects were integrated into psychoeduca- tion. A new meta-analysis on psychoeducation shows that ther e is a medium effect size for relapse and rehospitali- zation reduction if both the patient and the family participate. SUMMARY: Up to the present, patient-directed approaches are much more frequent in clinical practice than bifocal psychoeducation. Therefore, future research must focu s on patient-directed psychoeducation and, here especially, on integrating the more stable outpatients, who appear to profit more from psychoeducation than do symptomatic inpatients Witte F.

International Journal of Mental Health Nursing 2013;22(3):256-71. ABSTRACT: Although self-management education programs for persons with schizophrenia are being developed and advocated, uncertainty about their overall effectiveness remains. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine outcomes of self-management education interventions in persons with schizophrenia. Six electronic databases were searched. Manual searches were conducted of the reference lists of the identified studi es and major psychiatric journals. Ran- domized controlled trials self-management education reduci ng relapse and hospital read- missions, as well as improving symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and adherence to medication treatment were identified. Data were extracted and the quality of incl uded studies were rated by two authors independently. Finally, 13 studies with 1404 patients were included. Self-management education interventions were associated with a sig- nificant reduction of relaps e events and re-hospitalizations. Patients wh o received self-management education were more likely to improve adherence to medication and symptoms compared to patients receiving other care. However, 66 Resultat a benefit on psychosocial functioning was not confirmed in t he current meta-analysis. The study concludes that self- management education intervention is a feasible and effe ctive method for persons with schizophrenia and should be routinely offered to all persons with schizophrenia Depotbehandling vs daglig inntak (6) Bhanji NH, Chouinard A antipsychotics ar e available for schizophrenia management.

European Neuropsychopharmacology Conference: 25th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, ECNP cial worsen with r epeated psychotic episodes in pa- tients with schizophrenia, relapse prev ention is critical. High non-adherence ra tes in this population can limit the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, therefore, the use of long-ac ting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) is considered to be an important treatment option. However, new, large, controlled trials showed no benefit of LAIs [1]. Moreover our latest meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no superiority of LAIs over oral antipsychotics (OAPs) (N = 21, n = 4,905, RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.80-1.08, p = 0.35) [2]. Since multiple naturalistic studies have shown that LAIs were superior to OAPs, we aimed to meta-analy ze all available nonrandomized mirror image and cohort stud- ies, which may more accurately reflect the patient population t hat is most likely prescribed LA Is in clinical practice. METHODS: Systematic review/meta-analysis was conduct ed on non-RCTs lasting >=6 months, comparing LAIs and OAPs. Naturalistic cohort studies and mirror image studies (where the data before and after initiation of LAIs were compared) were both included in the analyses but synthesized separately. Primary outcome was re-hospitalization (if not reported, th e closest relapserelated outcome wa s utilized); secondary outcomes included number of hospitalizations, number of inpatient-days and a ll cause discontinuation. Pool ed relative risk (RR) or standard mean difference (SMD), together with their 95% c onfidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, using random- effects model. Number-needed-totreat (NNT) was calculated where appropriate. We used visual inspection of the forest plots to investigate the possibility of statistical heterogeneity, together with the I2-statistic, with an I2 >=50% indicating significant heterogeneity. RESULTS: Based on a near-complete systematic review of relevant data bases, we identified a total of 36 studies (mirror image studies: N= 22, n = 4,754, naturalistic cohort studies: N= 14, n = 26,602). Across mirror image stud- ies, LAIs significantly prevented hospitalization compared to OAPs, expressed as rehospita lization rate (N and mean number of hospitalizations (N = 3,592, LAIs over OAPs did not change when we excluded studies which conducted complete r's analysis. On the other hand, acro ss naturalistic cohort studies, LAIs were similar to OAPs regarding re-hos pitalization rate (N 13, n = 26,614, RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.67-1.23, p = 0.53). The result was highly heterogeneous (I2>80%). When we re-analyzed only studies based on large health care data bases, LAIs showed trend level 56%, p = 0.07). Conclusion: Given the possible biases in non-randomized open studies; i.e., expectation bias, time effect, etc., a careful interpretation of these data is required. Ne vertheless, results of mirror image studies indicated strong superiority of LAIs over OAPs in pr eventing relapse. The results are in c ontrast with metaanalysis on RCTs, which 67 Resultat showed non-superiority of LAIs. On the other hand, the resu lts of naturalistic cohort studies that also did not show superiority of LAIs were highly heterogeneous, probably due to the different target populations, or treatment set- tings. Given that the cohort study results were in favor of LAIs when the data were based on real world clinical set- tings, future RCTs may benefit from matchi ng more closely routine clinical settings Koola MM, Wehring HJ, Kelly DL. The potential role of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia and comorbid substance use. Journal of Dual Diagnosis 2012;8(1):01. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: Treatment of schizophrenia in patients with como rbid substance use (alcohol/i llicit drug use, abuse, or dependence) presents challenges for public health systems. Substance use in people with schizophrenia is up to four times greater than the general population and is a ssociated with medication nonadherence and poor outcomes. Therefore, continuous antipsychotic treatment in this population may pose more of a challenge than for those with schizophrenia alone. Many clinical trials and treatment reco mmendations in schizophrenia do not take into consid- eration substance use, as people with comorbid substance use have typica lly been excluded from most antipsychot- ic trials. Nonetheless, antipsychotic treatment appears to be as efficacious in this po pulation, although treatment discontinuation remains high. The objective of this review was to highlight the importance and utility of considering long-acting injectable antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance use. METHODS: We did a literature search using PubMed with keywords schizophrenia and substance use/abuse/dependence, We limited our search to human studies published in English and 4,971 articles were identified. We focused on clinical trials, case reports, case series, reviews, and meta-analyses, resulting in 125 articles from 1975 to 2011. RESULTS: Our review suggests the potential role of long-ac ting injectables for people with comorbid substance use and schizophrenia in leading to improvements in psychopathol ogy, relapse prevention, fewer rehospitalizations, and better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: While more research is needed, long-ac ting antipsychotics should be considered an important option in the management of cases of schizophrenia and comorbid substance use. 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC Leucht C, Heres S, Kane JM, Kissling W, Davis JM, Leucht S. Oral versus depot antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia--a critical systematic review and meta Non-adherence is a major problem in the tr eatment of schizophrenia. Depot antipsychotic drugs are thought to reduce relapse rates by improving adherence, but a systematic review of long-term studies in outpatients is not available METHOD: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group' s register, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane reviews on depot medication, and the reference sections of included studi es for randomised controlled tr ials lasting at least 12 months in outpatients that compared depot with oral antip sychotics in schizophrenia. Data on relapse (primary out- come), rehospitalisation, non-adherence, and dropout due to any reason, inefficacy of treatment and adverse events were summarised in a meta-analysis using a r andom-effects model. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool , and publication bias with funnel plots RESULTS: Ten studies with 1700 participants met the inclusi on criteria. Depot formulations significantly reduced re- lapses with relative and absolute risk reductions of 30% and 10%, respectively (RR 0.70, CI 0.57-0.87, NNT 10, CI 6-25, P=0.0009), and dropout due to 0.71, CI 0.57-0.89). Limited data on non-adherence, rehospitali- sation and dropout due to any reason and adverse events rev ealed no significant differenc es. There were several potential sources of bias such as limited information on randomisation METHODS, problems of blinding and different medications in the depot and oral groups. Other studies reduced a potential superiority of depot by excluding non-adherent patients DISCUSSION: Depot antipsychotic drugs significantly r to a number of methodological prob- lems in the single trials the evidence is, nonetheless, s ubject to possible bias.

ABSTRACT: Nonadherence to antipsychotics poses a major problem in the long-term management of schizophrenia. Subjective measures of adherence (self-reports, pr ovider reports) are unreliable, more objective methods (e.g., electronic mon- 68 Resultat itoring, plasma levels) are neither ava ilable in clinical practice, nor are they infallible. Risk factors include history of nonadherence, substance use, limited in sight, treatment with antidepressant s, medication-induced cognitive im- pairment, hostility, and violent behavior. Nonadherence results in partial or no response to antipsychotic treatment with many adverse consequences, including higher mortality. A recent meta-analysis somewhat surprisingly failed to prove higher adherence to depot formulations than to oral antipsychotics. However, unexpectedly high adherence in the reviewed trials suggests selection bias. This is further supported indirect ly by the findings from two large ob- servational studies from Finland. They showed that depot fo rmulations, as compared to oral formulations of the same drugs, were associated with a significantly lower risk of rehospitalization and drug discontinuation. Prescrip- tion data from the Czech Republic indicate that depot antip sychotics are underutilized. Contrary to traditional as- sumptions, patients with previous exposure to depot medi cation appraised them favorably and frequently preferred them in the long-term treatment. Depot formulations ma y be considered not only for nonadhe rent, relapsing or diffi- cult-to-manage patients, but also for actively pa rticipating, well-informed patients with insight Mohr P, Volavka J. update Nonadherence to antipsychotics poses a major problem in the long-term management of schizophrenia.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The economic impact and ease of measurem ent of all-cause hospital readmission rates (HRR) have led to the current debate as to whether they are reducible, and whether they should be used as a publicly reported quality indicators of medical care OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of broad clinical interventions in prevent ing HRR of patients with chronic dis- eases 69 Resultat METHOD: A meta-review of published systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clinical interven- tions that have included HRR among the patients' outcomes of interest MAIN FINDINGS: Meta-analyses of RCTs have consistent ly found that, in the community, disease management programs significantly reduced HRR in patients with hear t failure, coronary heart disease and bronchial asthma, but not in patients with stroke and in unselected patients with chronic disorders. Inhospital interventions, such as dis- charge planning, pharmacological consulta tions and multidisciplinary care, and community interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary di seases had an inconsistent effect on HRR. MAIN STUDY LIMITATION: De- spite their economic impact and ease of measurement, HRR are not the most important outcome of patient care, and efforts aimed at their reduction may compromise pati ents' health by reducing also justified re-admissions CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of inhospital interventions in reducing HRR is in need of further study. In patients with heart diseases and bronchial as thma, HRR may be considered as a publicly reported quality indicator of community care, provided that future research confirms that effort s to reduce HRR do not adversely affect other patients' out- comes, such as mortality, functional capacity and quality of life. Future research should also focus on the reasons for the higher efficacy of community interventions in pati ents with heart diseases and br onchial asthma than in those with other chronic diseases Calvillo-King L, Lo M, Eubank K, Yunyonying P, Stieglitz H, Arnold D, et al. A systematic review of social factors on risk of readmission and death after hospitalization with pneumonia or heart failure: Implications for pay for performance. Journal of General Internal Medicine Conference: 34th Annual Meeting of the Soci-ety of General Internal Medicine Phoenix, AZ United States Conference readmission and death after hos pitalization for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and heart failure (HF) are publically reported and will be tied to reimbursement. Safety net hospitals will be dis- proportionately affected if reimbursement policies do not acc ount for important patient-level social determinants that may increase risk of readmission and death. We performed a systematic review to assess the impact of social fac- tors on readmissions or death in CAP and HF. METHODS: We searched OVID, PubMed and PSYCHINFO fo r studies published since January 1, 1950. Eligible articles studied CAP or HF, include patient level data, examine >= 1 social factor (e.g., sociodemographics, insur- ance), and use readmission and/or death as the outcome. St udies were abstracted by two investigators using a structured data form ascertaining RESULTS [univariate (UV) and multivar iate (MV) associations] and methodological quality. Inter-rater discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: For CAP, 24 of 64 candidate articles met incl usion criteria. Readmission was the primary outcome for 4 studies, death for 16, and a composite outcome of readmission or death for 4. For HF, 52 of 170 were included. Readmission was the primary outcome for 26 studies, death for 39, and a composite outcome for 4. Thirty-nine percent of articles used administrative datasets, 23% medical records/ interviews, and 38% both. The overall meth- odological quality was mixed. Few studies rigorously exam ined social factors besides age, gender and race. Among CAP studies of readmission, only 5 assessed age effects, with 2/5 finding higher UV risk in the elderly, and 1/5 showing a significant MV age associati on. Six studies assessed gender effects with 3/4 showing higher UV&MV risk in women. Three examined race with 1/3 showing hi gher UV&MV readmission risk in non-whites. For death, 7/9 UV&MV risk for older age; 5/7 higher UV&MV risk in wo men; and 3/7 for higher UV risk for non-whites (and 2/6 MV race differences). Similarly, for HF studies of readmission, 28 assessed age effects, with 4/10 finding higher UV risk in the elderly, and 1/4 showing a significant MV association. Twenty-six assessed gender with 3/12 showing higher UV risk and 3/5 higher MV risk for women. Eighteen examined race with 6/9 showing higher UV risk and 3/5 higher MV risk for non-whites. For death, 38 assessed age e ffects with 5/11 showing higher UV risk and 8/13 higher MV risk for older age. Thirty-six assessed gender with 4/11 showing higher UV risk and 8/12 higher MV risk for women. Twenty-two assessed race effects with 3/7 show ing higher UV&MV risk for non-whites. A few studies found significant influences of ethnicity, insurance, education, unemployment, nur sing home residence, functional status, mental health, and alcoholism, among ot hers on rates of readmission or death. CONCLUSION: Most studies of readmission or death afte r CAP and HF ignored social factors, though those that looked found significant influences of age, gender, and race as well as others. More research is needed to assess the impact of deeper level social variables on risk of post-DC outcomes. Pay-for-Performance policies should adjust for the impact of social determinants of adverse post-hospital outcomes Craven B, Hermann M, Bishow A, Turse S, Kreisa L, Boling P. Predicting unplanned readmissions at a large, Urban medical center. Journal of Investigative Medicine Conference: American Federation for Medical Re-search Southern Regional Meeting, AFMR 2011 New Orleans, LA United States Conference Start: End: 30-day hospital readmission reflects co-morbidity and care quality, drives costs, and soon will impact payment. At our institution, 30-day readmission rate is a Performance Improvement target for CY2010. 70 Resultat We focused a pilot on two medicine units with combi ned monthly discharges of 330 patients and a 20% readmission rate. Given resource limitations, we needed to target a gr oup upon admission that is at risk for readmission. Litera- ture review found many variables associated with r eadmission but few predictive t ools, including LACE (CMAJ 2010. DOI:10.1503/cmaj.091117) which includes length of stay and is less useful at time of admission. METHODS Used: We randomly selected 125 patients discharged in CY2009 from the 2 pilot units who had un- planned readmissions within 30 days (E) and 125 more that did not (C). We performed detailed reviews of electronic health records, recording demographic data (age, sex, race), insurance type, living situation, ADL score, # of emer- gent admissions in prior 6 months, # of medications, and diagnoses thought to drive readmission (substance abuse, major psychiatric disorder, sickle cell disease, CKD stage 3 or more). We tested published prediction tools including the Charlson Index, LACE score, and LACE without length of stay (LACE-LOS). Using bivariate comparisons be- tween E and C, we identified variables statis tically associated with early readmission. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: Charlson Index, LACE-LOS, # of medications and # of emergent visits were associated with readmission. Emergent care and Charlson Index prov ided more discrete separation of E and C groups. Pivot tables helped to identify the best pairing of emergent care vi sits (3 or more) OR Charlson Index (4 or higher). This combination or \"RAM-PART\" (Re-AdMission Prediction A nd Risk Assessment Tool) had a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 42% for 30-day re-adm ission and retrospectively identified 54% of admitted patients for targeted inter- vention. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a prospective identification tool for high-risk patients likely to be readmitted. Sensitivi- ty and specificity are suboptimal but it performs better than other published tools. The tool will be validated and refined in a 3-6 month pilot interv ention designed to reduce readmissions Hansen LO, Young RS, Hinami K, Leung A, Williams MV. Interventions to reduce 30-day rehospitalization: a systematic review. Ann Intern Med 2011;155(8):520-8. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: About 1 in 5 Medicare fee-for-service pati ents discharged from the hospital is rehospitalized within 30 days. Beginning in 2013, hospitals with high risk-standar dized readmission rates will be subject to a Medicare reimbursement penalty. Purpose: To describe interventions evaluated in studies aimed at reducing rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for reports pub- lished between January 1975 and January 2011. Study Select randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; of interventions to reduce rehospitalization that reported rehospitalization rates within 30 days. Data Extraction: 2 reviewers independently identifi ed candidate articles from the results of the initial search on the basis of title and abstract. Two 2-physician reviewer teams reviewed the full text of candidate articles to identify interventions and assess study quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: 43 articles were identified, and a ta xonomy was developed to categorize interventions into 3 domains that encompassed 12 distinct activities. Predischarge in terventions included patient education, medication reconciliation, discharge planning, and scheduling of a follo w-up appointment before discharge. Postdischarge in- terventions included follow-up telephone calls, patient-act ivated hotlines, timely communication with ambulatory providers, timely ambulatory provider follow-up, and postdischarge home visits. Br idging interventions included transition coaches, physici an continuity across the inpatient and outpat ient setting, and patient-centered of ef- fects. Many studies identified in the review were single- institution assessments of quality improvement activities rather than those with experimental designs. Several common interventions have not been studied outside of multi- component \"discharge bundles.\" CONCLUSION: No single intervention implemented alone wa s regularly associated with reduced risk for 30-day rehospitalization.

Ann Intern Med 2012;157(6):417-28 ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Evidence shows that suboptimum handov ers at hospital discharge lead to increased rehospitalizations and decreas ed quality of health care. PURPOSE: To systematically review interventions that aim to improve patient discharge from hospital to primary care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, t he Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for stud- ies published between January 1990 and March 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials of inte rventions that aimed to improve handovers between hos- pital and primary care providers at hospital discharge. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study objectives, setting and design, inter- 71 Resultat vention characteristics, and outcomes. Studies were cat egorized according to methodological quality, sample size, intervention characteristics, outcome, statisti cal significance, and direction of effects. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 36 included studies, 25 (69.4%) had st atistically significant effects in favor of the inter- vention group and 34 (94.4%) described multicomponent interv entions. Effective interventions included medication reconciliation; electronic tools to facilitate quick, clear , and structured summary generation; discharge planning; shared involvement in follow-up by hospital and community ca re providers; use of elec tronic discharge notifications; and Web-based access to discharge information for general practi tioners. Statistically significant effects were mostly found in reducing hospital use (for exampl e, rehospitalizations), improvement of continuity of care (for example, accurate discharge information), and improvement of patient status after discharge (for example, satisfaction). LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of the interventions and st udy characteristics made meta-analysis impossible. Most studies had diffuse aims and poor descriptions of the specific intervention components. CONCLUSION: Many interventions have positive effects on pat ient care. However, given the complexity of interven- tions and outcome measures, the literature does not permi t firm cpmc\u00f8isopms about whic h interventions have these effects.

Aust Health Rev 2010;34(3):2010. ABSTRACT: *Increasing demand on public hospital beds has led to what many see as a hos pital bed crisis requiring substantial increases in bed numbers. By 2050, if current bed use trends persist and as the numbers of frail older patients rise exponentially, a 62% increase in hospital beds will be required to meet expected demand, at a cost almost equal to the entire current Australian healthcare budget. *This article provides an overview of the effectiveness of different strategies for reducing hospital demand that may be viewed as primarily (although not exclusively) targeting the hospital sector increasing capacity and throughput and reduci ng readmissions or the non-hospital sector facilitating early discharge or reducing presentations and admissions to hospital. Evidence of effectiveness was retrieved from a literature search of randomised trials and observational studies using broad s earch terms. *The principal findings were as follows: (1) within the hospital sector, thro ughput could be substantially improved by outsourcing public hospital clinical services to the priv ate sector, undertaking whole-of-hospital reform of care processes and patient flow that address both access and exit block, separating ac ute from elective beds and se rvices, increasing rates of day-only or short stay admissions, and curtailing ineffective or marginally effective clinical interventions; (2) in re- gards to the non-hospital sector, potentially the biggest gains in reducing hospital demand will come from improved access to residential care, rehabilitation services, and dom iciliary support as patients awaiting such services cur- rently account for 70% of acute hospital bed-days. Mo re widespread use of acute care and advance care planning within residential care facilities and population-based chr onic disease management program s can also assist. *This overview concludes that, in reducing hospital bed demand, clinical process redesign within hospitals and capacity enhancement of non-hospital care services and chronic disease management programs are effective strategies that should be considered before investing heavily in creating addi tional hospital beds devoid of any critical reappraisal of current models of care. What is known about the topic There is a growing demand for inpatient care in Australia, with presentations to public hospital emergency departments increasing by 4.9% per year over the last 5 years and admission numbers increasing by 3.6% pe r year. Increasing numbers of hospi tal beds may give only short-term reprieve in lowering bed occupancy rates if little attention is giving to improving hospital efficiency by internal pro- cess redesign or by decreasing demand for acute hospital beds by improving capac ity of the non-hospital sector to manage sub-acute illness and chronic disease. What does th is paper add This article provides a narrative meta- review of the evidence of effectiveness of various reform strategies. The key findings are that, within the hospital sector, patient throughput could be substantially improved by: outsourcing public hospital clinical services to the private sector where appropriate; implementing whole-of-hos pital reforms, which that facilitate more flexible and dynamic bed management (especially where it relates to syst ems of care for acutely ill patients); separating acute from elective beds and services; incr easing the numbers of day-only admissi ons; and curtailing ineffective or mar- ginally effective clinical interventions. However, the potentia lly biggest gains in hospital productivity will come from improved access to residential care, rehabilitation serv ices and domiciliary support for hospitalised patients who no longer require acute inpatient care, combined with decr eased need for hospitalisation as a result of population- based chronic disease management programs led by prim ary care agencies, and acute care and advance care planning within residential care facilities. What are the im plications for practitioners A public debate must start now on how the healthcare system and the role within it of hospitals should be re-config ured in managing future popula- tion healthcare needs in a sustainable way. In the meantime, all hospitals must consider implementing reforms with potential to improve their productivity and reduce access bl ock for those who really need acute hospital care. 2010 AHHA Shoeb M, Rennke S, Nguyen O, Yimdriuska M, Ranji S.

Journal of Hospital Medicine Conference: 2012 Annual Meeting of the Society of Hospital Medicine, SHM 2012 San Diego, CA United States Conference Start: addressing the gaps in transitional care, wh ich manifest as adverse events (AEs) and readmissions after disc harge. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services plan to lower reim- bursement to hospitals with excessive 30-day readmission ra tes. However, there is a lack of evidence-based strate- gies for improving transitional care. We conducted a systematic review of inte rventions to improve safety after hos- pital discharge, focusing on studies with a hospital-based intervention component. METHODS: We searched CINAHL, MEDLINE, the Cochr ane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EMBASE from 1991 to 2011. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and nonrandomized controlled trials (CCTs) that evaluated interventions to prevent AEs or readmissions in general medical pat ient populations, utilized at least one intervention prior to discharge, and reported rates of em ergency department visits, readm issions, or AEs after dis- charge. Titles and abstracts were scr eened and potentially relevant articles underwent full-text evaluation by two independent reviewers who extracted data on intervention c haracteristics, study methodological quality, and out- comes. We devised a taxonomy of interventions (Table); studi es were further classified as using a \"bridging\" inter- vention (predischarge and postdi scharge components) or a predischarge intervention only. RESULTS: We identified 15,905 citations, of which 454 underwent full-text review. Forty-six studies met all inclusion criteria, including 25 RCTs, 18 CCTs, and 3 implementation studies. Studies used a medi an of four interventions (range 1- 8); a bridging intervention was used in 31 st udies (21 RCTs) and 12 used a predischarge only intervention (three RCTs). All but one study reported readmission or ED vi sit rates, including 16 studies (11 RCTs) that reported these outcomes at 30 days after discharge. Only 10 studies reported AE rates after discharge (five of which meas- ured postdischarge adverse drug events). We identified five studies (four RCTs ) that reported significant reductions in 30- day ED visit or readmission rates; all of these st udies used a bridging strategy with >=5 separate interven- tions. Only one study achieved a signific ant reduction in adverse drug events. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pressure to improve transitional care, only a small number of resource-intensive interven- tions involving both predischarge and postdischarge components have success fully reduced 30-day readmissions. There is a notable lack of studies targeting and document ing improvement in specific AEs after discharge. (Table presented) Soeken KL, Prescott PA, & the Health Professions 1991;14(3):262-81. ABSTRACT: Summarizing the results of research related to identify ing potential predictors of hospital readmissions has been difficult because of conflicting results across studies. Using the techniques of meta-analysis, the results from 44 studies were examined in the present study. Overall, the mean readmission rate was 27%, with significant differ- ences based on patient diagnosis . Although diagnosis, age, initial length of hospital stay, and prior use of hospital resources were related to readmission, the strength of the re lationship is trivial. Combin ing data from 12 intervention studies designed to reduce readmission indicated that the ov erall treatment effect was not significant. Further re- search is needed to determine demographic, clinical, and social predictors of readmission if strategies are to be developed to reduce readmission and the resulting health care costs Vest JR, Gamm LD, Oxford BA, Gonzalez MI, Slawson KM . Determinants of preventable readmissions in the review. Implementation Science 2010;5:88. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hospital readmissions are a leading topic of healthcare policy and practice reform because they are common, costly, and potentially avoidable events. Hosp itals face the prospect of reduced or eliminated reim- bursement for an increasing number of preventable r eadmissions under nationwide cost savings and quality im- provement efforts. To meet the current changes and fu ture expectations, organizations are looking for potential strategies to reduce readmissions. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to determine what factors are associated with preventable readmissions METHODS: We conducted a review of the English language medicine, health, and health services research litera- ture (2000 to 2009) for research studies dealing with unplanned, avoidable, preventab le, or early readmissions. Each of these modifying terms was included in keyword sear ches of Cochrane Library, ProQuest Health Management, and PAIS International. results were limited to US adult populations RESULTS: The review included 37 studies with signific ant variation in index condi tions, readmitti ng conditions, timeframe, and terminology. Studies of cardiovascular-re lated readmissions were most common, followed by all cause readmissions, other surgical proc edures, and other specific -conditions. Patient-level indicators of general ill health or complexity were the commonly identified risk factors. While more than one study demonstrated preventa- 73 Resultat ble readmissions vary by hospital, identification of many specific organizational level characteristics was lacking CONCLUSIONS: The current literature on preventable readmissi ons in the US contains ev idence from a variety of patient populations, geographical locations, healthcare settings, study designs, clin ical and theoretical perspectives, and conditions. However, definitional va riations, clear gaps, and methodological c hallenges limit translation of this literature into guidance for the operation and management of healthcare organizations. We recommend that those organizations that propose to reward reductions in prev entable readmissions invest in additional research across multiple hospitals in order to fill this serious gap in k nowledge of great potential value to payers, providers, and pa- tients Wong FK, Chan MF, Chow S, Chang K, Chung L, Lee WM, et al. What accounts for hospital readmission? J Clin Nurs 2010;19(23-24):3334-46 . ABSTRACT: AIMS: This study was launched to address the knowledge gap regarding factors leading to readmission to hospital BACKGROUND: Repeated hospital admission is an issue of c oncern for health care serv ice providers. Research findings reveal that multiple fact ors can contribute to the phenomenon, but no study has examined the direct and indirect effects of these va riables on hospital readmission DESIGN: A survey conducted during the period from 2003-2005 in three hospitals in Hong Kong METHODS: Patients who were readmitted to the same hospi tal within 28days during the study periods were includ- ed. Data were collected using structured interviews. A st ructural equation model was employed to examine what factors will contribute to hospital readmission RESULTS: The final model showed that subjective health outcome was the only significant variable that had a direct effect on readmission, and it had indirect effects on readm ission mediating through the variables of age, income and satisfaction with care CONCLUSIONS: A literature review reveals that none of t he studies has recognised patient s' subjective appraisal of their health condition as a signi ficant variable to predict hospital readmi ssion. Results did not find an association be- tween evaluated and perceived need. In other words, patient s who felt a higher need for hospital care were not necessarily sicker. It is possible that if patients c an be empowered to manage their own health condition and make a fair appraisal of their well-being, unnecessary use of hospital serv ices can be reduced RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study provides evidence to support the notion that an effective transi- tional care programme needs to incorporate patients' own subjective assessment of health in the intervention and measurement of the outcome. We cannot solely use provi ders' judgment to measure health outcomes, for patients are active agents in seeking health care, and the use of serv ices is to an extent self-selective. 2010 Blackwell Pub- lishing Ltd Yam CH, Wong EL, Chan FW, Wong FY, Leung MC, Yeoh EK. Measuring and preventing potentially avoida-ble hospital readmissions: a review of the literature. [Review]. Hong Kong Medical Journal 2010;16(5):383-9. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: To review literature identifying key com ponents for measuring avoidable readmissions, their preva- lence, risk factors, and interventions that can reduce potentially avoidable readmissions DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: Literature search us ing Medline, PubMed and the Cochrane Library up to June 2010, using the terms le\", \"unplanned\", \"unnecessary\", \"readmission\", and \"rehospitalization\" STUDY SELECTION: A total of 48 original papers and review articles were selected for inclusion in this review DATA SYNTHESIS: Although hospital readmission seemed to be a term commonly used as an outcome indicator in many studies, it is difficult to make valid comparison of re sults from different studies. This is because the definitions of terms, Methods of data collection, and approaches to data analysis differ greatly. The following criteria for study- ing hospital readmissions have been reco mmended: (a) identify hospital admissi ons and define relevant terms, (b) establish a clinical diagnosis for a r eadmission; (c) establish the purpose for a readmission, (d) set a discharge-to- readmission timeframe, and (e) identify the sources of in formation for assessing readmissions. Studies to identify avoidable readmissions usually involve medical records and chart reviews by clinicians using the classification scheme developed by the authors. The proportion of all r eadmissions assessed as preventable varies from 9 to 59% depending on the population of patients studied, duration of follow-up, type and methodology of the study and case-mix-related factors. A number of studies classified ri sk factors for readmission into four categories: patient, social, clinical, and system factors. Home-based interv entions, intensive education/c ounselling, multidisciplinary care approaches, and telephone follow-up were the main ty pes of interventions to address potentially avoidable readmissions 74 Resultat CONCLUSIONS: A standard instrument to identify avoidable readmission is important in enabling valid comparisons within the system and at different timelines, so as to per mit robust evaluation of interventions. The assessment of preventable risk factors for readmissions also provides a basis for designing and im plementing intervention pro- grammes Intervensjoner i pasientens hjem (11) Anderson MA, Clarke MM, Helms LB, Foreman MD. Hospital readmission from home health care before and after prospective payment. Journal of Nursing Scholarship 2005;37(1):73-9. ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: To describe and compare clients who were r eadmitted to the hospital du ring an episode of home health care, before and after the inception of the prospective payment system (PPS) DESIGN: A longitudinal mixed design was used to replicate a study conducted 9 years previously (pre-PPS) in the same home care agency in the central part of the United States METHODS: Seventy-six closed-case medical records from a not-for-profit hospital-affiliated home care agency were retrospectively reviewed and compared to pre-PPS data. The same data collection tool, the Hospital Readmission Inventory, was used for both pre- and post-PPS studies. Nu rse administrators at the data collection agency were interviewed concerning comparative results FINDINGS: Currently readmitted clients were sicker than were those in the previous research report, they were readmitted sooner for a different diagnosis, and they had less continuity of services CONCLUSIONS: The home health care industry has undergone a dramatic change in payment for services, from fee-for-service to PPS. Of particular concern is the adv erse patient outcome of an unplanned hospital readmission. Prior studies have characterized such patients in home health care, but no comparative reports were found in a literature search since the inception of PPS. Findings from this study indicated that an increased emphasis on cost containment and higher-risk clients appear to have changed patterns of care delivery Barras S. A systematic and critical review of the literature: the effectiveness of Occupational Therapy Home Assessment on a range of outcome measures. Australian Occupational Therapy Journal 2005;52(4):326-36. ABSTRACT: AIM: To identify, collate and assess the findings of the available literature regardi ng discharge planning involving occupational therapy home assessments and the identified outco me measures. A systematic critical review of 31 studies of home assessment was completed METHODS: A comprehensive computer-aided search was conducted of 10 databases. Any searches identifying literature on home assessment and occupational therapy were retained. The McMaster critical appraisal tools were used to determine methodological quality, the McMaster ( qualitative and quantitative). Summaries were made of the key features of each study to enable comparison RESULTS: Two systematic reviews, eight randomised cont rolled trials, 16 descriptive and five anecdotal studies were found. Twelve papers relating directly to occupati onal therapy were identified. A wide variety of outcome measures were identified, covering seven major cat egories of: personnel present, cost, frequency and when a home assessment was completed, readmission to hospital, stakeholder perspective and use of standardised assess- ments. There was minimal consistency in measuring outcome s. The McMaster critical review format was used to evaluate each paper and denote a score out of 15 for quantitative and 27 for qualitative papers. These forms are written in basic terms that can be understood by researchers as well as clinicians and students CONCLUSION: Low numbers of high level (levels 1, 2) or hi gh quality publications directly relevant to the effective- ness of occupational therapy home assessment and dischar ge planning were identified. It is apparent from the pau- city of quality and quantity of studies identified in this curr ent review that considerably more high-quality research is required prior to definitive recommendations being made re garding the use of occupational therapy home assess- ments in discharge planning Caplan GA, Sulaiman NS, Mangin DA, Aimonino RN, Wilson AD, Barclay L.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: assess the effect of \"hospital in the home\" (HITH) services that significantly substitute 75 Resultat for inhospital time on mortality, readmission ra tes, patient and carer satisfaction, and costs DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Social Sciences Citation Index, CINAHL, EconLit, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, from the earliest date in each database to 1 February 2012 STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) co mparing HITH care with inhospital treatment for pa- tients aged > 16 years DATA EXTRACTION: Potentially relevant studies were reviewed independently by two assessors, and data were extracted using a collection template and checklist DATA SYNTHESIS: 61 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. HITH care led to reduced mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69 to 6992 readmission rates (OR, 0.75; CI, to 0.95; P = 0.02; 41 RCTs with 5372 patients) and cost (mean difference, -1567.11; 95% CI, -2069.53 to -1064.69; P < 0.001; 11 RCTs with 1215 patients). The number needed to treat at home to prevent one death was 50. No heterogeneity was observed for mortality data, but heterogeneity was observed for data relating to readmission rates and cost. Patient satisfaction was higher in HITH in 21 of 22 studies , and carer satisfaction was higher in and six of eight stud- ies; carer burden was lower in eight of 11 studies, although not significantly (mean difference, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.19 to 0.19) CONCLUSION: HITH is associated with reductions in mort ality, readmission rates and cost, and increases in patient and carer satisfaction, but no change in carer burden Iliffe S, Shepperd S. What do we know about hospital at home? Lessons from international experience. Ap-plied health economics and health policy 2002;1(3):2002. ABSTRACT: Hospital in the home' or 'hospital at home' services have become popular solutions to the apparent problems of conventional hospital care in many countries. Until recently their eval uation has been limited, and little has been known about their costs and benefits. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of such services has failed to detect a difference in mortality and readmission rates of patients using hospital in the home, but does suggest that these services are acceptable to patients, although not necessarily to their carers. Important questions about professional roles and workloads in hospital at home servic es need further investigation. Overall it does not appear that such services produce cost savings, although this may depend greatly on local circ umstances. This discussion paper uses the findings of a systematic review of the lit erature evaluating hospital at home and hospital in the home services to answer questions surrounding the supplementary or subs titution status of these services Messecar D.

How does hospital-at-home inpatient hospital care for vari- ous outcomes? REVIEW SCOPE Included studies compared admission-av oidance HAH (time-limited active treatment by healthcare professionals for acute condi tions in patients' homes, without wh ich patients would be admitted to an acute care hospital ward) with acute i npatient hospital care in patients 18 year s of age. Studies of obstetric, paediat- ric, mental health, and long-term care se rvices; services in outpati ent settings or after hospi tal discharge; or patient self-care at home were excluded. Outcomes included morta lity, hospital readmission, functional ability, cognitive ability, quality of life, and patient satisfaction REVIEW METHODS:Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, EconLit, Cochrane E ffective Practice and Or- ganisation of Care Group register, and reference lists we re searched to January 2008 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs); researchers were contacted. 10 RCTs (n = 1333) met the selection criteria MAIN RESULTS Meta-analysis showed that admission-av oidance HAH decreased mortality at 6 months compared with inpatient care (table). Groups did not differ for mo rtality at 3 months, hospital readmission (table), functional ability, cognitive ability, or quality of life. Patients w ho received admission-avoidance HA H reported greater satisfac- tion than those who received inpatient care (4 RCTs, p<0.001) CONCLUSION Hospital-at-home to avoid admission decreases mortality at 6 m onths but does not differ from inpa- tient hospital care for mortality at 3 mont hs, hospital readmission, or quality of life Shepperd S, Doll H, Angus RM, Clarke MJ, Iliffe S, Kalra L, et al. Hospital at home admission avoidance. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008;(4):CD007491. 76 Resultat ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Admission avoidance hospital at home is a service that provides active treatment by health care professionals in the patient's home for a condition that ot herwise would require acute hospital in-patient care, and always for a limited time period. In particular, hospital at home has to offer a specific service to patients in their home requiring health care professionals to take an active part in the patients' care. If hospital at home were not available then the patient would be admitted to an acute hospital ward. Many countries are adopting this type of care in an attempt to reduce the demand for acute hospital admission.Objectives: To determine, in the context of a systematic review and meta analysis, the effective ness and cost of managing patients with admission avoidance hospital at home compared with in-patient hospital care.Search METHODS: The following databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, EconLit and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisati on of Care Group (EPOC) register. We checked the reference lists of articles identified electronically for evaluations of hospital at home and obtained potentially relevant articles. Unpublished studies were sought by contacting providers and researchers who were known to be involved in this field.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled tr ials recruiting patients aged 18 years and over. Studies com- paring admission avoidance hospital at hom e with acute hospital in-patient ca re. The admission avoidance hospital at home interventions may admit patients directly from t he community thereby avoiding physical contact with the hospital, or may admit from the emergency room.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Our statistical analys es sought to include all randomised patients and were done on an intention to treat basis. We r equested individual patient data (IPD) fr om trialists, and relied on published data when we did not receive trial data sets or the IPD did not include the relevant outcomes. When combining outcome data was not possible because of differences in the repor ting of outcomes we have presented the data in narrative summary tables.For the IPD meta-analysis, where at leas t one event was reported in both study groups in a trial, Cox regression models were used to calculate the log hazard ratio and its standard error for mortality and readmis- sion separately for each data set (where both outcomes we re available). We included randomisation group (admis- sion avoidance hospital at home versus control), age (above or below the median), and gender in the models. The calculated log hazard ratios were co mbined using fixed effects inverse va riance meta analysis. If there were no events in one group we used the Peto odds ratio method to ca lculate a log odds ratio from the sum of the log-rank test 'O-E' statistics from a Kaplan Me ier survival analysis. Statistical signi ficance throughout was taken at the two- sided 5% level (p<0.05) and data are presented as the esti mated effect with 95% confidence intervals. For each comparison using published data for dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios using a fixed effects model to combine data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 RCTs (n=1333), seven of which were eligible for the IPD. Five out of these seven trials contributed to the IPD meta-analysis (n=850/975; 87% ). There was a non significant reduction in mortality at three months for the admission avoidanc e hospital at home group (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.09; p=0.15), which reached significance at six months follow-up (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.87; p=0.005). A non signifi- cant increase in admissions was observed for patients a llocated to hospital at home (adjusted HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.33; p=0.08). Few differences were reported for func tional ability, quality of life or cognitive ability. Patients reported increased satisfaction with admission avoidance hospital at home. Two trials conducted a full economic analysis, when the costs of informal care were ex cluded admission avoidance hospita l at home was less expensive than admission to an acute hospital ward. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We performed meta-analyses wher e there was sufficient similarity among the trials and where common outcomes had been measured. There is no evidence from the analysis to suggest that admis- sion avoidance hospital at home leads to outcome s that differ from inpatient hospital care Shepperd S, Doll H, Broad J, Gladman J, Iliffe S, Langhorne P, et al.

For patients recovering from a stroke and elderly patients with a mix of conditions respectively, significantly fewer people allocated to hospita l at home were in residential care at follow-up (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99; N =3 trials). Patients reported increased satisfaction with early discharge hospital at home. There was insu fficient evidence of a diffe rence for readmission between groups in trials recruiting patients recovering fr om surgery.

For patients recovering from a stroke and elderly patients with a mix of conditions respectively, significantly fe wer people allocated to hospital at home were in residential care at follow up (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98; N 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99; N =3 trials). Patients reported increased satisfaction with early discharge hospital at home. Ther e was insufficient evidence of a difference for readmission between groups in trials recruiting patients recovering fr om surgery. Evidence on cost savings was mixed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing interest in the potential of early discharge hospital at home ser- vices as a cheaper alternative to in-patient care, this review provides insufficient objective evidence of economic benefit or improved health outcomes.

Hospital at home versus in-patient hospital care. 2005 2005;(3):CD000356 ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hospital at home is defined as a service t hat provides active treatment by health care pro- fessionals, in the patient's home, of a condition that otherwi se would require acute hospital in-patient care, always for a limited period OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of hospital at home compared with in-patient hospital care 78 Resultat SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) spe- cialised register (November 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to 1996), EMBASE (1980 to 1995), Social Science Citation Index (1992 to 1995), Cinahl (1982 to 1996), EconLit (1969 to 1996), PsycLit (1987 to 1996), Sigle (1980 to 1995) and the Medical Care supplement on economic literature (1970 to 1990) SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of hospital at hom e care compared with acute hospital in-patient care. The participants were patients aged 18 years and over DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality MAIN RESULTS: Twenty two trials are included in this updat e of the review. Among trials evaluating early discharge hospital at home schemes we found an odds ratio (OR) for mo rtality of 1.79 95% CI 0.85 to 3.76 for elderly medical patients (age 65 years and over) (n = 3 trials); OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.17 for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 5 trials); and OR 0.78; 95%CI 0.52 to 1.19 for patients recovering from a stroke (n = 4 trials). Two trials evaluating the early discharge of patients recovering from surgery reported an OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.02 to 10.89) for patients recovering from a hip replacement and an OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.37 to 2.81) for patients with a mix of conditions at three months follow-up. For readmission to hospital we found an OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.78 to 3.99 at 3 months follow-up for elderly medical patients (n = 2 trials); OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.19 for patients with COPD (n = 5 trials); and OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.45 for pat ients recovering from a stroke (n = 3 trials). No signifi- cant heterogeneity was observed. One trial recruiting patient s following surgery for hernia or varicose veins reported 0/117 versus 2/121 patients were re admitted (Ruckley 1978) ; that (5%) 3%, 95% CI -5% of from replacement, (9%) 1/39 (3%) (difference 6%, 95% CI -3% to 15%) of patients recovering from a k nee patients recovering from a hysterectomy were readmitted. A third trial analysing surgical and medical patients together reported that 42/159 ve rsus 17/81 patients were readmitted at 3 months (OR 1.34 95% CI 0.66 to 2.20). Allocation to hospital at home re sulted in a small reduction in hospital length of stay, but hospital at home increased overall length of care. Patients a llocated to hospital at home expressed greater satisfac- tion with care than those in hospital, while the view of carers was mixed AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing interest in the potential of hospital at home services as a cheaper alternative to in-patient care, this review provides insuffici ent objective evidence of economic benefit. Early dis- charge schemes for patients recovering from elective surgery and elderly pat ients with a medical condition may have a place in reducing the pressure on acute hospital beds, providing the view s of the carers are taken into ac- count. For these clinical groups hospital length of stay is reduced, although this is offset by the provision of hospital at home. Future primary research should focus on ri gorous evaluations of admi ssion avoidance schemes and standards for original research should ai m at assisting future meta-analyses of individual patient data from these and future trials.

Medication review and reconciliation with cooperation between pharmacist and general practitioner and the benefit for the patient: A systematic review. Br J Clin Pharmacol 2012;74(1):July. ABSTRACT: This article systematically reviews the literature on the impact of collaboration between pharmacists and general practitioners and describes its effect on patients' health. A systematic literature search provided 1041 articles. After first review of title and abstract, 152 arti cles remained. After review of the full text, 83 articles were included. All in- cluded articles are presented according to the following variabl es: (i) reference; (ii) design and setting of the study; (iii) inclusion criteria for patients; (iv) description of the intervention; (v) whether a patient interview was performed to involve patients' experiences with t heir medicine-taking behaviour; (vi) outco me; whether healthcare profes- sionals received additional training; and (viii) whether healthcare professional s received financial reimbursement. Many different interventions are described where pharma cists and general practitioners work together to improve patients' health. Only nine studies reported hard outcomes, such as hospital (re)admissi ons; however, these studies had different results, not all of which were statistically significant. Randomized contro lled trials should be able to describe hard outcomes, but large patient groups will be needed to perform such studies. Patient involvement is important for long-term success. 2012 The Authors. Britis h Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 2012 The British Tait G, Behta M, Leas B, Hanish A, et al. Oral abstracts innovations the readmission risk flag: Using the electronic health record to automatically identify patients at risk for 30-day readmission. Journal of Hospital Medicine Conf erence: 2012 Annual Meeting of the So ciety of Hospital Medicine, SHM 79 Resultat 2012 San Diego, CA United States Conference unplanned readmissions within 30 day s of hospital discharge is a major focus of quality improvement and payment reform. Identification of patients at high risk for 30-day readmissions is an important step towards improving care and reducing readmissions. The grow ing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) may prove to be an important component of strategies designed to risk stratify patients and introduce targeted interven- tions. PURPOSE: To develop and implement an automated predictive model integrated into our hospital's EHR that identi- fies on admission patients at high risk fo r readmission within 30 days of discharge. DESCRIPTION: We first performed a systematic literature review to identify risk factors for 30-day readmissions. We then examined the data available from our hospital EHR at admission for t hose factors identified in our review, identified three variables that were consistently accurate, and then developed and tested 30 candidate prediction rules using a combination of these vari ables, including >0 and >1 prior admissi ons in the last 6 and 12 months, >0 and >1 prior ED visits in the last 6 and 12 months, and prio r 30 day readmissions in the last 6 and 12 months. Rules were tested on 24 months of historic data with a base line 30-day readmission rate of 5%. A single risk factor, >1 inpatient admissions in the past 12 months, was found to hav e the best balance of sensitiv ity (25%), positive predic- tive value (20%), patients flagged (7%) . An automated readmission risk flag was then integrated into the hospital's EHR, such that patients with this ri sk factor are flagged in the EHR on admission (Fig. 1). The flag can be double- clicked to display inform ation relevant to discharge planning incl uding inpatient and ED visits in the prior 12 months, as well as information about the primary t eam, length of stay, and admitting problem for those ad- missions. In the 30-day period after ri sk flag implementation, 13% of inpatients were flagged, and of those 21% were readmitted to our institution. The distribution of fl ags across hospital units corres ponds closely with the distri- bution of readmissions as expected. CONCLUSIONS: An automated prediction rule was easily and effectively integrated into an existing EHR and identi- fied patients on admission who are at risk fo r readmission within 30 days of discharge. Future work will further pro- spectively evaluate the flags performanc e, gather qualitative data on how providers and care teams use the infor- mation provided by the flag, and examine t he impact of the flag on readmission rates Crocker JB, Crocker JT, Greenwald JL. Telephone a primary care intervention for postdischarge outcomes improvement: A systematic review. Am J Med 2012;125(9):September . ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: Postdischarge telephone follow-up plays an integral part in transitional care efforts in many regions. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate t he evidence regarding the impact of primary care-based tele- phone follow-up on postdischarge emergency departm ent visits and hospital readmissions. METHODS: We performed an electronic database search fo r relevant telephone follow-up studies originating in adult primary care settings. RESULTS: Only 3 studies (N = 1765) met entry criteria for this review. None of t he studies demonstrated evidence of reduced admissions or emergency depa rtment visits from primary care-based telephone follow-ups. All 3 studies reported improved primary care office contact as a result of telephone follow-up intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the growing use of primary ca re-based telephone follow-up in the postdischarge period, there are no high-quality studies demonstrating its benef it. However, its positive impact on patient engagement holds potentially meaningful implications. In light of recent national health care l egislation, the primary care field is ripe for high-quality studies to evaluate the effectivene ss of telephone follow-up for patients in the postdischarge period. Particular areas of research focus are discussed. 2012 Elsevier Inc Lavenberg JG, Williams K, Behta M, Vanzandbergen C, Norris A.

The efficacy of com-puter-enabled discharge communication interventions: A systematic review. BMJ Quality and Safety 2011;20(5):May. ABSTRACT: CONTEXT: Traditional manual/dictated di scharge summaries are inaccurate, in consistent and untimely. Computer- enabled discharge communications may im prove information transfer by pr oviding a standardised document that immediately links acute and community healthcare providers. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review evaluating the efficacy of computer-enabled discharge communication 80 Resultat compared with traditional communication for pati ents discharged from acute care hospitals. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE In- Process. Keywords from three themes were combined: discharge communication, el ectronic/online/web-based and controlled interventional studies. STUDY SELECTION: Study types included: clinical trials, quasiexperimental studies with concurrent controls and controlled before - after studies. Inte rventions included: (1) automatic populat ion of a discharge document by com- puter database(s); (2) transmission of di scharge information via computer tec hnology; or (3) computer technology providing a 'platform' for dynamic di scharge communication. Controls included: no intervention or traditional manu- al/dictated discharge summaries. Primary outcomes in cluded: mortality, readmission and adverse events/near misses. Secondary quality/completeness and satisfac- tion. DATA EXTRACTION: Description of interventions and stud y outcomes were extracted by two independent review- ers. RESULTS: 12 unique studies were identified: eight r andomised controlled trials and four quasi-experimental stud- ies. Pooling/meta-analysis was not possible, given t he heterogeneity of measures and outcomes reported. The primary outcomes of mortality and readmission were inconsis tently reported. There was no significant difference in mortality, and one study reported reduced long-term readm ission. Intervention groups experienced reductions in perceived medical errors/adverse events, and improvement s in timeliness and physician/patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-enabled discharge communications appear beneficial with respect to a number of im- portant secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes of mort ality and readmission are less commonly reported in this literature and require further study Intervensjoner p\u00e5 sykehus, medisinforskrivning (4) Campo M, V, Mart\u00c2nez. Efficacy of medication reconciliation in the prevention of adverse events [Spanish]. Metas de Enfermeria 2011;14(1):28-32. ABSTRACT: Recent studies support medication re conciliation (MR) as an imegral step in the process ofcare andas an importam initiativefor the patient's safety. Despite this, these resu lts have not been sufficiently evaluated. Objective: to deter- mine whether the reconciliation procedure is effective in t he prevention ofmedication erro rs audlor to improve the outcome ofhealth care. Metodology: searchers were out in differem electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scielo, Cochrane) and grey literature bases. Controlled and Randomised Clinical Trials (CCTs and CRTs) were selected and in their absence, other research designs (non randomised c linical trials or quasi- experimental studies) were selected. The participants were subjectsfrom all age groups, Thefollowing resultsa were included: rehospitalisations, visits to t he ER, adverse events to drugs and mortality. Two foreign reviewers extracted the data and independently evaluated the quality ofthe studies using the Jadad scale. RESULTS: 163 articles were located audfour were in cluded to conduct the meta-analysis. The total number ofpatients was 1259. MR significamly reduced the number CONCLUSIONS: MR is effective in reducing the rate of adverse events caused by m edication errors and the rate ofvisits to the ER and hospitaUsations Lesprit P, Landelle C, Brun-Buisson C. Clinical impact of unsolicited post-prescription antibiotic review in surgical and medical wards: a randomized controlled trial. Clinical Microbiology & Infection 2013;19(2):E91-E97. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to determine the clinical course of pat ients and the quality of antibiotic use using a systematic and unsolicited post-prescription antibiotic review. Seven hundred and fifty-three adult patients receiving antibiotic ther- apy for 3-5 days were randomized to receive either a post- prescription review by the infectious disease physician (IDP), followed by a recommendation to the attending physician to modify the prescription when appropriate, or no systematic review of the prescription. In the interv ention group, 63.3% of prescriptions prompted IDP recommenda- tions, which were mostly followed by ward physicians (90. 3%). Early antibiotic modifications were more frequent in the intervention group (57.1% vs. 25.7%, p <0.0001) , including stopping therapy, shortening duration and de- escalating broad-spectrum antibiotics. IDP intervention led to a significant reduction of the median [IQR] duration of antibiotic therapy (6 [4-9] vs. 7 days [5-9], p <0.0001). In-hospital mortality, ICU admission and new course of anti- biotic therapy rates did not differ between the two groups. Fewer patients in the intervention group were readmitted for relapsing infection (3.4% vs. 7.9%, p 0.01). There wa s a trend for a shorter length of hospital stay in patients 81 Resultat suffering from community-acquired infecti ons in the intervention group (5 days [3-10] vs. 6 days [3-14], p 0.06). This study provides clinical evi dence that a post-prescription antibiotic review followed by unsolicited IDP advice is effec- tive in reducing antibiotic exposure of patients and increasing the quality of antibiotic use, and may reduce hospital stay and relapsing infection rates, with no adverse effe cts on other patient outcomes. 2012 The Authors Clinical Microbiology and Infection 2012 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Naz K. Domiciliary medicines use review (MUR) bridging the interface between secondary and primary care. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety Conference: Prescribing and Research in Medicines Management (UK and Ireland) Conference 2012 London United Kingdom Conference Start: 20120209 INTRODUCTION: The transfer of medicines from secondary ca re to primary care and vice versa can lead to incor- rect transmission of information, un intended changes in medication as well as conti nuation of medication that should have been discontinued. Previous work has centred on whether home based medication reviews by phar- macists actually led to an increase of hospital re-adm issions compared to a control group 1, although underlying reasons for this may be related to re cognition of adverse incidents by pharmac ists in an already at risk group. Fol- lowing discharge, adverse drug reactions are not unco mmon and can be prevented or attenuated using interven- tions and advice 2.A further systematic review and me taanalysis suggested that for older people (60 years +), pharmacist led medication review and associated interventi ons do not have any effect on reducing mortality or re- admissions, but may improve medicine k nowledge and compliance with medication to take as intended 3. This ab- stract highlights a service development that utilises pharma cists as part of a strategy sions using domiciliary MURs. Projec t: The domiciliary MUR service is run simultaneously as an advanced and a locally commissioned enhanced service, initiated in 2009 at the Littleton Ward Intermediate Care Unit, Cannock Chase hospital in South Staffordshire PCT. The aim of t he service is to tackle hospi tal admissions, re-admissions and delayed discharges of the elderly. Patient's discharged from intermediate ca re beds received a domiciliary MUR within 7 days of discharge, as part of a wider remi t examining Functional Independenc e Measure Scores (FIM), small numbers of admissions to and E and re-admissions within 28 days of discharge. RESULTS: From April 2009 to March 2010, 69 domiciliary vi sits were claimed for by community pharmacists, of which 63 were paid for as part of the enhanced service. T he Littleton Unit annual report for 2009/2010 details a net health saving of 413,819 by using the community beds as step up and step down for admissions. Good FIM scores, small numbers of admission to A&E and re-admissions of patients within 28 days of discharge have been demon- strated by the service (81% improvement of FIM score on discharge), of which the domi ciliary MUR service is part of. There has also been a reduction in delayed discharges. Further analysis of re-admissions within 28 days after discharge from the Littleton Ward, via ca se notes show that of the 39 readmissions in 2009-2010, 5 were unrelated (e.g. clinical deterioration of condition) , 32 were unavoidable (e.g. acute or uns table condition) and 2 were related or a regular occurrence. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS: This project has further ed medication review by pharmacists as project out- comes show that community beds and intermediate care are part of the discharge process, rather than being com- partmentalized. Further work is required to investigate the impact of the domiciliary MURs specifically e.g. communi- ty pharmacist perspective, specific pati ent satisfaction survey etc. as well as analysis of interventions and recom- mendations made Simoens S, Spinewine A, Foulon V, Paulus D. Review of the cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve seamless care focusing on medication. International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy 2011;33(6):December. ABSTRACT: Aim of the review This review of the internat ional literature aims to assess the evidence and its meth- odological quality relating to the cost-effectiveness of interv entions to improve seamless care focusing on medica- tion. METHOD Studies were identified by searching Med line, EMBASE, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination data- bases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EconLit up to March 2011 using search terms related to health economics and to seamless care. To be included, ec onomic evaluations had to ex plore the costs and conse- quences of an intervention to improve seamless care focu sing on medication as compared with usual care. Meth- odological quality of studies was assess ed by considering perspec tive; design; source of clinical and economic data; cost and consequence measures; allo wance for uncertainty; and incremental analysis. Costs were actualized to 2007 values. RESULTS Eight studies on medication in terventions for hospitalized patients in the transition between ambulatory and hospital care were included in the review. A variety of types of medication interv entions and target populations have been assessed, but the evidence is limited to one ec onomic evaluation for each par ticular intervention type and each specific target population. Most studies dem onstrated an impact of interventions on compliance and (re)hospitalization rates and costs. The studies did not fi nd an impact on quality of life or symptoms. Economic eval- uations suffered from methodological limitations related to the narrow perspective; restriction to health care costs only; exclusion of costs of the intervention; use of in termediate consequence measures ; no allowance for uncertain- ty; and absence of incremental analysis. CONCLUSION In light of the small number of economic ev aluations and their methodological limitations, it is not possible to recommend a specific intervention to impr ove seamless care focusing on medication on health econom- 82 Resultat ic grounds.

Review: hospital based case management does not reduce length of hospital stay or readmis- sions in adults. Evidence Based Nursing 2006;9(2):54. ABSTRACT: Does hospital based case management reduce length of hospital stay and readmissions in adults? bibliographies and content experts STUDY SELECTION AND ASSESSMENT: random ised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of hospital based case management on length of stay or readmission rate in inpatients >/=18 years of age. Studies of patients with mental illness, outpatient serv ices, or hospital-to-community bas ed or community based case management were exduded. Methodological quality of individual studies was assessed using the 5 point Jadad scale; intervention qualify was assessed based on the presence of 6 component s: comprehensive assessment, education/consultation, collaboration, discharge planning, linkage wi th community, and monitoring/follow up OUTCOMES: length of stay and readmission MAIN RESULTS 12 RCTs (2876 patients, mean age 72 y) met the selection criteria. 11 studies assessed a nurse led intervention, and 1 assessed a physici an led intervention; in all studies, t he control group received usual care. 6 of the 12 studies had high quality scores (>/=8 out of 11), and 6 had moderate quality scores (4-7 out of 11). Meta-analysis using a random effects model showed no differ ence between case management and usual care for length of stay (10 studies, n = 2666; pooled effect size 0.094, 95% CI -0.032 to 0.220) or readmissions (10 studies, n = 2603; odds ratio 0.87, CI 0.69 to 1.04). Sensitivity analys es showed that the effects of case management on length of stay did not differ based on study quality or number of intervention components. However, effectiveness did vary by patient diagnosis: case management reduced length of st ay in patients with heart failure (pooled effect size 0.241, CI 0.012 to 0.470) but not in patients with stroke (pool ed effect size -0.226, CI -0.542 to 0.089) or frail elderly people (pooled effect size 0.126, CI -0.073 to 0.324). Sensit ivity analyses showed that the effects of case manage- ment on readmissions did not differ by study quality, number of intervention components, or patient diagnosis CONCLUSION Hospital based case management did not reduc e length of hospital stay or readmissions in adult inpatients Jacob L, Poletick EB. Systematic review: predictors of successful transition to community-based care for adults with chronic care needs. Care Management Journals 2008;9(4):154-65. ABSTRACT: Difficult transition from acute hospital back to the co mmunity can be challenging. Pr oblems encountered during this process can lead to unplanned readmission and emergency departm ent visits. It is important for care managers to be able to identify patients susceptible to difficult trans ition and to understand strategies to reduce risk of unplanned hospital readmission. This qualitative systematic review of 10 studies of discharge inte rventions and patient charac- teristics finds little evidence that e nhanced discharge support is related to impr oved physical status at home, but there is mixed support for its role in preventing or de laying hospital readmissions in certain discharge diagnoses, specifi cally heart failure and stroke. Additionally, those with adequate social support and confi dence in their self- care ability tend to experience fewer readmissions than do those living alone and those w ho perceive themselves as not ready to return home Kim Y, Soeken KL. A meta-analysis of the effect of hospital-based case hospital length-of-stay and readmission. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although many hospital-based case managemen t (CM) interventions have been studied, there is little work summarizing the effectivene ss of these studies. OBJECTIVES: The pur pose of this study was to investi- gate the effect of hospital-based CM compared with usual care on length of hospital stay and readmission rate. METHOD: A meta-analytic method was employed to analyze t he effect sizes of CM intervention on outcomes. Eligi- ble studies were retrieved using co mputerized database searches, footnote c hasing, and contact with content ex- 83 Resultat perts. The authors reviewed the final 12 studies, and the effect size, 95% confidence interval (CI), sensitivity, homo- geneity, and publication bias were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall average weighted effect size on length of stay (LOS) was 0.094 with a 95% CI of -0.032 to 0.220. The overall odds ratio for readmission was 0.87 with a 95% CI of 0.69 to 1.04. Overall, hospital-based CM interventions were not significantly e ffective in reducing LOS and readmissions. However, CM for patients with heart failure (effect size of 0.241 with a 95% CI of 0.012 to 0. 470) was significantly effectiv e in reducing LOS, although it was not effective for stroke patients (effect size of -0.226 with a 95% CI of -0.542 to 0.089) and frail elders (effect size of 0.126 with a 95% CI of -0.073 to 0.324). Analysis indicated that in this meta-analysis publication bias was unlikely. DISCUSSION: The findings of this meta-analysis demonstrate a 6% decrease in readmission rate for pa- tients who received hospital-based CM in terventions. Further meta-analytic studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of CM on other outcomes Nagarajan A, Ramsaroop S, Siegler E, Reid C. Interventions designed to improve transitional care of pa-tients discharged from hospital to home: A systematic review. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society Conference: 2010 Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Geriatrics Society Orlando, FL United States Conference BACKGROUND: Poor transitions from hospital to home are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, as well as increased healthcare costs.Although a variety of interventions have been devel oped to improve transitional care outcomes, a formal review of the interventions has not been previously conducte d. Purpose:To conduct a sys- tematic review of intervention studies that sought to impr ove transitional care outcomes and that focused specifically on the transition from hospital to home. METHODS:We searched PUBMED and OVID databases (1/70- 7/09) to identify English language articles that re- ported one or more efficacy outcomes associated with an intervention designed to improve the hospital to home discharge process. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts and employed a standardized abstraction tool to collect data from retained articles including target pop ulation, specific type and int ensity of intervention(s), as well as study outcomes. RESULTS:The search produced 1,675 cita tions, and 35 articles met eligibility criteria and were retained for re- view.The mean study population size and age were 286 (range = 32-1001) and 68.8 (49.6-84.0), respectively. Most studies (71%) employed control desi gn, 14% used a quasi-experimental design, and 11% were cohort studies. Interventions were most often delivered by nurses (77%), follo wed by multidisciplinary teams (11%) and other groups (12%). Types of outcomes varied widely: 66% assessed readmission rates, 34% examined quality of life and 11% assessed mortality. Of the 23 studies that examined readmission rates, 10 (44%) demonstrated significant results in favor of treatment: median proporti onate reduction in readmission = 11.2% (-10.4% to 14.7%). Of the 12 studies that examined quality of life, 7 (58%) reported significant treatment effects for mental health: me- dian improvement = 14.2% (2.6% reported = 11.9% (-2.2% to 29.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents variation in person( s) delivering the intervention, and types of outcomes studied. Modest reductions in readmission rates with corre sponding improvements in mental and physical quality of life were found. These results support efforts to standardize outcome appraisals in future research and to identify more efficacious interventions Naylor M, Aiken L, Kurtzman E, Olds D, Hirschman K. The Importance Of Transitional Care In Achieving Health Reform. Health Aff (Millwood) 2011;30(4):746-54. ABSTRACT: Under the Affordable Care Act of 2010, a variety of tr ansitional care programs and services have been established to improve quality and reduce costs. These programs help hospitalized patients with complex chronic conditions- often the most vulnerable-transfer in a safe and timely m anner from one level of care to another or from one type of care setting to another. We conducted a systematic revi ew of the research literature and summarized twenty-one randomized clinical trials of transiti onal care interventions targeting chroni cally ill adults. We identified nine interven- tions that demonstrated positive effects on measures relat ed to hospital readmissions-a key focus of health reform. Most of the interventions led to reductions in readmissions through at least thirty days after discharge. Many of the successful interventions shared similar features, such as a ssigning a nurse as the clinical manager or leader of care and including in-person home visits to discharged patients. Based on these findi ngs, we recommend several strate- gies to guide the implementation of transitional care under the Affordable Care Act, such as encouraging the adop- tion of the most effective interventions through such pr ograms as the Community-Based Care Transitions Program and Medicare shared savings and payment bundling experiments Parkes J, Shepperd S. Discharge planning from hospital to home. Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) (4) (pp CD000313), 2000 Date of Publication: 2000 2000;(Online):2000. 84 Resultat ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Discharge planning is t he development of an individualised disc harge plan for the patient prior to leaving hospital for home, with the aim of containing costs and improving patient outcomes. It has been suggested that discharge planning can reduce unplanned readmission to hospital. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of discharge pl anning for patients moving from hospital to home. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, ME DLINE (1966 to 1996), EMBASE (1980 to 1996), Sigle (1980 to 1996), Bioethics (1985 to 1996), Health Plan (all avail able years), PsycLit (1974 to 1996), Cinahl (1982 to 1996), EconLit (1969 to 1996), Social Science Citation Index (1992 to 1996), and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials and controlled tr ials comparing discharge planning with routine dis- charge for hospital patients. The outcomes were mortality, clinical complications, hosp ital length of stay, readmis- sions, discharge destination, general and di sease specific health status, functi onal status, psychological well-being, patient satisfaction, carer satisfaction, carer burden, cost to the health service, patient and family, general practice, and community services. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies were included involving 4837 pat ients. Four studies recruited patients with a medical condition; four recruited patients with a mix of medica l and surgical conditions, and one of these recruited medical and surgical patients as separate groups. There was a small reduction in hospital length of stay for elderly medical patients allocated to discharge planning (weighted mean differ ence -1.01, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.05). The effects of discharge planning on readmission rates were mixed. No stat istically significant differ ences were detected for pa- tient health outcomes. Patients with medical conditions a llocated to discharge planning reported increased satisfac- tion compared with those receiving routi ne discharge. No statistically significant differences were reported for overall health care costs, although one study reported a significant reduction in readmission costs for medical patients allo- cated to discharge planning. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The studies s howed mixed results, which may refl ect the different study populations and the different ways the intervention was implemented. There is some evidence t hat discharge planning may lead to reduced hospital length of stay, and in some cases reduc ed readmission to hospital. T here is also some evidence that discharge planning increased pati ent satisfaction. There was no ev idence that discharge planning reduced health care costs; however few studies conducted a formal economic analysis Rennke S, Nguyen O, Shoeb M, Magan Y, Wachter R, Ranji S. Hospital-initiated transitional care interven- tions as a patient safety strategy: a systematic review. Ann Intern Med 2013;158(5 Pt 2):433-40. ABSTRACT: Hospitals now have the responsibility to implement strat egies to prevent adverse outcomes after discharge. This systematic review addressed the effectiveness of hospital- initiated care transition strategies aimed at preventing clinical adverse events (AEs), emer gency department (ED) visits, and readmi ssions EMBASE, and Cochrane Da tabase of Clinical Trials (January 1990 to September 2012) were searched, and 47 controlled studies of fair met hodological quality were identified. Forty-six studies re- ported readmission rates, 26 reported ED visit rates, and 9 r eported AE rates. A \"bridging\" strategy (incorporating both predischarge and postdischarge interv entions) with a dedicated transition pr ovider reduced readmission or ED visit rates in 10 studies, but the overall strength of evidenc e for this strategy was low. Because of scant evidence, no conclusions could be reached on methods to prevent postdischarge AEs. Most studies did not report intervention context, implementation, or cost. The strategies hospital s should implement to improve patient safety at hospital discharge remain unclear Scott IA. Preventing the rebound: Improving care transition in hospital discharge processes. Aust Health Rev 2010;34(4):2010. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND. Unplanned readmissions of recently disc harged patients impose a signi ficant burden on hospitals with limited bed capacity. Deficiencies in discharge proce sses contribute to such readmissions, which have prompt- ed experimentation with multiple types of peridischarge interventions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the relative efficacy of perid ischarge interventions categor ised into two groups: (1) sin- gle component interventions (sole or pr edominant) implemented either before or after discharge; and (2) integrated multicomponent interventions which have pre- and postdischarge elements. DESIGN. Systematic metareview of controlled trials. Data collection. Search of four electronic databases for con- trolled trials or systematic review s of trials published between January 1990 and April 2009 that reported effects on readmissions. 85 Resultat DATA SYNTHESIS. Among single-component interventions , only four (intense self-management and transition coaching of high-risk patients and nurse home visits and telephone support of patients with heart failure) were effec- tive in reducing readmissions. Multicomponent interventi ons that featured early assessment of discharge needs, enhanced patient (and caregiver) education and counselling, and early postdischarge follow-up of high-risk patients were associated with evidence of benefit, especially in popul ations of older patients and those with heart failure. CONCLUSION. Peridischarge interventions are highly heterogenous and reported outcomes show considerable variation. However, multicomponent interventions ta rgeted at high-risk populations that include pre- and postdischarge elements seem to be more effective in reducing readmissions than mo st single-component interven- tions, which do not span the hospitalc 2010 Shepperd S, Lannin NA, Clemson LM, McCluskey A, Cameron ID, Barras SL. planning hos- pital to Reviews 2013;1:CD000313. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Discharge planning is a routine feature of he alth systems in many countries. The aim of discharge planning is to reduce hospital length of stay and unplanned readmission to hospi tal, and improve the co-ordination of services following discharge from hospital OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of planning the discharge of individual pati ents moving from hospital SEARCH METHODS: We updated the review using t he Cochrane EPOC Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Social Science Citation Index (last searched in March 2012) SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT s) that compared an individualised discharge plan with routine discharge care that was not tailored to the individual patient. Participants were hospital inpatients DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently undertook data analysis and quality assessment using a pre designed data extraction s heet. Studies are grouped according to patient group (elderly medical pa- tients, patients recovering from surgery and those with a mi x of conditions) and by outcom e. Our statistical analysis was done on an intention to treat basis, we calculated ri sk ratios for dichotomous out comes and mean differences for continuous data using fixed-effect meta-analysis. When combining outcome data was not possible, because of differences in the reporting of outcomes, we have presented the data in narrative summary tables MAIN RESULTS: We included twenty-four RCTs (8098 patients); three RCTS were identified in this update. Sixteen studies recruited older patients with a medical condition, four recruited patient s with a mix of medical and surgical conditions, one recruited patients from a psychiatric hospital, one from both a psychiatric hospital and from a gen- eral hospital, and two trials patients admitted to hospital following a fall (110 patients). Hospital length of stay and readmissions to hospital were statistically significantly reduced for patients admitted to hospital with a medical diag- nosis and who were allocated to discharge planning (mean differe nce length of stay -0.91, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, 12 tr ials). For elderly patients with a medical condition there was no statistically significant differenc e between groups for mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.25, five trials) or being discharged from hospital to home (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14, two trials). This was also the case for trials recruiting patients recovering from surgery and a mix of m edical and surgical conditions. In three trials, patients allocated to discharge planning reported increased satisf action. There was little ev idence on overall healthcare costs AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that a discharge plan tailor ed to the individual patient probably brings about reductions in hospital length of stay and readm ission rates for older people admitted to hospital with a medical condition. The impact of di scharge planning on mortality, health outcomes and cost remains uncertain Stubenrauch JM. More data: Transitional care reduces readmissions. Am J Nurs 2011;111(9):September .

J Eval Clin Pract 86 Resultat 2007;13(6):December . ABSTRACT: AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of study outcomes of published papers that report the effects of clinical pathways (CP). METHOD: Systematic review based on two search including searching Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Psychinfo and Picarta from 1995 till 2005 and ISI Web of Knowledge <sup>SM</sup>. We included randomized controlled or quasi-experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of clinical pat hway application. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies included randomization, power analysis, selection bias, validity of outcome indicators, appropriateness of statistical tests, direct (m atching) and indirect (statistical) control for confounders. Outcomes included length of stay, costs, readmission ra te and complications. Two reviewers independently as- sessed the methodological quality of the selected papers and recorded the findings with an evaluation tool devel- oped from a set of items for quality assessment derived fr om the Cochrane Library and other publications. RESULTS: The study sample comprised of 115 publications. A total of 91.3% of the studies comprised of retrospec- tive studies and 8.7% were randomized controlled studi es. Using a quality-scoring assessment tool, 33% of the papers were classified as of good quality, whereas 67% were classified as of low quality. Of the studies, 10.4% controlled for confounding by matching and 59.1% adopted parame tric statistical tests without testing variables on normal distribution. Differences in outcomes were not al ways statistically tested. Conclusion: Readers should be cautious when interpreting the results of clinical pathw ay evaluation studies because of the confounding factors and sources of contamination affect ing the evidence-based validity of the outcomes. 2007 The Authors Flynn D, Knoedler MA, Hess EP, Murad MH, Erwin PJ, Montori VM, et al. Engaging patients in health care decisions in the emergency department through shared decision-making: a systematic review. [Review]. Acad Emerg Med 2012;19(8):959-67. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many decisions in the emergency department (ED) may benefit from patient involvement, even though this setting has been cons idered least conducive to shared decision-making (SDM) OBJECTIVES: The objective was to c onduct a systematic review to evaluat e the approaches, methods, and tools used to engage patients or their surrogates in SDM in the ED METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched in conjunction with contacti ng content experts, reviewing se- lected bibliographies, and conducting citati on searches using the Web of Know ledge database. Two reviewers inde- pendently selected eligible studies that addressed patient involvement and engagement in decision-making in the ED setting via the use of decision s upport interventions (DSIs), defined as decision aids or decision support de- signed to communicate probabilistic information on the risks and benefits of treatment options to patients as part of an SDM process. Eligible studies described and assessed at least one of the following outcomes: patient know- ledge, experiences and perspectives on par ticipating in treatment or managemen t decisions, clinician or patient satisfaction, preference for involvement and/or degree of engagement in decision-making and treatment prefer- ences, and clinical outcomes (e.g., rates of hospital admi ssion/readmission, rates of medical or surgical interven- tions). Two reviewers extracted data on study characteri stics, methodologic quality, and outcomes. The authors also assessed the extent to which SDM interventions adhered to good practice for the presentation of information on outcome probabilities (eight probability items from the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Instrument [IPDASi]) and had comprehensive development processes RESULTS: Five studies met inclusion criteria and were synthesized using a narrative approach. Each study was of satisfactory methodologic quality and used a DSI to engage pati ents or their surrogates in decision-making in the ED across four domains: 1) management options for childr en with small lacerations; 2) options for rehydrating chil- dren presenting with vomiting or diarrhea or both; 3) ri sk of bacteremia (and associated complications), tests, and treatment options for febrile children; and 4) short-term ri sk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in adults with low- risk nontraumatic chest pain. Thre e studies had poor IPDASi probabilities and development process scores and lacked development informed by theory or involvement of clinicians and patients in development and usability test- ing. Overall, DSIs were associated with improvements in patients' knowledge and sati sfaction with the explanation of their care, preferences for involvement, and engagement in decision-making and demonstrated utility for eliciting patients' preferences and values about management and tr eatment options. Two computerized DSIs (designed to predict risk of ACS in adults presenting to the ED with c hest pain) were shown to reduce health care use without evidence of harm. None of the studies reported lack of feasibility of SDM in the ED CONCLUSIONS: Early investigation of SDM in the ED sugges ts that patients may benefit from involvement in deci- sion-making and offers no empirical evi dence to suggest that SDM is not feas ible. Future work is needed to develop and test additional SDM interventions in the ED and to ident ify contextual barriers and facilitators to implementation in practice. 2012 by the Societ y for Academic Emergency Medicine Gooch S.

ABSTRACT: QUESTION: For the disciplines of nursing, midwifery, health visiting, chiropody, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, clinic al psychology, pharmacy, a nd radiography, do dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines improve professional practi ce, cost effectiveness, and patient outcomes? DATA SOURCES: Studies were identifi ed using 9 bibliographic databases and the trials register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. Expe rts and libraries of professi onal organisations were con- tacted, internet sites were searched, bibliogr aphies were scanned, and 1 journal was handsearched. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after studies, or interrupted time series designs were selected if the professions of nursi ng or allied health were studied and if the dissemination or implementation of a clinical practice guideline was evaluated for changes in c linician behaviour or patient outcomes. Data extraction: Data were extracted on study design, participants, clinical area, study comparisons, and process and patient outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: 18 studies (13 RCTs) met the inclusion crit eria. Guidelines were targeted at nurses only (12 stud- ies), nurses and physicians (5 studies), dietitians only (1 study), and a multidisciplinary lipid team that included nurses (1 study). 3 RCTs evaluated guideline dissemination or implementation: 1 of a nurse protocol found positive changes in process (offer of vaccines) and 1 found improved catheter practices; and 1 that measured patient out- comes found more patients in the intervention group declin ing influenza vaccinations (p < 0.001) and pneumococcal vaccinations (p < 0.001). 4 RCTs compared a guideline with no guideline: 1 of 2 found some improvements in care process (labour and delivery). All 4 showed improvements in patient outcomes (quality of life and exercise in pa- tients with diabetes, multiple labour and delivery outcom es, decreased hospital readmission after surgery, and im- proved lipid values). There were 6 RCTs of skills subs titution (nurses taking on tasks conventionally done by a phy- sician). In all 6 studies, nurses showed at least equivalent care processes. 5 studies assessed patient outcomes: 1 study showed no difference in management of dysuria, fr equency, and vaginal discharge, and 1 showed no differ- ence in hypertension outcomes; 1 study showed greater sa tisfaction with nursing care, no difference in symptom relief or complications, but more patients returned with back problems within 3 months; 1 study showed improve- ment in satisfaction in 6 of 9 elements of headache re lief; and 1 study showed improved activated partial thrombo- plastin time. Methodological quality and data were often lim ited. Only 1 RCT (of dietitians) included a formal eco- nomic evaluation and found a cost efficiency in favour of the control group for 1 outcome (glycated haemoglobin), but no difference in blood glucose concentrations. CONCLUSION: Nursing care driven by guidelines may o ffer improvement in some process measures and patient outcomes.

Decreased hospital length of stay associated with presentation of cases at morning report with librarian support. Journal of the Medical Library Association 2007;95(4):October. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: The research sought to determine whether case discussion at residents' morning report (MR), accom- panied by a computerized literature search and librarian suppo rt, affects hospital charges, length of stay (LOS), and thirty-day readmission rate. METHODS: This case-control study, conducted from August 2004 to March 2005, compared outcomes for 105 cases presented at MR within 24 hours of admission to 19,210 potential matches, including cases presented at MR 89 Resultat and cases not presented at MR. With matching criteria of patient age (+/- 5 years), identical primary diagnosis, and secondary diagnoses (within 3 additional diagnoses) usi ng International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, 55 cases were matched to 136 controls. Statistical analys es included Student's t tests, chi-squared tests, and non- parametric methods. RESULTS: LOS differed significantly between matched MR cases and controls (3 days vs. 5 days, P < 0.024). Me- dian total hospital charges were $7,045 for the MR gr oup and $10,663 for the control group. There was no differ- ence in 30-day readmission rate between the 2 groups. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Presentation of a case at MR, followed by the timely dissemination of the results of an online literature review, resulted in a shortened LOS and lower hospital charges compared with controls. MR, in association with a computerized literature search guided by the librarians, was an effective means for introducing evidence-based medicine into patient care practices Butler M, Collins R, Drennan J, Halligan P, O'Math\u00fana DP, Schultz TJ, et al. Hospital nurse staffing models and patient and staff-related outcomes. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2011;(7):CD007019. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Nurse staffing interventions have been introduc ed across countries in recent years in response to changing patient requirements, developments in patient ca re, and shortages of qualified nursing staff. These include changes in skill mix, grade mix or qualific ation mix, staffing levels, nursing shi fts or nurses' work patterns. Nurse staffing has been closely linked to patient outcomes, organi sational outcomes such as costs, and staff-related out- comes.Objectives: Our aim was to explore the effect of hospital nurse staffing models on patient and staff-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases fr om inception through to May 2009: Cochrane/EPOC resources CENTRAL, the EPOC Specialised Regi ster), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, CAB Health, Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library, the Joanna Briggs Institute database, the British Library, interna- tional theses databases, as well as generic search engines.Selection criteria: Randomised control trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and a fter studies and interrupted time series analyses of interventions relating to hospital nurse staffing models. Participants were patients and nursing staff working in hospital settings. We included any objective measure of patient or staff-related outcom e.Data collection and analysis: Seven reviewers working in pairs independently extracted data from each potentia lly relevant study and assessed risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 6,202 studies that were pot entially relevant to our review. Following detailed exami- nation of each study, we included 15 studies in the review . Despite the number of studies conducted on this topic, the quality of evidence overall was very limited. We found no evidence that the addition of specialist nurses to nurs- ing staff reduces patient death rates, attendance at the emer gency department, or readmission rates, but it is likely to result in shorter patient hospital stays, and reductions in pressure ulcers. The evidence in relation to the impact of replacing Registered Nurses with unqualif ied nursing assistants on patient outcomes is very limited. However, it is suggested that specialist support staff, such as dietary assistants, may hav e an important impact on patient out- comes. Self-scheduling and primary nursing may reduce staff turnover. The introduction of team midwifery (versus standard care) may reduce medical procedures in labour and re sult in a shorter length of stay without compromising maternal or perinatal safety. We found no eligible studies of educational interventions , grade mix interventions, or staffing levels and therefore we are unable to draw conclusions in relation to these interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest interventions relating to hospi tal nurse staffing models may im- prove some patient outcomes, particularly the addition of specialist nursing and specialis t support roles to the nurs- ing workforce. Interventions relating to hospital nurse staffing models may also improve staff-related outcomes, particularly the introduction of primary nursing and self- scheduling. However, these fi ndings should be treated with extreme caution due to the limited evidence ava ilable from the research conducted to date Carpenter J.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES 1. Describe how palliative care teams are repo rting transitions for adult pat ients. 2. Articulate dis- charge disposition location of patients seen by inpatient palliative care teams. BACKGROUND. Palliative care clinical practice guide lines and accrediting agencies em phasize the importance of care coordination and managing transitions while implementing effective palliative care. However, it is unclear how hospitalbased teams are easing transitions for patients who receive inpati ent palliative care services without hos- pice upon hospital discharge. Aim. The purpose of this synt hesis is to review hospital based palliative care team discharge planning and specifically the proc ess of palliative care coordination from hospitals to nursing homes. A systematic review of US literature published between 1990 and 2012 was performed using PubMed, CINAHL, and AgeLine databases. Search terms included palliative care, hospi tal, and discharge. Articles reflective of discharge planning or disposition and post-acute palliative care transit ion as a primary outcome were included. Pediatrics was 90 Resultat excluded. METHODS/Session Descriptions. Five peer-r eviewed, original research arti cles were identified from 65 RESULTS. Amanual search of the reference lists did not re sult in additional articles. Research methods varied with one qualitative and four quantitative studies. Findings include t hat the most palliative care patients seen in the hos- pital are discharged alive. Selected arti cles measured survival, r eadmission rate, location of death, number of partic- ipants referred to hospice after discharge, and costs. Nu rsing home placement ranged from 3% to 20%. Only one study described healthcare experiences of patients and fam ilies after hospital discharge. None of the studies exam- ined follow through of palliative care recommendations after discharge. CONCLUSION. This literature review documents a lack of re search describing the continuity (or lack thereof) of care following inpatient palliative care services. Fu ture studies are needed to describe and enhance patient and family experiences and outcomes of hospital-based palliative care services post-discharge, with a focus on care coordination and continuity Griffiths P, Edwards M, Forbes A, Harris R. Post-acute intermediate care in nursing-led units: a systematic review of effectiveness. Int J Nurs Stud 2005;42(1):107-16. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: In care in nursing-led inpatient units (NLUs) is effective in preparing patients for discharge from hospital we conducted a systematic review of the evidence. REVIEW METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Effective Prac tice and Organisation of Ca re specialist register, Med- line, Cinahl, Embase, British Nursing Index and the HMIC databases were s earched for all available dates up to mid-2003. The science and social science cita tion indices were searched for papers that cited key works. Authors of papers were asked to identify additional research. Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time-series designs that compared the NLU to usual post-acute inpatient care for adults were included in the review. Studies were assessed for quality. Statistical meta-analysis on the re- sults of controlled trials was performed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the impact of methodo- logical quality on conclusions. Outcomes: Outcomes considered were mortality, institutionalisation after discharge, functional status early readmission, length of inpatient stay and cost. RESULTS: Nine random or quasi-random controlled trials in volving 1669 patients were reviewed. Quality was vari- able. The mean age of patients in all studies was over 70 ye ars. There was no statistically significant difference in inpatient mortality between NLU and usual inpatient care (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.56-2.16). The NLU was associated with reduced odds of discharge to institutional care (OR 0.44 95% CI 0.22-0.89), better functional status at dis- charge (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.54) and reduced odds of early readmission (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.34-0.80). Length of stay until discharge home was increased by 5.13 days (WMD) (95% CI-0.5-10.76 days). At longest follow up (3-6 months) there was no statistically signifi cant difference in the proportion of patients in institutional care (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.60-1.58). The results were not generally sensitive to study quality. CONCLUSIONS: The NLU successfully functions as a form of intermediate care, so far there is no evidence of ad- verse outcome from the lower level of routine medical care . However, more research is required to confirm safety. Patients discharged from NLUs have higher levels of function although it is uncl ear if the benefit is simply a product of an increased stay. There is no evidence of benefit over the longer term Griffiths P, Wilson-Barnett J. The effectiveness of 'nur sing beds': a review of the literature. J Adv Nurs 1998;27(6):Jun. ABSTRACT: A literature search was conducted to identify 'nursing led in-patient units' where the nurse is the designated leader of the clinical team. The review concentrates on studies which have attempted to measure the impact of nursing-led in-patient units and reviews both the methodology and outcomes. Three major bodies of work were identified. Lydia Hall's evaluation of the Loeb Center for Nursing and Rehabilitat ion (USA) is reviewed in some detail. This work was the model for 'nursing beds' at the two Oxfordshire Nursi ng Development Units (UK) in the 1980s. Studies evaluat- ing these centres are reviewed and reports of similar UK units discussed. A third body of work evaluates a nurse- managed critical care environment. Common features incl ude a case mix based on nursing need with nurses having authority to admit and discharge patients. While results are generally favourable, with improved patient independ- ence, fewer readmissions, lower mortality and cost savings r eported in some or all of the studies, all studies re- viewed demonstrate the difficulties of applying an experimental model to real life clinic al services. methodological limitations render firm conclusions di fficult. Techniques adopted from studies in field settings, the so-called 'quasi- experiment', are advocated as a remedy, as is further study of the process of care in investigating this model of care delivery Griffiths PD, Edwards MH, Forbes A, Harris RL, Ritchie G. Effectiveness of intermediate care in nursing-led in-patient BACKGROUND: The Nursing led inpatient Unit (NLU) is one of a range of services that have been considered in order to manage more successfully the transition between hospital and home for patients with extended recovery times. This is an update of an earlier review pub lished in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 2004 OBJECTIVES: To determine whether nursing-led inpatient units are effective in preparing patients for discharge from hospital compared to usual inpatient care SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Library, t he Specialized Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) EMBASE, BNI and HMIC searches on the sci ence and social science cita tion indices. Authors were contacted to identify additional data. The initial search was done in January 2001. The register search was updated in October 2006, the other database searches were updated in November 2006 and the citation search was run in January 2007 SELECTION CRITERIA: Controlled trials and interrupted time series designs that com pared the NLU to usual inpa- tient care managed by doctors. Patients over 18 years of age following an acute hospital admission for a physical health condition DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality MAIN RESULTS: Ten random or quasi-random controlled tr ials reported on a total of 1896 patients. There was no statistically significant effect on inpatient mortality (OR 1. 10, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.16) or mortality to longest follow up (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.29) but higher quality studies s howed a larger non-significant increase in inpatient mor- tality to 2.68). to instit utional care was reduced for the NLU (OR 0.44 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89) and functional status at discharge increased (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.54) but there was a near signifi- cant increase in inpatient stay (WMD 5.13 days 95% CI -0.5 days to 10.76 days). Early were reduced (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.34 to 0.80). One study compared a NLU for the chronically critically ill with ICU care. Mortality (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.35 to 1.10) and length of inpatient stay differ did not differ (WMD 2 days, 95% CI 10.96 to -6.96 days). Early readmissions were reduced (OR 0.33 95% CI 0. 12 to 0.94). Costs of care on the NLU were higher for UK studies but lower for US based studies AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that patients discharged from a NLU are better prepared for discharge but it is unclear if this is simply a product of an increased length of inpatient st ay. No statistically signifi- cant adverse effects were noted but the possibility of in creased early mortality cannot be discounted. More research is needed.

J Psychosom Res 2007;62(3):March. ABSTRACT: Objective: The aim of this study was to summa rize the available literature on the effectiveness of am- bulatory nurse-led case management for complex patients in general health care. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Cinahl. We included randomized controlled trials, controlled clin ical trials, controlled before/after stud y, and time series studies; identified references were screened by two reviewers. Two reviewers ra ted the quality of each article. Data extracted from the selected publications included design, c haracteristics of the participants, the intervention, type of outcome measures, and results. RESULTS: We identified 10 relevant publications. Nine st udies used readmission rate as primary outcome. Fewer studies investigated duration of hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits, functional status, quality of life, or patient satisfaction. In general, results with regard to the effectiveness of case management were conflict- ing. CONCLUSION: There is moderate evidence that case m anagement has a positive effect on patient satisfaction and no effect on ED visits. It was not possible to draw firm conclusions on the other outcomes. 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved Mistiaen P, Francke AL, Poot E. Interventions aimed at reducing problems in adult patients discharged from hospital to home: a systematic meta-review. BMC Health Services Research 2007;7(pp 47):2007. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many patients encounter a variety of pr oblems after discharge from hospital and many discharge (planning and support) interventions have been developed and studied. These primary studies have already been synthesized in several literature reviews with conflicting c onclusions. We therefore set out a systematic review of the reviews examining discharge intervent ions. The objective was to synthesiz e the evidence presented in literature on the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce post-discharge problems in ad ults discharged home from an 92 Resultat acute general care hospital. METHODS: A comprehensive search of seventeen literatur e databases and twenty-five websites was performed for the period 1994-2004 to find relevant reviews. A three-stage inclusion process consisting of initial sifting, checking full-text papers on inclusion criteria, and methodologica l assessment, was performed independently by two review- ers. Data on effects were synthesized by use of narrative and tabular methods. RESULTS: Fifteen systematic reviews met our inclusion cr iteria. All reviews had to deal with considerable hetero- geneity in interventions, populations and outcomes, making synthesizing and poo ling difficult.Although a statistical significant effect was occasionally found, most review aut hors reached no firm conclusi ons that the discharge inter- ventions they studied were effective. We found limited ev idence that some interventions may improve knowledge of patients, may help in keeping patients at home or may reduc e readmissions to hospital. Interventions that combine discharge planning and discharge s upport tend to lead to the greatest effects. There is little evidence that discharge interventions have an impact on length of stay, disc harge destination or dependency at discharge. We found no evidence that discharge interventions hav e a positive impact on the physical st atus of patients after discharge, on health care use after discharge, or on costs. CONCLUSION: Based on fifteen high quality systematic review s, there is some evidence that some interventions may have a positive impact, particularly those with educ ational components and those that combine pre-discharge and post-discharge interventions. However, on the whole there is only limit ed summarized evidence that discharge planning and discharge support inte rventions have a positive impact on patient status at hospital discharge, on pa- tient functioning after discharge, on health care use after discharge, or on costs Quinn K, Mourad M, Rennke S. Increasing readmission s awareness: What will you do differently? Journal of Hospital Medicine Conference: 2012 Annual Meeting of the Society of Hospital Medicine, SHM 2012 San Diego, CA United States Conference Start: BACKGROUND: Patients with a prior hospitalization in the la st 6 months are at increased risk of readmission. How- ever, given our current system of care, providers may be unaware that a patient was previously admitted to the hospital. Increasing awareness of readm issions can allow providers to focus on known strategies for reducing pre- ventable readmissions. PURPOSE: (1) To understand attending, resident and nurse awar eness of readmissions (2) To test simple strate- gies to increase awareness of readmitted patients, and (3) To determine the effects of increasing awareness on safe discharge processes and outcomes. DESCRIPTION: Baseline audits on readmission awareness were performed on the Medicine Service at a 600-bed academic teaching hospital par ticipating in Project BOOST. All resident s received an introductory lecture on the importance of discharge safety in r educing readmissions. Over a two 2-mont h period, 23 attendings, 20 residents, and 47 nurses were asked to identify patients under their care who had an admission to our hospital in the last 30 days. Attendings correctly identified 21/40 (53%) readmi and nurses 10/ 22 (47%) of readmitted patients. To increase awareness of readmitted patients and to encourage discussion of risk factors at daily multidisciplinary rounds (MDR), we began by identifying patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days through an administrative database. A large orange \"R\" sticker was placed on their paper chart on hospital day 1. During MDR, nurses were responsible for alerting att endees of readmitted patients. Starting in December 2011, serial audits of residents, attendings and nurses will ident ify any changes in awareness, and audits of PCP commu- nication, timely follow up, change in discharge disposit ion and readmission rates will look for process and outcome changes. In March 2012, a second intervention will be implem ented. The previous discharging team and the current admitting team will receive an email notifying them of a pat ient's readmission status. This email will encourage them to discuss the reasons for readmission and strategies to prev ent future readmission with the previous team and care coordination staff, as well as reminding them of the re corded process measures. Att endingsAttending on service will receive an educational module that they can complete with their team around one of thei r team's readmissions. This educational module will review the literature and best practices around preventing r eadmissions. Subsequent audits of readmission awareness, process and outcome measures will be performed through June 2012. CONCLUSIONS: When asked to identify readmissions, care providers were unaware of half of their readmitted patients. Our intervention will determine which strategies ar e effective in increasing prov ider awareness of readmis- sions, and if that awareness translates in to improved discharge processes and outcomes 93 Resultat Andre diagnoser (15) Barn (7) Cooper C, Wheeler DM, Woolfenden SR, Boss T, Piper S.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate specialist hom e-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches were made of CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tri- als) 2005 (Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to August 2005); EM BASE (1980 to August 2005); PsycINFO (1887 to 2005); CINAHL (1982 to abstrac ts (1963 to August 2005). Opti mally sensitive search strategies for randomised controlled tr ials (RCTs) were combined with medical subject headings and text words specific for ambulatory paediatrics, nursing outreach and 'hospital in the home', and no language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITIERIA: RCTs of children aged 0-18 with ac ute or chronic illnesses allocated to specialist home- based nursing services compared with c onventional medical care. Outcomes included utilisation of health care, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analysis was not a ppropriate because of the clinical diversity and lack of common outcomes measures MAIN RESULTS: 1655 titles yielded 5 RCTs with a total of 771 participants. Participants, interventions and out- comes were diverse. No significant differences were reported in health outcomes; two studies reported improve- ments in child and parental anxiety; one study reported no significant difference in re admissions; two studies report- ed significantly fewer bed days; increased satisfaction was r eported ; home care was more costly for service provid- ers, but less expensive for parents. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While current research does not provide definitive suppor t for specialist home-based nursing services in reducing access to hos pital services or length of stay, preliminary results show no adverse im- pact on physical health outcomes and a number of papers re ported improved satisfaction with home-based care. Further trials are required, measuri ng health, satisfaction, service utilisati on and long-term costs. Copyright 2006 The Cochrane Collaboration.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early postpartum discharge (less than 48 hours a fter vaginal birth or 96 hours after cesarean delivery) on maternal and neonatal comp lications, maternal concerns , patient satisfaction, and cost saving DATA SOURCES: We performed a MEDLINE search of English-language journals for pertinent articles published from 1966 through January 1997. We also reviewed reference lists in all the articles retrieved in the search as well as those of major obstetric texts METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included all studies describing early postpartum discharge TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Studies in cluded five randomized controlled trials, ten cohort stud- ies, one case-control study, and 12 case-series reports. We classified the data using the rating system of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. We calculated relative risks and 95% confi dence intervals for maternal and neona- tal readmission and outpatient treatment after early postpartu m discharge. Most studies did not show an increase in maternal or neonatal morbidity after early discharge. The fi ve randomized controlled studies did not meet criteria for properly designed trials. Most evidenc e consists of cohort studies and case -series (class II-2 and III evidence) of highly selected patients with extensive supplement al antepartum and postpartum care and education CONCLUSION: The current data do not support or condemn widespread use of early postpartum discharge in the general population (class C recommendation). Early postpartu m discharge appears safe for carefully selected, con- senting patients. Whether these data can be extrapolated to the general population of pregnant women remains un- 94 Resultat known Jonguitud-Aguilar A, Tomasso G, Cafferatta ML.

These include selection bias, limited power and exclusions of patients after randomiz ation. We initially planned to perform a formal meta- analysis of this randomized controlled trials, but the methodological limitati ons prevent aggregation and quantifica- tion in a meta-analysis CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence in randomized controlled trials is insufficient to judge the safety of early post-partum discharge.

Incidence of severe adverse neonatal outcomes: use of a composite indicator in a population cohort. Maternal & Child Health Journal 2012;16(3):600-8 . ABSTRACT: The aim was to develop a composite outcome indicator to i dentify infants with severe adverse outcomes in routinely collected population health datasets, and assess the indicato r's association with readmission and infant mortality rates. A comprehensive list of diagnoses and procedures indicative of serious neonatal morbidity was compiled based on literature review, validation studi es and expert consultation. Relevant diagnoses and procedures indicative of severe morbidity that are reliably reported were analysed and reviewed, and the neonatal adverse outcome indi- cator (NAOI) was refined. Data were obtained from linked birth and hospital data for 516,843 liveborn infants >=24weeks gestation, in New South Wales, Australia from 2001 to 2006. Face validity of the indicator was exam-ined by calculating the relative risks ( and 95% CI) of hospital readmission or death in the first year of life of those infants identified by the NAOI. Overall 4.6% of all inf ants had one or more conditions included in the NAOI; 35.4% of preterm infants and 2.4% of term infants. Infants identifi ed by the composite indicator were 10times more likely to die in the first year of life and twice as likely to be readmitted to hospital in the first year of life compared to infants not identified by the NAOI. The NAOI can reliably identif y infants with a severe adverse neonatal outcome and can be used to monitor trends, assess obstetric and neonatal interv entions and the quality of perinatal care in a uniform and cost-effective way Margolis LH. A critical review of studies of newborn discharge timing. Clin Pediatr (Phila) 1995;34(12):626-34 ABSTRACT: The duration of hospitalization for newborns has declined dr amatically, driven by efforts to control health-care costs as well as by efforts to demedicalize childbirth. In order to determine the clinical basis fo r this practice, the quality of the published literature on discharge timing was analyzed. Th irteen experimental or quasi-experimental studies were retrieved through a computer search. Seven characte ristics that influenced the quality of these studies were reviewed: research design; measures sam- ple size; and the definition of early discharge, including t he use of any related interventions. Although all 13 studies suggest that there are no differences between infants discharged early and their compeers, these studies have three limitations. First, with one exc eption, these reports are from hospitals where well-defined assessment and follow-up protocols have been established, potentially limiti ng their wide applicability. Second, these studies lack statistical power to assess the likelihood of rare events such as readmission. Third, few studies report outcomes other than readmission and medical conditi ons diagnosed within 1 to 6 weeks. Early discharge as the standard of care for well newborns has not been well established by empirical studies. Pediatri cians and local public health officials have a responsibility to assure that the health obj ectives of hospitalization are met whether this occurs in the hospital or through other mechanisms, such as routine home visiting Mussman GM, Conway PH. Pediatric hospitalist systems versus traditional models of care: Effect on quality 95 Resultat and cost outcomes. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2012;7(4):April. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Pediatric hospitalist systems are increasing in popularity, but data regarding the effects of hospital- ist systems on the quality of care has been sparse, in par t because rigorous metrics fo r analysis have not yet been established. We conducted a literature review of studies comparing the performance of pediatric hospitalists and traditional attendings. Objective: To determine the effect of pediatric hospitalists on quality and outcome metrics such as length of stay, cost, patient satisfaction, mort ality, readmission rates, and us e of evidence-based medicine during care. RESULTS: A Medline literature search identified 11 studies t hat met criteria for inclusion. Five previously reviewed studies reported lengths of stay between 6% and 14% shor ter for hospitalists. Five of the new studies evaluated lengths of stay, with 1 showing significantly lower length of stay and cost for a faculty model, 1 showing lower length of stay for hospitalists for all conditi ons, 1 for certain conditions only, and 2 showing no statistical difference. Six studies reported on readmission rate, with 4 showing no di fference, 1 showing decreas ed readmissions for hospital- ists, and 1 showing decreased re admissions for a traditional fa culty service. Hospitalists self-report higher use of evidence-based guidelines. Few di fferences in patient satisfaction were r eported. Mortality on the pediatrics wards is rare, and no studies were adequately powered to evaluate mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Hospitalists can improve the quality and effici ency of inpatient care in the pediatric population, but the effect is not universal, and mechanisms underlying demonstrated improvements are poorly understood. We propose 4 components to improve quality and value in hospital medicine systems: investment in comparative effec- tiveness research involving delivery system interven tions, development and implementation of pediatric quality measures, better understanding of improvement mechanism s for hospital medicine systems, and increased focus on quality and value delivered by hospital medicine groups and individuals. 2011 Society of Hospital Medicine Parab CS, Cooper C, Woolfenden S, Piper SM. Specialist home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013;(6) ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Specialist paediatric home-based nursing se rvices have been proposed as a cost-effective means of reducing distress resulting from hospital admissions, while enhancing primary care and reducing length of hospi- tal stay. This review is an update of our original re view, which was published in 2006. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate specialist home-based nursing services for ch ildren with acute and chronic illnesses. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases in February 2012: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2012 Issue 2, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Sociological abstracts. We also sear ched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Inte rnational Clinical Trials Registry Platform. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children from birth to age 18 years with acute or chronic illnesses allocated to specia list home-based nursing services compared with conventional health care. Out- comes included utilisation of health care, physical and m ental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review author s extracted data from the studies independently and re- solved any discrepancies by recourse to a third author. Me ta-analysis was not appropriate because of the clinical diversity of the studies and the lack of common outcome measures. MAIN RESULTS: We screened 4226 titles to yield seven RCTs with a total of 840 participants. Participants, inter- ventions and outcomes were diverse. No significant differences were report ed in health outcomes; two studies re- ported a reduction in the hospital stay with no difference in the hospital readmission rates. Three studies reported a reduction in parental anxiety and improvement in child behav iours was reported in thr ee studies. Overall increased parental satisfaction was reported in three studies. Also , better parental coping and family functioning was reported in one study. By contrast, one study each reported no impact on parental burden of care or on functional status of children. Home care was reported as more costly for service providers with substantial cost savings for the family in two studies, while one study revealed no significant cost benefits for the family. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current research does not provide supporting evidence fo r a reduction in access to hospital services or a reduction in hos pital readmission rate for children with acute and chronic illnesses using spe- cialist home-based nursing servic es; however, the only summary finding acro ss a few studies was that there is a significant decrease in length of hospitalisation. The pr eliminary results show no adverse impact on physical health outcomes and a number of papers reported improved satisfaction with home-based care. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, servic e utilisation and long-term costs [CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.] Vendittelli F, Boulvain M. assess a policy of early di scharge from hospital a fter a vaginal birth DATA SOURCES: Reports of studies on this topic were identified in Medline and Cochrane Collaboration database (from 1985 to the beginning of 1995, in english or latin pub lications). This search wa s supplemented by referenced studies in book chapters and in other published bibliographies . Key words were: early discharge or ambulatory care and mother or infant or post-partum or obstetrics STUDY SELECTION: One hundred and ten articles have been retrieved. We have included in the meta-analyse the randomized clinical trials comparing a group of women disc harged early (less than 48-72 hours after delivery) with a control group leaving hospital after an usual stay (mor e than 48-72 hours). Quality of the studies was analysed through the Chalmers et al. recommendations DATA EXTRACTION: Data were retrieved independently by two authors, and results were compared. Selected out- comes were: hyperbilirubinemia, infant feeding problems and skin rashes; breast feeding; maternal satisfaction on the hospital stay; readmission and non-routine clinics for both the mother and her child DATA SYNTHESIS: Data from five included studies were pool ed by the Peto method. There are no significant modi- fications of the risks of re-admission to hospital. The fr equency of non-routine clinics and the risk of skin rash are not different in the two groups. The risk of hyperbilirubi nemia and infant food problems are not different. The fre- quency of breastfeeding one month after delivery was higher in the early discharge group (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.09- 3.23), but this difference decreased over time. Women satisfaction on hospital stay was lower in case of early dis- charge (OR = 0.56; 95% IC: 0.44-0.72) CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests an advantage of early discharge policy on breastfeeding at one month after the delivery, but mothers seem to prefer longer hospita l stays. These results must be cautiously interpreted as included studies are of small sample size or rather old. This policy remains to be evaluated more thoroughly before recommendations could be made Hoftebrudd (2) Halbert J, Crotty M, Whitehead C, Cameron I, Kurrle S, Graham S, et al. Multi-disciplinary rehabilitation after hip fracture is associated with improved outcome: a systematic review. Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine (Stiftelsen Rehabiliteringsinformation) 2007;39(7):507-12. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: While hip fractures are an important caus e of disability, dependency and death in older adults, the benefit of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation for people who have sustained hip fracture has not been demonstrated. METHODS: Systematic review of randomized controlled tr ials which compare co-ordinated multi-disciplinary reha- bilitation with usual orthopaedic care in older people w ho had sustained a hip fracture. Outcome measures included: mortality, return home, \"poor outcome\", total length of hospital stay, readmissions and level of function. RESULTS: We identified 11 trials including 2177 patients. Patients who received multi-disciplinary rehabilitation were at a lower risk (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) of a \"poor outcome\" - that is dying or admission to a nurs- ing home at discharge from the programme, and showed a tr end towards higher levels of return home (Risk Ratio 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.15). Pooled data for mortality di d not demonstrate any difference between multi-disciplinary rehabilitation and usual orthopaedic care. CONCLUSION: This is the first review of randomized trials to demonstrate a benefit from multi-disciplinary rehabili- tation; a 16% reduction in the pooled outcome combining death or admission to a nursing home. This result sup- ports the routine provision of organiz ed care for patients following hip fracture , as is current practice for patients after stroke Handoll HH, Cameron ID, Mak JC, Finnegan TP. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for older people with hip fractures. Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) (4) (pp CD007125), 2009 Date of Publication: 2009 2009;(Online):2009. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hip fracture is a major cause of morbidit y and mortality in older people and its impact on society is substantial. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of multidisciplinary re habilitation, in either inpatient or ambulatory care set- tings, for older patients with hip fracture. 97 Resultat SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Jo int and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2009), The Cochrane Library (2009, Iss ue 2), MEDLINE and EMBASE (both to April 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of post-surgical care using multidisciplinary re- habilitation of older patients (aged 65 years or over) with hip fracture. The primary outcome, 'poor outcome' was a composite of mortality and decline in residential stat us at long-term (generally one year) follow-up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial selection was by consensus. Two review authors independently as- sessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were pooled where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: The 13 included trials involved 2498 older , usually female, patients who had undergone hip frac- ture surgery. Though generally well conducted, some trials were at risk of bias such as from imbalances in key baseline characteristics.There was subs tantial clinical heterogeneity in the tr ial interventions and populations. Multi- disciplinary rehabilitation was provided pr imarily in an inpatient setting in 11 tria ls. Pooled results showed no statisti- cally significant difference between intervention and c ontrol groups for poor outcome (risk ratio 0.89; 95% confi- dence interval 0.78 to 0.90, 95% c onfidence interval 0.76 to 1.07) or hospital readmission. Individual trials found better results, often short-term only, in the intervention group for activities of daily living and mobility. There was considerable heterogen eity in length of stay and cost data. Three trials reporting carer burden showed no evidence of detrimental effect from the intervent ion. Overall, the evidence indi cates that multidisciplinary rehabilitation is not harmful.The trial home-based multidisci plinary rehabilitation with usual inpa- tient care found marginally improved function and a clinically significantly lower burden for carers in the intervention group. Participants of this group had shorter hospital stay s, but longer periods of rehabilitation. One trial found no significant effect from doubling the number of weekly contac ts at the multidisciplinary rehabili- tation team. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While there was a tendency to a be tter overall result in pati ents receiving multidiscipli- nary inpatient rehabilitation, these results statistica lly significant.Future trials of multidisciplinary rehabilita- tion should aim to establish both effectiveness and cost effect iveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation overall, ra- ther than evaluate its Kreft (2) Dalby C, Campos SM, Doverspike L, Spinks M, Jacobson JO.

Journal of Clinical Oncology Conference: ASCO's Quality Care Symposium 2012 San Diego, CA United States Conference Start: 20121130 a follow-up appointm ent scheduled prior to discharge is one of several key interventions shown to reduce hospita l readmission rates (Hansen L.O., Young R.S., Hinami K., al. to reduce 30-day rehospitalization: a syst ematic review. Annals of Internal Medicine, 155[8], 520- 528). Lack of follow-up diminishes conti nuity between the inpatient and outpatient setting, can lead to patient dissat- isfaction, as well as delays in proposed therapy. METHODS: A three-month review of discharge data high lighted 49% of Women's Cancer Gynecologic patients at an academic medical center were discharged from the hos pital without securing a follow-up appointment. A multi- disciplinary team involved in the scheduling process was assembled and determined failure to schedule appoint- ments was attributed to a lack of communication betw een the inpatient and outpatient services, a complicated scheduling process, as well as ambiguity regarding when patient's should retu rn. Several rapid PDSA cycles were implemented over a three month period of time. The inte rvention created a standardized electronic template, includ- ing the establishment of standard time frames for follo w-up appointments post discharge (7 to 10 days). The tem- plate details all required scheduling elements such as se rvices requested, required l aboratory studies, and patient preferences. Within the electronic temp late is the ability to directly email essential staff through a centralized email address embedded within the form. Staff engaged through reviewing of data, identification of the importance of securing a follow-up appointment, and weekly huddles. RESULTS: Post intervention, the rate of compliance of scheduled discharge follow-up appointments rose from 49% to 87%. Staff reported high satisfaction with the new pr ocess, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Securing a follow-up appointment prior to discharge is feasible as evidence by increased compli- ance from baseline 49% to 87%. Future endeavors will impl ement this process across other disease programs in hopes of obtaining similar results Marla S, Stallard S. Systematic review of day surg ery for breast cancer. International Journal Of Surgery 2009;7(4):2009 . ABSTRACT: 98 Resultat BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, breast cancer sur gery has become less invasive and potentially suitable for day surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to establish the benefits and disadvantages of day surgery for breast cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of the Cochrane Libr ary, Medline, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO was carried out. All relevant papers were asse ssed for their methodological quality using a checklist designed to assess both randomised and non-randomised studi es with specific questi ons added to address out- come measures. RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials were found in literature. Eleven observational studies were included. The rate of discharge after day surgery was universally hi gh with very low acute readmission rates. Intractable vom- iting, patient anxiety and pain control were the main reas ons for failing discharge. Patient satisfaction with day sur- gery was high and psychological recovery was quicker, howeve r, majority of the studies did not use validated ques- tionnaires. The hospital costs were lower for day surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Day surgery for breast cancer is safe, with equivalent complication rates, but there is lack of evi- dence from randomised controlled trials. Patient satisfaction and psychological well- being is high. Further trials with validated questionnaires are required to conf irm this. 2009 Surgical Associates Ltd Lungebetennelse (3) Campbell SG, Patrick W, Urquhart DG, Maxwell DM, Ackroyd-Stolarz SA, Murray DD, et al.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety of discharging pat ients with community acqui red pneumonia (CAP) according to a clinical practice guideline METHODS: A systematic retrospective review of medi cal records of 867 adult patients discharged from an emer- gency department (ED) with CAP between 3 January 1999 and 3 January 2001. Readmission or death rates within 30 days of discharge were evaluated, using data from all local hospitals and from the provincial coroner RESULTS: Of 685 patients with pneumonia severity index (PSI) scores of <91, 13 (1.9%) were readmitted and five (0.76%) died within 30 days of the ED visit. Thirty day readmission and death rates for patients with PSI >90 were 7.14% (13 of 182) and 9.34% (17 of 182), respectively CONCLUSION: Adult patients with CAP discharged from the ED according to the recommendations of a clinical practice guideline based on the PSI have low readmissi on and death rates, and are generally safely managed as outpatients Chalmers JD, Akram AR, Hill AT.

Eur Respir J 2011;37(4):858-64 ABSTRACT: In order to identify, synthesise and interpret the evidence re lating to strategies to increase the proportion of low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated in the community, we conducted a systematic review of inter- vention studies conducted between 1981-2010. Articles were included if they compared strategies to increase out- patient care with usual care. Outcomes were: the proporti on of patients treated as outpatients, mortality, hospital readmissions, health related quality of life, return to usual activities and patient satisfaction with care. The main analysis included six studies. The intervent ions in these studies were generally complex, but all involved the use of a severity score to identify low-risk patients. Overall, a si gnificantly larger numbers of patients were treated in the community with these interventions (OR 2.31, 95% CI 2. 03-2.63). The interventions appear safe, with no significant differences in mortality (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59-1.17), hos pital readmissions (OR 1.08, 95% 0.82-1.42) or patient satisfaction with care (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.97-1.49) bet ween the intervention and control groups. There was insuffi- cient data regarding quality of life or return to usual activi ties. All studies had significant limitations. The available evidence suggests that interventions to increase the proportion of patients treated in the community are safe, effec- tive and acceptable to patients Domingo GR, Reyes FC, Thompson FV, Johnson PM, Shortridge-Baggett LM.

Journal of Health Care for the Poor & Underserved 2013;24(2):499-524 ABSTRACT: Medical respite programs provide care to homeless patients who are too sick to be on the streets or in a traditional shelter, but not sick enough to warrant inpatient hospitaliz ation. They are designed to improve the health of home- less patients while also decreasing costly hospital use. Al though there is increasing interest in implementing respite programs, there has been no prior systematic review of t heir effectiveness. We conducted a comprehensive search for studies of medical respite program outcomes in mu ltiple biomedical and sociological databases, and the grey literature. Thirteen articles met inclus ion criteria. The articles were heter ogeneous in methods, study quality, inclu- sion of a comparison group, and outcomes examined. Av ailable evidence showed that medical respite programs reduced future hospital admissions, i npatient days, and hospital readmissions. They also resulted in improved hous- ing outcomes. Results for emergency department use and cost s were mixed but promising.
