Your unconscious mind knows best what you need and is connected to both the collective unconscious of all beings as well as the knowledge of the Universe (some may call this God, Spirit or by another name). You are able to access all of this knowledge and healing power as you connect & trust. The Healing Ritual Deck draws on this connection and wisdom. It is not magic. It is based on mind-body science and ancient spiritual healing practices. You have access to significantly more knowledge and guidance then you are consciously aware of. Our conscious mind only stores a very very small amount of information in comparison to the deep, wide breadth of knowledge, information and wisdom our unconscious mind stores. Our unconscious mind, as world renowned psychologist Carl Jung taught, is connected to the collective unconscious which houses the collective knowing of all. Our unconscious mind is what is connected not only to this collective knowledge but also to the Universe (some may call this God, Spirit or by another name). You can connect with the intuitive intelligence within your unconscious as well as the collective unconscious and the Universe's knowledge and healing power to create a healing ritual for yourself, or on behalf of a loved one. This information will be spoken in the language of the unconscious mind, in imagery and metaphor. If a you are experiencing something specific that you need healing, transformation or breakthrough with, such as grief from the loss of a loved one, heartbreak from a failed relationship, an injury, disease or illness in the body for example, you can ask your unconscious mind to access the collective wisdom and create a healing ritual that will guide you to move towards healing. The Healing Ritual deck is a tool to use to create a healing ritual using that collective wisdom and healing power. Use your healing ritual deck to move towards healing any issue or ailment in mind, body, heart & spirit for yourself or on behalf of another. Contents: Your Healing Ritual Deck comes with 108 cards and a 57 page book to help guide you through creating your healing rituals. "}
