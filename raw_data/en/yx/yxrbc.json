That means 120 varieties of Zulu plants and an on-the-spot traditional healer who might even help you find love Jane Dunford As a dedicated fan of the fine art of pampering, I've had a few unusual spa experiences in my time. But none, I think as I sit in a stone hut with traditional Zulu healer Dr Elliot Ndlovu, has been quite like this. I've blown into a bag of bones and shells, thrown the contents on to the eland skin on the floor, and now Dr Ndlovu is looking into my future and sussing out potential health problems. He suggests I burn helichrysum, a herb for relaxing and easing stress, and he's detected a problem with my foot that massage could help. The consultation is an option at the Fordoun Hotel, Spa and Restaurant, a boutique property in KwaZulu Natal, two hours north-west of Durban. While the treatment rooms and therapists are as you might expect from a state-of-the-art spa, the philosophy behind it all is unique - the Ndlovu product range is based on traditional Zulu healing plants, and over 120 varieties are grown in the herb garden. Fordoun's owner Jon Bates explains: \"We want the spa to be linked to the healing powers of Africa. The soul of the place is the important thing and it's what sets us apart.\" Guests can go to Dr Ndlovu with a specific problem and he'll prescribe a cure - perhaps a Transvaal saffron infusion for a stomach complaint or black stinkwood tea for emotional upset - or just have a general wellbeing consultation before deciding on spa treatments. I try an umcako lungisa. First I smother myself in clay, then relax in a mosaic-lined room which fills with eucalyptus steam until a gentle shower rains down to rinse it off. Perhaps not that unusual in itself, but the clay, so Elliot tells me, is harvested from the nearby White Mountain in the traditional Zulu way - by virgins and post-menopausal women on a full moon - and then boiled for three days to remove impurities. The Inkomfe Herbal Wrap uses a butter made from African potato to strengthen and soften the skin. Known for its immune system-boosting substances and anti-cancer properties, the Bates have been trying to incorporate the inkomfe into the restaurant's menu too - now used dried and in a pepper grinder. But besides the pampering possibilities, the hotel itself induces a sense of calm. Surrounded by rolling grassland, Fordoun was originally an 1860s settler homestead and, until it opened as a hotel last year, a fully functioning dairy farm. Set in picturesque gardens, with croquet lawn and peacocks strutting, there's a real sense of history. The whole place has been painstakingly designed to incorporate original features, the stone buildings are single-storey and the 17 suites luxurious but homely. The spa building was once the old dairy, with cows milked over buckets in what's now the swimming pool. Lying in the flotation tank, looking at the domed ceiling, I try to imagine that this used to be the silo full of grain, with pens of Jersey stud bulls and calves in the gym and sauna next door. Part of the farm manager's house became Skye Restaurant, full of light by day, and warm and welcoming at night, with pre-dinner drinks served in the adjacent lounge. Langoustine in saffron sauce and lamb shank are highlights on an enticing menu which uses only the freshest ingredients. Before breakfast the next morning I meet personal trainer Joe Klapprott for a \"nature\" walk. We pass ponds and wander across fields with the Drakensberg mountains in the background. Walking and mountain-bike trails are planned, allowing guests to get out and about with minimal impact on the countryside. Back in the spa I'm wired up to the Bodystat machine, which calculates my body fat percentage and a dazzling array of other details which Joe uses to devise personal exercise and diet programmes. Combining the best of modern spa facilities with Zulu healing ideas, Fordoun gets the balance right, allowing guests to delve into the traditions of Africa, or stick to what they know. Before I leave, Dr Ndlovu gives me a twig, a piece of the ilomomnandi tree. If I want someone to be crazy about me I should chew it before I kiss them. \"It's good for togetherness, it boosts relationships,\" he tells me. Now that's something I've never taken away from a spa before. \u00b7 Fordoun offers a range of spa and fitness treatments, including consultation with Elliot Ndlovu R200; Rasul clay and steam treatment R150.
