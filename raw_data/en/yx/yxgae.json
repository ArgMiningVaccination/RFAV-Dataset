Leading authorities should base decisions or policies on this knowledge; hence they need to master the actual state of this knowledge. Due to the large number of publications shared daily, decision makers heavily depend on accurate summaries of these publications, in the different public health domains. Therefore, the authors of this report were mandat ed by the Swiss School of Public Health plus (SSPH+), upon request of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), to i nform the FOPH on recent findings from the literature. Background According to the current global data on vaccinations, 53.8% of the world populations , of which only 5.5% of people in low -income countries , have received at least one dose of a marketed C OVID -19 vaccine as of 26 November 20211. Currently , [namely, Comi , and COVAXIN /BBV15 2 (Bharat Biotech, India) ] were assessed and granted an authorization by WHO as of 26 November 2021. Articles regarding the latest data on vaccine effectiveness , vaccine induced immune response , breakthrough infections and transmission , and booster doses were prioritized during the literature search and are the latest additions to the table . Data from clinical trials and observational studies for the s even EUL-accepted vaccines and the vaccine candidate Novavax regarding th ese highlighted topics were summarized and can be found in the synoptic table below . 1 https://ourworldindata.org/covid -vaccinations (accessed on 26.11.2021). Literature screening report: COVID -19 vaccines in the WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Report (9) - 30.11.21 - Sabina Rodriguez Vel\u00e1squez Guizzo Dri , Camille Beatrice Gaza Valera Methodology We screened the data for the EUL -accepted vaccines and the vaccine candidate Novavax as of 26 November 2021 from PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Cochrane, and clinical trials databases such as ClinicalTrials and WHO Trial Registry. The methods used were reported previously and can be found in prior reports2. Results As phase III COVID -19 vaccine trials confirmed vaccine efficacy and safety for all seven WHO EUL authorized vaccines , and as the share of fully vaccinated people begin to increase across countries , it is important to assess vaccine effectiveness in real-world conditions , especially in relation to evolving variants of concern (VOC) . Latest Data on Vaccine Effectiveness No significant updates regarding vaccine effectiveness were identified since the previous synoptic table this month. In a recent study , final analyses of the blinded phase of Moderna's mRNA1273 vaccine efficacy and safety further support existing evidence of its effectiveness against COVID -19 inf ection and severe disease. From the clinical trial's 30,315 subjects, there were 55 confirmed COVID -19 cases among individuals who received mRNA -1273 compared with 744 COVID -19 cases among individuals in the placebo group; resulting in vaccine efficacy pre venting COVID -19 infection at 93.2% (95% CI, 91.0 to 94.8) .3 In terms of prevention against severe disease, vaccine efficacy was 98.2% (95% CI, 92.8 to 99.6) while vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic infection 14 -days after dose completion was 63.0% (95% CI, 2 COVID -19 vaccines: efficacy and safety (Literature Review 1).

Alternatively, a national cohort study conducted in Norway from January to September 2021 investigated vaccine effectiveness by age and prod uct-specific vaccine (homologous and heterologous regimens) effectiveness against various COVID -19 disease outcomes. Overall, full vaccine dosages were found to provide better protection when compared with partial doses. Resulting effectiveness against any COVID -19 infection for those fully vaccinated was at 72.1% 71.2 -73.0) , (95% CI 82.5 -91.8) against death.5 Furthermore, when comparing specific vaccine regimens among fully vaccinated, heterologous mRNA vaccines demonstrated the highest protection with effectiveness against infection at 84.7% (95% CI 83.1 -19.6 the newly WHO EUL approved vaccine BBV152/Covaxin , data in a recent preprint from The Lancet show that during dominance of the Delta variant, Covaxin demonstrated , statistically, relatively good effectiveness against severe COVID -19 in India. In this multi -centric, hospital -based case -control study condu cted on Covaxin and Covishield effectiveness, results of the investigation illustrated that full dose Covaxin effectiveness was at 69% (95% CI, 54.0 -79.0) for the Delta variant plus its sub -lineages, while Covishield had an effectiveness of 80% (95% CI, 73 .0-86.0) .7 4 Efficacy of the mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV-2 Vaccine at Completion of Blinding Phase .

The study followed participants from peak immunity (2 -4 weeks post full immunization) until to 8 months post - vaccination8. Similar to vaccine effectiveness data outcomes, Moderna's mRNA -1273 vaccine demonst Ad26.COV2 significantly lower median t itres compared to mRNA -1273 titres declined by factor of 44 6 (pseudovirus NAb titre), and 17 (RBD titre) , while BNT162b2 titres decreased by a factor of 34, 4, and 29 , respectively9. All three vaccines demonst rated \"broad cross -reactivity against SARS -CoV-2 variants\" and CD8+ T cell responses of 0.017%, 0.016%, and 0.12% 8 months after full immunization for the mRNA -1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2 vaccines, respectively10. A Colombian surveillance study evaluated the sensitivity of Pfizer -BioNTech's BNT162b2 vaccine to neutralize three SARS -CoV-2 strains in Colombia : Mu (B.1.621; Variant of Interest), Gamma ( P1; Variant of Concern) and the B.1.111 lineage (\"lacks genetic markers associated with greater virulence\" )11. While the BNT162b2 vaccine demonstrated robust neutraliz ation against both the B.1.111 lineage and P .1 strain, albeit the Gamma variant titre ( GMT 65.2 TCID 50) was 3.4-fold lower of the B.1 .111 lineag e (GMT 224.2 78.5% ) of serum kinetics of immune responses elicited by COVID -19 vaccines.

The mean geometric mean titre against B.1.621 was 41- and P.1 lineages12. Breakthrough Infections and SARS -CoV-2 Transmission While all WHO EUL authorised vaccines have demonstrated to be effective against severe SARS -CoV-2 infections and hospitalization, the combined effects of low vaccination rates13, waning vaccine immunity, and the emergence of the Delta variant has led to increased cases of SARS -CoV-2 breakthrough infections, raising concerns among the general population. Breakthrough infections typically have higher viral loads, prolonge d PCR positivity, and demonstrate lower levels of vaccine induced NAbs14,15. For example, s ymptomatic hospital staff in Ho Chi Minh City (all vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV -19) demonstrated higher viral loads (median IQR: 16.5) relative to asymptomatic cases (median viral load IQR: 30.8)16. Additionally, breakthrough infections were characterised by havi ng low er levels of neutralizing antibodies after vaccination (median % of NAb inhibition: 69.4) and when positive for SARS - CoV-2 (median % of NAb inhibition: 59.4) relative to control participants (median % of NAb inhibition after vaccination: 91.3; median % of NAb inhibition at 7 -8 weeks uninfected control: 91.1). The authors highlighted that \"the absence of correlation between neutralizing antibody levels and peak viral loads suggested that vaccine might not lower the transmission potential of breakthroug h infection cases\"17. The authors' claim is corroborated by a recently published serological study that confirmed SARS -CoV-2 transmission is correlated to high viral loads, which is uncorrelated to vaccination status and/or the presence of COVID -19 symptoms18. 12 Low neutralizing antibody titers against the Mu variant of SARS -CoV-2 in BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals. medRxiv. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.19.21266552v1.full 13 Community -level evidence for SARS -CoV-2 vaccine protection of unvaccinated individuals.

Studies are recommend ing continuing the implementation of social distancing and non -pharmaceutical measures in order to mitigate pandemic effects. Booster Dose As evidence on the efficacy, safety, effectiveness , and immunogenicity of third (booster) doses becomes av ailable, many countries are continuing to expand their recommendations for booster shots and are slowly beginning to administer third doses to all adults, and sometimes adolescents, who have rec eived their full COVID -19 vaccine jabs at least six months ago . Recently, on 23 November 2021, Switzerland joined other countries in approving the booster to its general population by approving the extension of the Pfizer -BioNTech booster dose to everyone aged 16 years and older24. This decision was supported by the published data , made available by Pfizer -BioNTech, on the efficacy and safety of the BNT162b2 booster doses on 10,000 participants 16 years of age and older who completed a two -dose series of the BNT162b2 vaccine25. Based on those results , the vaccine effi cacy of the booster dose against symptomatic COVID -19 in participants withou t evidence of prior infection was (95% CI, 89.5-97.9) and 96.5% (95% CI, 89.3 -99.3) aged of age and 93.1% (95% CI, 78.4 -98.6) for participants ag ed over 55 years25. Additionally, the booster dose demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. On top being efficacious in clinical trials, booster doses have also shown to have a high effectiveness and significantly increase the immune response of recipie nts.
