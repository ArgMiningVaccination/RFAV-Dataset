Most of them are mild and transient. The authorities for medicinal products only grant a marketing authorisation to a vaccine that has been scientifically demonstrated to be both effective and safe. Coronavirus vaccines are evaluated on the same quality, safety, and efficacy criteria as other medicines. This page provides information on the safety of coronavirus vaccines, possible adverse effects, and their monitoring. Safety of coronavirus vaccines - COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated on the same quality, safety and efficacy criteria as other medicines. COVID-19 vaccines undergo the same phases of research as other vaccines. Vaccine trials concerning the newly introduced COVID-19 vaccines have involved tens of thousands of voluntary subjects, both in Europe and elsewhere around the world. The authorities for medicinal products only grant a marketing authorisation to a vaccine that has been scientifically demonstrated to be both effective and safe. The authorities assess whether the evidence demonstrating the benefits of the product is significant enough compared to the potential adverse effects to be able to grant a marketing authorisation on the basis of the evidence obtained. The authorities always monitor the efficacy and safety of all vaccines after they have been introduced to the market. - Due to the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disease burden, COVID-19 vaccines were granted conditional marketing authorisation in the EU. Normal marketing authorisation was granted to the Comirnaty and Spikevax-mRNA vaccines and their variant-tailored products on 16 September 2022. A normal marketing authorisation was granted because sufficient research evidence has been gathered on the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. A conditional marketing authorisation can be granted because the product is considered essential based on medical grounds but more research data is needed to grant an ordinary marketing authorisation. To extend the marketing authorisation, the marketing authorisation holders of COVID-19 vaccines, i.e. pharmaceutical companies, provide the authorities with more efficacy and safety data on a monthly basis. With regard to COVID-19 vaccines, the monitoring period has been shorter than average. - THL is constantly monitoring the safety of coronavirus vaccines by examining the information in health care registers. Examining vaccine safety also provides monitoring data on total mortality. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has used register data to determine the prevalence of rare severe allergic reactions after coronavirus vaccination and whether the mortality rate of vaccinated people differs from the average mortality rate of the population. To date, total mortality has been monitored for a total of 4.4 million first dose recipients, 4.2 million second dose recipients and 2.3 million third dose recipients. Monitoring of total mortality is not connected with monitoring of coronavirus-related deaths. The monitoring has shown that the mortality rate of vaccinated persons in the weeks following the vaccination is lower than that of unvaccinated persons, taking into account the persons' age, illnesses and gender, among other things. The monitoring of mortality rate will continue as vaccinations progress. A temporal link between the vaccination and death does not mean that the vaccination and death have a causal link. Around 55,000 people die in Finland every year. Elderly persons living in nursing homes were among the first recipients of coronavirus vaccines, and their risk of dying of their underlying conditions is high even in the short term. THL uses health care registers to also investigate, for example, the incidence of vascular thrombosis in patients who have received coronavirus vaccine. - Research data shows that the administration of the first and second doses of different corona vaccine products causes the body to defend itself effectively against the coronavirus infection. In Finland, THL has used health care register data to determine that administering different corona vaccines at different times protects the vaccinated against mild and severe coronavirus disease at least as well as when the same product is administered on both occasions. In addition, the studies have not revealed any concerns about the safety of combining different vaccine products. Persons who have received two different vaccines have had similar mild and transient adverse effects, such as local reactions and fever, as those who have received only one product. Persons who have received two different products have not experienced significantly higher number of adverse effects than those who have received only one product. Moreover, experience and previous knowledge of how the vaccines work do not give rise to any concern about the safety or efficacy of vaccines. Possible adverse effects - All vaccines, like all other medicines, can have adverse effects. Most of the adverse effects of vaccines are mild and transient. The most typical symptoms after the injection include local symptoms at the site of injection, such as pain, redness, heat, and swelling. Also very typical are transient general symptoms, such as fever reactions, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, irritability, nausea, and chills. Local and general symptoms usually occur a few days after the vaccination. They pass in a few hours or days. They can be treated with antipyretics and analgesics, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or paracetamol. Local and generalised symptoms are not a contraindication for further vaccinations. The expected symptoms, such as local reactions, are more common after the second or later mRNA vaccine dose compared to the first dose. Adenovirus vector vaccines show more local and general symptoms after the first dose than later doses. As a rule, the majority of adverse reactions to vaccines occur within six weeks of vaccination. - - All vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions, but their occurrence is rare. The firstly introduced mRNA vaccines have been reported to cause such reactions to approximately two persons out of 100,000 vaccinated persons. This number is slightly higher than average. The severe allergic reactions caused by the adenovirus vector vaccine are similar to those caused by other vaccines. - Those who have received a mRNA vaccine, that is Moderna Spikevax or Biontech-Pfizer Comirnaty, have been diagnosed with more myocarditis than the population on average. The majority of cases have been diagnosed in young men after the second vaccine dose and there are relatively more cases in those who have received a Spikevax vaccine than in those who have received a Comirnaty vaccine. Myocarditis has also been reported among Nuvaxovid protein vaccine recipients. Cases of myocarditis are rare in general, and the symptoms have been mild in most cases. - Other very rare adverse effects of mRNA vaccines include facial paresis and erythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme an immunological reaction the skin and mucous membranes, in which red, bull's-eye-like spots or splotches develop on the skin. - The AstraZeneca and Janssen adenovirus vector vaccines are associated with the risk of very rare coagulation disorder. In studies, the adverse effects of the variant-tailored mRNA vaccines have not differed from the original mRNA vaccines More information about myocardial inflammation and the coagulation disorder below on this page. - Although all new vaccines will be thoroughly tested, the possibility of rare adverse reactions for any vaccine or medicine cannot be completely excluded. Although vaccine studies involve tens of thousands of subjects, very rare adverse effects might only emerge after the vaccine has been administered to an even larger and more diverse group of people. - Over 10 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have already been administered around the world, and extensive experience in using them has already been gathered for two years. Both mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines have been studied and developed for several years before the coronavirus pandemic, so information on the vaccines has accumulated even before the vaccines were taken into use. It is known from experience that the vast majority of the adverse effects of vaccines can be observed within six weeks of vaccination. No serious adverse effects of coronavirus vaccines have occurred months after the vaccination. The safety of coronavirus vaccines is continuously monitored both in Finland and internationally. - The Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea has received approximately 4000 adverse reaction reports for different types of menstrual disorders. They describe very different types of menstrual cycle disorders: heavy, short, painful, irregular or absent menstrual periods, as well as different types of spotting and intermenstrual bleeding. The adverse reaction reports show signs of a possible link between the COVID-19 vaccine and menstrual disorders. Because menstrual disorders of various types are common, the adverse reaction reports cannot be used to deduce the frequency of the phenomenon or how it changes over time. The majority of women with menstrual disorders do not seek healthcare. As a result, these menstrual disorders do not get recorded in health care registers, which can be used to carry out epidemiological investigations. On the basis of recently published studies, the frequency and nature of the phenomenon are being examined in more detail. COVID-19 vaccines have not been found to have any effects on fertility. The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has added an increase in menstrual bleeding as an adverse effect of Comirnaty and Spikevax mRNA vaccines. According to EMA, mRNA vaccines do not cause the absence of menstruation. [PRAC: Comirnaty and Spikevax: heavy menstrual bleeding added as a side effect](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-24-27-october-2022) - It is considerably safer to take a vaccine than to have the coronavirus disease. The benefits and disadvantages of coronavirus vaccines have been studied in advance and are well known. The majority of harmful effects are mild and will go away quickly. Serious harmful effects are very rare and can be treated. The consequences of coronavirus disease are less predictable. It cannot be known in advance whether the coronavirus disease is severe in your case, or whether it causes secondary diseases or prolonged symptoms. Curative treatment for coronavirus disease is currently studied, but for the time being there is no certain treatment method or medicine. No vaccine gives a complete protection against a disease or an infection. However, coronavirus vaccines are effective, against severe coronavirus disease, even when the disease is caused by the Omicron variant of the virus. Vaccination also significantly improves the protection provided by coronavirus disease that you have had previously. That is why you should take a coronavirus vaccine even if you have already had coronavirus disease. [Frequently asked questions about vaccinations after recovering from the coronavirus disease](/en/web/infectious-diseases-and-vaccinations/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates/vaccines-and-coronavirus/getting-vaccinated-against-covid-19-how-why-and-when-/vaccine-doses-offered-to-different-groups#vaccination_after_coronavirus_disease) - Pharmaceutical authorities monitor the possible adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines as they do with all new medicines. Many national authorities actively follow the safety of the coronavirus vaccinations. In Finland, the monitoring involves for example combining information from different registers. Information is also collected through adverse event reports, studies, and safety reviews. In Finland, the Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea collects information on suspected adverse reactions to vaccines and shares the information with THL and the European Medicines Agency EMA. The holder of the marketing authorisation of the vaccine and the World Health Organisation WHO get information on suspected adverse events through the EMA. Using national registers, THL investigates the frequencies and backgrounds of suspected adverse events collected by Fimea and other general concerns around vaccinations. The registers used in the reports include information sent from health care units on vaccinations, diagnoses, and deaths. - In Finland, the Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea collects information on suspected side effects of vaccines. If you suspect that you have had an adverse reaction to the coronavirus vaccine, report it to your doctor or some other health care personnel. A health care professional can report the adverse reaction to Fimea on your behalf. You can also report an adverse reaction yourself or at a pharmacy. You can read detailed instructions on reporting an adverse reaction on the Fimea website. - If the COVID-19 vaccine administered in Finland causes harm, you can apply for compensation under the pharmaceutical injuries insurance. Information on how the adverse effects caused by coronavirus vaccines will be compensated can be found on the Finnish Mutual Insurance Company for Pharmaceutical Injury Indemnities website. Questions about myocardial inflammation - Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle. Its most common cause is a virus infection, such as flu or an overreaction of the body to a virus infection. Those who have received mRNA vaccines have reported more myocardial inflammations in Finland and other countries than the population on average. According to a Nordic follow-up study, more myocardial infections have occurred in those who have received Moderna Spikevax vaccines than in those who have received Biontech-Pfizer Comirnaty vaccines. The risk of myocardial inflammation after vaccination is higher among young men than among women. For this reason, THL has instructed municipalities to offer only the Biontech-Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine to men under the age of 30. The study found that myocardial inflammation from coronavirus vaccines is nevertheless rare overall. Cases of myocardial inflammation occur all the time as a result of various infections also in unvaccinated people. The majority of myocardial inflammations observed after coronavirus vaccination have been diagnosed within two weeks of receiving a second dose of mRNA vaccine. The symptoms of myocardial inflammation associated with the coronavirus vaccine have usually been mild. Most patients requiring hospital examination have been discharged in good condition after a few days of treatment. - According to THL monitoring, there has been an increase in myocardial inflammations also in Finland, but the cases are rare in relation to the total number of people vaccinated. Coronavirus disease also increases the risk of myocardial inflammation. Myocardial inflammations also occur continuously in the population without the COVID-19 vaccination. Myocardial inflammations occur most in young men, whether they are vaccinated or not. However, in this group the symptoms of myocardial inflammation are generally mild. Myocardial inflammations of vaccinated patients are rare in general after both the first and second doses of vaccine. It is still important to take both vaccine doses in the basic vaccination series as normal. The second dose of vaccine strengthens and extends the protection provided by the first dose. - According to a Nordic follow-up study, relatively more myocardial inflammations occur in those who have received Moderna Spikevax vaccines than in those who have received Biontech-Pfizer Comirnaty vaccines. The risk of myocardial inflammation after vaccination is higher among young men than among women. For this reason, THL has instructed municipalities that only Comirnaty vaccines should be offered to men under the age of 30. [The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare issues instructions that men under 30 years of age should only be offered the Comirnaty coronavirus vaccine (THL, 11.10.2021)](/en/web/thlfi-en/-/thl-issues-instructions-that-men-under-30-years-of-age-should-only-be-offered-the-comirnaty-coronavirus-vaccine). [Nordic study confirms connection between coronavirus vaccines and myocarditis - cases rare and mild (THL, 4.5.2022)](/en/web/thlfi-en/-/nordic-study-confirms-connection-between-coronavirus-vaccines-and-myocarditis-cases-rare-and-mild) - The severity of myocarditis, or myocardial inflammation, may vary from no symptoms to severe. The most common symptom of myocardial inflammation is chest pain, typically when lying on the left side or sitting in a stooping position. Severe symptoms include laboured breathing, various cardiac arrhythmias and, sometimes, cardiac heart failure. Myocarditis usually heals by itself, but should symptoms arise, it is advisable to seek medical attention without delay in order for the inflammation or other cause of the symptoms to be identified and the symptoms treated. - After the vaccination, you should exercise according to how well you feel. If you feel that you have a temperature, fever, or if you feel generally unwell, avoiding exercise while the symptoms persist is recommended. The coronavirus vaccine is injected into a muscle. After the vaccination it is worth considering if you should engage in a type of exercise that puts a powerful strain on the muscle into which the vaccine was injected. Straining the muscle might increase local symptoms at the point of injection. Inflammations of the heart muscle and pericardium (myocarditis and pericarditis) are very rare side effects of mRNA vaccines. THL recommends as a precaution to avoid extreme physical strain for three days after receiving an mRNA coronavirus vaccine. The recommendation applies to both the first and second doses of the vaccine. There is no need to avoid normal exercise if you feel well. The issue is the precautionary principle, and it is not possible, based on current information, to give any more detailed guidelines for different sports, for example. Questions about adenovirus vector vaccines - There are reports from European countries indicating that very rare coagulation disorders are more frequent in people who have received the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria and Janssen coronavirus vaccines. Rare coagulation disorders have occurred in the reported cases. This means thrombosis combined with reduced platelets. Thrombosis has occurred, among others, in the brain veins and in the veins or arteries of the intestinal region. The use of Vaxzevria vaccination was terminated on 30 November 2021. The Vaxzevria vaccine is no longer procured for Finland. [EMA considers it possible that there is a connection between a very rare blood clotting disorder and the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria COVID-19 vaccine (Fimea, in Finnish)](https://www.fimea.fi/-/ema-pitaa-yhteytta-erittain-harvinaisen-veren-hyytymishairion-ja-astrazenecan-vaxzevria-koronarokotteen-valilla-mahdollisena) [Use of AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to end in Finland in November (18.10.2021)](/en/web/thlfi-en/-/use-of-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-to-end-in-finland-in-november) The likelihood of getting symptoms is very small Exceptional symptoms that have been observed are very rare, and the likelihood of getting such symptoms after a vaccine remains very small. The average incidence of the coagulation disorder has been about one case per 100,000 recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the European Union area and, in a few countries, there have been about one case per 40,000. In the EU area tens of millions of people have been given the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. Less than one case of the coagulation disorder has been reported per 100,000 Janssen vaccine recipients in the EU. The incidence of the coagulation disorder in different age groups is not precisely known. - - In accordance with the precautionary principle, the Janssen coronavirus vaccines are not administered in Finland to those under the age of 65 or those aged 65 and over who have previously suffered from neurovenous thrombosis, i.e., sinus thrombosis or heparine-related thrombocytopenia (HIT). The Janssen coronavirus vaccines are also not administered to those who have previously had capillary leak syndrome. Others aged 65 or over may receive the Janssens coronavirus vaccine as a second or third dose. From this age onwards, the risk of severe coronavirus disease and death starts to increase significantly. Those aged 65 or over also have the option to select a mRNA vaccine or Novavax's Nuvaxovid coronavirus vaccine instead of an adenovirus vector vaccine. - If you are 65 years old or older and received the AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccine as your first vaccine dose, you may receive either the Janssen vaccine, an mRNA vaccine or the Nuvaxovid protein-based vaccine as your following doses. If you are under the age of 65 and received the AstraZeneca vaccine as your first dose, you will receive an mRNA vaccine or Novavax's Nuvaxovid coronavirus vaccine as your following doses. The Janssens vaccine is not given to those under the age of 65 even if the person being vaccinated would want an adenovirus vector vaccine. The risks of a coagulation disorder linked with adenovirus vector vaccines is greater among those under 65 than among those who are older. Vaccines are used in Finland according to medical indications for use and established treatment practice, which means that all those who have been vaccinated also have insurance cover. - An analysis by the European Medicines Agency has not found any actual risk factors that would predispose a person to the rare coagulation disorder. Therefore, the administration of the AstraZeneca Vaxzevria or the Janssen coronavirus vaccine is not prevented by history of: - cerebral artery thrombosis, - stroke, - cerebral haemorrhage, - subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), - pulmonary embolism, or - deep vein thrombosis, in the lower extremities, for example. It is important to note that thrombosis observed in veins in the brain and in intestinal veins and arteries, linked with a low platelet count, is very rare. There is a clear increase in risk of common vascular thrombosis linked to COVID-19 disease. - If you have received a Janssen coronavirus vaccine, observe any abnormally severe symptoms that may occur within a few days and no later than about two weeks after vaccination. Early treatment can help prevent symptoms from getting worse and prevent possible blockages. Seek immediate treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: - Abnormal, extended and worsening headache or nausea - Obscure vision - Small intradermal haemorrhages outside the vaccination site or abnormal bruises - One-sided muscle weakness of limbs or face - Strongly increased bruising on skin or mucous membranes - Small intradermal haemorrhages - Shortness of breath - Chest pain or prolonged abdominal pain - Exceptional swelling of lower limbs. Within a few days of vaccination, mild headache is usually a harmless and transient symptom after vaccination. There is no cause to seek medical care for it. - Extremely rare cases of capillary leak syndrome, in which fluid leaks from small blood vessels into tissues, have been observed after the Janssen and AstraZeneca Vaxzevria vaccines. In some of the reported cases, the person had already had the same syndrome before. The symptoms have usually occurred within a few days of vaccination. Seek immediate treatment if you experience the following symptoms: - Rapid and strong swelling in the limbs - Sudden weight gain - Dizziness related to the above-mentioned symptoms - Very rarely, cases of polyradiculitis (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), which have occurred within a few weeks of vaccination, have been reported. However, polyradiculitis also occurs in the population normally. For example, it may be linked to a virus infection that the person has had. Seek immediate treatment if you experience the following symptoms: - Numbness, tingling and increasing muscle weakness in the lower limbs - Spread of the above symptoms to the upper body About cookies Cookies help us to develop our website and to improve its content and availability.
