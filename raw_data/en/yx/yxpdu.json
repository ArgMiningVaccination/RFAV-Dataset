Researchers reviewed epidemiological evidence to consider three hypotheses. The first was that the combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine damages the gastrointestinal lining, thereby permitting the entrance of encephalopathic proteins and causing autism. After the 1998 publication of a study suggesting an association between MMR vaccine and autism, 13 studies in five countries showed no such link. No data supported any causal connection between the MMR vaccine and autism, and any apparent association was coincidental, because the vaccine is typically administered at the age when symptoms of autism first emerge. Given the 1998 prevalence of autism in England, 25 children each month would receive a diagnosis soon after MMR vaccination by chance alone. The second was that thimerosal, an antibacterial compound used in vaccines for more than 50 years, is toxic to the central nervous system. Seven studies from five countries found autism rates to be unaffected by the presence or absence of thimerosal in vaccines. The third was that the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. The infant immune system is immediately capable of generating a vast array of protective responses--conservative estimates predict a capacity to respond to thousands of vaccines simultaneously. The authors conclude that 20 epidemiologic studies have shown neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine to cause autism. In concert with the biological implausibility of vaccines overwhelming a child's immune system, these have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism. Gerber J, Offit P.
