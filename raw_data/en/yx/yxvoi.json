They have been increasing adopted in because overall research has shown them to be a safe and cost effective way of reducing length of hospital stay and positive patient outcomes. ERAS protocols are threaded throughout the perioperative care, including pre, intra and post-operative phases. I will analysis two research papers which highlight the use of ERAS protocols and define a variety of protocols and focus on four ERAS protocols which are commonly used in surgical nursing. It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Introduction In the last five years, Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways for colorectal resection have been thrust into spotlight with evidence of expedited recovery time and improved postoperative outcomes1-5. However, there exists little uniformity in the recommendations and results of published ERAS pathways, and there is some evidence suggesting that the wrong cocktail of bundle elements can increase Surgical Site Infection (SSI) rates6. This inconsistency can be attributed to a lack of consensus on the efficacy of some common bundle elements, such as preoperative antibacterial showering, maintenance of normothermia, and high intraoperative Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (Fi02) 7-15. Such dissonance in studied ERAS efforts Discerning gentlemen have come to trust the elite level of companionship available at DC Barbies. Our glorious ladies are everything astute men desire when seeking a clandestine escape with a sophisticated woman prepared to erase the day's stress and pave the way to forgetting life for a while. No matter As complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) grows more popular with the American public, the question arises whether we should consolidate aspects of unorthodox medicine with standard care. Many, such as Dr. Andrew Weil, swear by CAM's effectiveness and urge for a more patient-centered approach to care (Relman). While CAM has no shortage of critics, a growing body of research is indicating the effectiveness of many CAM therapies in treating a variety of conditions. Patients, physicians, and researchers sometimes find that CAM therapies are more Sham-acupuncture has shown that the results for it and acupuncture are fairly similar. It is possible that the percentages of acupuncture and sham-acupuncture are similar because they were both the result of a placebo effect. The percentage for both acupuncture and sham-acupuncture were only 50% or less, showing that there The healer I had interviewed was a physical therapist named George Ciresi. Physical therapists are health care professionals who diagnose and treat patients of all ages who are experiencing medical problems causing limitations in their abilities to move and perform everyday functional activities. This kind of care can be provided in a variety of settings such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and sports and fitness facilities. When seeing a physical therapist the first step involves an evaluation. An evaluation is when the physical therapist examines each individual one on one in order to develop a plan using treatment techniques to aid the patient in a full recovery on the body part that is causing any pain or restrictions in their everyday lives. Also, to be able to achieve this goal the therapists must learn and identify existing problems with Two twenty-four minute Reiki sessions were completed at the children's home. In conclusion, decreased mean scores for outcome measures indicate the reiki therapy did decrease pain, anxiety, heart rate, and respiratory rate, but small sample size deterred statistical significance. This work suggests that complementary methods of treatment such as reiki may be beneficial to support traditional methods to manage pain and anxiety in these children. However, more research should be done to further validate the claims (Thrane et al., 2017, p. A wide range of treatments exists under the umbrella term of 'complementary therapy'. Each treatment has its own unique theory and practice, which makes it difficult to offer a As women age, many changes take place in her body such as hormone levels reducing, hair graying, and skin wrinkling. Kegel muscles, found inside the vagina and pelvic walls, start to lose elasticity. This change is daunting to many women, and can greatly have an effect on their ability to enjoy sexual intercourse. The sensations and feelings may be lost by this change, and there are some options available to restore their glorious physical state. The most obvious option many women choose is surgery to rejuvenate vaginal size, allowing them to get to enjoy their time with their partners again. Although surgical procedures work wonders, they are not always financially feasible, and this has made many women choose other methods to solve the problem Although alternative healing methods have been historically practiced longer than biomedicine, the culture of biomedicine has in the past few centuries worked to assert itself as a more legitimate form of healing. These claims in part come from the assertion that science has proven the legitimacy and effectiveness of biomedicine and the same cannot be said for alternative healing methods. These differences in healing relate to the fact that they have different views of what causes illness. Additionally the two ideologies often cannot coexist with each other which only leads to more disagreement. The differences between the culture of biomedicine and alternative healing methods stem from different understandings of where illness comes from and therefore how it can be healed. In this day and age, a culture of compromise and understanding from both sides, biomedical and traditional, is necessary for effective treatments. Kristyne, I read your post and even though my addiction is back with smoking, I still agree with all of the negative information, that I have read and what you have posted. I really wanted to comment on Reiki, the holistic approach to healing my not have scientific proof that it works, this Japanese technique that creates stress reduction and relaxation that promotes healing has a long history. Overall, I think Reiki has it's merits and I find it a fascinating practice. Post-Operative Care Instructions As long as the affected area is still numb from the anesthesia, it is possible to injure your tongue and/or cheek when chewing. Due to this fact, drinking and eating during this period is not recommended and should be avoided. When the numbness has dissipated, be the basis for the way that Reiki works, which is examined in the following sections.
