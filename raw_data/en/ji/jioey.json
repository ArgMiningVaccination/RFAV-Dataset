Please take the appropriate care in any such transaction as no guarantees are given by the Glass Message Board for any items offered for sale here. For both buyer and seller protection, the Board encourages sellers to list with a sales site with buyer and seller protection, such as eBay or their own established shop site, and then advertise via the Market Place. Please do not buy from a seller who contacts you privately unless you know and trust them well. The Board takes no responsibility for any issues arising from such transactions. To be fair to all members, posts offering items for sale in other forums will be moved here even if the post includes an ID request.
