Linterman1 The generation of protective humoral immunity after vaccination relies on the productive interaction between antigen- specific B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Despite the central role of Tfh cells in vaccine responses, there is currently no validated way to enhance their differentiation in humans. From paired human lymph node and blood samples, we identify a population of circulating Tfh cells that are transcriptionally and clonally similar to germinal center Tfh cells. In a clinical trial of vaccine formulations, circulating Tfh cells were expanded in Tanzanian volunteers when an experimental malaria vaccine was adjuvanted in GLA-SE but not when formulated in Alum. The GLA-SE -formulated peptide was associated with an increase in the extrafollicular antibody response, long-lived antibody production, and the emergence of public TCR clonotypes in circulating Tfh cells. We demonstrate that altering vaccine adjuvants is a rational approach for enhancing Tfh cells in humans, thereby supporting the long-lived humoral immunity that is required for effective vaccines. Introduction Vaccination is one of the most powerful interventions for re- ducing the disability and death caused by infectious diseaseworldwide ( Andre et al., 2008 ). Despite its success, there are still numerous pathogens that are not controlled by current vacci-nation strategies, including HIV and Plasmodium spp. , the para- sites that cause malaria ( Burton et al., 2012 ;Delany et al., 2014 ). The majority of effective vaccines work by stimulating theproduction of antibodies that bind the surface of the pathogen to either block the pathogen 's ability to establish an infection or recruit and stimulate other immune cells, resulting in thepathogen 's destruction. Antibody production after vaccination can occur via two cellular pathways, which although separatedin time and anatomical space, are both induced after vaccinationwith a protein antigen. The first wave of antibody productioncomes from the extrafollicular plasmablast response, in whichshort-lived antibody-secreting cells produce immuno- globulin for a few days ( MacLennan et al., 2003 ). The second wave of ASCs comes from the germinal center (GC) response.The GC is a specialized microenvironment that forms in sec-ondary lymphoid tissues after immunization, where antigen-activated B cells clonally expand within the B cell follicleand undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) of theirimmunoglobulin loci. The SHM, followed by the affinity-based selection of GC B cells, results in the emergenceof long-lived, high-affinity, antibody-secreting plasma cells andmemory B cells that are able to provide protection againstsubsequent infection ( Vinuesa et al., 2016 ). The GC response is absolutely dependent on a specialized subset of CD4 +T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which provide growth and differ-entiation signals to GC B cells. Tfh cells mediate the positive selection of B cell clones in the GC and thereby determine which B cells exit the GC as plasma cells or memory B cells(Vinuesa et al., 2016 ). Because Tfh cells are key determinants of the long-lived humoral immunity that arises from the GC, theyrepresent an exciting therapeutic target through which vaccinestrategies could be improved ( Linterman and Hill, 2016 ). This is particularly pertinent for malaria vaccine development, asclinical trials indicate that the development of long-lived anti- body responses, in particular for the preerythrocytic and blood stages of infection, are essential for sustained protective im-munity ( Cockburn and Seder, 2018 ). Adjuvants are an attractive way to improve vaccine re- sponses in humans. This is reflected in the licensing of four newadjuvants in Cambridge, UK;2Ifakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo, Tanzania;3Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK;4Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine and Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY;5European Vaccine Initiative, Heidelberg, Germany;6Babraham Bioinformatics Facility, Babraham Institute, Department, Lister Hospital, Stevenage, UK;9Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland;10University of Basel, Switzerland. *D.L.

Nevertheless, the number of adjuvants that are in use in current vaccines is still very limited, largelyunchanged since the 1940s, as is our understanding of how ad-juvants boost a specific cellular immune response in humans.While studies in animals indicate that adjuvants are a valid wayto boost the GC and Tfh cell response ( Aloulou et al., 2016 ; Desbien et al., 2016 ;Liang et al., 2017 ), translational work is needed to determine if using novel adjuvants can boost these responses in humans. Despite Tfh cells being central for long-term humoral immunity, most human vaccine studies have notincluded these cells in their analysis, rather focusing oncytokine-producing CD4 +T cells ( Coler et al., 2015 ), an approach that does not accurately capture vaccine-reactive Tfh cells ( Dan et al., 2016 ). The tendency to omit the analysis of Tfh cells in human vaccination studies may be due to difficulty in studying these cellular responses. Tfh cells are located in secondary lymphoid tissue, which is not easily sampled during vaccinetrials. To circumvent this issue, a population of circulating Tfh-like (cTfh) cells that are found in the blood and phenotypicallyand functionally resemble lymphoid tissue Tfh cells can be usedas a biomarker of ongoing Tfh cell responses ( Simpson et al., 2010 ;Chevalier et al., 2011 ;Morita et al., 2011 ;Bentebibel et al., 2013 ;He et al., 2013 ;Locci et al., 2013 ). Here, we have used a seasonal influenza vaccination study and analyses of CXCR5 + Tfh cell populations from the blood and LNs of human donors to refine our understanding of cTfh cells as circulating biomarkersof bona fide Tfh cells resident in secondary lymphoid tissues. Wethen applied this knowledge to determine whether the combi-nation adjuvant glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion(GLA-SE; developed by the Infectious Disease Research Institute,Seattle, WA) can augment cTfh cell responses. In a phase Ib malaria vaccine trial in Tanzania, we show that a GLA- SE-formulated vaccine is superior to one formulated with Al- hydrogel (Alum). GLA-SE induced a greater extrafollicularantibody response and increased the formation of cTfh cells,including cTfh cells with transcriptional similarity and a LN GC-Tfh cells. While the different adjuvants didnot differential gene expression profiles in cTfh cells,multiple GLA-SE -vaccinated individuals had cTfh cells ex- pressing public TCR clonotypes, indicating that GLA-SE may support the recruitment of T cells bearing specific TCRs to theTfh cell compartment or promote their subsequent expansion.This demonstrates that experimental vaccine adjuvants offer aviable strategy to enhance Tfh responses and long-lived humoralimmunity in humans. Results cTfh cells clonally expand after vaccinationThe aim of our study was to determine whether the adjuvantGLA-SE promotes a cTfh cell response in humans. The locationof the GC response, within secondary lymphoid tissues, is one ofthe major barriers to understanding how different vaccines, andtheir adjuvants, affect GC biology in humans. For this reason,circulating cells that can act as biomarkers of the GC response are an area of intense interest. In particular, it is well established that there is a population of blood CXCR5 +CD4+cells thatexpands after vaccination ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 ;He et al., 2013 ; Locci et al., 2013 ) and that these cTfh cells phenotypically and functionally resemble lymphoid tissue Tfh cells ( Linterman and Hill, 2016 ). There is considerable heterogeneity in the circulat- ing CXCR5+CD4+T cell compartment, with multiple subsets described within this population ( Schmitt et al., 2014 ). Because of this heterogeneity, we first sought to identify the subpopu- lation of CXCR5+CD4+T cells that were activated by vaccination to enable us to refine our analyses. Inducible costimulator(ICOS) and CD38 are receptors expressed on the cell surface oftonsillar Tfh cells but not CD45RA non-Tfh cells (Fig. S1, A -D). The frequency of ICOS+CD38+tonsillar Tfh cells correlates with the percentage of GC B cells (Fig. S1 E), suggesting that cTfh cellsexpressing these markers may represent a circulating surrogateof activated lymphoid tissue Tfh cells. We first tested expression of these cell-surface receptors after seasonal influenza vaccina- tion, a routine nonadjuvanted inoculation in which cTfh cellexpansion has been well described ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 )a n d in which expression of ICOS and CD38 has been reportedon cTfh cells ( al., 2013 ;Herati et al., 2017 ; Koutsakos et al., 2018 ). We observed an expansion of ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells in healthy UK volunteers (n= 41) 7 d after vaccination ( Fig. 1, A and B ), the peak of the cTfh cell response ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 ;Carr et al., 2016 ). This expansion of ICOS+CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells corre- lated positively with the increase in influenza-specific anti-bodies 7 and 42 d after vaccination ( Fig. 1, C and D ; and Fig. S1, F and G). In addition, using HLA-DR tetramers in a subset of thevolunteers with the appropriate HLA genotype ( Yang et al., 2013 ), we were able to identify hemagglutinin (HA)-specific ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells 7 d after vaccination (Fig. S2, A -C). These data indicate that ICOS+CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+ cTfh cells could be a good biomarker of lymphoid tissue Tfh cells that support humoral immunity. To gain insight into how vaccines qualitatively alter Tfh cell responses, we performed RNA sequencing of 200ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells immediately before and 7 d after influenza vaccination in four individuals. Differentialgene expression analysis of these cTfh cells indicated up- regulation of CXCR3 and down-regulation of CCR6 tran- scripts in cTfh cells isolated 7 d after vaccination ( Fig. 1 E ). This difference in mRNA was also reflected at the proteinlevel, with the proportion of CXCR3 +cTfh cells increasing after influenza vaccination and a reciprocal decrease in CCR6+ cTfh cells ( Fig. 1 F ). This is consistent with previous work demonstrating that influenza vaccination results in a Th1-skewing of the Tfh cell population ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 ). Transcriptomic analysis al so enabled an assessment of the TCR usage within cTfh cells. Assessment of the nucleotidesequence encoded by the CDR3 region of the TCR chain re- vealed 160 TCR clonotypes per person that were unique at the amino acid level before vaccination ( Fig. 1 G ), a number that is consistent with the 200 cells sequenced. After vacci-nation, the number of unique TCR clonotypes identified per person was reduced ( Fig. 1 G ), consistent with clonal expan- sion ( Herati et al., 2017 ). This reduction in diversity was Hill et al.

This indicates that the cTfh cell response to influ- enza vaccination is dominated by the expansion of a smallnumber of T cell clones. In summary, the combination of flow cytometric analysis and RNA sequencing identifies theICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cell population as a biomarker of ongoing Tfh cell responses and provides a quantitative and qualitative way to assess the biology of these cells during human vaccine trials.

Because seroreactivity to P27A is high in populations naturally exposed to malaria, and anti-P27A IgG can inhibitasexual blood stage parasite growth in vitro ( Olugbile et al., 2009 ), P27A offers a rational vaccine target to prevent malaria disease. In a phase Ib clinical trial with adults from Tanzania, theP27A peptide (50 \u00b5g) was formulated with one of two adjuvants:the widely used Alum (Alhydrogel) or the experimental adjuvantGLA-SE enabling immunity ( Steiner-Monard et al., 2019 ). All participants were malaria preexposed but had no clinical malaria episode recorded in the past 5 yr. The vol- unteers were given three doses of either vaccine, each 1 mo apart, with blood samples taken for serology at multiple timepoints over a 34-wk follow-up period ( Steiner-Monard et al., 2019 ;s a m p l i n gs c h e d u l ei n Fig. 2 A ). In each participant, we detected low levels of anti-P27A antibodies before vaccination,which was not different between adjuvant groups, indicatingthat responses to the P27A vaccination involve reactivation ofP27A-specific memory lymphocytes ( Fig. 2 B ). It is important to study vaccine responses in cohorts with preexposure, as only a vaccine that successfully induces protective immunity in in-dividuals living in malaria-endemic regions will limit malarialdisease burden. Individuals with preexposure have been shownto mount poorer humoral responses in experimental malariavaccine trials than unexposed individuals, including to the P27Apeptide ( Steiner-Monard et al., 2019 ). After vaccination, P27A induced a higher anti-P27A IgG response when formulated in GLA-SE compared with Alum from day 63 through day 238 (Fig. 2 B ). In contrast to Alum, a significant further increase in serum anti-P27A IgG titers was observed 28 d after the thirdvaccination in the GLA-SE group ( Fig. 2 C ). This is the peak of the antibody response in this study, and a time when vaccine-specific antibodies are most likely derived from both extra-follicular and GC-derived ASCs. To determine whether the ad-juvant has an impact on the longevity of the antibody response, we calculated the proportion of peak (day 84, 28 d after the final vaccination) anti-P27A IgG antibodies that remain at later timepoints ( Fig. 2 D ). 6 mo after the final vaccination, individuals vaccinated with GLA-SE -formulated antigen had 25% of peak antibody titers remaining compared with 18% in the Alum- treated group ( Fig. 2 E ). There was no significant difference in the subclass of the IgG produced, with IgG1 dominating the re-sponse in both groups ( Fig. 2 F ). Together, these indicate that the adjuvant GLA-SE increases both the magnitude and longevity of the anti-P27A antibody response compared with Alum. GLA-SE drives higher frequencies of cTfh cells compared with AlumTfh cells regulate GC size and are essential for the emergence oflong-lived plasma cells and memory B cells from the GC;therefore, boosting Tfh cell number is a rational strategy to enhance vaccine responses ( Linterman and Hill, 2016 ). In this clinical trial, only volunteers receiving the vaccine containingGLA-SE had an expansion of the ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cell population 7 d after the third vaccination ( Fig. 3, A -C), and the increase in cTfh cell frequency correlated positively with anincrease in anti-P27A IgG at peak response ( Fig. 3 D ). This demonstrates that altering the vaccine adjuvant is a rationalapproach to enhance the magnitude of the cTfh cell response inhumans. These data show that GLA-SE can provoke a robust boost of humoral immunity even in the context of high preex- isting antibody titers induced by the previous two P27A in-oculations. This finding is critical in cases where preexistingnatural antigen exposure may have a negative impact on vaccineresponses, such as in malaria-endemic regions like Tanzania. Public TCR clonotypes identified in cTfh cells from GLA-SE -inoculated individuals As GLA-SE quantitatively altered the cTfh cell response in hu- mans, we wanted to determine if it also has a different quali-tative effect compared with Alum on this cell population.Previous studies have shown that CXCR5 +CD45RACD4+cTfh cells have B cell helper capacity in vitro ( Simpson et al., 2010 ; Chevalier et al., 2011 ;Morita et al., 2011 ;Bentebibel et al., 2013 ; He et al., 2013 ;Locci et al., 2013 ). In this study, <500 ICOS+CD38+ cTfh cells were isolated per person, meaning coculture studies to address the functional capacity ex vivo could not be pursued, but low-cell-number RNA sequencing was still achievable. As es-tablished in our UK influenza vaccination study ( Fig. 1 ), we performed total RNA-sequencing on 150 -200 ICOS +CD38+cTfh cells per person before vaccination (day 0), and 7 (day 63) and 28(day 84) d after the third vaccination. There was no significantalteration in the cTfh cell transcriptome between adjuvantgroups L A - S E , n= 8) 7 d after the third vacci- nation ( Fig. 3 E ) or at the other time points analyzed (data not shown). This suggests that while the GLA-SE -formulated pep- tide increases the magnitude of the cTfh cell response, it is notlikely to alter cTfh cell function when compared with Alum.Consistent with this, there was no difference in the mRNA ex-pression of the key cTfh effector molecules CD40LG orIL21be- tween the two volunteer groups ( Fig. 3, F and G ). In contrast to what was observed in the UK unadjuvanted influenza vaccina- tion cohort, there was no significant change in the CXCR3 or CCR6 transcripts ( Fig. 3, H and I ), indicating that the Th1/2/17 phenotype of these cTfh cells is not skewed by either adjuvant.This observation is consistent with the similar distribution ofP27A-specific IgG subclasses found after vaccination ( Fig. 2 F ). To determine whether adjuvant choice had an effect on theclonality of the cTfh response, we examined TCR sequences in our RNA-sequencing dataset of samples from days 0, 63, and 84. There was no evidence of clonal expansion in either adjuvant group (Fig. S3), but common clones were identified betweensamples. Within the Alum group, we identified 10 TCR clono- type sequences that were shared between samples (five distinctclones, each present in two separate samples); however, withone exception, these were only shared within individuals atdifferent time points ( Fig. 4 A ). In the GLA-SE -vaccinated group, of the nine distinct TCR clones that were common between two different samples, six were public TCR clonotypes, shared be- tween five different individuals ( Fig. 4 B ). Strikingly, these Hill et al.

These data indicate that GLA-SE may either promote the recruitment or selective expansion of T cells ex-pressing shared TCR clonotypes into the cTfh cell compartment. GLA-SE -formulated vaccines stimulate the extrafollicular ASC response Because GLA-SE promoted the expansion of cTfh cells, we wanted to determine whether this adjuvant also has an impacton the B cell response after vaccination. To this end, we assessed t h en u m b e ra n dt h er e p e r t o i r eo fp e r i p h e r a lb l o o dA S C s . Despite the increase in P27A antibody titers ( Fig. 2, B and C ), there was not an increase in the frequency of circulatingCD38 +CD20CD19+ASC 7 d after the third vaccination (day 63) in either group relative to baseline ( Fig. 5, A and B ). This may be because it is difficult to detect numerical changes in blood ASCsin Tanzanian individuals due to higher baseline frequenciesthan in age-matched samples from our UK cohort (Fig. S4 A). Alternatively, this may be because 7 d after the third vaccination (day 63) is not the peak of the circulating ASC response in this Figure 2.

An alternative strategy to understand the detailed nature of B cell responses in humans after vaccination is to assessthe clonality and mutation rate in ASCs. To investigate the characteristics of vaccine-induced ASCs, we performed V(D)J RNA sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chain IgG (IgHG)repertoires in blood ASCs from all individuals 7 d after the thirdvaccination (day 63). The analysis revealed that individuals withhigh titer antibody responses (defined as anti-P27A IgG >500arbitrary units [AU] at day 84) had oligoclonal expansion of ASCclones 7 d after the third vaccination ( Fig. 5, C and D ; and Fig. S4 B). Strikingly, these individuals showed an enrichment of IgHG clonotypes with fewer somatic mutations in their IgG heavy chain variable region (FR1 -FR3 regions), compared with theblood sample obtained before vaccination ( Fig. 5, E -H). This indicates that high-titer responders have more circulating ASCsderived from the extrafollicular antibody response than low responders. This decreased frequency of mutations occurred more frequently in GLA-SE -vaccinated individuals than in those that received the Alum-formulated P27A peptide ( ASC responsesmore efficiently than Alum. This consistent with amurine study showing that GLA-SE stimulates a greater numberof antigen-specific in im-munization Alum-formulated vaccination ( Desbien et al., 2016 ). It is important to note that this occurs in parallel with an enhancement of the GC response, demonstrating that both Figure 3. A GLA-SE adjuvanted vaccine pro- motes cTfh expansion.

Journal of Experimental Medicine 1862 The adjuvant GLA-SE enhances human Tfh responses https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20190301Downloaded from http://rupress.org/jem/article-pdf/216/8/1857/870909/jem_20190301.pdf by guest on 04 August 2020 responses can be simultaneously enhanced by GLA-SE in mice and that this adjuvant does not skew the B cell response in favorof one pathway over the other ( Desbien et al., 2016 ;Olafsdottir et al., 2016 ). Transcriptional analysis identifies circulating counterparts of GC-Tfh cells In both mice and humans, Tfh cells play essential roles within the GC (GC-Tfh) and outside the B cell follicle supporting theextrafollicular antibody response ( McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2009 ;Bentebibel et al., 2011 ;Lee et al., 2011 ). Our results indicate that GLA-SE is able to promote both cTfh cell and extrafollicularantibody responses, prompting the hypothesis that usingICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells as a biomarker of Tfh cells, as in our study, does not discriminate between GC-Tfh and ex- trafollicular Tfh cells, which would both be expected to form after vaccination to support their respective B cell responses.Recent studies suggest that cTfh cells with the highest expres-sion of PD-1 represent a highly activated cTfh cell population(Schmitt et al., 2014 ;Heit et al., and LN GC-Tfh that CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh cells may represent a distinct biomarker of GC-Tfh cells. To test thishypothesis, four different CD4 +CD45RAT cell subsets were sorted based on their expression of CXCR5 and PD-1 (gating shown in Fig. 6 A ), including bona fide LN CXCR5+PD-1+++Bcl-6+ Tfh cells ( Fig. 6 B ), from paired human blood and iliac LN samples from six individuals, and their transcriptomes weresequenced as described above. Hierarchical clustering of themost variable genes shows that CD4 +CD45RAT cell subsets from blood clusters with their corresponding subset from LNsexpressing the same cell surface phenotype ( Fig. 6 C ). Principal component (PC) analysis shows that majority of variation in the data is driven by the cell phenotype (PC1, 30%) while the secondcontributor to variation (PC2, 11%) is tissue origin ( Fig. 6 D ). Together, this strongly suggests that the CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh population most closely resembles the LN resident CXCR5+PD- 1+++Bcl6+GC-Tfh cell type. To further determine to what extent the transcriptome of the cTfh cells overlaps with that of the GC-Tfh population (LN 4, Fig. 6 A ), we first generated a list of 254 genes that were differentially expressed in GC-Tfh (LN 4) compared with the three other LN populations (LN 1, 2, 3), thenused this gene signature to compare with the four differentblood CD4 +CD45RApopulations ( Fig. 6 E ). The population clustered most closely with the LN GC-Tfh cell population, with a number of gene modules showing the sameexpression pattern ( Fig. 6 E ); for example, the canonical Tfh genes ASCL2 ,IL21,a n d ICOS show the same expression patterns in both LN and circulating CXCR5 +PD-1+++cells ( Fig. 6 F ). No- tably, IL7R is low in both LN and circulating CXCR5+PD-1+++cells ( Fig. 6 F ), consistent with a GC-Tfh Figure 4. A GLA-SE adjuvanted vaccine elicits common TCR clonotype usage.

However, there are differ- ences between the LN and circulating populations, as exempli-fied by low expression of S1PR1 on LN-GC-Tfh cells but high expression on CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh cells ( Fig. 6 F ), consistent with its role as a blood-localizing receptor on T cells. Analysis ofthe TCR CDR3 sequences from the paired blood and LN cell populations revealed that a high proportion of CDR3 sequenceswere shared between CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh and GC-Tfh cells (Fig. 6 G ), consistent with a previous study that sequenced the TCR of PD-1+ICOS+cTfh cells ( Heit et al., 2017 ). Combined, our data demonstrate that CXCR5+PD-1+++cTfh cells are clonally and transcriptionally most closely related to GC-Tfh in secondarylymphoid tissues; this shared ontology and antigen specificitymean this cTfh population can be used as a surrogate for GC-Tfh cells. The expansion of CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh cells is enhanced in GLA-SE -vaccinated participants The direct comparison of paired blood and LN samples indicatedthat CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh cells may be a circulating biomarker of GC-Tfh cells. Next, we tested whether CXCR5+PD-1+++cTfh ex- pansion correlated more with vaccination-induced long-termIgG responses measured after influenza and P27A vaccination,as long-term antibody responses are GC derived. CXCR5 +PD-1+++ cTfh cells expanded after seasonal influenza vaccination in ourUK cohort, confirming their responsiveness to immunization(Fig. 7, A and B ;Carr et al., 2016 ;Heit et al., 2017 ) and the presence of HA-specific T cells within this population wasconfirmed (Fig. S2, D and E). This expansion also correlates withthe increase in antibody titer 42 d after vaccination ( Fig. 7 C ). To determine the effect that GLA-SE has on this population, wereanalyzed our flow cytometry data from the P27A vaccine trial with this alternate gating strategy. There was a significant ex- pansion of CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh cells in the GLA-SE group but not in those volunteers who received the Alum-formulatedpeptide ( Fig. 7 E ). Importantly, the increase in CXCR5 +PD-1+++ cTfh cells at day 63 correlated with long-term antibody titers assessed on day 238 ( Fig. 7 F ), suggesting that this population may promote the acquisition of long-term humoral immunity, aproperty consistent with stimulating a GC response. These data, together with murine research demonstrating GLA-SE promotes GC B cell number in the draining LN ( Desbien et al., 2016 ), suggest that GLA-SE is a rational choice of adjuvant for en-hancing the GC response and long-lasting humoral immunity inhumans. Discussion Adjuvants are currently the most tractable way of altering howthe human immune system responds to vaccination. Themajority of licensed vaccines provide protection against subse- quent infection by generating long-lived antibody responses.Therefore, adjuvants that enhance the magnitude of the GC re-sponse are a logical approach to enhancing humoral immunity.The size and quality of the GC response depend on the quantityof Tfh cells that are induced by vaccination. While animalstudies clearly show that different adjuvants can enhance theTfh cell response ( Aloulou et al., 2016 ;Desbien et al., 2016 ), these findings need to be translated into human studies. Here, we show that a next-generation adjuvant can be used to enhance themagnitude of the Tfh cell response in humans. The GLA-SEadjuvant increases both the ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+total P27A vaccination, indicating that this adjuvant en-hances the GC response. The analysis of the ASCs by V(D)Jsequencing showed that GLA-SE also enhances the extra- follicular response. The data presented here are consistent with a mouse immunization study showing that antigen formulatedwith GLA-SE enhances Tfh cell numbers, the GC reaction, andplasmablasts in secondary lymphoid tissues after immunization(Desbien et al., 2016 ). Together, this demonstrates that GLA-SE enhances the magnitude of the humoral immune responserather than skewing it toward either the GC reaction or theextrafollicular antibody response. The stimulation of both these ASC sources in parallel maximizes the production of vaccine- specific antibodies. This demonstrates that GLA-SE can be usedto make vaccines that potentiate Tfh cell and antibody responsesin humans. Rapid antibody production after vaccination is supported by the extrafollicular ASC response. During a primary response,extrafollicular ASCs usually do not exhibit strong SHM in theirantibody variable (V) gene segments because they do not derive from GCs. Importantly, our study was done on malaria- preexposed volunteers who received three P27A vaccinationsat monthly intervals. Therefore, ASCs measured after the thirdvaccination could have differentiated from memory B cells de-rived either from a GC reaction after the first two P27A immu-nizations or from a natural malaria infection. These memoryBc e l l -derived ASCs would be expected to have fewer somatic mutations than GC-derived ASCs because memory B cells emerge from the GC before long-lived plasma cells ( Weisel et al., 2016 ). Consistent with this, individuals with high titer antibody responses 7 d after the third vaccination had mutations presentin the FR1 -FR3 regions of the antibody V gene segments; how- ever, the frequency of mutations was lower than ASCs at base-line. This indicates these ASCs were likely of extrafollicularorigin and suggests that the precursors of these ASCs werememory B cells that underwent low-level SHM during a GC response to one of the previous vaccinations in the vaccine trial. This FR1 -FR3 region low-mutation signature was morecolors shown in A. RNA-sequencing data were standardized relative to a library size of 1 million reads, and then read counts were log2 transformed; a va lue of 5 represents the limit of detection. P values were determined using ANOVA and the Tukey multiple-comparison test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 ).

Studies in mice have shown that GLA-SE augments the formation of early ASCs in the draining LN ( Desbien et al., 2016 ;Olafsdottir et al., 2016 ), and our findings indicate that in humans GLA-SE can also enhance the recruitment of memoryB cells into an extrafollicular ASC response. The generation of humoral immunity after vaccination oc- curs in secondary lymphoid tissues, which has hindered our ability to study detailed cellular vaccine responses in humans.Since the first descriptions of the expansion of a population of cTfh cells in the blood in patients with autoimmunity ( Simpson et al., 2010 ) and subsequently after vaccination ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 ;He et al., 2013 ), there has been growing interest in using cTfh cells as a biomarker of the GC response in humans(Linterman and Hill, 2016 ). A single unifying definition of what a Tfh cell is or a description of how they should be identified hasyet to be precisely demarcated. It has been proposed that Tfhcells are defined by their capacity to provide help to B cells, andthose that do so in the context of a GC reaction are described as GC-Tfh cells, thereby subsetting the total Tfh cell population by the site at which it functions ( McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2009 ; Figure 7.

Journal of Experimental Medicine 1867 The adjuvant GLA-SE enhances human Tfh responses https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20190301Downloaded from http://rupress.org/jem/article-pdf/216/8/1857/870909/jem_20190301.pdf by guest on 04 August 2020 Bentebibel et al., 2011 ;Lee et al., 2011 ). Here, we describe that a similar compartmentalization can be applied to the circulatingcounterparts of Tfh cells. The ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells represent a larger group of B cell helper cells; within thiscTfh population, those cells with the highest expression of PD-1 are the most similar to the GC-Tfh cells found in human LNs,consistent with previous work ( Heit et al., 2017 ). Analysis of the transcriptome of cTfh cells has the potential to yield information about how vaccination changes the phenotype of Tfh cells. Weobserved changes in the transcriptome of these cells 7 d afterseasonal subunit influenza vaccination in UK adults. These in-cluded alterations in the expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 , che- mokine receptors known to be affected by this vaccination(Bentebibel et al., 2013 ), demonstrating that RNA sequencing is a viable approach to detect phenotypic changes in cTfh cells after vaccination. However, our study did not detect differences in the transcriptomes of ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells 7 d after the third inoculation with a synthetic peptide formulated inAlum and GLA-SE, suggesting that the main difference in cTfhcells driven by these adjuvants is quantitative rather thanqualitative. This quantitative difference may arise from thedistinct mechanisms of action of the two adjuvants; while GLA-SE is thought to exert its effect on sinus macro- phages via ), Alum does not act through TLRs but instead may act via the inflammasome(Eisenbarth et al., 2008 ). The stable emulsion (SE) in GLA-SE has adjuvant properties on its own, such as is seen for emulsionadjuvants like MF59. It is clear from preclinical studies that thecombination of GLA with SE creates a more potent stimulator ofboth humoral immunity and the Tfh cell response than eithercomponent individually ( Desbien et al., 2016 ;Knudsen et al., 2016 ). Therefore, it is likely that this combination adjuvant is responsible for supporting the enhanced cellular immune re-sponse described in this study. Our results indicate that, despitedifferent mechanisms of innate immune cell activation by thesetwo adjuvants, they do not affect innate immune cells in a waythat results in a qualitatively different Tfh cell response. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that GLA-SE also promotes the emergence of common TCR clonotypes in cTfh cells that were shared between five of eight individuals. The emergence of so-called public clonotypes is informative forv a c c i n ed e s i g na si ti n d i c a t e st h a tt h e r em a yb eac o m m o n ,immune-dominant epitope that could be used to specifically enhance T cell responses in human populations. The recentdiscoveries of public antibody clonotypes have revolutionizedwhole-parasite malaria vaccine strategies ( Imkeller et al., 2018 ;Tan et al., 2018 ), and here, we extend this to the iden- tification of public cTfh cell TCR clonotypes induced after vaccination. The identification of these common TCR clo- notypes in cTfh cells from participants who received the GLA-SE-formulated vaccine could be a consequence of the greater magnitude of the response, indicating that more T cell clonesare recruited into the cTfh cell response. The knowledge ofkey antigenic peptides to which multiple individuals respond,combined with adjuvants that allow a better recruitment of Tfh cells into the GC, outlines a rational way to enhance vaccine responses at the population level.To date, there have been multiple subtypes of cTfh cells identified that have different activation states and functionalcapacities ( Morita et al., 2011 ;Bentebibel et al., 2013 ;Locci et al., 2013 ;Schmitt et al., 2014 ). Here, we aimed to identify the pop- ulation of cTfh cells that are most similar to GC-Tfh cells inhuman LNs. While GC-Tfh cells are likely to be the most infor-mative cell type in vaccination trials in which the generation of long-lived somatically mutated GC-derived ASCs is desirable, obtaining GC-Tfh cells is not possible in large vaccinationstudies. We show here that cTfh can provide surrogacy for GC-Tfh cells, including insights into the transcriptome of Tfh cells.CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh cells have a similar, although not identical, RNA profile to GC-Tfh cells found in LNs. These two cell typesalso shared TCR clonotypes, which indicates they may be clones derived from the same cell. This clonal relationship is consistent with a previous study ( Heit et al., 2017 ), which to- gether with data presented here suggests that cTfh cells withhigh PD-1 expression are closely clonally and transcriptionallyrelated to GC-Tfh cells. This study supports the relevance ofstudying the CXCR5 +PD-1+++cTfh population in this and future studies of how vaccines shape human GC-Tfh cell biology. Ourfinding that GLA-SE can enhance the GC-Tfh-like cTfh popula-tion and long-lived antibody response in the P27A vaccine trial demonstrates that the adjuvant should be a key consideration in vaccine design to maximize the generation of protective T cell - dependent humoral immunity in humans. Materials and methods Study designThe main research objective of this study was to characterize the cTfh cell and ASC responses to vaccination in humans at the cellular and molecular level. To that end, two related studieswere performed: (1) peripheral blood was tested from 41 healthyUK adults (18 -98 yr of age) who were vaccinated with the tri- valent influenza vaccine (northern hemisphere winter2016 -2017) and (2) 16 healthy HIV-negative Tanzanian male adults (18 -45 yr old) with minimal malaria exposure (urban Dar- es-Salaam), who were vaccinated with 50 was for analysis, and pe-ripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were available fromseven in the Alhydrogel-vaccinated group and eight in the GLA-SE-vaccinated group ( Steiner-Monard et al., 2019 ). Circulating Tfh cells and ASCs were identified by flow cytometry in samplesbefore and after vaccination and were flow-sorted for mRNA orB cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing, respectively. Re- searchers remained blinded to the adjuvant group throughout sample processing and data acquisition. Tonsil samples werecollected from adults undergoing routine tonsillectomy atCambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Pairedblood and LN samples were taken from patients recruited fromthe renal transplant live donor program at Cambridge Univer-sity Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and who provided in-formed consent. All patients were either receiving or within 6 mo of requiring renal replacement therapy. Patients taking immunosuppressive medication before the transplant were Hill et al.

Lymphoid tissue was removed as part of theroutine operative procedure as previously described ( Wallin et al., 2014 ). All human blood and tissue were collected in ac- cordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinkiand the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The seasonal UKinfluenza vaccination cohort was collected with UK local re- search ethics committee (REC) approval (REC reference 14/SC/ 1077), using the facilities of the Cambridge Registry identifier: from the Tanzanian Food and Dar-es-Salaam, TFDA13/CTR/004/03),National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR; Dar-es-Salaam, NIMR/HQ/R8a/Vol.IX/1742), Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic, Bern, Switzerland, reference no.2013DR1165), and ethical review boards at Ifakara Health Insti-tute and the University of Lausanne. Use of P27A trial samples inthe UK was approved by the UK Health Research Authority (RECreference 17/EE/0063) and Babraham Institute Human EthicsCommittee. Tonsil tissues and paired blood and LN sampleswere collected from UK adults undergoing surgery for their own medical care, under ethical approval from UK Health Research Authority (REC references 16/LO/0453 and 11/EE/0355, respec-tively) at Cambridge University Hospitals and processed at theBabraham Institute. Written informed consent was receivedfrom all volunteers. Cell isolation of PBMC, LN, and tonsillar lymphocytes Blood samples were collected into EDTA-coated tubes on the day of vaccination (before administration of the vaccine) and at the i n d i c a t e dt i m ep o i n t s .P B M C sw e r ei s o l a t e du s i n g1 5m lHistopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight in a methanol bath at 80\u00b0C, then kept in liquid nitrogen before analysis by flow cytometry. To isolate asingle cell suspension from secondary lymphoid tissues, tonsiland LN samples were finely minced and then pressed through a 70-\u00b5m cell strainer (Becton Dickinson), cells were washed twice in 50 ml sterile PBS, then frozen as above. Flow cytometry and sequencing of cTfh cells, tissue Tfh cells, and ASCsCryopreserved mononuclear cells were thawed and rested for 1 hat 37\u00b0C. Cell types were pre-enriched using MagniSort CD19Positive Selection followed by CD4 memory T cell enrichment (eBioscience). Fc receptors on all cells were blocked using hu- man IgG, followed by staining with panels outlined in Table 1 and separation on BD Biosciences Aria Fusion or Influx cellsorters. A dump channel consisting of viability dye and anti-bodies to CD14, CD16, and either CD19 or CD3 was used to ex-clude unwanted cell cTfh cell and ASC sorts,respectively. HA-specific CD4 +T cells were identified using class II tetramers with methods and reagents that have been previ- ously reported ( Yang et al., 2013 ). Gating ICOS+CD38+PD-1+CXCR5+cTfh and ASCs are included asFig. S5. Tonsil and LN cells were stained with the same flow cytometry panel as cTfh cells, and 4 million cells tained for intracellular Bcl6 mRNA was the SMART-Seq V4 Ultra-Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio) and sorting 200 cells directly into lysis buffer. mRNA from paired blood and LN CD4+CD45RAT cell populations was isolated from 52 -1,000 cells sorted into lysis buffer. cDNA libraries were subsequently generated using the Nextera XT DNA Li-brary Prep Kit (Illumina), followed by Illu-mina HiSeq 2000 with million 100-bp single-end reads per ASCs (CD19 +IgDCD27+CD71+CD20CD38+) were sorted into RNAlater (500 -10,000 cells) and RNA isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). In all samples for which sufficient RNA was extracted, immunoglobulin heavy (IgG, IgM) chainswere amplified using 5 9RACE with unique molecular identifiers as previously reported ( Turchaninova et al., 2016 ;Davydov et al., 2018 ) using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England MiSeq (340 \u00d7280-bp paired-end). Serology IgG to influenza HA proteins were measured before and aftervaccination by Luminex using magnetic beads coated with full-length recombinant HA proteins from A/California/07/2009(Cali09) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Bris08) as previously re-ported ( Wang et al., 2015 ). IgG to P27A was measured by ELISA as previously reported ( Steiner-Monard et al., 2019 ). Titers are represented as per milliliter, and where indi- cated, preexisting IgG titers were subtracted calculate vaccination-induced responses.

Reads were quantitated over exons, the library size was standardizedto 1 million reads, and then read counts were log2 transformed.Differentially expressed genes were determined by DESeq2 us-ing raw counts (adjusted P value cutoff, <0.05; Love et al., 2014 ). Hierarchical clustering and PC analysis were performed usingvariable genes (those with a standard deviation of >0.7 whencomparing all the datasets). The LN GC-Tfh signature was erated using DESeq2 and applying a post hoc z-score threshold of 0.9 to select the genes most highly or least expressed in GC-Tfhcells relative to other LN populations.

Clonotype diversity and sharingwere determined using vdjtools (version 1.0.3; Shugay et al., 2015 ). Processing and analysis of the V(D)J sequencing reads of ASCs were done using MIGEC and MiXCR as described inTurchaninova et al. (2016) but with some changes. Briefly, \"migec Histogram \"was used as described but with omitting the \"command. The recommended molecular identifier group (MIG) -size thresholding from this was used to select MIGs with sufficient over-sequencing to allow efficienterror correction in the subsequent \"migec Assemblebatch \" process \"was again Assemblebatch. \"Over-sequencing thresholds used ranged from 3-16 with the majority (27 of 30) being 4. The \"kaligner \" alignment algorithm was used in \"mixcr align \"to map reads to the\"VTranscipt \"feature full-length data. Vdjtools (version 1.1.7; Shugay et al., 2015 ) was used for summarizing and visualizing results. SHM was analyzed usingIMGT HighV-QUEST ( Brochet nucleotide sequences of clonotypes by MiXCR were filtered to incomplete both always very-low-frequency clonotypes) and non-IgG sequences of the IgG clonotypes were submitted to IMGT HighV-QUEST andSHM analyzed using the \"V-REGION-nt-mutation-statistics \" output file.

For the UK influenza vaccination studies, comparisons were madebetween days 0 and 7 for each individual with a paired Student 's ttest. For the P27A study, comparisons between the Alum and GLA-SE groups were done using a two-tailed unpaired Student 's ttest. ASC frequencies and serum IgG levels in the Tanzanian P27A vaccination cohort did not follow a normal distribution andwere analyzed using a Mann-Whitney Utest. Comparisons of the IgG titer from multiple time points in the Tanzanian P27A vac-cination cohort were calculated on log-transformed data using atwo-way ANOVA with Sidak 's multiple-comparisons test. The Kruskal-Willis test was used to compare TCR sharing in the paired blood and LN study. The number of cells sorted per population and the number of TCR clonotypes for the paired blood and LN study are shown in Table 2 . Figure legends include the test and the number of observations. For paired blood and LN analysis of TCR clonotyping, we used the following strategy to allow for the effect of the smallercell numbers in blood \"population 4 \"(ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+) based upon a prior study ( Shugay et al., 2013 ). This paper shows for 12 unrelated donor pairs that the number of shared clono- types ( Y) is directly proportional to the square of the number of clonotypes tested ( X), such that Y=aX2,w h e r e ais a constant. This extends work from Robins et al. (2010) , which used a similar power law to extrapolate TCR clonotyping to estimate the total size of the human naive CD8 pool. We, therefore,normalized our observed sharing frequencies between pop-ulations iand j(Y ij)a sf o l l o w s . Normalized sharing count between populations populations iandj, respectively. For some comparisons, Yijwas equal to 0. To allow normalization, we used pseudocounts Yij=Yij+0 . calculated NormYbetween all eight populations (8!/2!6! = 28 comparisons) for each individual.Online supplemental material Fig. S1 shows the expression of CD38 and ICOS on tonsillar Tfhcells and the relationship of CD38 +ICOS+CXCR5+PD-1+Tfh with GC B cells. Fig. S2 shows HA-specific CD4+T cells within the cTfh cell population 7 d after vaccination. Fig. S3 shows theproportion of the 40 most abundant TCR CDR3 clonotypes in ICOS +CD38+CXCR5+PD-1+cTfh cells from each P27A study par- ticipant.
