Neuroimmunediseasesareagroupofdisordersthatoccurduetothedysregulationofboththenervousandimmunesystems,and theseillnessesimpacttensofmillionsofpeopleworldwide.However,patientswhosuferfromthesedebilitatingconditionshave very few FDA-approved treatment options. Neuroimmune crosstalk is important for controlling the immune system both centrally and peripherally to maintain tissue homeostasis. Tis review aims to provide readers with information on how natural products modulate neuroimmune crosstalk and the therapeutic implications of natural products, cannabis tomitigatetheprogressionofneuroimmunediseases,suchasAlzheimer'sdisease,multiplesclerosis,amyotrophiclateralsclerosis,Parkinson's disease, depression, and anxiety disorders. Te majority of the natural products based clinical studies mentioned in this study have yielded positive results. To achieve the expected results from natural products based clinical studies, researchers shouldfocusonenhancingbioavailabilityanddeterminingthesynergisticmechanismsofherbalcompoundsandextracts,which willleadtothediscoveryofmoreefectivephytomedicineswhileavertingtheprobablenegativeefectsofnaturalproductextracts. Terefore, future studies developing nutraceuticals to mitigate neuroimmune efects and neuropsychiatric that are characterized by infammatory responses in thecentral nervous system (CNS). Even though neuroimmunedisorders predominantly manifest as an exaggerated im-mune response, the underlying pathogenesis involves dif-ferent immunological mechanisms such as those that arecell-mediated, humoral mediated, or triggered by infection,which is characterized by genetically defned mechanismsfor each disorder [1]. Neuroinfammation is a hallmark responsible for the occurrence of neurodegenerative conditions, includingAlzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease(HD),andmultiplesclerosis(MS)[2].TandBlymphocytes,as well as infammatory cells in the nervous system such asmicroglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, are stimulatedHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2023, Article ID 5583996, 18 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/5583996 bytheactivationofnumerousimmunecascades,whichplay a key role in neuroinfammation and infammatory cyto-kines. Te activated immune cascade disrupts the blood-brainbarrier(BBB)andblood-nervebarrier(BNB),allowinginfammatory cells to infltrate the nervous system furtherand the development of neuroimmune disorders. Te ac- tivation of the various immune cascades stimulates Tand B lymphocytes and infammatory cells as microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, andplaysapivotalroleinneuroinfammationandinfammatorycytokines. Te activated immune cascade causes the BBB and BNB, which allows additional infltration ofinfammatory cells into the nervous system and the devel-opment of neuroimmune diseases [3-5]. ALS is a known neurodegenerative disease with a poor prognosis, with few United States Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) approved disease-modifying drugs that produce only minimal survival benefts [6]. Studies have estimated that approximately 35 million people worldwidearesuferingfromthedebilitatingefectsofAD,yetonlyonerecently FDA-approved drug is available to mitigate diseaseprogression [7]. Although approved immunomodulatorytherapeuticmodalitiesforMSareavailable,thesedrugshavelimited efcacy in preventing the transition to the pro-gressivephaseofMS,andsevereadverseefectshavebecomea major issue with these disease-modifying drugs [8]. TescenarioforPDisnoexception,astherearelimitedavailabletherapeutic options to treat PD, and these therapies do notalterthenondopamine-dependentfeaturesofPD,especially cognitive impairment [9]. Patients sufering from the aforementioned incurable and debilitating neuroimmunediseases have devastating lifelong functional, physical, andmental disabilities. Additionally, they may have to undergovery expensive, therapeutic interventions that are un-afordable for many, thus creating a great economic burdenon their families, especially in developing countries [1].Several preclinical investigations have found that naturalproductsandtheirbioactivecomponentscanprotectagainstneuroimmune disorders. Terefore, alternative drug dis-coverybasedonauthenticnaturalproductshasthepotential toimprove thequality of lifeof disease progression and reducingcomorbidities [1, 10, 11]. Te authors aim to provide a review of the existing clinical studies that utilised natural products in South Asiatargeted at neuroimmune diseases. Moreover, this reviewsuggests some solutions for enhancing the bioavailability ofnatural products by optimizing the appropriate dosage,synergetic modifca-tions, and encapsulation with nanoparticles. Methodology Tereviewprocesswasdividedintothreemajorsteps:title,abstract, and content screening. Te previous South Asiannatural products studies on neuroimmune disease arereviewedinthisarticle.Articlesweresearchedindatabasesincluding PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, andSpringer. Te search was based on the key words:neuroimmunediseases,neuroimmunecrosstalk,andSouthAsian natural products where a total of 3024 publicationswere identifed. All the titles were screened, and 1578 documents were downloaded for abstract screening. Te inclusion criteriawere having the key words \"South Asian natural products\" and \"neuroimmune diseases.\" After the abstract screening, a total of 333 articles out of 1578 that met the inclusioncriteriawere retained. Finally, full texts of all 333 retaineddocumentswerecriticallyassessedusingthesameinclusion/exclusion criteria as the abstract screening, leaving 105papers to be included in this review. Te review method-ology has been summarised in Figure 1. 2.1. Neuroimmune Crosstalk in Neuroimmune Diseases. According to Deczkowska and Shwartz, cells patrol the immune-privileged CNS comparatively the peripheral immune system, glial cells play a majoranti-infammatory and neuroprotective role by upregulatinganti-infammatory processes to protect the CNS from stressandnoxiouspathogens,henceregulatinghomeostasis[14].Onthe other hand, exorbitant or tedious glial astrocytesto induce factors to stimulate a neu-roinfammatory cascade [17, 18] (Figure 2). Even though the adaptive response from the acute in- fammatory response is benefcial to defending againstpathogens, chronic neuroinfammation causes tissue de-struction and neuronal dysfunction [19]. Te underlyingmolecular mechanisms have been demonstrated by in vitro studies, including the upregulation of peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc) and the downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) pathway[20,21].Tisleadstoinhibitionoftheactivationofmicroglia, thus diminishing the generation of proin-fammatory cytokines and reducing reactive oxygen species(ROS) production the Janus kinase activator of transcription 3 23]. Due to the ability of microglia toregulateneuroinfammation,thehomeostaticproteinsofthemicroglia have been considered drug targets by modulatingsignaling pathways such as JAK/STATand NF-B [24]. Temetabolite of cinnamon and sodium benzoate been shown to reduce glial infammation, upregulate Tregs via reduction of nitric oxide (NO) suppress Thelper17(T17)cellsandType1Thelper(T1)cells,inhibitinfammatory infltration, restore the integrity of the BBB,and protect myelin in mouse models of MS [25, 26]. Teimmunomodulatory properties of NaB may be used againsta variety of neuroinfammatory disorders, including MS, asa primary or adjunct therapy [27]. Tis reduces redox im-balance, can be used asa therapeutic target of natural products to treat neurode-generative diseases [24, 28]. Tereisaclinicalnecessitytoidentifynovelcompounds to mitigate or treat the diseases associated with neuro-immune communication to reduce the negative efects ofmicroglia and infammatory cytokines. As summarized inTable1,naturalproductsmaypotentiallybeusedasimmunemodulators to treat neuroimmunological disorders due totheir ability to participate in numerous functions of adap-tive/innateimmunity.Inthisscenario,naturalproductsandtheir bioactive can be used as protective agents against neuronal damage caused by infammation and oxidative stress [24, 28]. 2.2. Curcumin. Curcumin yellow-coloured spice that comes from the Curcuma longa plant and is widely used in India and Sri Lanka [45]. Curcumin is a lipophilic phenolic diferuloylmethanethathasbeenshowntoinhibitavarietyoftranscription in-terleukins, and enzymes linked to infammation, making ita potential therapeutic option for neuroimmune diseases such as MS, PD, AD, and ALS [46-48]. Despite multiple encouraging outcomes from in vivo andin vitro in- vestigations, similar progress in human trials against ADwitha24-weekstudyofadailydosageof2gramsor4gramsof oral Curcumin C3 Complex [32] has not been made.Curcumin's the generation of biologically inactive [31],Future research should be designed to optimize efectiveness. Clinical research comparing thebioavailability of curcumin and ofhepatic and revealed thebioavailability of curcumin rose when piperine was con- sumed simultaneously, which could explain the reported increase in curcumin activity [45]. Dolati et al. [44] months candrasticallyreducethemRNAexpressionandsecretionlevelsof proinfammatory cytokines and transcription factors inMS patients. As a result, nanocurcumin could be admin-istered to alleviate MS symptoms. Polyherbal extracts will be a superior choice for in- creasing curcumin bioavailability and thus improving itstherapeutic efcacy by altering hepatic and intestinalmetabolic enzymes and transporters. Chico et al. [31] in- vestigated efcacy of to enhance bioavailability. Following 6months on clinical parameters(Table 1) and biochemical markers ALS patients foundthat treatment with curcumin modifes lactate productionprofle during muscular exercise suggesting improvement in mitochondrial function aerobic metabolism and oxi- dative damage thus slowing down the diseaseprogression [31]. Teexploitationofthesynergisticmechanismsofherbal compounds will lead to the discovery of more accom-plishable phytomedicines that can avert the probable neg-ative efects of single compounds. It is necessary to conducthumanstudiestoidentifypossiblecompoundsthatcouldactsynergistically with curcumin to enhance its bioavailabilityand activity [49].

Its anti-infammatory and neuroprotectiveproperties could open up new avenues for treating neu-roimmune diseases [50]. In a phase 1 clinical trial to in-vestigate the efcacy of EGCG in individuals with MS,800mgofpolyphenonEfailedtorestoreN-acetylaspartate(NAA) levels and resulted in increased liver enzyme levels in the participants (Table 1) [39]. To estimate the toxic dosage and bioavailability of EGCG, more clinical in-vestigations are needed. Factors that reduce catechinconcentration and inactivation, such as hard water withhighCa2+andMg2+concentrationsorevendrinkingmilkwithEGCG,shouldbeconsidered[51].TeintakeofEGCGin combination with other dietary components, whichmodifythecontextofEGCGbeforeabsorptionandalteritsbiological response, has a direct impact on its absorptionand stability.AccordingtoNaumovskietal.[52],systemicabsorption of EGCG given in capsules without food following anovernight fast was substantially higher than when it wasgiven in capsules with a light breakfast.

Te active treatment outperformed the placebo interms of improving patients' cognitive function and neu-ropsychiatric symptoms. Te clinical signifcance of thepharmacological efects was demonstrated by the consis-tency of both primary and secondary outcomes, such as functional status, global evaluation, quality of life, and re- sponse rates. Ginkgo biloba extract appears to be well tol- erated in the studies reviewed, without any signifcantdiferences between treatment and placebo, consideringadverse efects and study withdrawals [58]. Johnson et al. conducted a clinical trial to investigate if theconsumptionof240mgofaginkgoextract(EGb761)perday for four weeks enhanced functional performance in MSpatients. On measures of fatigue, symptom severity, andfunctionality, the ginkgo group had considerably moreparticipants exhibiting improvement on four or moremeasures and less fatigues [33]. Despite the fact that ginkgo appeared to have therapeutic efects in some of the subjects, it is conceivable that the treatment duration was short.Furthermore, the individual therapeutic responses mightvary.Tus,theresultisthatcombiningpositiveandnegativeresponses in analysesmay disguise or plant in Ayurvedic and tra- ditional medical systems [59]. Te two main activecomponents in ashwagandha are withaferin WS is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine,and it has been explored as a treatment for a variety ofdiseaseconditionsincludinganxiety,infammation,PD,andcognitive impairment [62]. Withania somnifera is also used asanimmunologicalstimulantinindividualswithlowwhiteblood cell counts and as an adaptogen for patients withfatigue, sleeplessness, and stress disorders [62, 63]. A studythat looked at the efects of a Withania extract on calciumantagonism in the central nervous system shed some in-formation on a possible anxiolytic mode of action. In thisinvestigationbyGrunzeetal.[64],treatmentwithWithaniaextractcausedextracellularcalciumantagonisminneurons,counteracting excitement. Calcium excitation has beenfound to play a role in a variety of psychiatric diseases,including anxiety, so inhibiting calcium excitation shouldhave an anxiolytic efect. According to a clinical trial by Langade et al. [29], Ashwagandha root extract (KSM 66 pill) of 300mgtwice daily dosage for a period of 10weeks improved sleepparameters in individuals with insomnia and anxiety (Ta- ble 1). When compared to the placebo group, signifcant improvements in sleep quality and sleep metrics such assleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efciency (SE), PittsburghSleep Quality Index (PSQI), and anxiety parameters such asthe Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) were seen. Inthis context, oral administration of capsules containingAshwagandha can be used as a potential anxiolytic agent(Table 1) 2.6. Centella asiatica (L). Centella asiatica is a herbaceous plant that can be found all throughout India, the Middle East, and Asia including Sri Lanka. Te main bioactivecompound of this plant is triterpene saponosides [65].Furthermore, pharmacological studies demonstratedthatC. asiatica and its constituents, primarily asiaticoside and ursolic acid, exhibit a wide range of pharmacologicalactions, including memory boosting, sleep-inducing, anxi-olytic, and antioxidant characteristics [66-68]. C. asiatica has also been shown to mitigate neurodegeneration andprotectagainstoxidativestress-inducedbrainaging[66].Bythese mechanisms, C. asiatica can exert neuroprotective efects against neuroimmune diseases such as AD, PD,depression, and anxiety [69-71]. A clinical study conducted by Jana et al. [30] to in- vestigate the therapeutic efcacy of C. asiatica to treat psychiatric conditions such as generalized anxiety dis-order found that oral administration of encapsulated500mgof C.asiatica plantextract twicedaily after ameal for two months has been shown to efectively decreasestress anxiety-depression disorders (Table 1). No otheranxiolytic drugs were given to the study subjects duringthe study period. Te study found that after 60days of treatment, the anxiety index, depression index, adjust- mentscore,andattentionlevelweresignifcantlyreduced,with no negative sideefects. often known as \"Brahmi,\" is a native plant that can be found in the Indian subcontinent,EastAsia,andsomepartsoftheUnitedStates.Its antianxiety, anti-infammatory, memory boosting, and immunomodulatory properties are thought to be due to its antioxidant properties. Bacosides, one of its bioactive in-gredients,havebeenproventohelpwithanxiety,depression,andcognitiveimpairment[72-74].Aclinicalstudyofnewlydiagnosed AD a standardizedextractof Bacopamonnieri (Bacognize \u00ae)300mgtwicedaily forsixmonthsimprovedtheirqualityoflife,enhancedtheirmemorypower,and reducedtheirirritabilityandinsomnia,and some even in their familybehavior (Table 1) [74].12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicineIt has been demonstrated that the natural product for- mula containing B. monnieri efectively increased mini- mental state examination (MMSE) scores in AD patients. A polyherbal compound's synergistic properties [43] 500mg over a 12-month period was efective inimproving cognitive skills in individuals with senile de-mentia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) when compared to thedonepezil-treated group. Diminished infammation andoxidative stress were indicated by dismutase,tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), the SDATpatients treated with the to group(Table 1).Tese resultsshowed aprotective efect of the testformulation in managing cognitive decline associated with the aging process [43]. A prior in vivostudy showed that bacoside A encapsulation with nanoparticles might be a potential strategy to facilitate BBB penetration, thus en-hancing therapeutic efcacy while treating neurodegenera-tive diseases. Terefore, B. monnieri may be a plausible therapeutic agent to enhance cognitive function in ADpatients via a nanotechnological approach [42, 75]. 2.8.Ginseng. Ginsengisawell-knownherbalremedythatis widely used in traditional restorative, and antiaging agent [76]. Ginsenosides are themain bioactive are also polysaccharides, triterpenoids, and favonoids [77, 78]. Free radicals and oxidative stress may have a role in thedevelopmentoffatigueinpeoplewithMS[79,80].Ginseng'santifatigue properties could be attributed to its antioxidantproperties and ability to control GABAergicneurotransmissions [81]. Etemadifar et al. [37] conducted a pilot study to assess the efcacy and safety of ginseng in the treatment of fatiguein MS patients and found that the ginseng supplement waswell tolerated with no signifcant adverse events after threemonths of daily administration of 500mg of ginseng. Te results showed that when ginseng was used instead of a placebo, the mean scores for the fatigue impact scale(MFIS) \"physical\" subscale improved signifcantly(p0.046) [37]. Furthermore, as compared to the placebo group, most of the scores for the individual domains of theMultiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQOL-54),includingphysicalhealth,emotionalwell-being,energy,cognitive function, health distress, and quality of life, weresignifcantly higher in the ginseng-treated group [37].However, a human trial conducted by Kim et al. on thetreatment of fatigue in 47 MS patients with progressively increasingdosesofginsengovera6-weekperiodfounditto be safe but inefective. Tis could be related to the study'sshortdurationandtheseverityandstagesofthedisease[82].Terefore, future clinical trials should be conducted overa considerable period of time to determine the efcacy ofginseng at various stages of the disease.2.9. Cannabis. Cannabis plants are native to Central Asia that are grown all over the world [83]. D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactivecomponent of cannabis, but other derivatives may havemedicinal or synergistic properties. Te most promising ofthese is cannabidiol (CBD), which is nonpsychoactive and mayregulateTHC'sintoxicationand/ormemoryefects.For its intoxicating qualities, high quantities of THC are pre-ferred in the illegal market [83]. Terefore, standardizedwhole [84]. Inhalation and vaping are themostcommonwaystoconsumecannabis.Cannabinoidsarerapidly absorbed into the bloodstream in this manner, withpeak plasma THC concentrations reaching within minutes.Oralcannabisabsorptionandmetabolismareunpredictable,and plasma concentrations are often sustained for longerperiods of time (8-20hours), resulting in inconsistent psychotropic efects [83]. With low degrees of intoxication, single case-crossover studies have shown that these CBMEs have the ability to diminish symptoms such as spasticity, pain, and spasms, inpatients with MS [85]. Wade et al. conducted a trial usinga whole plant extract including equal quantities (120mg) ofTHC and CBD gave in a pump-action spray for the relief ofMS symptoms. To mask thetaste and appearance of CBME,all preparations included peppermint favouring and col-ouring. Patients on an active treatment whose primarycomplaint was spasticity exhibited a substantial reduction(p0.001) in contrast to placebo at the end of the study duration of six weeks. Patients with stable MS were givenatwo-weekdosetitrationphasefrom5mgtoamaximumof25mgoftetrahydrocannabinoldaily,followedbyaten-weekmaintenance phase, according to Zajicek et al. [38]. After12weeks, the rate of relief from muscle stifness was nearlytwice as high with cannabis extract (CE) compared withplace(Table1).Evenifthemedicaluseofcannabisisclearlybenefcial,itisimportanttobeattentiveinordertodiscoverthe potential for harm, particularly in relation to inhaledtobacco [83]. 2.10. Future Prospects for Natural Product Clinical Research against Neuroimmune Diseases. Many factors should be consideredinordertoattainexpectedresultsfromanaturalproductclinicaltrial.Tefndingsofnaturalproductclinicaltrials will be infuenced by factors such as dose range, with theleast amount of side efects [87]. Acceptability of favour, texture, and/or ease of swallowing capsules or tablets is critical for the participant's adherence to the study [88].Future research should look into the mechanisms that ex-plain why some people beneft from natural products whileothersdonotsothattreatmentcanbemoreusefulandcost-efectively targeted can im- prove bioavailability by increasing the rate of delivery andthe ability to traverse lipid-rich biomembranes [89].Phospholipid-based drug-delivery systems have beendemonstrated to in the delivery of herbaldrugs[90].Bioenhancerssuchas Piperlongum,black pepper (Piper nigrum), long pepper (P. longum), and ginger (Zingiber ofcinale) are drug facilitators that enhance the activity of drug molecules which can be used in clinicalstudiestoincreasedrugbioavailabilityacrossthemembrane[91, 92]. Nanocarriers are being developed to overcomeunmet drug-delivery hurdles and enable cross BBB. Extra-cellular vesicles have recently emerged as a natural [93, 94]. Fur-thermore, gold nanoparticle-based drug-delivery systemsarealsocapableofreachingthecentralnervoussystem[87]. Itisworthnotingthatdrug-deliverynanoparticlescaneither stimulate or inhibit the immune response, and they canreside in the body, so researchers must design appropriatenanodrugs, modify them according to disease characteris-tics, and conduct extensive immunotoxicology researchbefore moving forward with clinical trials [95]. Naturalproduct extracts may have a high concentration of con-stituents, and the combination of various active ingredientsin extracts can provide synergistic efects, resulting in im-proved antioxidant and disease-modifying action [96, 97].Identifying the compounds responsible for a particular bi- ological action is challenging. For fnding constituents that engage in synergistic efects, metabolomics and bio-chemometric methods are synergistic mechanisms of actionshould be investigated [99]. Strategies to improve the out-come of natural product clinical studies are summarised inFigure3.However, this reviewonly focusedonSouth Asiannatural products, and due the discrepancies in clinicalevaluation batteries/criteria in reviewed articles, we couldnot conduct a meta-analysis. We acknowledge this asa limitation in our study. 3.Conclusions Positive results of clinical studies of natural products and gallate (EGCG), neuroimmune diseases, amply prove that they havetherapeuticpotential.Oneofthechallengesthatremainwiththeir use is to maintain the stability of the unstable activeingredients of these natural products until they reach thetargetsite.Inadequatedosages,pooraqueoussolubility,andinadequate oral absorption via the oral route due tometabolism in the gastrointestinal tract and the inability tocross the BBB are the main considerations for natural productsinclinicalstudies.Terefore,itisveryimportantto evaluate the kinetic and physicochemical properties to de-velopsuchdrugsandtheirdeliverysystems.Teimportanceof multitarget combination therapies and the concept ofsynergyinthepolyherbalformulationhaverisentothefore.Futureresearchshouldfocusonidentifyingthecombinationof efects within complex mixtures, assuring a favourableoutcome in natural product clinical studies. Chemicalmodifcation and encapsulation into nanoparticles mayboost their efcacy and curtail systemic toxicity. Futurestudies are required to determine the correct techniques for natural products and their nanoformulations to convert them into probable drug candidates to treat neuroimmunediseases. Te development of such nutraceuticals may pavethe way toward novel therapeutic strategies to mitigatechronic neuroinfammation and overcome neuroimmunedisorders.
