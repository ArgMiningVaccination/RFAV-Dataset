If you test positive for COVID -19, contact your doctor or a test-to-treat site immediately to seek treatment . Treatments work best when started right after symptoms begin. Stay Home if You're Sick! It's crucial to stay home if you are feeling ill. Avoid close contact with others to protect them and take the time you need to heal. This is especially important for respiratory viruses like the flu, RSV and COVID -19, which can lead to more severe illness. Wear a Mask There is no vaccine for RSV, so wearing a mask can significantly slow the spread and protect babies and young children who do not yet have immunity and are too young to wear a mask themselves. Wearing a mask in indoor public places is a good way to limit the spread of germs. Wash Your Hands Your mom was right: Frequent handwashing, with soap and warm water -for at least 20 seconds, is an easy way to prevent getting sick and spreading germs. Cover Your Cough or Sneeze Remember to cough or sneeze into your elbow, your arm, or a disposable tissue to help prevent the spread of winter viruses. J ustmake sure to wash your hands or sanitize and dispose of your tissue after.The White House Fact Sheet 13 Biden Administration Announcement_11.22.22 RECENT TOPICS & RESOURCESBIWEEKLY BRIEFINGS Biweekly briefings provide partners with the top COVID -19 vaccine mis/dis topics and trends, and invitees receive a copy of the report post -briefing.

Sample survey question and response: \"COVID -19 Therapeutics like Paxlovid can cause a rebound\" Response Vaccinated RespondentsUnvaccinated Respondents Agree 50% 56% Disagree Patient Concerns Regarding Paxlovid Rebound Patient: \"Rebound is caused by treatments and is really common.\" Provider: \"Rebound has been in the news a lot! Something that most people don't realize is that rebound happens in people who don't take treatments as well as those who do. It does happen somewhat more frequently among people taking Paxlovid. For some people, taking Paxlovid will help you test negative sooner. But for some, the symptoms may return. The good news is that if yours do return, they tend to be mild & do not require repeating the treatment.\" Steps Healthcare providers should use other approved or authorized products that are expected to retain activity against BQ.1 and BQ.1.1. Treatment is indicated for patients with positive results of direct SARS -CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid is authorized for the treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) Remdesivir is approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg) Molnupiravir ,for whom alternative COVID -19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate.

Tecovirimat can be extended on a day -by-day basis beyond the standard 14 -day course Therapeutics, including cidofovir, brincidofovir , and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV), can be administered concurrently with tecovirimat for certain patients with --or at high risk for --severe mpoxManagement Considerations 101Counsel patients about the critical importance of taking oral tecovirimat with fatty meals to: oEnsure adequate levels of the drug oInadequate serum levels could promote resistance Vaccination with JYNNEOS remains an important tool to prevent mpox in at-risk patients.
