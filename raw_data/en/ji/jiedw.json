I highly recommend Dr. Julie to anyone who wants to truly feel better. She is the first doctor to listen to what I had to say. I had been sick for at least a year, stressed out beyond measure, and really struggling with flat out exhaustion. I could barely function and was losing my mind. I was sick and tired of being told nothing was wrong with me. I went on a search and found Dr. Julie. It only took one test and two visits for Dr. Julie to figure out the problem. Thanks to her expert advice and treatment I am back on my feet feeling better than ever. My son struggles with feeling utterly overwhelmed when facing daily tasks, he's often inexplicably sad and at times explosively angry. Having worked with many different doctors for my son, Dr. Van Vleet stands apart in conveying genuine care, full and ready engagement and the sense she really knows what she's talking about. Dr. Castle artfully blends her diagnostic abilities and keen clinical awareness while providing a safe and comfortable environment for her patients. The generosity of her heart shines in her eyes as she shares the depth of her experience with you. It is a joy to have someone as gifted as Dr. Castle share her expertise. Stacy is awesome! Working with Stacy was life-changing. I was overweight and facing long-term health concerns and thought I'd tried everything. She taught me about how food is important to my body in ways I could understand and use and she held me accountable. Stacy really cared about my goals and never gave up. I lost over 40 pounds in a manageable and sustainable way! I eat normal food, have energy, and enjoy the best of my life in balance. "}
