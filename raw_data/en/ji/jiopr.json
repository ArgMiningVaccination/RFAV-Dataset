November 2008 iv Executive Summary Arthritis is the most common cause of severe chronic pain and disability in Canada, and currently affects about four million Canadians (aged > 15 years). From the patient's perspective, the most important goals of arthritis treatment are to control pain, limit functional debility and maintain a normal life. There is mounting evidence that patients with arthritis benefit from a combination of pharmacological and non-drug treat ments; however, the literature also suggests that many people with arthritis do not receive effective treatments in a timely manner. Our ultimate goal was to use the available information to develop interventions for improving arthritis care and health service delivery. Specific objectives of this project are to: 1. Understand the decision-making process in seeking help for osteoarthritis (OA) and inflammatory arthritis 2. Identify gaps in the literature pertaining to patients' help-seeking 3. Synthesize information about individual, social and cultural determinants associated with help-seeking among people with arthritis (ongoing) 4. Propose interventions to overcome barriers and facilitate access to appropriate treatment and information (ongoing) We conducted a scoping review to identify the literature related to help-seeking in arthritis. Eligible articles were mapped onto three areas: (1.) type of arthritis, (2.) type of information/treatment sought by participants, a nd (3.) study design. Areas where questions can be developed for further quantitative or qualitative systematic reviews were identified. The initial literature search yielded 31,146 articles; of those, 301 passed the title and abstract screening. After the detailed review, 120 papers remained eligible. The majority of the papers address help-seeking primarily in rheumatoid arthritis (RA; N = 48), OA (N = 30), and general arthritis (N = 28). Only eight papers involved other types of conditions: ankylosing spondylitis (N = 3), lupus (N = 4) and Lyme disease (N = 1). Six papers were categorized as other because the type of arthritis was not clearly specified. Our analysis identified four broad themes of research on help-seeking in people with arthritis: 1.) seeking diagnosis, 2.) seeking traditional treatments and health professional visits, 3.) seeking complementary and alternative therapies and 4.) Seeking arthritis-related information. This scoping review has identified seven areas where further research synthesis is possible: 1. Factors affecting the decision to seek help for early arthritis symptoms (a meta-synthesis) 2. The experience of psychosocial distress in people with arthritis (a meta-synthesis) 3. Does inequity exist in health service utilization by people with RA? (a meta-analysis) 4. The decision to use medication for arthritis (a meta-synthesis) 5. Factors associated with the use of medication for arthritis (a quantitative review) 6. Decisions regarding total joint replacement surgery (a meta-synthesis) 7. Decisions to use complementary and alternative therapies (a meta-synthesis) CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 1Chapter 1: Introduction Arthritis is the most common cause of severe long-term pain and disability in Canada.1;2 About four million Canadians currently have arthritis and the number has been projected to be six million by 2026. 2 Patients often need a combination of pharmacological and non-drug treatments over the course of the disease. For example, in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), early treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can prevent irreversible joint damage. However, despite the evidence of DMARDs' effectiveness, only about half of people with RA reported having used one over a five-year period. 3;4 The situation is similar for osteoarthritis (OA). Although physical activity and weight management are recommended as the first-line treatment for OA, 5-9 only about one in four patients were physically active or received weight-management interventions.10 A patient's decision about a treatment is a complex process and is influenced by a multitude of factors. In the current study, we review the literature on factors that influence people's help- seeking behaviour. We conceptualize help-seeking as the process through which people decide if, when and how they will use health services as a part of the overall illness-management strategy within the context of the health care system and their daily lives. It encompasses the practice of information-seeking from health professionals or other informal sources (e.g., friends, family, Internet) and treatment-seeking from health professionals or other sources (e.g., over-the- counter therapies).11 Scope of the Project and Objectives This report describes a systematic review of the literature on help-seeking in people with arthritis. Our ultimate goal was to use the information to develop interventions for improving arthritis care and health service delivery. CIHR approved the research grant in March 2007 and funding was in place by April 2007. The literature search and review commenced soon after. The specific objectives of the review were to: 1. Understand the decision-making process in seeking help for OA and inflammatory arthritis such as RA 2. Identify gaps in the literature pertaining to patients' help-seeking 3. Synthesize information about individual, social and cultural determinants associated with help-seeking among people with arthritis 4. Propose interventions to overcome barriers and facilitate access to appropriate treatment and information The results of Objectives 1 and 2, and the ongoing activities related to Objective 4, are described in this report. Data analysis for Objective 3 is underway and is expected to be completed in September 2009. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 2 Chapter 2: Background Which treatments are effective for people with arthritis? From the patient's perspective, the most important goals of arthritis treatment are to control pain,12-14 limit functional disability and maintain a normal life.15 There is mounting evidence that patients with arthritis benefit from a combination of pharmacological and non-drug treatments. In OA, the most common form of arthritis (affecting 10% of the population), therapeutic exercises, education programs, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, weight management and non-opioid analgesics are recommended for those with mild symptoms. 16-19 If patients are unresponsive to this treatment regimen, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in addition to non-drug therapy is appropr iate. Judicious use of intra-articular steroid injections is also effective in patients with symptomatic effusion. 16;17 For late-stage OA in hips or knees, there is solid evidence supporting the use of total joint replacement surgeries.16;20-22 In RA, a form of inflammatory arthritis aff ecting about 1% of the population, early use of DMARDs can prevent irreversible joint damage, especially if they are used in the first two years. 23;24 Among patients who have failed to respond to DMARDs, biologic therapies have been associated with significant improvement in disease activity.25;26 Further, education programs are effective in increasing patients' confidence in self-care,27-29 while exercise and physical modalities (e.g., TENS and laser) can be used for short-term pain control.30 In other types of inflammatory arthritis, including spondyloarthropathies, current evidence also supports early medical treatment with adjuncts of exercise and education. 31 Are people with arthritis using appropriate treatment? Many patients with arthritis did not receive effective and timely treatments. In 2002, the USA's Arthritis Foundation developed 22 indicators to assess the quality of care in OA.32-34 When the indicators were applied to a community-based OA population in Ontario, only about 60% of patients had appropriately used acetaminophen for pain, 40% had tried exercise and 23% had participated in education programs. 35 Also, fewer than 15% of people with severe arthritis were \"definitely willing\" to undergo total joint repl acement surgeries despite the focus on wait list management.36 Other research has reported patients using treatments that are ineffective or lack scientific evidence. For example, about 32% of patients had tried massage, 28% homeopathic/herbal remedies, 10% magnets and 7% reflexology, 13 none of which have demonstrated effectiveness in treating arthritis. The situation is similar with RA. Only 43% and 35% of the RA population in British Columbia (BC) report having used a DMARD over a 5-year and 2-year period, respectively. 3 In Ontario, 58% of the RA population had used DMARDs.4 Further, only about 30% participated in a health-professional-supervised exercise program.13;37 Overall, the use of treatment by people with arthritis is far from adequate. What is known about factors relating to he lp-seeking in people with arthritis? Individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education), social factors and cultural background, as well as knowledge and perception about a treatment and health status can influence CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 3information- and treatment-seeking behaviours. Research on OA management has consistently shown that the use of pain medication improves in individuals who are older, are female,38;39 have a higher perceived health state40 and understand the drug's purpose.41 Having a higher number of co-morbid conditions interferes with the use of pain medications, as do concerns about addiction and denial of the disease and pain. 42 Perceptions of pain and disease status also affect an individual's decisions about joint replacement surgeries.43 The use of mainstream non- drug treatment is generally associated with a higher level of disability and a higher income.44 As well, people with RA tend to use more non-drug treatment than people with OA.45 Finally, analyses from our recent survey suggest an a ssociation between individuals' perceptions of effectiveness and use of a non-drug treatment, regardless of the available evidence about the treatment. 13 Another factor is the lack of an integrated system for arthritis care, which we conceptualize as a continuum from the person's awareness of their symptoms and initial access to health professionals to the appropriate diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and self-management. Arthritis management has been haphazard at the primary care level, with wide variations in prescriptions and referrals to specialists and rehabilitation services. 46;47 For example, in BC only 48% and 34% of the RA population saw a rheumatologist at 5 and 2 years after diagnosis, respectively.3 The use of physiotherapy services was also low (46%),3 given the known effects of RA on mobility and function. A lack of overall coordination in arthritis care may pose a barrier for patients in recognizing the need to seek appropriate treatments. Yet another factor relates to challenges in identifying early arthritis. Current diagnostic criteria for OA rely on x-ray findings, but the concordance between joint symptoms and radiographic findings is poor. 48 A recent population-based study using MRI suggested that 55% of people with knee pain had OA that was not evident on x-rays.49 Uncertainties in the diagnosis of early OA might lead people to think that no treatment is required at that stage. Misinformation, such as considering mild OA as a part of normal ageing, also contributes to delays in seeking treatment. 43 Finally, an inadequate supply of qualified hea lth professionals can hinder people's decisions about help-seeking. The Canadian Rheumatology Association recommended one rheumatologist per 70,000 Canadians, which translates as 500 rheumatologists. 50 However, there are currently only 329 rheumatologists in Canada, with most practising in urban regions.51 Orthopaedic surgeons are also in short supply.52 Further, only about 450 physiotherapists work in rheumatology, and most of those practise in Ontario and BC.53 People may not be accessing appropriate treatment because of maldistribution or lack of services. What would this review add to the current provincial chronic care initiatives? To our knowledge, this research synthesis project was the first to summarize the individual, social and cultural determinants of help-seeking behaviours in arthritis. Current chronic care initiatives, including arthritis care, focus mainly on waiting list management, 54 evidence-based practice in primary and specialty care,55;56 expanded roles for allied health professionals57-61 and self-management62 by targeting health-system and professional-related factors. By including social and behavioural sciences literature, we synthesized determinants beyond the scope of clinical and health service research. This would allow health care administrators, policy makers CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 4and researchers to incorporate relevant determinants in the planning of service delivery models and complementary resources (e.g., transportation, information technologies, exercise facilities), leading to the development of a patient-centred strategy for arthritis care. Further, consumer groups would be able to use the knowledge to develop strategies for sharing evidence-based information about arthritis management with other patients and the public. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 5Chapter 3: Methods Search Strategy We conducted a systematic review of the health, behavioural and social sciences literature on determinants of people's used Medline, CINHAL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO and SocioFile to search papers published between 1981 and 2007 that addressed patient decision-making of the included treatment s. We expect that pre-1981 information about determinants is likely to be out of date. Papers written in languages other than English were included. We also examined reference lists of retrieved articles and periodically searched the databases after the initial search to identify additional articles. The list of search terms was developed in consultation with a senior librarian with extensive experience in Cochrane systematic reviews (M. Doyle-Waters). The search strings for Medline ( Appendix 1 ) were adapted for other databases. Scoping Review: Article Selection To identify areas where primary studies on help-seeking in arthritis are available, we conducted a scoping review on the topic. Scoping reviews are considered to be the preliminary process that identifies areas of research where subsequent focused systematic reviews may be performed. 63 In this study, we used the scoping review to highlight the range of research in arthritis help-seeking and to identify gaps for future research. Eligible articles were original studies that describe or evaluate individual, social and cultural determinants associated with patients' seeking treatment or information for managing OA and inflammatory arthritis. The latter included RA, spondyloarthropathies (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis), connective lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Articles retrieved from the database search were first uploaded into Refworks, and then to Trialstat SRS4.0 for screening and review. The article selection involved a two-phase screen ing. In the first phase, two reviewers screened the title and abstract of each reference to identif y studies that met the eligibility criteria. Eight researchers and two research staff were involve d in this process. Any disagreements were discussed by the two reviewers. If the review ers could not resolve their disagreement, the reference was then discussed at the weekly Aches & Pains Review Team meeting. The second phase involved an in-depth review of the included articles. Because of the diverse backgrounds of the reviewers (six researchers and two research staff), there was considerable conflict in the pilot review. We subsequently had two meetings to discuss the disagreements and modify the criteria to improve clarity. In addition, the team agreed to assign three reviewers for each article. Articles that passed the screening stage were mapped into three areas: (1.) Type of arthritis (OA, RA, spondyloarthropathies, connective tissue disease, general arthritis), (2.) Type of information or intervention sought by participants (medication, surgery, allied health CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 6interventions, complementary and alternative therapies (CATs), disease-related information) and (3.) Study design (qualitative, quantitative). The mapping was initially conducted by one of the Co-Principal Investigators (LL) and was then presented to the Aches & Pains Review Team for further discussion. Data Extraction and Systematic Review (Ongoing) In the next six months, members of the Aches & Pains Review Team will complete specific systematic reviews identified from the mapping exercise. The information collected from quantitative systematic reviews will include: (1) type of arthritis, (2) type of treatment, (3) patient demographic characteristics and disease status and (4) determinants associated with the use (or non-use) of the treatment (Appendix 2: Sample data extraction form) . Due to the variation of interventions, participants and outcomes measures for evaluating help-seeking, we will develop a separate form to capture information for each quantitative review. We will test the form with a random sample of five papers. Disagreements in the extracted data will be resolved by discussion and, if consensus is not achieved, a third team member will break the tie. All eligible publications will be subjected to a full review by two team members. We will also conduct a meta-synthesis on the qualitative studies about people's explanatory frameworks for their illness and the relevance of this for decisions about help-seeking. 64 Sandelowski and Barroso65 describe meta-syntheses as interpretive and analytic processes by which findings of qualitative studies are aggregated, integrated and summarized. The aim of meta-synthesis is to create larger interpretive artifacts of all studies that examine a target domain (in this case, decision-making about help-seeking), while preserving the integrity and richness of findings in each individual study. Descriptive meta-synthesis involves the synthesis of qualitative findings in a comprehensive analysis of phenomena. 66;67 The review team will inductively develop codes for the analysis. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 7 Chapter 4: Results The search of electronic databases found 51,752 articles ( Figure 1 ), of which 20,607 were duplicates. From the remaining 31,146 unique articles, 30,845 articles were excluded; of those, 30,662 were not related to help-seeking, 84 were not related to arthritis and 99 were reviews, commentaries or letters. Of the 301 articles that passed for a detailed screening, 120 primary studies were identified as primary studies concerning help-seeking in arthritis. Figure 1: Literature search strategy Potentially relevant articles identified through Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, ERIC N = 51,752 Duplicates = 20,606 Title and Abstract Systematic Reviews N = 120Excluded = 30,845 -Not related to help-seeking (30,662) -Not related to arthritis (84)-No primary data (i.e. reviews, letters, editorials) (99) Excluded = 181 -Not related to help-seeking (176)-Arthritis not the primary diagnosis (5) Most of the papers included were published in 2006, and they came mainly from the US and the UK. We mapped the 120 articles by the type of arthritis, the type of treatment/intervention and CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November design ( Table 1 ). An annotated bibliography, organized according to the three domains, is presented in Appendix C .

After a detailed review of the articles in each group, we further organized them into four broad themes: 1. Seeking diagnosis: This theme focuses on patients' experiences with early joint symptoms and seeking a diagnosis. 2. Seeking traditional treatments and health professional visits: This theme focuses on the complexity involved in patients' decisions to use (or not use) a treatment or to consult (or not consult) a health professional. It also addresses the interplay among predisposing, enabling and needs factors associated with health services and treatment use. 3. Seeking complementary and alternative treatments (CAT) : This theme addresses the factors associated with the use of CAT and the underlying reasons for the decision. 4. Seeking information about arthritis : This theme concentrates on patients' search for information in order to make decisions about treatments, and on the factors associated with information-seeking. The following sections highlight the issues discussed under the four themes. Seeking diagnosis The majority of studies in this theme focus on patients' experiences with, and interpretations of, the early symptoms of RA, OA and other forms of arthritis. In 1982, Bury 68 published the first qualitative study about the illness experience of 30 patients with a new diagnosis of RA. He highlighted the process of people who attempted to explain away the early signs and symptoms, and only sought medical help when they were no longer able to cope. Individuals tended to link CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 9the initial symptoms with acute musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., fracture), repetitive strain injuries (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome) or normal ageing (e.g., 'wear and tear'). The process tended to be prolonged among those with mild, vague and non-disabling symptoms. 69 Later studies also described how people attempted to accommodate and cloak symptoms at home and at work during the early stage of illness in order to maintain their identity as a healthy person, both to themselves and to others. 68;70;71 This process of 'normalization of symptoms'72 sometimes led to a delay in seeking help from medical professionals. We found two studies that discussed the use of CAT prior to the diagnosis, although neither study directly explored the relationship between CAT use and the delay in help-seeking. A survey in Korea found that almost 95% of people with arthritis used at least one type of CAT before seeing a doctor. The median lag time between the initial symptoms and the first visit was eight weeks, which was longer than the four weeks estimated in an US study conducted around the same period. 73 The survey results were echoed by Candib's biographical study, which described her decision to seek massage therapy, glucosamine sulphate/chondroitin and over-the-counter pain medications for her neck, back and thumb pain years before she saw a family doctor for a diagnosis. The literature also highlighted the lengthy and frustrating experience of getting a diagnosis. We identified three sub-themes: 1.) the role of patient-physician communications,; 74 2.) the patient's perception of doctors' knowledge of rheumatologic conditions and early management75-77 and 3.) psychosocial and financial distresses.68;71;75;78 Patient-physician communications: In analysis of patients' narratives in a health-related website, Headland described examples of positive medical encounters in which physicians were sympathetic, supportive and resourceful. 74 Individuals who had these experiences appeared to be more likely to use the recommended treatments. However, those who did not feel that the physicians acknowledged their pain and functional limitations subsequently sought a second opinion or changed physicians. The patient's perception of doctors' knowledge about rheumatologic conditions and early management: This topic was addressed by studies in a variety of rheumatologic conditions. Powanda's biographical study recorded that his knee OA symptoms were overlooked for a period of 20 years by a number of physicians. 75 During that time, he received no recommendation about physical activity, weight management or pain control. Similar reports were also found in studies of early RA 68;76 and systematic lupus erythematosus.79 Psychosocial distresses : Research in this area focused on the experience of those with early inflammatory arthritis. Bury described the treme ndous anxiety of individuals trying to hide the emerging symptoms from family members and co-workers.80 Other research illustrated the impact of arthritis-related functional limitations on relationships and family dynamics. For example, two studies described how difficult it was for families of female patients, who used to be the carers, to accept their illnesses. 68;74;79 Younger patients often talked about their fear of the impact of arthritis on their physical appearance and their ability to engage in intimate relationships. 71;81 Finally, for those who had to stop working due to arthritis, financial hardship due to loss of income and increasing medical expense could be a significant source of stress.78 CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 10 Seeking traditional treatments and health professional visits The majority of primary studies on help-seeking address the individual's use of medications, non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercises, psychosocial and counselling), surgical interventions and health professional visits. We have identified two main areas of research: 1.) studies that explored specific factors associated with treatment and health service use and 2.) studies that addressed the complexity involved in patients' decisions to use a treatment or consult a health professional. Factors associated with the use of treatments and health services: Several surveys used the Andersen's model82;83 as the framework to explore factors associated with access to health care in RA.84-87 According to this model, access to health care depends on three types of factors. Predisposing factors refer to demographic and social structural characteristics such as age, sex and marital status. Enabling factors include resources such as income, health, insurance and costs of health services. Need factors represent the most immediate cause for health service use, which may include the patient's perception of the illness, symptoms, diagnosis and disability. In an earlier US study, Berkanovic et al. reported that need factors were the main driver for physician and physiotherapy visits, and the use of surgery; although predisposing factors and enabling factors were also responsible for the variability in the health service use. 84;85 While need factors accounted for 33% to 50% of the explained variance in physician visits by people with RA, 50% to 67% of the variance was attr ibutable to predisposing and enabling factors. 85 A later population-based survey in Iowa found that the use of physician care for RA was driven largely by need factors, although some variability in the usage pattern was observed between rural and urban regions. 86 Disparities were also found in a recent Dutch study on access to allied health services in those who were older and with lower education, and access to home care in those without health insurance. 87 These findings suggest that although health care utilization by patients with RA was mainly explained by needs, some inequity cannot be ruled out. Overall, the three categories of factors predicted 13% to 20% of the variance of seeking physician and allied health care. 84;85 We also found studies evaluating specific factors associated with patients' use of arthritis treatments and health services, including: 1.) patients' disease activity and symptoms; 88-90 2.) socioeconomic factors,91;92 3.) ethnic and cultural factors; 93-97 4.) involvement in their own health care;98;99 5.) perceived control of their action, attitude toward the intervention (e.g., perceived effectiveness and adverse events of the treatment), subjective norm and self-efficacy; 100-107 and 6.) good patient-clinician communications.104;108 Furthermore, patients' priorities should be taken into consideration in developing treatment and future research as their priorities may be different from those of health professionals and researchers. 109 Complexity in making decisions about the use of treatments and health services : For people with arthritis, making treatment decisions is a complex process of negotiating multiple factors, including balancing the pros and cons. Several studies described patients' ambivalence about taking medication for RA, lupus and OA. 110-114 On the one hand, people followed the recommendation because they believed that the medication would improve their quality of life CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 11and help them maintain a good relationship with the clinic staff; on the other hand, they worried about side effects. Patients' social and economic circumstances, their family support and the availability of community network played a role in patients' treatment decisions. 115 A number of studies also explore the use of joint replacement surgery. While surgery is a cost-effective treatment for severe OA, people sometimes expressed a preference to avoid surgery even if they were a candidate for the procedure. Several qualitative studies reported patients' misconceptions about the severity of pain one should experience before considering surgery, 96;116-118 with some feeling that they did not have sufficient pain for surgery even when their ability to function fully was severely compromised.116 A recent meta-synthesis has further explored the reasons for patients' decisions about hip and knee surgery based on 10 qualitative studies, 119 from which all the arthritis-related articles have been captured by the current review. Finally, patients welcome information about treatments. 120 While some may prefer to participate in group education sessions, others prefer to recei ve the information from health professionals on a one-to-one basis.121-123 Seeking complementary and alternative treatments (CAT) This theme consists of studies that were conducted around the world, including North America,88;93;104;115;124-141 Europe,69;108;142-146 Africa,147 Asia, 148-155 and Australia.156 The prevalence of reported CAT use ranged from 38% 142 to 84%;127 however, the case definitions vary greatly. For example, Chandola asked patients with arthritis who were seen at a rheumatology practice whether they had ever use any CAT, which was not specifically defined. 142 Cronan, however, asked patients with OA to report their use of 19 unprescribed remedies (including dietary supplements, behaviour al interventions and exercise, not prescribed by a health professional) within a six-month period.127 The lack of uniformity in the case definition makes it difficult to estimate the overall use of CAT by people with arthritis. A number of qualitative studies examined the reasons for people to use CAT. Some reasons were: 1.) perceived ineffectiveness of Western medicine for arthritis, 125 2.) perceived fewer side effects in CAT compared to Western medicine,130 3.) greater selection of interventions,126 4.) recommendation of a friend or relative125;148 and 5.) good working relationship with CAT practitioners.69;126 A few studies also explored the complex relationship between cultural beliefs and the use of CAT for arthritis management. Seeking information Information-seeking is a cross-cutting theme that addresses why and how individuals sought information about their arthritis diagnosis and/or treatments, and the type of information in which they were interested. Studies in this theme described information-seeking as a process that facilitated patients' decisions about seeking care. Five studies focused specifically on the use of the Internet for health information. 102;157-160 In a large population survey, Millard et al. found that those who were more skeptical about health care, or were dissatisfied or experienced problems with access to health care, reported being CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 12more likely to go to the Internet for arthritis-related information.158 In general, people sought information on the Web without discussing the information with their physicians.157 Areas for future systematic reviews This scoping review has identified seven areas where further research synthesis is possible. The decision is based on the number of articles on the specific topic. 1. Factors affecting the decision to seek help for early arthritis symptoms (a meta-synthesis) 2. The experience of psychosocial distress in people with arthritis (a meta-synthesis) 3. Does inequity exist in health service utili zation by patients with RA? (a meta-analysis) 4. Decision to use medication for arthritis (a meta-synthesis) 5. Factors associated with the use of medication for RA, OA and general arthritis (a quantitative review) 6. Decisions regarding total joint replacement surgery (a meta-synthesis) 7. Decisions to use complementary and alternative therapies (a meta-synthesis) In April 2009, the research team will meet with the patient and health decision maker collaborators to identify other possible topics for reviews. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 13 Chapter 5: Discussion and Knowledge Translation Activities This study is the first to synthesize the literature on help-seeking in patients with arthritis. One major observation of the scoping review is the large amount of literature that addresses help-seeking and the breadth of research in this field. Most studies focused on decisions on treatments and health services provided by physicians and allied health professionals for RA and OA. In contrast, very little research was found on other rheumatologic conditions. However, since different conditions, such as lupus and ankylos ing spondylitis, may pose different challenges in making decisions about treatments, further research is warranted. It should be noted that studies on factors associated with the use of health services and treatments only predict a small proportion of the variability in people's use of health services. This is not surprising because most of the surveys on health resource use covered only a limited number of factors. Although the Andersen model 82;83 addresses the major factors affecting people's access to health services, it does not address other important variables such as an individual's coping mechanism, self-efficacy or r eadiness to seek help, and nor does it address the complexity of the help-seeking process. Our ongoing synthesis of studies that address health inequity in the use of RA treatment will provide insight on how to improve research in this area. We anticipate that the seven review topics will provide a comprehensive view on the current knowledge on help-seeking in arthritis. The results will provide the foundation for further development of interventions to facilitate access to patient-centred arthritis care.

CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 14We continue to update collaborators and the public on the progress of the project by way of our electronic plain language summary* and newsletters. Our team is also working with Dr. Ann Cranney's Arthritis and Driving Safety research synthesis team at the Ottawa Health Research Institute to develop three joint workshops in Halifax, Toronto and Vancouver to disseminate the review results. We will invite other CIHR-funded research synthesis teams working on arthritis-related topics to join as partners in these events. Our goal is to streamline the knowledge translation activities that aim at people with arthritis, clinicians, professional associations, and other relevant stakeholders. Finally, input from our collaborators will be sought to develop additional knowledge translation activities. * Plain language summary References (1) Woolf AD, Akesson K.

Refid: 110721 Main message: Chronically ill people can make adaptations to their lifestyle, but may have moments when they feel helpless, such as when symptoms are severe or following surgery. Summary: The study used semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients with RA to describe the experience of onset and development of RA. The results highlighted the resources (cognitive and material) available to individuals, modes of explanation for pain and suffering, and factors that help explain variation in experience. Nyman, C. S. & Lutzen, K. (1999). Caring needs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nursing science quarterly, 12, 164-169. Refid: 125910 Main message : Interviews with people with RA revealed four predominant themes: seeking help, searching for meaning, uncertainty and fear of being disappointed. These four issues captured the complexities of the physical, emotional, social and existential experiences of the patients. Summary : Qualitative interviews were conducted in order to identify the caring needs specific to the human experience of having RA and undergoing acupuncture treatment. With the application of Watson's 10 Carative Factors, four themes related to the caring needs of patients with RA who sought acupuncture were identified. These patients have a strong tendency toward and need for seeking help. They are searching for meaning within the context of a chronic disease, and they are coping with the uncertainty and fear of being disappointed because of the chronic aspects of the disease. These needs affect and are affected by the physical, emotional, social and existential events of their lives. Awareness of them by the nurse-acupuncturist will allow him or her to be more aware of the caring needs of these patients. Sakalys, J. A. (1997). Illness behavior in rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis Care and Research, 10, 229-237. Refid: 126924 Main message : An interview study of women with RA showed that the illness is prolonged, diagnosis and treatment are confusing and dealing with RA causes personal and social stress. Summary : In this descriptive study, interview and medical records data from 50 female patients were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings revealed a high incidence of symptom normalization, self-treatment, symptom comparison and delays in diagnosis with multiple misdiagnoses and several physicians being consulted. Most participants reported a lack of validation from their health care providers about the initial symptoms, emotional distress and relief upon receiving an accura te diagnosis. Significant associations were CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 37found; for example, (1.) illness-related symptom attributions were associated with fewer physicians consulted and with less invalidation; (2.) life stress events were associated with fewer physicians consulted and with a faster diagnosis; and (3.) remissions were associated with time to diagnosis, the number of physicians consulted and the number of misdiagnoses. Skinner, N. (2001). Rheumatoid arthritis: CareManagement, 7, 4-5. Refid: 127427 Main message: Case managers and physicians should work with patients to manage RA for better and more comprehensive care of the patient. Summary : This study was a biographical narrative of one woman's experience with RA. The central theme of the paper was that \"case managers\" had a responsibility to work in partnership with physicians to promote patient education and determine appropriate treatment options. This would enable patients to have a high level of functioning and an enhanced quality of life. Van der Ende, A. G. (1997). Patient viewpoint: a reconstruction.

Summary : In this qualitative biographical paper, a 54 year-old man who was diagnosed with RA six years ago reflected on the importance of timely diagnosis, his experience and contact with other people with RA, psychosocial issues and the need for consumer-friendly health care. The author concluded that more research was required to develop ways to improve health care delivery for people with RA. Rheumatoid arthritis: Diagnosis - quantitative (N=1) Cho, K. J., Jang, S.

One factor that contributes to this lag time includes the use of unconventional medicine (Chinese herbal medicine) or non-prescribed medicine after symptom onset. Summary: The purpose of this study was to determine the factors responsible for delaying diagnosis and optimal management of RA in Korea. From the study sample of 98 patients, 51 patients consulted an orthopaedic surgeon, 19 patients consulted a Chinese herbal doctor and 16 patients consulted a pharmacist. In this study 59% of patients were diagnosed with RA by an orthopaedic surgeon, and 25% by a rheumatologist. Patients with RA in Korea lost twice as much time when consulting a medical doctor compared to patients with RA in the United States.

Medical Journal of Australia, 155, 268- 269. Refid: 120064 Main messages: Living with arthritis is difficult both physically and mentally. Different treatments produce different side e ffects. Emotional support is very important to help patients cope with both the disease and the side effects of treatments. Summary: This article is a narrative by a patient who has lived with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for over 20 years. The patient described the different treatment options she has tried both successfully and unsuccessfully to manage her arthritis. There is a discussion about the physical treatment options as well as the emotional and psychological treatment options to help with self-esteem and motivation issues. The need for emotional support is intense, but the patient often finds it difficult to seek out support because he or she is feeling low when the disease is at its most debilitating.

Summary: This study used qualitative interviews to explore patients' experiences in two different arthritis education groups to de velop an understanding of meaningful group experiences. Ten participants with RA or other inflammatory arthritis were recruited. Individual and focus group interviews provided descriptions of experiences. The results showed that arthritis education group experiences led to improved perceptions of an ability to cope with the chronic disease. The idea that the patient's process of change can lead to healthy behaviours and desired health outcomes was also discussed. Barlow, J. H., Cullen, L. A., & Rowe, I. F. (2002).

Some patients with RA prefer group interventions for learning about self-management and exercise. Summary: This mixed method design examined patients' preferences for interventions, as well as psychological well-being and self-efficacy. The results revealed that patients preferred education about the disease and its treatment, as well as emotional issues, to be delivered on a one-to-one basis by health professionals. Group interventions were the preferred format for self-management, exercise and relationship issues, wh ereas videos were thought to be useful for demonstrating the use of aids and showing how other families cope.

Summary: The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate how adults with chronic illnesses perceived their need to take medications during the course of their illness. The results demonstrated that participants struggled over changing their self-identify from that of a well person to someone who needed medical intervention. There was also a struggle over negotiations with health care providers about the use of medications. The authors concluded that patients experienced not only physical but also emotional side effects from medications. Chan, H. (2002).

Refid: 121384 Main message: In Hong Kong, patients' beliefs in Chinese and Western medicine, the cost of treatments and the effects of treatments are associated with treatment preferences and use. Chinese medicine is often used because a friend or relative recommends it and Western medicine is often used because a physician recommends it. Summary: This mixed method study examined the utilization pattern and reasons for patients with RA using Chinese and/or Western medicine. Most patients used Chinese medicine because it was recommended by a friend or relative, and most of those who used Western medicine were acting on the recommendations of physicians. Dyck, I. (1992).

Occupational therapy in a clinical setting was indentified as an important component in the management of her conditions. It showed how health care decisions were related to her life as a working-class immigrant woman. Garcia Popa-Lisseanu, M. G., Greisinger, A., Richardson, M., O'Malley, K. J., Janssen, N.

Summary: This study aimed to examine the factors that affect adherence to medical recommendations among ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged patients with RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Houston, Texas. The majority of participants reported experiencing difficulty in adhering to th eir treatment. Patients with SLE or RA reported similar barriers to adhering to treatment and to keeping appointments.

Factors influencing the beliefs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis regarding disease-modifying medication. Rheumatology, 43, 583-586. Refid: 122967 Main message: The complex belief systems of patients with RA about disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are informed by a wide variety of sources, including health care professionals, newspapers, magazines, self-help group newsletters, the Internet and television. Patients' views continue to evolve as they learn more about this type of medication. Summary: This study used semi-structured interviews, activity diaries and focus groups to examine the views about DMARDs among people with RA. Results showed that DMARDs were perceived as central to the management of RA , but there were strong concerns about potential long-term effects. Patients' judgements of effi cacy were influenced by the degree of symptom relief, occurrence of side effects and perception of alternative treatment options. Perception, reporting and tolerance of side effects differed widely among individuals. The authors concluded that understanding individuals' belief systems c ould facilitate the provision of appropriate information and support for making decisions about treatment use. Marshall, N. J., Wilson, G., Lapworth, K., & Kay, L. J. (2004). Patients' perceptions of treatment with anti-TNF therapy for rheumatoid qualitative study. November 2008 41 In general, patients' experience of anti-TNF therapy was positive, particularly in terms of physical function and well-being, but some patients felt that it did not live up to their expectations. Summary : In this study, separate focus groups were conducted for patients treated with infliximab and etanercept in an effort to explore patients' experience of and views about the treatments. Five main themes were identified: patients' expectations of the effectiveness of treatments, their actual experience of the treatment and its effects, their concerns about taking a new class of drug, their views about the BSR Biol ogics Registry process and costs. The results indicated that patients' experience of anti-TNF therapy was good, particularly in terms of physical function and well-being, although it did not live up to the very high expectations of some patients. While the BSR BR process caused initial apprehension, patients had personal and altruistic reasons for being happy to comply with monitoring requirements. Van der Ende, A. G. (1997).

Refid: 121027 Main messages: The use of influenza vaccine in patients with RA taking MTX is suboptimal. The reasons for this include patient concerns over side effects and beliefs about vaccine inefficacy, and the fact that the patients are not being offered the vaccine. Summary: This quantitative study looked at the factors that influenced the uptake of the influenza vaccine in RA patients. Awareness of vaccination by patients who had received it came most commonly from family doctors or nurses. Advice about immunization mainly came from primary care, with little contribution from secondary care. The most common reasons for non-uptake of vaccination were patients not being offered the vaccine and not realizing they needed it, concerns about side effects and beliefs about vaccine inefficacy.

Summary: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of rheumatic diseases in a suburban community in Mexico City. The burden of illness and help-seeking behaviour of patients with rheumatic diseases were also examined. The results indicated that 419 participants (17%) had reported pain in the last seven days due to musculoskeletal disorders and 13% of the total sample had experienced some form of treatment. Cho, K.

Refid: 122695 Main message: Among the adverse events associated with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), patients ranked surgery, hospitalization, and prophylaxis-induced diarrhea as the least desirable gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Summary: This pilot study examined the preferences for avoiding adverse events that were associated with NSAID use. The results suggested that participants placed a high value on avoiding surgery, hospitalization, prophylaxis-induced diarrhea and uncomplicated ulcers. The avoidance of ulcer symptoms and the inconvenience of taking an additional medication for preventing GI complications four times daily appeared to be less important to these patients.

Summary : A questionnaire survey was conducted among patients with RA in order to evaluate whether those in need of care actually received it. Health care use was assessed for medical care, allied health services, psychosocial counselling and home care. The results indicated that most patients received the care they needed. However, disease-related factors including age, sex and living situation were found to be predictive of the use of health services. Kahn, K. L., MacLean, C. H., Liu, H., Rubenstein, L. Z., Wong, A.

Summary : This prospective cohort study of 568 RA patients used observational data from telephone interviews to study health status, comorbidity, use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, visits to care providers, provider types, encounter settings and the discontinuity between patients and providers. The results indi cated that during a 12-month period patients on average saw three to four health care providers in the outpatient setting.

Summary : A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed using the database from a large observational cohort of RA patients. Among 3,815 RA patients 34.6% used at least one type of CAM. Health foods, including dietary supplements, were the most commonly used CAM. CAM was more frequently used by female patients. Se x and degree of satisfaction with DMARDs were significant independent predictive factors for CAM use. Vetter, N. J., Charny, M., Lewis, P. A., & Farrow, S. (1990).

Summary : This survey involved a random sample of 712 people aged 65 years and over in the UK. Symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism were very common, more so in women than in men, and were associated with marked degrees of disability and some dependency. While most respondents regarded their general practitioner as the best person to treat such symptoms, many had not reported them to any health service personnel, but had chosen instead to treat them themselves, suggesting a degree of skepticism about the effectiveness of professional treatment.

Arthritis & Rheumatism, 56, 2135-2142. Refid: 129007 Main messages : There is a substantial discrepancy between patients' satisfaction with therapy and RA disease activity and functional status. Fear of losing control of one's health and f ear of side effects are major concerns of people with RA. Maintaining the current status, rather than aiming for future improvement, appears to be a higher priority for patients. Summary : In this study, a questionnaire was administered to 6,135 people with RA. The results showed that 63.8% of the patients would not want to change their treatment as long as their condition did not deteriorate, 77.3% were satis fied with their medications and 9.4% were dissatisfied. These assessments were weakly related to RA activity and functional status. Predictors of unwillingness to change therapy were satisfaction with RA control, risk of side effects, physician opinion, fear of loss of control, lack of better medications, and costs. There was little difference in results between patients who were receiving biologic agents and those who were not.

Emotional support is very important to help patients cope with both the disease and the side effects of treatments. Summary: This article is a narrative by a patient who has lived with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for over 20 years. The patient described the different treatment options she has tried both successfully and unsuccessfully to manage her arthritis. There is a discussion about the physical treatment options as well as the emotional and psychological treatment options to help with self-esteem and motivation issues. The need for emotional support is intense, but the patient often finds it difficult to seek out support because he or she is feeling low when the disease is at its most debilitating.

Summary : This qualitative study interviewed 15 patients with RA about their experience in managing fatigue. Participants described two type s of fatigue: severe weariness and dramatic overwhelming fatigue. RA fatigue was found to be extreme, unfounded and non-resolving. Participants described the physical, cognitive and emotional impact of feeling fatigued, and the effects on relationships and participation in social and family roles. They attributed fatigue to the inflammatory process, overuse of the joints and unrefreshing sleep. Participants used self- management strategies but with limited success. Most did not discuss fatigue with clinicians but when they did, they felt it was dismissed. Some participants held negative views on the management of fatigue due to limited success with their self-management strategies and limited guidance from health professionals, and a resulting perceived lack of control over their fatigue.

The purposive sample consisted of six Caucasian women living in West Virginia. The results showed six emerging themes: grieving, understanding RA symptoms, the importance of resilience, confronting negative feelings, understanding how to use the health care system and gaining new perspectives on life. The quality of nursing care can be improved by providing personalized, holistic and humanistic care, which can ultimately contribute to an improved quality of life for the patient. Nyman, C.

Summary : Qualitative interviews were conducted in order to identify the caring needs specific to the human experience of having RA and undergoing acupuncture treatment. With the application of Watson's 10 Carative Factors, four themes related to the caring needs of patients with RA who sought acupuncture were identified. These patients have a strong tendency toward and need for seeking help. They are searching for meaning within the context of a chronic disease, and they are coping with the uncertainty and fear of being disappointed because of the chronic aspects of the disease. These needs affect and are affected by the physical, emotional, social and existential events of their lives. Awareness of them by the nurse-acupuncturist will allow him or her to be more aware of the caring needs of these patients. Sakalys, J. A. (1997). Illness behavior in rheumatoid arthritis.

Summary : In this descriptive study, interview and medical records data from 50 female patients were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings revealed a high incidence of symptom normalization, self-treatment, symptom comparison and delays in diagnosis with multiple misdiagnoses and several physicians being consulted. Most participants reported a lack of validation from their health care providers about the initial symptoms, emotional distress and relief upon receiving an accura te diagnosis. Significant associations were found; for example, (1.) illness-related symptom attributions were associated with fewer physicians consulted and with less invalidation; (2.) life stress events were associated with fewer physicians consulted and with a faster diagnosis; and (3.) remissions were associated with time CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 48to diagnosis, the physicians consulted and the number of misdiagnoses.

The results demonstrated that predisposing and enabling factors accounted for 50-67% of the explained variance in the three types of visits, while need accounted only for 33-50%. These results showed the need for further studies on the factors that influence both RA patients' decisions to seek care and physicians' decisions to request further visits.

The study examined individual variables, including sex, age, disease duration and disease severity, and their relationships to patients' choices. The issues rated most important by patients included communicating with the doctor; understanding their medication; dealing with their pain; and the effects of arthritis on their energy level, their participation at work and their future. Most patients preferred to seek help from their physicians, although many were willing to attend groups or see non-physician counsellors for individual counselling. Cardiel, M. H. & Rojas-Serrano, J.

Summary: The purpose of this CDC report was to estimate the prevalence of people with chronic joint symptoms who did not see a health care provider in 2001. The results indicated that one-fifth of the estimated population had never seen a health care provider for joint pain problems. Several factors contribute to these findings. For example, many patients have comorbidities that were more severe or life-threatening then their joint symptoms and so they might pay less attention to the latter. Also, some patients perceived arthritis as being part of the normal aging process and so felt that treatment was neither necessary nor beneficial. Cho, K. J., Jang, S. H., Lee, S. K., & Doh, W. S.

Summary: The purpose of this study was to determine the factors responsible for delaying diagnosis and optimal management of RA in Korea. From the study sample of 98 patients, 51 patients consulted an orthopaedic surgeon, 19 patients consulted a Chinese herbal doctor and 16 patients consulted a pharmacist. In this study 59% of patients were diagnosed with RA by an orthopaedic surgeon, and 25% by a rheumatologist.

Had the helpline not been available, 60% of the patients would have made an appointment with their GP. The helpline produced a cost saving to the National Health Service, largely due to the GP consultations avoided. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 51 Jacobi, C.

Most help given at home was provided by informal caregivers such as friends and family of the patient. The amount of help received from informal caregivers is largely explained by the patient's physical condition and marital status, the sex of the caregiver, the patient's expectations of their ability to cope with RA and the age of the patient. The amount of help received from health professionals is related primarily to the marital status and physical condition of the patient. Saag, K. G., Doebbeling, B. N., Rohrer, J.

Summary : A population-based telephone interview survey was conducted on a random sample of 488 adults aged 65 or older with self-reported ar thritis, with about half the sample from urban communities and half from rural communities. The results indicated that urban respondents were more commonly reported as having received a diagnosis of osteoarthritis from their physicians but being less likely to report RA. A greater pr oportion of urban versus rural respondents had seen a physician for their arthritis and had seen an orthopaedist or general internist more often. Some factors were significantly associated with pr ior rheumatologist use; for example, diagnosis of RA, being younger, living with someone, having a higher income and being further from an arthritis care provider.

Summary: In this study, a questionnaire was administered to 52 ambulatory patients (44 women CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 54and 8 men) with rheumatoid arthritis. The questionnaire involved four areas: general data, patients' interest for information concerning RA, popular concepts, and functional consequences of RA. A high interest was shown for knowing more about the disease, the main source of information was newspapers, and the most important items were diet and physical exercise. Medical information was received only by exception. Patients did not agree with the possibility of a cure, they did not believe the disease was contagious, and they did not believe that it occurred in children. Patients were instead convinced of a cause-effect relationship in which RA was caused by cold and temperature changes. They also believed that the disease can be controlled, believed in the concept of arthritis as a group of different diseases, and believed that it was possible to lead an active life despite the disease. Having an interest in knowing more about the disease was clearly related to better functioning and a higher schooling degree. *This article is in Spanish Chan, H. (2002).

Refid: 114120 Main message : Patients with OA and RA would use unconventional therapies (UT) to relieve pain. The source of information about UT is important, but cost is not. Summary : Focus groups of randomly selected patients with arthritis, four groups of RA patients and one group of OA patients, each containing 20-30 people, were conducted to discuss their beliefs about arthritis and UT. All the participants believed arthritis to be incurable by conventional regimens or UT. Over half the participants had used UT to relieve pain despite the cost. Patients trusted information about UT from fa mily, friends and others with arthritis, but not information from supermarket tabloids or television commercials. Most discussed UT use with their physician, primarily to prevent interactions with prescribed treatments. Physicians' reactions ranged from ridicule to giving permission to continue using UT. Rose, G. (2006). Why do patients with rheumatoid arthritis use complementary therapies? Musculoskeletal Care, 4, 101-115. Refid: 126798 Main message : Compared to conventional treatments, complementary therapy (CT) is perceived to have fewer adverse reactions, provide greater se lections, provide psychological comfort and provide good working relationships between patients and their CT therapists. Summary : This qualitative study aimed to develop an understanding of the lived experience of patients with RA. Incentives to use CT include d dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, social factors and psychological issues such as depression, hopelessness and fear. Perceived benefits of CT included improved physical and psychological functioning. The most commonly used CTs were herbal remedies and supplements, closely followed by aromatherapy massage. Disadvantages and risks were identified as physi cal (pain and discomfort), psychological (fear and uncertainty) and/or material (cost).

Use of complementary and alternative medicine among patients attending rheumatology clinics in Israel. Israel Medical Association Journal, 8, 184-187. Refid: 121014 Main messages: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use was influenced by the level of education of the patient. Patients with RA are less likely than others with rheumatic diseases to use CAM. The preferred method of CAM among patients with rheumatic diseases mirrors that of the general population, and is not specific to those with rheumatic diseases. Summary: The objective of this quantitative study was to evaluate the prevalence of CAM use among patients with rheumatic diseases, and to analyze the demographic features of CAM users, their reasons for using CAM and the use of specific CAM methods. The results indicated that 42% of patients reported using CAM. Homeopathy and acupuncture were the most common types of CAM treatment used. CAM was more commonly used by patients with advanced education. Patients with RA used CAM less than patients with other rheumatologic conditions. Buchbinder, R., Gingold, M., Hall, S., & Cohe n, M.

Patients spent as much money on complementary medicine (CM) as they did on prescription medicine. Summary: The research used quantitative questionnaires to determine the prevalence and features of CM use among patients with RA who attended a community-based private rheumatology practice. The results showed that nearly two-thirds of the patients who were surveyed had used some form of CM in the past year. The most commonly used treatments were dietary and behavioural and cognitive therapies. Prescription medicine was considered more beneficial than either form of CM, and both us ers and non-users of CM had a similar perception of the efficacy of prescription medicine. Women a nd patients not in receipt of a pension were the most likely to have consulted a CM practitioner. Cardiel, M. H. & Rojas-Serrano, J. (2002).

Summary: The focus of this study was to determine the prevalence of complementary therapies among patients attending a musculoskeletal clinic. The predominant diagnosis was RA. Over half the patients were satisfied with conventional medical treatment and 38% had considered the use of complementary therapies. The majority of patients who had used complementary therapies said they had enjoyed some benefit. Acupuncture, homoeopathy, osteopathy and herbal medicine were the most popular types of treatment used. Female patients and those who were dissatisfied with current therapies were most likely to have considered complementary therapies. Chandrashekara, S., Anilkumar, T., & Jamuna, S. (2002).

Refid: 121397 Main message: Of the patients with RA in this study, which took place in India, 43% used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) drugs for the treatment of arthritis. Summary: This study aimed to understand the pattern of therapy and medication used by patients with RA. The results showed that almost half the patients had used CAM drugs. Ayurveda and homeopathy were the two most common CAM used by the patients. The majority of participants believed that conventional medicine could not cure RA, and that adverse reactions were rare in CAM. These factors predominantly influenced th eir decisions to choose CAM. The use of CAM increased as the duration of the disease increased. Cho, K. J., Jang, S. H., Lee, S. K., & Doh, W. S. (1998).

One factor that contributes to this lag time includes the use of unconventional medicine (Chinese herbal medicine) or non-prescribed medicine after symptom onset. Summary: The purpose of this study was to determine the factors responsible for delaying diagnosis and optimal management of RA in Korea. From the study sample of 98 patients, 51 patients consulted an orthopaedic surgeon, 19 patients consulted a Chinese herbal doctor and 16 patients consulted a pharmacist. In this study 59% of patients were diagnosed with RA by an orthopaedic surgeon, and 25% by a rheumatologist. Patients with RA in Korea lost twice as much time when consulting a medical doctor compared to patients with RA in the United States.

Refid: 121717 Main message: Unprescribed remedies are frequently used by patients with arthritis, and are rated by patients as effective as prescribed remedies. Summary: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and consequences of use of unprescribed remedies by people with self-reported osteoarthritis, and to identify factors that predict such use. Of the 382 participants with self-reported musculoskeletal disorders involved, the results showed that 84% had used at least one unprescribed remedy during the past six months. People with self-reported RA used more such remedies than those with self-reported osteoarthritis, and those with a greater degree of disability used more unprescribed remedies than those who were less affected.

Refid: 123834 Main message : Investigators concluded that psychosocial differences accounted for the use of alternative treatments in patients with RA. Summary : In this survey, 266 patients with RA were randomly selected from hospitals in the Netherlands to provide information about health and symptom status. The results indicated that female patients used alternative treatments more often than male patients did. With males and females combined, those who used alternative treatments were younger than those who did not. While the patient groups did not differ in terms of medical visits, those who used alternative treatments visited medical specialists for RA-related complaints less frequently than those who relied only on conventional treatments. Investigat ors concluded that those people who perceive their RA symptoms to be worse without having a worsening of the disease could explain why some patients use CM. This suggests that CM can be substituted not by additional conventional treatment prescribed by the rheumatologist, but rather by psychosocial intervention.

Female patients and patients dissatisfied with DMARDs used CAM more frequently, regardless of their disease activity. Summary : A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed using the database from a large observational cohort of RA patients. Among 3,815 RA patients 34.6% used at least one type of CAM. Health foods, including dietary supplements, were the most commonly used CAM. CAM was more frequently used by female patients. Se x and degree of satisfaction with DMARDs were significant independent predictive factors for CAM use. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 59 Kay, E. A. & Punchak, S. S. (1988).

Refid: 124175 Main message : Patients generally perceive themselves as having little understanding about the cause and treatment of RA, and want more information about their disease and its management. Summary : Qualitative interviews were conducted with 100 RA patients to assess their knowledge of the disease and its treatment. Only 46 patients said they had received information about RA from health care professionals. The most popular source of information used by the patients was television (82%). Patients believed that a number of factors caused RA and subsequent flare-ups. These included stress, too much exercise, infections and climate. Patients' knowledge of symptoms was also poor. Fifty-eight patients had tried non-prescribed remedies for RA, but 70% did not find them effective. Ramos-Remus, C., Watters, C. A., Dyke, L., Suarez-Almazor, M. E., & Russell, A. S. (1999).

NCR users tend to be younger, more disabled and in the middle income class. Summary : A cross-sectional survey and qualitative interview of 200 patients with rheumatic diseases in Edmonton, Canada, was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of use, and patients' beliefs, perceptions and expectations in relation to NCR. The results showed that 60% of the study patients had used NCR in the previous 12 months, 47% had received at least one NCR before the first rheumatology consultation and an additional 8% initiated NCR after their initial contact with a rheumatologist. Only 18% of the patients using NCR notified their rheumatologist about their use. Patients who used NCR in the preceding 12 months were younger, slightly more disabled and in the middle income class.

The results showed that patients with less function and greater pain were more likely to choose MCP joint arthroplasty. Other factors associated with an increased likelihood for choosing MCP joint arthroplasty included being younger and being female. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 60 Gabriel, S.

Summary: This pilot study examined the preferences for avoiding adverse events that were associated with NSAID use. The results suggested that participants placed a high value on avoiding surgery, hospitalization, prophylaxis-induced diarrhea and uncomplicated ulcers. The avoidance of ulcer symptoms and the inconvenience of taking an additional medication for preventing GI complications four times daily appeared to be less important to these patients. Martin, L.

Summary : A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 123 patients aged 60 years and over attending rheumatology outpatient clinics. Respondents were more likely to express a need for chiropody or footwear, physiotherapy or education about RA than for occupational therapy or surgery. Those respondents who had high disease activity scores and high anxiety scores showed a greater perceived need for additional health services. Rheumatoid arthritis: Information - qualitative studies (N=6) Marines Castillo, A. L., Salcido, G. P., Orozco, C ., Osorio, C. 131 - 6. Refid: 320763 Main Message: People with RA are interested in knowing more about the disease, especially with respect to diet and exercise. The main source of information is newspapers. Summary: In this study, a questionnaire was administered to 52 ambulatory patients (44 women and 8 men) with rheumatoid arthritis. The questionnaire involved four areas: general data, patients' interest for information concerning RA, popular concepts, and functional consequences of RA. A high interest was shown for knowing more about the disease, the main source of information was newspapers, and the most important items were diet and physical exercise. Medical information was received only by exception. Patients did not agree with the possibility of a cure, they did not believe the disease was contagious, and they did not believe that it occurred in children. Patients were instead convinced of a cause-effect relationship in which RA was caused by cold and temperature changes. They also believed that the disease can be controlled, believed in the concept of arthritis as a group of different diseases, and believed that CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 61it was possible to lead an active life despite the disease. Having an interest in knowing more about the disease was clearly related to better functioning and a higher schooling degree. *This article is in Spanish Ashe, B., Taylor, M., & Dubouloz, C. (2005).

Summary: This study used qualitative interviews to explore patients' experiences in two different arthritis education groups to de velop an understanding of meaningful group experiences. Ten participants with RA or other inflammatory arthritis were recruited. Individual and focus group interviews provided descriptions of experiences. The results showed that arthritis education group experiences led to improved perceptions of an ability to cope with the chronic disease. The idea that the patient's process of change can lead to healthy behaviours and desired health outcomes was also discussed. Barlow, J. H., Cullen, L. A., & Rowe, I. F. (2002).

Summary: This mixed method design examined patients' preferences for interventions, as well as psychological well-being and self-efficacy. It examined addressing education, self- management and the consequences of RA. The results revealed that patients preferred education about the disease and its treatment, as well as emotional issues, to be delivered on a one-to-one basis by health professionals. Group interventions were the preferred format for self-management, exercise and relationship issues, wh ereas videos were thought to be useful for demonstrating the use of aids and showing how other families cope.

Summary : To assess patient satisfaction a postal questionnaire was sent to 87 patients who called the rheumatology helpline in a one-month period. The results indicated that 97% of the participants were satisfied with the response time and 100% were satisfied with the courtesy; 95% and 98% felt that their questions were answered directly and to their satisfaction, respectively. Had the helpline not been available, 60% of the patients would have made an appointment with their GP. The helpline produced a cost saving to the National Health Service, largely due to the GP consultations avoided.

Summary: The purpose of this CDC report was to estimate the prevalence of people with chronic joint symptoms who did not see a health care provider in 2001. The results indicated that one-fifth of the estimated population had never seen a health care provider for joint pain problems. Several factors contribute to these findings. For example, many patients have comorbidities that were more severe or life-threatening then their joint symptoms and so they might pay less attention to the latter. Also, some patients perceived arthritis as being part of the normal aging process and so felt that treatment was neither necessary nor beneficial. Cho, K. J., Jang, S. H., Lee, S. K., & Doh, W. S.

Summary : This qualitative study interviewed 15 patients with RA about their experience in managing fatigue. Participants described two type s of fatigue: severe weariness and dramatic overwhelming fatigue. RA fatigue was found to be extreme, unfounded and non-resolving. Participants described the physical, cognitive and emotional impact of feeling fatigued, and the effects on relationships and participation in social and family roles. They attributed fatigue to the inflammatory process, overuse of the joints and unrefreshing sleep. Participants used self- management strategies but with limited success. Most did not discuss fatigue with clinicians but when they did, they felt it was dismissed. Some participants held negative views on the management of fatigue due to limited success with their self-management strategies and limited guidance from health professionals, and a resulting perceived lack of control over their fatigue.

Arthritis & Rheumatism, 55, 394-401. Refid: 124337 Main message : There is a need for a more flexible and patient-centred care model in which patients with RA or ankylosing spondylitis can decide which services they need and how they should be delivered. Summary : Questionnaires were completed by 1,193 patients with RA and ankylosing spondylitis. The majority of patients reported medium to high levels of information received about RA, involvement in medical decisions a nd satisfaction with care. High involvement in medical decisions was associated with high levels of perceived information and satisfaction, as well as with lower age and a good health status. Patient satisfaction, a high level of received CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 67information, age and 12+ years of formal education were significant predictors to current involvement. Nearly one-third of the respondents reported a variety of unmet health care needs, and this report was associated with poor health. Martin, L. J. & Griffith, S. M. (2006).

Summary : A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 123 patients aged 60 years and over attending rheumatology outpatient clinics. Respondents were more likely to express a need for chiropody or footwear, physiotherapy or education about RA than for occupational therapy or surgery. Those respondents who had high disease activity scores and high anxiety scores showed a greater perceived need for additional health services.

Refid: 125332 Main message : Rheumatology helpline services in the UK lacked uniformity in the delivery of care and accessibility to relevant patient groups. These differences could result in patient dissatisfaction and confusion, and the creation of national guidelines is recommended. Summary : Information was collected on the first 100 calls received by six rheumatology helplines in the south and west of England. Background information was gathered on the management, availability, setting and purpose of each helpline. The results indicated that patients with RA were the major users and no significant differences were found in the outcome of their calls between centres, although wide variations were found in the operation of the helplines, the populations they serve and the services they offer.

Refid: 126582 Main message : Over half of respondents used nonconventional remedies (NCR) for their RA symptoms, but fewer than 2 in 10 told their rheumatologist about them. NCR users tend to be younger, more disabled and in the middle income class. Summary : A cross-sectional survey and qualitative interview of 200 patients with rheumatic diseases in Edmonton, Canada, was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of use, and patients' beliefs, perceptions and expectations in relation to NCR. The results showed that 60% of the study patients had used NCR in the previous 12 months, 47% had received at least one NCR before the first rheumatology consultation and an additional 8% initiated NCR after their initial contact with a rheumatologist. Only 18% of the patients using NCR notified their rheumatologist CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 68about their use. Patients who used NCR in the preceding 12 months were younger, slightly more disabled and in the middle income class. Riemsma, R. P., Klein, G., Taal, E., Rasker, J. J., Houtman, P.

Refid: 126708 Main message : The amount of help received by patients with RA is related to the physical condition of the patient, marital status of the patient and sex of the caregiver. Summary : A survey of patients with RA and their caregivers found that in general patients received the help they needed. Most help given at home was provided by informal caregivers such as friends and family of the patient. The amount of help received from informal caregivers is largely explained by the patient's physical condition and marital status, the sex of the caregiver, the patient's expectations of their ability to cope with RA and the age of the patient. The amount of help received from health professionals is related primarily to the marital status and physical condition of the patient. Saag, K. G., Doebbeling, B. N., Rohrer, J.

Summary: The purpose of this qualitative study was to determine what influences seniors' choices of medication for osteoarthritis. Four themes emerged from interviews conducted about medication choices: the role of family physicians, the effect of fear, the reasons for discontinuing medication use and views on other information sources. This study also discussed the perception that seniors claimed not to be influenced by consumer advertising or the fact that some arthritis medications are more expensive then others. Mikhail, S.

Summary : Five focus groups (three for GPs and two for patients with OA) were conducted in southwestern Sydney, Australia, to examine d ecision-making about NSAIDs and to explore issues concerning the use of NSAIDs from bot h prescriber and consumer perspectives. The results showed that GPs are cautious when prescribing NSAIDs because of medicolegal concerns and uncertainty about their safety ; they were skeptical about information provided by the pharmaceutical industry because they found it confusing. Time was identified as a major barrier to adequate discussion with patients, and explaini ng the risk to patients in a meaningful way was perceived as a challenge. Patients wanted information and sought it from a range of sources, most commonly pharmacists and GPs. Most patients made active decisions about using or not using NSAIDs, with some favouri ng physical function over safety. Powanda,M. C. (2003).

Summary: A questionnaire was designed to explore the perceived importance of symptoms, treatment preferences, and research priorities of people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, and was distributed to 112 people with knee OA. Pain, disability, and instability in the joint were the most important symptoms, and anxiety about knee OA caused distress to many people. Oral drugs (90%), physical therapy (62%), and aids and adaptations (56%) were the most commonly used treatments. Surgery, oral drugs, and intra-ar ticular injections were perceived as the most efficacious interventions. Patients' highest priorities for research were surgery and educational interventions, despite the fact that few had had surgery and education was not perceived as very effective.

Arthritis Care and Research, 8, CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 72 The best predictor of health care use among older patients with OA in a health maintenance organization (HMO) is their prior use of health services. Summary: This study examined factors that predicted health care use among older members of an HMO who had osteoarthritis. The frequency of physician visits, phone calls, emergency room visits and inpatient stays were recorded. Factors such as age, health and psychological status were examined. The results showed that being older and more physically impaired, and having lower well-being scores were predictors of health care use. Heijmans,M., Foets,M., Schreurs,K., De Ridder,D., Bensing,J.

Summary: Questionnaire interviews were conducted with 580 patients with a diagnosis of diabetes or osteoarthritis and their GPs about the stressors accompanying a patient's illness, and information was obtained from each patient on health status and use of health care. Results show that patient and GP diverge in the way they think about chronic illness; this incongruence was larger in the case of osteoarthritis. Incongruence between patient and GP was associated with a worse health status of the patient and an increase in health-care use, although the pattern of correlation differed by type of disease. It is important that providers recognize the personal impact that a chronic disease has on the patient's life instead of just focusing on the medical aspects of disease. Ibrahim,S. A., Siminoff,L.

Summary: This observational, cross-sectional study used structured questionnaires to compare the perceptions of the efficacy of traditional and complementary treatments and their self-care practices between elderly African American and Caucasian patients. The study sample consisted of 593 patients (44% African American and 56% Caucasian) from Ohio; the two groups were comparable with respect to age, disease severity or functional status, and comorbidities. African Americans were more likely to report lower educational level and household income than Caucasians. African Americans were also more likely to perceive various traditional and complementary care modalities as efficacious. However, they were less likely than Caucasians to perceive joint replacement therapy as efficacious, and more likely to rely on self-care measures for their arthritis.

Refid: 133742 Main Message: The concept of perceived behavioral control (PBC) in the Theory of Planned Behavior can be broken down into two dimensions: perceived difficulty and self-efficacy. Controllability impacts whether perceived diffi culty and self-efficacy overlap or diverge, with higher controllability associated with distinct dimensions. Summary: In the Theory of Planned Behavior, pe rceived behavioral control (PBC) has been directly measured in 3 different ways, i.e. perceived difficulty, self-efficacy, and controllability. This study explored the relationship of percei ved difficulty and self-efficacy in the factor structure of PBC, and examined the impact of controllability on this relationship. The study context was osteoarthritis patients' drug information seeking from physicians and pharmacists for advertised anti-arthritic prescription medications. One thousand patients were randomly selected from 3000 nationwide osteoarthritis patients. A self-administered survey collected perceived difficulty (3 items), self-efficacy (3 items), and controllability (2 items) of drug information seeking from physicians and pharmacists. The re sponse rate was 61.9%. Perceived difficulty and self-efficacy may represent 2 dimensions of an overall concept. Controllability impacts whether perceived difficulty and self-efficacy overlap or diverge, with higher controllability associated with distinct dimensions. Liu, Y., Doucette, W. R., Farris, K.

Summary : The purpose of the survey was to identify predictors of patients' intentions and behaviours to seek drug information from physicians, pharmacists and the Internet after exposure to direct-to-consumer marketing using theories of planned behavior (TPB) and self-efficacy. The questionnaire was sent to 1,000 patients. Of those, 454 had prior exposure to DTCA. The results showed that TPB accounted for 40-50% of the variance for patients' intentions to seek drug information, and 19-38% of the variance for the action of drug information-seeking.

Summary: A survey regarding OA symptoms and treatments was administered to 205 veterans in order to examine the prevalence of self-reported use of common non-pharmacological therapies as well as patient- and physician-related predictors of use. 94 subjects (46%) reported current use of exercise, 23 (11%) reported using PT, and 24 (12%) dietary/herbal supplements. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were generally poor predictors of use of non-pharmacological therapy. Females were more likely to report exercising than males, and patients with greater disease severity were more likely to report current use of PT. Patients' perceived helpfulness of each therapy significantly predicted use (p<0.05). Physician demographic characteristics were not strong predictors of patients' use of therapy, but physician recommendation for exercise and PT predicted patients' use (p<0.05). Ibrahim,S.

However, the choice of undergoing late reconstruction (LR) appeared to be linked to the person's experience of the knee function. Summary : Thirty-six patients with knee OA who chose anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery were questioned about the reasons behind their decision. A high pre-injury activity level was associated with the choice of ACL recons truction, but the choice of treatment was not associated with age, sex or the outcome variables measured. The 75% of the subjects who chose ER based their decision on assumptions of future problems rather than their knee function, and the 88% who chose reconstructive surgery later based their decision on their experience of knee function.

Summary : Focus groups of randomly selected patients with arthritis, four groups of RA patients and one group of OA patients, each containing 20-30 people, were conducted to discuss their beliefs about arthritis and UT. All the participants believed arthritis to be incurable by conventional regimens or UT. Over half the participants had used UT to relieve pain despite the cost. Patients trusted information about UT from fa mily, friends and others with arthritis, but not information from supermarket tabloids or television commercials. Most discussed UT use with their physician, primarily to prevent interactions with prescribed treatments. Physicians' reactions ranged from ridicule to giving permission to continue using UT.

Refid: 121717 Main message: Unprescribed remedies are frequently used by patients with arthritis, and are rated by patients as effective as prescribed remedies. Summary: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and consequences of use of unprescribed remedies by people with self-reported osteoarthritis, and to identify factors that predict such use. Of the 382 participants with self-reported musculoskeletal disorders involved, the results showed that 84% had used at least one unprescribed remedy during the past six months. People with self-reported RA used more such remedies than those with self-reported osteoarthritis, and those with a greater degree of disability used more unprescribed remedies than those who were less affected.

British Journal of Health Psychology , 6(3), 229 - 242. Refid: 132566 Main Message: There is incongruence between patients' and general practitioners' (GP) ideas about the stressors that accompany chronic diseases, which is associated with a worse health status of the patient and an increase in healthcare use. Summary: Questionnaire interviews were conducted with 580 patients with a diagnosis of diabetes or osteoarthritis and their GPs about the stressors accompanying a patient's illness, and information was obtained from each patient on health status and use of health care. Results show that patient and GP diverge in the way they think about chronic illness; this incongruence was larger in the case of osteoarthritis. Incongruence between patient and GP was associated with a worse health status of the patient and an increase in health-care use, although the pattern of correlation differed by type of disease. It is important that providers recognize the personal impact that a chronic disease has on the patient's life instead of just focusing on the medical aspects of disease. Hsieh,J. B., Dominick,K. L. (2003). Use of non-pharmacological therapies among patients with osteoarthritis. Aging-Clinical & Experimental Research , 15(5), Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 79 In a sample of 205 veterans with OA there was relatively low use of exercise, PT, and dietary/herbal supplements. Patients' perceptions of treatment helpfulness and physician recommendations strongly predicted use. Interventions should aim to educate both patients and physicians about these therapies. Summary: A survey regarding OA symptoms and treatments was administered to 205 veterans in order to examine the prevalence of self-reported use of common non-pharmacological therapies as well as patient- and physician-related predictors of use. 94 subjects (46%) reported current use of exercise, 23 (11%) reported using PT, and 24 (12%) dietary/herbal supplements. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were generally poor predictors of use of non-pharmacological therapy. Females were more likely to report exercising than males, and patients with greater disease severity were more likely to report current use of PT. Patients' perceived helpfulness of each therapy significantly predicted use (p<0.05). Physician demographic characteristics were not strong predictors of patients' use of therapy, but physician recommendation for exercise and PT predicted patients' use (p<0.05). Ibrahim,S.

Summary: This observational, cross-sectional study used structured questionnaires to compare the perceptions of the efficacy of traditional and complementary treatments and their self-care practices between elderly African American and Caucasian patients. The study sample consisted of 593 patients (44% African American and 56% Caucasian) from Ohio; the two groups were comparable with respect to age, disease severity or functional status, and comorbidities. African Americans were more likely to report lower educational level and household income than Caucasians. African Americans were also more likely to perceive various traditional and complementary care modalities as efficacious. However, they were less likely than Caucasians to perceive joint replacement therapy as efficacious, and more likely to rely on self-care measures for their arthritis. Testerman, J. K., Morton, K.

Summary : This study surveyed 230 patients with osteoarthritis and/or depression plus 60 patients without these conditions in an outpatient setting about their health beliefs and use of complementary and alternative therapies. The results showed that holistic health beliefs, higher spirituality scores and lower health functional status were predictive of more CAM use whereas CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 80personal control over health and satisfaction with physicians were not.

Participant interviews were used to assess the coping strategies of patients with advanced osteoarthritis who had expressed a preference to avoid TJA. The results showed that participants frequently normalized the functional decline as being due to age and rejected arthritis-related medical treatments.

Summary : Seventeen elderly individuals who were potential candidates for TJA but were unwilling to undergo the procedure participated in an interview study about their decision- making process. The results showed that three assumptions might have prevented elderly persons from considering surgery: (1.) OA was a normal pa rt of aging rather than a disease, (2.) only those with more severe pain and disability than themselves should have surgery, and (3.) if they either required or would benefit from TJA, their physicians would have suggested it.

Individuals' perceptions and past experiences with health care professionals may affect their decisions about joint replacement surgery. Summary : In-depth qualitative interviews were carried out with 27 participants who had high levels of hip/knee pain and disability. Three type s of barrier were identified: (1.) people's own perceptions of need and reluctance to seek treatment, (2.) perceptions and experiences of primary care and (3.) experiences of treatment in secondary care. Pessimism about the availability of treatments and concerns about the effectiveness and risks of surgery made older people reluctant to seek medical help. Some of those referred to a hospital specialist were told that they were too young or too mobile for surgery. Tallon,D., Chard,J., Dieppe,P. (2000).

Summary: A questionnaire was designed to explore the perceived importance of symptoms, treatment preferences, and research priorities of people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, and was distributed to 112 people with knee OA. Pain, disability, and instability in the joint were the most important symptoms, and anxiety about knee OA caused distress to many people. Oral drugs (90%), physical therapy (62%), and aids and adaptations (56%) were the most commonly CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 83used treatments. Surgery, oral drugs, and intra-ar ticular injections were perceived as the most efficacious interventions. Patients' highest priorities for research were surgery and educational interventions, despite the fact that few had had surgery and education was not perceived as very effective.

Summary : This was a qualitative study in which 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with people who had enrolled for TKR and who had a lower-than-average disease burden based on pain and function scores. Several themes related to the need for TKR emerged: patients' adoption of the medical model of OA; patients' soci al network; the level of pain experienced; the impact of functional loss; patients' feelings of vulnerability, dependency, low mood and fatigue; and patients' ideas about disease progression and e xpectations of TKR outcomes. It is important for health professionals to explore and tackle these personal meanings when considering treatment. Osteoarthritis: Surgery - quantitative studies (N=7) Behairy, Y. M., Motuweh, S.

CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 84Summary: The aim of this study, which was conducted through qualitative interviews with patients, was to evaluate patients' attitudes toward having total knee replacement (TKR) surgery and to identify factors that might influence their decisions. Their reasons for refusing surgery included the fear of failed surgery, or a memory of a previous failed surgery, and the dangers of TKR surgery; being afraid of stiffness or death or of being too old for surgery; worrying that their symptoms were not severe enough; and worrying about misinformation or the need for a second opinion. The results from this study showed a high refusal rate, but no specific influencing factor could be identified. Byrne, M. M., Souchek, J., Richardson, M., & Suarez-Almazor, M. (2006).

Women and older individuals (of all ethnic backgrounds) were also less likely to choose surgery. There was no difference in preference for surgery between the general public and the patients examined in this study. Figaro, M. K., Williams-Russo, P., & Allegrante, J. P. (2005).

Summary: This survey investigated preferences among African-Americans with osteoarthritis (OA) regarding TKR surgery. Very few of the African-American patients interviewed believed that TKR was likely to improve knee pain, and al most half thought TKR would not improve their current health. African-American patients perceived a high quality of life, yet had low expectations from TKR and were therefore less likely to consider TKR as a treatment for OA. Hawker,G. I. Badley,E. M. (2006). A prospective population-based study of the predictors of undergoing total joint This prospective cohort study of people aged 55 years and older in Ontario, Canada found that the predictors of undergoing tota l joint arthroplasty (TJA) are: worse osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms, younger age, better health, and willingness to consider TJA. Summary: This prospective cohort study included 2,128 people from an existing population- CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 85based cohort who were 55 years or older with disabling hip or knee OA and no prior TJA from two different regions in Ontario, Canada. The likelihood of undergoing TJA was significantly greater for people between the ages of 63 and 81, people with worse OA symptoms, people in better general health, and people who are willing to consider TJA. When willingness was excluded from the model, education level became significantly associated with receipt of TJA and there was a clear trend showing an increasing likelihood of TJA with more education. Sex and income were not significant predictors of TJA. Ibrahim, S. A., Siminoff, L. A., Burant, C. J., & Kwoh, C. K. (2002). Differences in expectations of outcome mediate African American/white patient differences in \"willingness\" to consider joint replacement. Arthritis & Rheumatism, 46, 2429-2435. Refid: 132804 Main message : African-American patients were less likely than Caucasian patients to express \"willingness\" to consider joint replacement even if the procedure was needed and recommended. This was explained by differences between the groups' expectations of surgery outcomes. Summary : In a cross-sectional survey of 596 elderly men with moderate-to-severe symptomatic knee or hip OA, researchers found that African-American patients were less familiar with and less willing to consider joint replacement surgery than Caucasian patients. African-American patients were also more likely to expect a longer hospital stay, worse pain and more functional disability following replacement surgery. These findings help us understand some of the reasons for the marked racial/ethnic disparities in the use of joint replacement for knee/hip OA. Suarez-Almazor, M. E., Souchek, J., Kelly, P.

However, the choice of undergoing late reconstruction (LR) appeared to be linked to the person's experience of the knee function. Summary : Thirty-six patients with knee OA who chose anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery were questioned about the reasons behind their decision. A high pre-injury activity level was associated with the choice of ACL recons truction, but the choice of treatment was not associated with age, sex or the outcome variables measured. The 75% of the subjects who chose ER based their decision on assumptions of future problems rather than their knee function, and the 88% who chose reconstructive surgery later based their decision on their experience of knee function.

Controllability impacts whether perceived diffi culty and self-efficacy overlap or diverge, with higher controllability associated with distinct dimensions. Summary: In the Theory of Planned Behavior, pe rceived behavioral control (PBC) has been directly measured in 3 different ways, i.e. perceived difficulty, self-efficacy, and controllability. This study explored the relationship of percei ved difficulty and self-efficacy in the factor structure of PBC, and examined the impact of controllability on this relationship. The study context was osteoarthritis patients' drug information seeking from physicians and pharmacists for advertised anti-arthritic prescription medications. One thousand patients were randomly selected from 3000 nationwide osteoarthritis patients. A self-administered survey collected perceived difficulty (3 items), self-efficacy (3 items), and controllability (2 items) of drug information seeking from physicians and pharmacists. The re sponse rate was 61.9%. Perceived difficulty and self-efficacy may represent 2 dimensions of an overall concept. Controllability impacts whether perceived difficulty and self-efficacy overlap or diverge, with higher controllability associated with distinct dimensions. Liu, Y., Doucette, W. R., Farris, K.

Before diagnosis there was concern to appear legitimately ill and to have a label for the condition. After diagnosis participants still encountered health care professionals who were poorly informed about SLE. Family, friends, and employers did not understand the fluctuating nature of SLE, which often led to isolation. Participants felt that even health care professionals who specialized in SLE could not fully understand the psychosocial impact of the condition, and therefore did not provide information to meet those needs. Participants did not know which of the many health care professionals they had contact with to approach about their concerns. Lack of communication at an interdisciplinary level left them feeling that nobody was \"joining the dots\" for their health care. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 90Headland, M. (2006). Using a website containing patient narratives to understand people's experiences of living with arthritis. Journal of Orthopaedic Nursing, 10, 106-112. Refid: 123404 Main message : The main concerns of people with arthritis in the UK include a lack of engagement and adequate treatment by health professionals a nd health care staff, delays in obtaining a diagnosis and beginning treatment, and effects of the illness on personal relationships. Summary : A thematic analysis of patients' written comments about their experiences of living with arthritis posted on the BBC's health website was used to explore people's personal experiences of living with arthritis. The findings illustrated how the respondents used various psychological and behavioural mechanisms to help them cope and adjust to the changes brought about by their condition. Some respondents indicated that they were dissatisfied with the care and attention they received from health care professionals, while others spoke of more positive experiences. Another important issue was the wait time for obtaining a diagnosis and the corresponding effects this had on the patient's treatment and outcome. The health care professionals' attitudes toward the patients and their symptoms played a significant role in this process. Social implications and effects on personal relationships were also highlighted. Maddox, J. (1981). Medical care and the arthritis sufferer: a survey in outer Melbourne. Australian Family Physician, 10, 876-882. Refid: 113156 Main message : Rheumatic diseases are undertreated in Melbourne, Australia. Summary : Chronic rheumatic diseases affect more than 750,000 Australians, who consume medical services at least in proportion to their numbers. A survey of 646 people with a rheumatic complaint in Ringwood, Victoria, found consistent accounts by sufferers of unmet expectations and shortcomings in medical care. While it is possible that dissatisfaction is inevitable because there are no effective treatments for arthritis, the author argues that there was a consistent and widespread belief among respondents that physicians' medical knowledge of arthritis was limited or incomplete, that their general outlook on the management of rheumatic disease was pessimistic, and that more research and education in arthritis was needed.

Summary : In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of urban- dwelling Native Americans. Joint pain was not generally assumed to be related to arthritis or to aging. The belief that chronic pain affecting multiple joints was a serious and unexpected condition was associated with Native Americans' decisions to seek medical attention. The CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 92researchers found that verbal communications about pain might be subtle or underemphasized in this population and that their coping strategies for chronic or episodic pain were limited.

Refid: 150286 Main Messages: The \"human becoming\" school of thought posits that individuals should make their own decisions about their healthcare. This is a more ethical model of care that should replace the traditional paternalistic model. Summary: A belief that in certain circumstances it is acceptable to disregard a person's views in favor of promoting his or her health is called paternalism . In contrast, the \"human becoming\" school of thought posits that the person is the only one who knows the way - thus, individuals' own decisions about their health and quality of life are believed to be the most appropriate guides for healthcare practices. To judge people as not knowing what is best for their lives may lead to ways of practicing that disregard indi viduals' uniqueness, discount individuals' choices, and violate individuals' right to self-determinati on. The purposes of this article are to specify various meanings of paternalism, illuminate the ethical framework for honoring people's choices that is embedded in the ontology of the human becoming school of thought, and demonstrate the difference between practice guided by paternalistic values and beliefs and practice guided by \"human becoming\".

In order to improve the care of these patients, the barriers must be addressed and eliminated. Summary : Focus groups were used to determine the barriers to health care that people with mobility impairments, including spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and arthritis, face. The results revealed common barriers such as restricted physical access to doctors' offices and office equipment; difficulty establishing trusting relationships with physicians; and the costs of durable medical equipment, medications and rehabilitation.

Summary: This study aimed to examine the factors that affect adherence to medical recommendations among ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged patients with RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Houston, Texas. The majority of participants reported experiencing difficulty in adhering to th eir treatment. Patients with SLE or RA reported similar barriers to adhering to treatment and to keeping appointments.

Some may also see a Chinese medicine practitioner, but most of them will return to Western medicine later on. Summary : This was a qualitative study in which in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 Chinese immigrants in Calgary, Canada. The results indicated that the process of illness management usually started with participants using self-care remedies, before consulting Western physicians, then consulting Chinese healers, and finally returning to Western medicine. Disease management strategies among Chinese immigrants are influenced by disease, personal and cultural factors. These factors could influence possible approaches for providing culturally sensitive care, which can lead to greater satisfaction and well-being for Chinese immigrants with arthritis.

These needs place a serious burden on providers and can complicate the management of patients' chronic medical illnesses. Summary : A survey was conducted with 500 consecutive patients in a primary care clinic serving only uninsured, low-income patients. Participants reported that their most common chronic medical problems were headaches, chronic back problems and arthritis. The most common concerns patients wanted to discuss with health care providers were emotional issues. When compared with patients without mental illness, those with a current major mental illness reported significantly more concerns about their health, physical symptoms, chronic illnesses, stressors and higher incidences of abuse during their life.

Symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism were very common, more so in women than in men, and were associated with marked degrees of disability and some dependency. While most respondents regarded their general practitioner as the best person to treat such symptoms, many had not reported them to any health service personnel, but had chosen instead to treat them themselves, suggesting a degree of skepticism about the effectiveness of professional treatment.

Summary : A self-administered questionnaire study of 2,969 people in which subjects were self- selected was conducted in the UK. Medicinal cannabis use was reported by patients with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, depression, arthritis and neuropathy. Medicinal cannabis use was associated with youth, males and previous recreational use. Researchers advised caution on the interpretation of these data because the study population was self-selected rather than randomly selected, which introduces a risk of selection bias in the results.

Summary: The purpose of this CDC report was to estimate the prevalence of people with chronic joint symptoms who did not see a health care provider in 2001. The results indicated that one-fifth of the estimated population had never seen a health care provider for joint pain problems. Several factors contribute to these findings. For example, many patients have comorbidities that were more severe or life-threatening then their joint symptoms and so they might pay less attention to the latter. Also, some patients perceived arthritis as being part of the normal aging process and so felt that treatment was neither necessary nor beneficial.

Among 257 patients surveyed, 28% reported that they searched for arthritis information on the Web. Factors associated with using the Web for arthritis information were youth, employment and having a higher income and higher level of education. While the difference in ratings regarding the accuracy of Web-sourced arthritis information between physicians and patients was not significant, only about 16% of physicians responded that their patients understood the Internet content accurately. Physicians also tended to reply more negatively than patients about the content and the influence of Web-sourced arthritis information. Kjeken, I., Dagfinrud, H., Mowinckel, P., Uh lig, T., Kvien, T.

The majority of patients reported medium to high levels of information received about RA, involvement in medical decisions a nd satisfaction with care. High involvement in medical decisions was associated with high levels of perceived information and satisfaction, as well as with lower age and a good health status. Patient satisfaction, a high level of received information, age and 12+ years of formal education were significant predictors to current involvement.

Urban/rural status does not appear to independently influence the use of health care providers for arthritis care. Summary : A population-based telephone interview survey was conducted on a random sample of 488 adults aged 65 or older with self-reported ar thritis, with about half the sample from urban communities and half from rural communities. The results indicated that urban respondents were more commonly reported as having received a diagnosis of osteoarthritis from their physicians but being less likely to report RA. A greater pr oportion of urban versus rural respondents had seen a physician for their arthritis and had seen an orthopaedist or general internist more often. Some factors were significantly associated with pr ior rheumatologist use; for example, diagnosis of RA, being younger, living with someone, having a higher income and being further from an arthritis care provider.

Refid: 111483 Main message: The findings show that all patients in this study decided to abandon treatment if it did not meet their expectations for a cure. Summary: This qualitative paper explored patients' dissatisfaction with non-conventional therapies. Three main topics emerged from the patient interviews: patients generally did not like having a paternalistic relationship with the doctor; patients often felt that the alternative therapies were no different to conventional medicine; and treatment outcome is the first consideration when deciding whether or not to commit to the treatment. Concepts such as \"smart consumers,\" who place utmost importance on outcome and do not hesitate to discontinue treatment, were also discussed. O'Day, B., Dautel, P., & Scheer, J. (2002).

Refid: 125931 Main message: Common barriers to accessing health care exist for people with mobility impairments. In order to improve the care of these patients, the barriers must be addressed and eliminated. Summary : Focus groups were used to determine the barriers to health care that people with mobility impairments, including spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and arthritis, face. The results revealed common barriers such as restricted physical access to doctors' offices and office equipment; difficulty establishing trusting relationships with physicians; and the costs of durable medical equipment, medications and rehabilitation.

Refid: 115562 Main message : Chinese immigrants in Canada tend to manage their arthritis symptoms on their own before seeing a physician. Some may also see a Chinese medicine practitioner, but most of them will return to Western medicine later on. Summary : This was a qualitative study in which in-depth interviews were conducted with 19 Chinese immigrants in Calgary, Canada. The results indicated that the process of illness management usually started with participants using self-care remedies, before consulting Western physicians, then consulting Chinese healers, and finally returning to Western medicine. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 103Disease management strategies among Chinese immigrants are influenced by disease, personal and cultural factors. These factors could influence possible approaches for providing culturally sensitive care, which can lead to greater satisfaction and well-being for Chinese immigrants with arthritis.

Ethnic differences in the perception of prayer and consideration of joint arthroplasty. Medical care, 40, 471-476. Refid: 110160 Main message: Patients' perceptions of the benefits of prayer may influence their decisions about surgery. Summary: This quantitative study examined ethnic differences in the perception and use of prayer in the treatment of arthritis and its role in patients' decision-making about surgery. It aimed to measure the \"helpfulness of prayer\" in the treatment of arthritis and patients' attitudes toward joint arthroplasty. The results demonstrated that African-American patients were more likely than Caucasian patients to perceive prayer as helpful and that they were more likely to have actually used prayer as part of their arthritis treatment. The perception of the helpfulness of prayer may be an important explanatory variable in the relationship between ethnicity and patients' decisions when considering arthroplasty.

Refid: 110288 Main message: Comorbid pain among persons with depression is associated with more intensive use of general medical services, but lower rates of mental health services usage compared to that of depressed persons with no pain. Summary : The purpose of this quantitative cross-sectional study was to provide national estimates of the impact of common pain conditions (including self-reported arthritis) on the use of health services and quality of care among persons with depression. The results demonstrated that depressed persons with comorbid pain were older, had lower incomes and reported more severe psychiatric distress than depressed persons who did not have pain. Patients with comorbid pain paid more visits to medical providers, but they were less likely than patients without pain to see a mental health specialist. It was also shown that pain was associated with greater use of complementary or alternative medicine but not with differences in the use of antidepressants. Blake, V. A., Allegrante, J.

The perception of risk of surgery is much higher among African-Americans compared to Caucasians and is a barrier when considering surgery. Summary: This quantitative study examined social ne tworks and perceptions of the benefit of arthritis treatments and whether they influenced a decision to seek diagnosis and treatment. The results showed that African-Americans know fewe r people who have had surgical treatment of hip and knee pain than Caucasians do and appear to be less likely to perceive such treatment as beneficial.

Disability and rehabilitation, 28, 505-513. Refid: 110795 Main message: In this study sample, 19% of participants with physical disabilities used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Summary: The goals of this survey were to estimate the prevalence of CAM use among people with physical disabilities, to assess the reasons for their use and to determine the symptoms for which CAM practitioners were consulted. CAM use was more prevalent among women than men, in the Western US than in the Midwest and among those patients who had used CAM before compared with those who had not. Ther e were no significant differences by condition in CAM use. In this study, most people reported us ing CAM to treat pain, decreased functioning and lack of energy. Common reasons for using CAM included Kim, H. A. & Seo, Y. I. (2003).

Summary : A survey was conducted of patients in rheumatology clinics to assess the use of CAM, related demographic and clinical factors, and attitudes among Korean arthritis patients. At least one form of CAM was used by 68.5% of the respondents during the preceding 12 months. Herbal remedies and acupuncture were the most frequently used categories. Income level was significantly and negatively associated with the fr equent or regular use of CAM. Korean patients do not seem to discuss CAM use with their physicians. The main reason offered for not discussing CAM use with physicians was that the patients had \"not been asked\" by their physicians if they were using CAM. Lazarus, H. & Neumann, C. J. (2001).

Summary : A cross-sectional study based on a random sample of 488 adult patients with chronic diseases was carried out in Singapore. Factors associated with CAM use included middle age, arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders and stroke, multiple conditions, poor perceived health, family use of CAM, recommendation by close social contacts, strong adherence to traditional health beliefs and perceived satisfaction with care. CAM use was also significantly and independently predicted by the 'chronic disease triad' (arthritis/musculoskeletal disorders/stroke). Lewis, D., Paterson, M., Beckerman, S., & Sandilands, C.

Refid: 112978 Main message : Most respondents, some of whom had arthritis, would accept integration of complementary and alternative techniques into a hospital. Therapies would be more acceptable if there were clear evidence of their efficacy. Summary : A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to characterize the use of complementary and alternative therapies. The three most common therapies used were chiropractic, massage and herbal/phytology; the three most common reasons for use were general health, fatigue and arthritis. Of those surveyed, 33% would use holistic therapy in the future. Barriers to use were lack of information, perceived ineffectiveness and cost. Approximately 40% agreed they would only use complementary and alternative therapies with medical advice. Approximately 13% were opposed to complementary and alternative therapy and objected to its use in hospitals. Youth, preference for complementary and alternative therapy over conventional medicine, and prior use of these therapies independently predicted high likelihood for future use. A lower income and high self-perceived health were associated with a negative attitude toward the use of holistic therapies in hospital. Singh, V., Raidoo, D. M., & Harries, C. S. (2004).

This practice could not be attributed to any particular demographic profile. Summary : Structured interviews were conducted with 200 randomly selected South Africans of Indian origin to explore the use of CAM in this population. It emerged that 38.5% of the participants used CAM to treat conditions including diabetes mellitus, headaches, arthritis and joint pains, stress, skin disorders, backaches, hypertension and nasal disorders. Spiritual healing and herbal/natural medicines, including vitamins, were the most common types of CAM used. Seventy-nine percent of CAM users indicated that they enjoyed positive outcomes with their treatments. Ware, M. A., Adams, H., & Guy, G. W. (2005).

Refid: 115300 Main message : In the UK medicinal cannabis is used by up to 55% of people, especially in younger people (both male and female) and older males, with chronic conditions including arthritis. Summary : A self-administered questionnaire study of 2,969 people in which subjects were self- selected was conducted in the UK. Medicinal cannabis use was reported by patients with chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, depression, arthritis and neuropathy. Medicinal cannabis use was associated with youth, males and previous recreational use. Researchers advised caution on the interpretation of these data because the study population was self-selected rather than randomly selected, which introduces a risk of selection bias in the results. They recommended that further clinical studies were required to target people who have never used or rarely use cannabis in order to determine the effectiveness of cannabis for pain management.

While many arthritis sufferers reported improved mobility and less joint pain, over half indicated that they did not feel any benefit from taking supplements yet they continued to use them. Summary : Questionnaires were administered to 418 people aged 60-69. The results showed that NVNM supplement \"consumers\" and \"non-consumers\" were not significantly different for sex, age, ethnicity, perceived health status, income level and health insurance access. Arthritis, memory improvement and general health and well-being were the main reasons for using NVNM supplements. Less joint pain/improved mobility was the main perceived improvement from taking NVNM supplements.

Observed SES disparities in the rates of performed arthroplasties cannot be explained by a lesser need or less willingness to undergo arthroplasty in those with lower SES. Summary: This survey assessed education, income, arthritis severity and comorbidity in 28,451older individuals with moderate-to-severe hi p/knee problems living in Ontario, Canada. In a subset of 2,411 participants, the diagnosis of arthritis was validated and interviews were conducted to evaluate willingness to consider TJA. Less education and lower income were independently associated with a greater like lihood of a potential need for arthroplasty. Among those with a potential need, neither education nor income was independently associated with a definite willingness to consider arthroplasty. Thus, taking willingness into consideration, individuals with less education and/or a lower income were more likely to have a potential unmet need for arthroplasty. Hawker, G. A., Wright, J.

Summary: This survey covered 379 people aged 55 or older with hip or knee arthritis. About 34% reported that they were willing to consider TJA as a treatment option. Willingness was independently associated with the following factors: younger age, perceived higher arthritis severity, perception of TJA as appropriate for controlling joint pain, inability to walk more than one block, perception of an acceptable potential risk of needing additional surgeries and using friends as an important source of health information.

Increased communication between various health professionals and readily available information about SLE may help to minimize patients' feelings of isolation. Summary: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 women aged 26 to 68 years who CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 111were diagnosed with SLE 1 to 12 years earlier. Four themes emerged: diagnostic difficulties; understanding; communication; and integrated health care. Before diagnosis there was concern to appear legitimately ill and to have a label for the condition. After diagnosis participants still encountered health care professionals who were poorly informed about SLE. Family, friends, and employers did not understand the fluctuating nature of SLE, which often led to isolation. Participants felt that even health care professionals who specialized in SLE could not fully understand the psychosocial impact of the condition, and therefore did not provide information to meet those needs. Participants did not know which of the many health care professionals they had contact with to approach about their concerns. Lack of communication at an interdisciplinary level left them feeling that nobody was \"joining the dots\" for their health care.

Summary: This questionnaire-based study aimed to determine the proportion of patients attending a rheumatology clinic with Internet access, and to assess how often they searched for health information and how useful they found the information. Of 138 people who completed the questionnaires, 78% had RA. Patients searched online for information about arthritis, drug treatment, alternative therapies, diet and patient organizations. None of the participants recalled being advised to search for information by their doctors or nurses. Patients who searched for medical information were younger, more likely to be employed and more likely to be married or in a stable relationship; there were no differen ces in sex distribution, diagnosis, disease duration or social deprivation.

Summary : Questionnaire surveys of patients with arthritis and rheumatologists were performed to appraise the impact of arthritis information available on the Web. Among 257 patients surveyed, 28% reported that they searched for arthritis information on the Web. Factors associated with using the Web for arthritis information were youth, employment and having a higher income and higher level of education. While the difference in ratings regarding the accuracy of Web-sourced arthritis information between physicians and patients was not significant, only about 16% of physicians responded that their patients understood the Internet content accurately. Physicians also tended to reply more negatively than patients about the content and the influence of Web-sourced arthritis information. Kjeken, I., Dagfinrud, H., Mowinckel, P., Uh lig, T., Kvien, T.

The majority of patients reported medium to high levels of information received about RA, involvement in medical decisions a nd satisfaction with care. High involvement in medical decisions was associated with high levels of perceived information and satisfaction, as well as with lower age and a good health status. Patient satisfaction, a high level of received information, age and 12+ years of formal education were significant predictors to current involvement. Nearly one-third of the respondents reported a variety of unmet health care needs, and this report was associated with poor health. Maisiak, R., Koplon, S., & Heck, L., Jr. (1989).

Subs equent behavior of users of an arthritis information telephone service. Arthritis & Rheumatism, 33, 212-218. Refid: 113197 Main message : The use of telephone information services may increase subsequent positive actions taken and the sense of control in people with arthritis. Summary : Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of 305 users of a prototype telephone information service for ar thritis two to four months after their initial contact with the service. Of those surveyed, 79% reported taking at least one positive action for their arthritis because of service usage. The most frequently reported actions were asking the doctor more questions and greater compliance with the doctor's orders. About half of the respondents felt more in control of their arthritis because of service usage. Respondents who were younger than 60 years old, black or symptomatic were significantly more likely to take an action. This minimal intervention may stimulate positive behaviours for individuals with arthritis. Mauksch, L. B., Katon, W. J., Russo, J., Tucker, S. M., Walker, E., & Cameron, J. (2003). The content of a low-income, uninsured primary care population: Including the patient agenda. Journal of the American Board of Family Practice, 16, 278-289. Refid: 113316 Main message : A survey of primary care clinic patients in an uninsured, low-income population of Colorado showed that their health issues consisted mostly of physical pain and emotional distress. These needs place a serious burden on providers and can complicate the management of patients' chronic medical illnesses. Summary : A survey was conducted with 500 consecutive patients in a primary care clinic serving only uninsured, low-income patients. Participants reported that their most common chronic medical problems were headaches, chronic back problems and arthritis. The most common concerns patients wanted to discuss with health care providers were emotional issues. When compared with patients without mental illness, those with a current major mental illness reported significantly more concerns about their health, physical symptoms, chronic illnesses, stressors and higher incidences of abuse during their life.

Refid: 113449 Main message: A growing number of activist health consumers are using the Internet to help manage their health. These individuals are more likely to be female, in poorer health and more inclined to engage in self-care, and may lack access to professional care. CIHR Report: Help-seeking in Arthritis; November 2008 114Summary : An online survey was conducted among 10,069 patients with chronic illnesses. The most frequently reported conditions were allergies, arthritis and hypertension. Respondents who complained of a gynecological condition, chronic sinusitis, arthritis, migraine or a thyroid condition reported spending the most time online. Those who were more skeptical about healthcare, or were dissatisfied or experienced problems with access to healthcare, reported being more likely to go to the Internet as a source of health information. The Internet appeared to be used as a surrogate for medical advice among patients who lack insurance coverage or otherwise find it difficult to obtain care. Horton,R. Peterson,M. G. Powell,S.

Refid: 141259 Main Message: Telephone networks similar to the LupusLine model may be able to offer substantial benefit to people coping with the complex, ongoing psychosocial challenges of SLE. The at-home accessibility and low cost of such volunteer-based interventions may play an ever more needed role in the present health care environment. Summary: A survey was conducted to assess the impact of LupusLine during its pilot phase of operation by determining patterns of utilization and user satisfaction. LupusLine is a peer counseling service designed to provide ongoing emotional support from home to home by telephone appointment. One hundred fifty-three respondents completed a structured questionnaire administered over the telephone. Most users were women (94.5%) who had SLE themselves (87.5%) and who called the service because of recent changes in their physical functioning and reported feelings of depression a nd anxiety about their illness. Forty-one percent of respondents made 6 or more calls to their assigned peer counselor. Respondents reported high levels of satisfaction across 5 highly correlated measures, with 92% of callers reporting at least moderate satisfaction with the service. Over 60% of respondents who reported a change in 6 \"feeling\" categories attributed this change to using LupusLine. Fewer users reported a change in 4 specific behaviors since using the service, but more respondents attributed changes, when they occurred, to LupusLine. Shuyler, K. S. & Knight, K. M. (2003).

Summary: This narrative described a patient's search for a diagnosis and treatment of pain in her thumbs. The conventional diagnostic process was not enough for her. However, using the holistic approach of complementary health care, including massage therapy and acupuncture, combined with physical therapy, gave the patient a sense of empowerment over her arthritis. As the patient wrote about the experience, she recognized that she had been having difficulty accepting the aging process and having a chronic illness. Writing about her arthritis helped her accept her disease and it showed her the ways in which she had changed during the process.

Summary: This qualitative study used focus group interviews to examine the needs and preferences of both children with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and their parents, and also to look at how their needs may be addressed through educational interventions. The results showed that both children and parents believed that current interventions were inappropriate. Parents expressed frustration and anger at social barriers in their attempts to achieve a sense of normalcy. The greatest concern among children was peer belonging and social acceptance.

It was found that people who consulted their GP about their knee pain tended to have more severe disease and higher levels of disability, and believed that their condition had major consequences on their lives. Summary : Individuals with knee pain were identified through questionnaires sent to patients aged 50 and older from 2 GP practices in sout heast London. Of the 2940 questionnaires sent out, 34% were completed; of these, 49% reported having knee pain within the last 12 months and were invited to the department, and 231 people (47%) chose to participate. Of those who participated, 31% were given a diagnosis of OA. Factors that predict GP consultation are the perceived disease impact, the belief that the knee pain would have permanent effects, and that it would influence how others saw them. Factors that predict referral to specialists are knee swelling, the perceived disease impact, the belief that the knee pain would have permanent effects, and that it would influence how others saw them.
