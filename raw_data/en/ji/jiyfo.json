That did remind me somewhat ofNot sure if the authors are reading the comments but I'm curious how this would be localized to just the tumor. Stimulating T-cells to start killing would presumably damage healthy parts of the body if it occurred elsewhere. Are you also going to study how to block the signals the cancer cells sending? That would seem to be better targeted at just the cancer, versus generally altering the body's immune response.Altogether, our research suggests that T cells in tumors are not necessarily working hard and getting exhausted. Rather, they are blocked right from the start. This is because the negative signals cancer cells send out to their surrounding environment induce T cell dysfunction, and a lack of positive signals like inflammation results in a failure to kick T cells into high gear.

Our hope is that this will help T cells kill their cancer targets more effectively. Especially when those same damned asshole T cells will STILL induce an allergic (even fatal) reaction for a lifetime. And for no reason either. Think: peanut allergies. Why react at all?

It just provokes emotion and/or signalling without being funny or punny. (The two times short statements tend to get upvoted) So... Why the t cells even goes \"Okey dokey\", when the cancers told them to stand down? this is quite un-true comparing the compositions and makeup and effects could yield useful insight into what works and by extension what could work going forward.I'm not sure there are very useful conclusions to draw nowadays from nineteenth-century oncology. Because we never see cancers which can't send effective stand-down signals to T cells - the damaged cells are immediately destroyed by the immune system.So... Why the t cells even goes \"Okey dokey\", when the cancers told them to stand down? I think you mean \"one in 2^17 divisions\" not days, else we would consider cancer cured long agoBecause we never see cancers which can't send effective stand-down signals to T cells - the damaged cells are immediately destroyed by the immune system. There are about 2^41 cell divisions per day, there's a cancer in about one in five hundred humans each year (so one in 2^17 days), so a single division resulting in a cancer that gets to a detectable state is the same order of probability as guessing a 56-bit DES encryption key on the first attempt. That's because software is a gas. It expands to fill whatever e-space it exists in...It is funny, on all the projects I have worked the software started as (kinda)intelligent design and then started evolving into incomprehensible mess Technically, we already do ... but our system is pretty stupid.Imagine the things we could do if we as a society spent a trillion dollars a year on medical research instead of bombs \u00af\\()/\u00af One of the most astonishing studies done on the ultima HeLa cells (recently in the news), was theEither I am missing something here, or this article is rather unfortunately worded (#1 suspect) or the late '90s wants its immuno-oncology back. It has been known for over 20 years that T cells do not become exhausted, but are actively immune-suppressed by the tumors, \"anergized\". I assume that a new immunosuppressant signaling system has been found here, but I am not seeing it. Otherwise the speed of the energization is being reported on, but it was obviously fast; if you wait around for the T-cells to breach your cell membrane, and release recruiting cytokines before immunosuppression, it will be ineffective. But do we really need to spend more than the next ten militaries combined?Medical research spending in the US alone reached an estimated quarter of a trillion dollars in 2020. I'd love to spend less on the military, but the world is not a safe place and does not seem likely to become so in the next couple of decades. This doesn't answer his question, which is how are the cancer cells sending the stand-down signal.Because we never see cancers which can't send effective stand-down signals to T cells - the damaged cells are immediately destroyed by the immune system. There are about 2^41 cell divisions per day, there's a cancer in about one in five hundred humans each year (so one in 2^17 days), so a single division resulting in a cancer that gets to a detectable state is the same order of probability as guessing a 56-bit DES encryption key on the first attempt.
