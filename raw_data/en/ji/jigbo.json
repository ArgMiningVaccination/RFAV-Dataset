My team and I turned that clinic into a healing mecca, generating over a million dollars per year in revenue, with patients traveling from far and wide to see us. Our methods were so successful that our slogan became: \"Specializing in Difficult Cases.\" How did we do that? We taught patients everything we could to empower them to help themselves and their families. That was one big key to our patients' success. The other was that we developed new methods of integrating chiropractic with homeopathy, a 200-year-old science, founded by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a brilliant German physician who first coined the terms \"allopathic\" and \"homeopathic\" medicine. Dr. Hahnemann's story is fascinating, but in this article, I want to show you some similarities between his teachings in 1789 and those of D.D. Palmer in 1895, 106 years later. More importantly, I want to show you why all this matters for your practice today. These are vital connections for the doctor of the whole person to understand. Homeopathy: The Law of Similars Dr. Hahnemann discovered that the same symptoms caused by concentrations of substances (from the plant, animal, or mineral domains), could be cured by those substances after they were made into safe, non-toxic, homeopathic medicines through serial dilution and potentization. He called this discovery Homeopathy, from the Greek words meaning \"similar suffering,\" sometimes called the Law of Similars or \"like cures like.\" He also carefully documented every homeopathic remedy he developed, and he found that the remedies affected the body on multiple levels: mental, emotional, and physical. Hahnemann knew that true healing could only be based on natural methods of realigning the whole person. Perhaps the first proponent of what we now call the natural health movement, Hahnemann taught that true healing depended on cleanliness, fresh air, nourishing foods, pleasant thoughts, pure water, sunlight, and natural medicines. These concepts were radical and new in 1789. However, Hahnemann knew that natural methods were essential to strengthen a patient's \"vital force,\" the whole person: body, mind, and spirit. In chiropractic, this vital force was called \"innate intelligence.\" D.D. Palmer also knew that effective treatments, realigning the body's circuitry through spinal adjustments, affected the whole person. And we also realize this today - that true wellness involves every part of the whole person. Hering's Law of Cure The medical profession of his day rejected Dr. Hahnemann's research findings on homeopathic medicine. They ridiculed and persecuted him, with many of the same biases we still hear today (relating to both homeopathy and chiropractic): \"That's impossible. There's nothing there. It can't work.\" Dr. Hanhemann replied, \"Aude sapere,\" \"Dare to know,\" \"Dare to learn,\" or even, in this case, \"Dare to try.\" In other words, don't close your mind and mimic others in saying it doesn't work without trying it and seeing the proof for yourself. Dr. Constantine Hering (1800-1880) was tasked with discrediting Dr. Hahnemann's work and proving him wrong. Instead, Dr. Hering was quickly cured of his own longstanding health problem by homeopathic medicine. He became an advocate for homeopathy and brought the knowledge to the U.S. in the 1830s. He originated the famous principle: Hering's Law of Cure, which states that the body heals first from the inside out, from the head down, and in the reverse order that symptoms appeared or were suppressed. In chiropractic, you may recognize this phenomenon by a different name: retracing. The body adjusts to true healing by gradually releasing longstanding injuries and deeply held trauma or toxins. These releases during the natural healing process may be physical (i.e., sensations of old injuries in another part of the body) or emotional. The allopathic model tries to categorize people, in a mechanistic, reductionist sense: the body is just a \"machine,\" food is just \"fuel,\" and the doctor is like the \"mechanic\" when something goes wrong, using drugs and surgery as the tools of choice. However, we never were that. We are complex, highly individualized human beings, each with unique needs. Differing Philosophies: Allopathic and Homeopathic The allopathic medicine model uses drugs to suppress symptoms. Have you heard the analogies of cutting the wires to your smoke alarm because it's making too much noise, or covering the flashing oil light on your car's dashboard so it doesn't bother you? This is similar to what allopathic medicine does. It seeks to stop the symptoms, but it doesn't address the root causes: the fire or the low oil. The homeopath realizes that suppressing symptoms without addressing the root cause merely drives the problem deeper into the body where it may take longer to resolve. To compound the problem, now the body may also have the toxins from the drug itself to eliminate, as well as the drug's negative side effects, contraindications, or addictive nature. All of this may explain why chiropractors have seen the very real evidence of retracing during true healing. Dr. Hahnemann was distraught by the toxic, harsh medicines and methods used as the standard of care in his day. He saw that their methods of working against nature killed more patients than they helped. It's interesting that we see a parallel today, with hundreds of thousands of patients killed by properly prescribed and properly taken allopathic medicines, not to mention the tragic epidemic we see of drug abuse and addiction. Hahnemann called homeopathy the gentle cure, because the serial dilution and potentization makes it nontoxic. Yet the body recognizes it as it awakens the body's own healing response within. Homeopathic medicine helps the body express (not suppress) and overcome the root cause, which relieves the symptoms naturally. And with no negative side effects, no known addictions, no known negative drug interactions, and no known contraindications. Does it Work? Critics who say there's no scientific proof or research behind homeopathy, are misinformed. There are hundreds of clinical trials and studies documenting the efficacy of homeopathy. It wouldn't have lasted for 200+ years worldwide unless it worked! Here are just a few examples: Resetting the Nervous System Control Networks Just as chiropractic helps reset the nervous system's control network through spinal alignment, homeopathy helps reset the body's energetic control networks throughout the whole body. The wonderful thing about homeopathic medicine is that because it affects the body's energetic system, it may be taken orally or administered topically. Since the average nerve speed is 200 mph, when the body gets the correct homeopathic remedies, the healing response can seem almost instantaneous, just as relief from the correct adjustment can. When the two methods are combined, they can turbo-charge your practice. Resetting Your Practice Homeopathy empowers the chiropractor to correct nerve interferences throughout the brain and body, equipping the chiropractor to achieve greater results and safely expand the scope of their practice. Be empowered to address the whole person (and the whole nervous system), even where the hands of the chiropractor cannot reach. That's why I call homeopathy chiropractic in a bottle.
