As a certified nutritionist and dietitian who comes across a multitude of products and brands every day, it's been great to have come across Tropeaka. They have a range of wholefood products that tick all the right boxes I look for when recommending products for general health and wellbeing.

As a Dietitian, Nutritionist & Recipe Developer, Tropeaka ticks all of my boxes! Wholefoods, quality ingredients and eating in a way that makes you feel good is central to my food philosophy and to find a company that compliments my values is so refreshing. The health and wellness industry is an extremely saturated space at the moment, and I have to be honest in saying that I was apprehensive in trying another range of products. Given the nature of my work, I receive countless amounts to try and test and I can confidently say that until I tried Tropeaka, I was yet to find a Protein or Superfood Powder that I would personally use and would be happy to recommend to my clients and followers. These days, it's rare to find a health food company that doesn't use artificial sweeteners, additives, preservatives or misleading nutrition claims and is one of the many reasons Tropeaka comes out on top for me! With the increasing popularity of plant-based eating (and for good reason at that!), It is evident that hours of research and time have gone into formulating these products to not only make them accessible and suitable for everyone, but to make them delicious, nutrient-dense and of the highest quality. Each wholefood product clearly contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals and unmodified nutritious ingredients proven to optimise energy, strength, gut health, performance and immunity. Isn't it obvious that feeling your best and living life to your fullest is at the forefront of Tropeaka's mission? I think so! As a clinician, time and time again I witness my clients trying various protein powders that cause them digestive discomfort and leave them feeling sluggish. This is often the result of consuming products that use refined ingredients or sugar alcohols to add sweetness, or even due to a lack of digestive enzymes within their gut to break down the food. Tropeaka wholefood products are more likely to be suitable for those with food intolerances, food sensitivities, certain allergies and may help to manage bloating and general gut upset in some individuals due to the use of plant-protein and addition of digestive enzymes. Seriously what is not to love! I personally enjoy adding the protein range into my healthy slices, muffins and bliss balls to make for a more satisfying and fulfilling snack. I'm also partial to an extra hit of antioxidants which is why the Immunity Powder has become a core ingredient in my morning smoothie. The vibrancy of the purple is like nothing you've seen before and makes for an aesthetically pleasing Instagram-worthy image every single time! I'm allowed to say that because it's my part of my job to make food look as good as it tastes and what it can offer nutritionally, right?
