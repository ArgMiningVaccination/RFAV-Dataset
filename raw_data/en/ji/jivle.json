It addresses the issue of crime and violence in the Caribbean, a complex prob lem that prejudices both the social and economic development of the region. The Governments of the Caribbean countries recognize the seriousn ess of the problem and are exploring innovative policy responses at both the national and regional levels. Civil society organizations are doing their part as well by designing and implementing violence prevention programs targeting yout h violence, violence against women, and other important forms of violence. Much, however, remains to be done. Some of the factors that make the Caribbean most vulnerable to crime and violence\u2014the drug trade and trafficking of weapons are two important examples\u2014require a response that transcends nationa l and even regional boundaries. Also, promising initiatives at th e national level must be evaluated for effectiveness so that scarce resour ces can be efficiently invested. This report is offered as a contribution to the ongoing dialogue in the region on approaches to address crime and violence. It is not intended to provide a definitive blueprint for action, but rather is offered as a tool to engage stakeholders\u2014governments, civil society organizations, ci tizens, and international part ners\u2014in a serious dialogue on crime and violence, based on evidence and goo d practices from inside and outside the region.

Patterson said, \"Without a doubt, the high level of violent crime remains our most troubling and pressing problem.\" In opening the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago in September 2005, President George Maxwell Richar ds said the country was in crisis due to the escalating crime rate. Through multiple channels, crime and violence threaten the welfare of Caribbean citizens. Beyond the direct effect on victims, crime and violence inflict widespread costs, generating a climate of f ear for all citizens and diminishing economic growth. Crime and violence present one of th e paramount challenges to development in the Caribbean. Several factors which cut across the divers e countries of the re gion heighten their vulnerability to crime and violence. Primary among these is the region 's vulnerability to drug trafficking. Wedged between the world's source of cocaine to the south and its primary consumer markets to the north, the Cari bbean is the transit point for a torrent of narcotics, with a street va lue that exceeds the value of the entire legal economy. Compounding their difficulties, Ca ribbean countries have large coastlines an d territorial waters and many have weak criminal jus tice systems that are easily overwhelmed. Key messages and recommendations from the report include the following: 1) Crime and violence are a development issue . The high rates of crime and violence in the region have both direct e ffects on human welfar e in the short-run and longer run effects on economic growth and social development. Estimates suggest that were Jamaica and Haiti to re duce their rates of homicide to the level of Costa Rica, each country would see an in crease in its growth rate of 5.4 percent annually. 2) While levels of crime and associated ci rcumstances vary by country, the strongest explanation for the relatively high rate s of crime and violence rates in the region\u2014and their apparent rise in recent years\u2014is narcotics trafficking . The drug trade drives crime in a number of ways: through violence tied to trafficking, by normalizing illegal behavior, by diverting criminal justice resources from other activities, by provoking property crime rela ted to addiction, by contributing to the widespread availability of firearms, and by undermining and corrupting societal institutions. At the same time, it should be recognized that there is a trade-off between resources spent on combating dr ug trafficking and those spent on other forms of crime and violence prevention. 3) In general, there has been an over-reliance on the criminal justice approach to crime reduction in the region, to th e detriment of other complementary approaches which can be effective in reducing certain types of crime and violence. Over the last few years, howeve r, several countries such as Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are increasingly i nvesting in different approaches. Crime prevention through environmental design ( CPTED ), the study and design of environments to encourage desirable beha vior and discourage antisocial behavior, has significant potential to generate rapi d decreases in property crime and some iiforms of inter-personal violence. Integrated citizen security approaches have seen initial success in the Dominican Republic and should be explored elsewhere. These programs, by combining modern me thods of policing with prevention interventions undertaken by both government and non-governmental organizations, are extremely promising. The public health approach , which focuses on modifying risk factors for viol ent conduct, is especially promising for addressing violence against women and youth violence. 4) At the same time, it is also crucial to note that certain types of crime and violence \u2014in particular, organized crime and drug trafficking\u2014 are largely impervious to prevention approaches; a criminal justice-focused approach is essential in dealing with them . Within the criminal justice approach, there is much room for improvement. An especially urgent priority is the development of management information systems and performance indicators for better problem diagnosis, tracking of system out puts, monitoring reform programs and providing increased accountability to citizens. 5) These different approaches mean that there are multiple possible entry points to engage in violence and crime prevention. In one instance, the most promising approach may be in the context of a sl um-upgrading project; in another, in the context of a reform of the health service; in a third, in the cont ext of a reform of the criminal justice system. There is no one \"ideal\" approach. The common denominator is that successful interventions are evidence-based , starting with a clear diagnostic abou t types of violence and risk fact ors, and ending with a careful evaluation of the intervention's impact which will inform future actions. 6) Evidence from Jamaica and othe r countries shows that the average deportee is not involved in criminal activity, but a minor ity may be causing serious problems, both by direct involvement in crime and by providing a perverse role model for youth. More services should be offered to reintegrate deportees , along the lines of those provided by the Office for the Resettlement of Deportees in St. Kitts and Nevis. Options should be explored fo r deporting countries to shoulder a significant portion of the costs of thes e programs, in exchange for serious monitoring and evaluation of program impacts. 7) Given that Caribbean countries are trans it and not producer countries of cocaine, interdiction needs to be complemented by other strategies outside the region (principally demand reduction in consum er countries and er adication and/or alternative development in producer c ountries). Within the region, policies should focus on limiting the availability of fi rearms and on providing meaningful alternatives to youth . Since the Caribbean nations have limited resources to effectively fight the drug trade, significant assistance sh ould come from the destination countries in suppo rt of interdiction efforts . The case study of the Netherlands Antilles shows this to be bot h effective and in th e self-interest of developed countries. 8) Gun ownership is an outgrowth of the drug tr ade and, in some countries, of politics and associated garrison communities. Within these environments, which iiipromote the demand for weapons, reduc ing gun ownership is a difficult undertaking. Better gun registries, marking and tracking can help, as can improved gun interdiction in ports . Long run and sustai ned reduction in the demand for guns, however, will hinge on progress in combating drugs. 9) To address issues of youth violence , policy makers in the short run should borrow from the toolkit of evidence-based programs from other regions, such as early childhood development and ment oring programs, interventions to increase retention of high-risk youth in secondary schools, and opening schools after-hours and on weekends to offer yout h attractive activities to occupy their free time. While there are a multitude of programs in the region that address youth violence, few if any have been subject to rigorous impact evaluation. In the medium and long run, impact evaluations should systematically document what works in youth violence prevention in the Caribbean. 10) This report has culled many different sour ces of data to present as comprehensive a picture as possible of crime and violence in the Caribbean. Yet it is clear that there are major data gaps that hinder policy making . Chief among them is the lack of regular, periodic victimization surveys that permit comparison of crime levels both across countries and over time. R OAD MAP OF THE REPORT The report is organized as follows. It begins with an overview of crime in the region, separately considering conve ntional and organized crime. Two subsequent chapters examine risk factors and the costs of crime fo r the region as a whole. Next, a series of chapters presents case studies designed to highl ight particular issues in specific countries. These case studies were chosen in order to provide a detailed an alysis of the most pressing issues that are amenable to policy making at the regional and national levels. The specific issues were chosen in consultati on with stakeholders in the region to ensure that the report was responding to their demands and needs. Th e report ends with a chapter on public policy responses to crime in the region. 1 Overview of Crime Trends Murder rates in the Caribbean\u2014at 30 per 100,000 population annually\u2014are higher than for any other region of the world and have ri sen in recent years fo r many of the region's countries. Assault rates, at leas t based on assaults reported to police, are also significantly above the world average. These reported rates are highly sensitive to the level of trust in the local police in general and the willingness to report domestic violence, in particular. Victimization surveys are needed to even approximate true levels of assault, yet standardized victimization su rveys have rarely been unde rtaken in the Caribbean. 1 Note that this report does not contain an in-depth analysis of political violence in the Caribbean. ivMurder Rates in Selected Caribbean Countries: 1999-2005 Murder Rates by Region of the World 05101520253035 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005Murders per 100,000 residentsDominican Republic Trinidad and Tobago AmericaSouth/West Procuradur\u00eda General of the Dominican Republic; Central Statistical Office of Trinidad and Tobago; Central Statistical Office of St. Lucia. Sources: (right figure) UN Crime Trends Survey and Interpol, 2002 or most recent year. Note: Figures shown are annual murder rates per 100,000 population. Violence against women affects a significant percentage of wome n and girls in the Caribbean. Police statistics offer only a very imperfect picture of violence against women, since the majority of these incidents are not reported to police and increased trust in police will increase reporting. To get a more precise idea of prevalence rates, one must use victimization surveys that focus on violence against wome n. One such regional victimization survey revealed that 48 percent of adolescent girls' sexual initiation was \"forced\" or \"somewhat forced\" in nine Ca ribbean countries (Halcon et al., 2003). According to the latest available data from the UNODC's Crime Trends Survey (CTS), which is based on police statisti cs, three of the top ten record ed rape rates in the world occur in the Caribbean. All countries in th e Caribbean for which comparable data are available (Bahamas, St. Vincent and the Gr enadines, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Dominica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago ) experienced a rate of rape above the unweighted average of the 102 countries in the CTS. Despite their diversity, one thing all Caribbean countries have in common is that they have long been caught in the crossfire of in ternational drug trafficking. The good news is that the flow of drugs through the region may be decreasing. The transshipment of cocaine to the United States, the most significa nt flow in economic terms, appears to be in decline. Cannabis production for export from Jamaica, the largest cannabis producer in the region, appears to be in a slump. vDespite these recent shifts, large quantities of drugs continue to transit the Caribbean. In 2005, it is estimated that about 10 tons of cocai ne transited through Jamaica, and 20 tons through Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In addition to drug trafficking, kidnapping a nd corruption are other forms of organized crime which affect the region. Two count ries\u2014Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago\u2014have seen recent and rapid increases in kidnappi ngs. The kidnapping rate nearly doubled in Trinidad and Tobago between 1999 and 2005 (Central Statisti cs Office of Trinidad and Tobago, 2006). Corruption is a difficult crime to measur e. While there are methodological concerns about Transparency International's Corruptio n Perceptions Index (C PI), it remains the standard for international corruption comparis ons and boasts one of th e few datasets with near-global coverage. In the 2006 CPI, ten Caribbean countries were included in the world rankings. Haiti was ranked as the mo st corrupt country in the world, while Barbados was ranked as the 24th least corrupt country, ahead of many European countries. Risk Factors for Crime and Violence Potential risk factors for crime victimiza tion encompass conditions at the individual, relationship, community, and societal levels . As a whole, Caribb ean countries exhibit crime patterns similar to those in other coun tries. Both murder and robbery rates are higher in countries with low ec onomic growth while murder rates are highest in countries and communities that are poor and have large populations of young men. But these factors alone cannot explain the high rates of crime in the Caribbean. In Caribbean countries overall, homicide rates are 34 per cent higher and robbery rates are 26 percent higher than in countries with comparable macroeconomic conditions. Household-level victimization data from Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic were analyzed to generate a profile of ke y risk factors. Poorer households in poor communities face higher risk of violent crime, while property crime more often strikes the wealthy. The presence of a large populatio n of young men in the community is associated with higher levels of both types of crime in both Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. In all three countries, crime is highl y concentrated in urban areas and in most cases in areas with high population density. While these risk factors provide a profile of who is most likely to be victimized, observable variables have low predictive power in a statistical sense because victims vary widely in their characteristics. In othe r words, crime victimization is a general phenomenon which strikes citizen s of all stripes, and few if any are immune from the threat. This can be seen in part for Haiti by the fact that while prope rty crimes most often strike those in the richest quintile, and t hose in the poorest quintile most often suffer injury due to crime, victims are spread across all five quintiles of the income distribution. viAn important finding of this study is that in Jamaica a lower percentage of crimes are reported to the police in areas with higher crime rates. The reporting rate can plausibly be interpreted as a measure of confidence in the police, as people will be more likely to report when they trust the police and believe they will respond. Lack of trust and confidence in the police is then lower in areas with higher local crime rates. This suggests also that official police data distort the true geographic profile of crime, because official data are biased downwards for higher crime areas. Socioeconomic Costs of Crime and Violence This report reviews the literature on the eff ects of crime in the region and presents new analysis of the costs of crime in terms of lo ss of quality of life for victims, responses to fear of crime, and economic growth. Few studies in the region have examined so cioeconomic costs of gender-based violence and its effects. Morrison and Orlando ( 2005) find that women victimized by physical violence in Haiti are: i) less likely to receiv e antenatal care; ii) more likely to suffer from genital sores and ulcers; and iii) more likel y to be anemic (as are their children). Due to the high levels of violence in parts of urban Jamaica, residents are afraid to leave the homes and interact less often with friends and family who live elsewhere. Similarly, survey data from the Dominican Republic a nd Haiti show that peopl e avoid activities and locations that are perceived to expose them to a high risk of criminal victimization. Another channel through which crime exacts co sts is through its effects on businesses, which can be particularly damaging because they can involve both short-run costs and long-run consequences for development, by diverting resources to crime prevention measures and otherwise discour aging investment. In Jamai ca, 39 percent of business managers in a World Bank survey responded that they were less likely to expand their business because of crime, and 37 percent re ported that crime discourages investments that would improve productivity. Because of the key role that tourism plays in many Caribbean countries, the effects of crime on tourism are of partic ular concern. Alleyne and Boxil (2003) examined the relationship ove r time between tourist arrivals and crime in Jamaica and concluded that cr ime has discouraged tourists.

UNODC data and other (see Annex 3.1) for crime rates, Penn World Tables for GDP per capita. viiIt is possible to add up the total costs of crime through the accounting method. A study by Francis et al. (2003) found that the total cost s of crime in Jamaica in 2001 came to J$12.4 billion, which was 3.7 percent of GDP. Security costs dominate the total costs of crime as calculated by the accounting method. The impact of crime on overall economic growth can also be estimated using cross-country panel data. Results from this kind of analysis suggest very large potential gains from reduction in violence for Haiti and Jamaica. Both countries could boost annual economic growth per capita by 5.4 percent if they were to bring their homicide rates dow n to the levels of Costa Rica. Guyana and the Dominican Republic would also benefit substantia lly, with potential growth rate increa ses of 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. Criminal Deportees in Jamaica Each year, the United States, the United Ki ngdom, and Canada deport thousands of people convicted of various crimes to their countries of citizenship in the Caribbean. There is a widely held belief in the Caribbean that recent crime troubles can be tied directly to the activities of deportees w ho have learned criminal behavior in the developed countries. This report examines the situation in Jamaica, which is proportionately most affected by criminal de portations, and where o fficials have worried that the country's rising murder rate may be linked to the growing stock of deported convicts. The figure below shows both the nu mber of murders and the number and source of deportee arrivals over the 1998-2004 period. Whether these two variables are related cannot be determined from this figure.

A recent study (Headley, 2005) examined approximately 5000 records of criminals deported from the U.S. between 1997 and 2003. The data indicate that the average age of a criminal deportee entering the United States was 23 and the average age on deportation was 35. According to official Jamaican statistics, 81 percent were returned to Jamaica for non-violent offenses. While there is clearly heterogeneity in the pool of deportees, the typical deportee does not fit the profile of an individual who is likely to be a violent criminal on return to Jamaica. Thus, it appears unlikely that the average deportee is committing violent crime in Jamaica. At th e same time, although the majority of the criminal deportees were deported for non-viol ent offenses, 224 convicted murderers were included in the flow between 2001 and 2004. Rela tive to the Jamaican population, this is not a small number, and it does not take a large number of offenders to have a potentially large impact. Are deportees contributing signi ficantly to crime in other co untries of the region? Of 332 criminal deportees returned to Barbados between 1994 and 2000, only 13 percent were subsequently charged with a criminal offens e. Similarly, in Trinid ad and Tobago, of the 565 deportees received between 1999 and 20 01, only 15 percent we re subsequently charged with a crime. This recidivism rate is low compared to the reoffense rate of prisoners released from local prisons. Developed countries provide a variety of forms of aid to the Caribbean to support development. Subsidizing reintegration for deported offenders would be a very cost- effective way of achieving similar ends. It w ould save Caribbean societies the cost and trauma of recidivism; reduce criminal ju stice costs involved in processing and incarcerating repeat offenders; and promot e the stability esse ntial to attracting investment, promoting tourism, and reduc ing emigration. Another result might be weakened international crime networks, wh ich also will benefit developed countries. Guns in Trinidad and Tobago The data for several countries shows that not only have levels of crime and violence increased, but so too has the use of weapons in criminal acts.

The CARICOM Regional Task Force on Crime and Security recently commissioned a report on the proliferation of small arms a nd light weapons (SALW) in the Caribbean (CARICOM, 2002). The resulting report identified three levels of SALW proliferation in the region: countries with established high levels and patterns of armed crime (Jamaica), countries with emerging high levels of armed and organized criminality (Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago), and countries with indications of increased use and availability of small arms (Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines). At that time, it was determined that, am ong CARICOM nations, only Jamaica fell in the first category, with indications that milita ry type weapons were available and that paramilitary units were operating (Burrows and Matthias, 2003). If such an evaluation were done today, Trinidad and T obago might also be included in this tier, as the murder rate doubled between 2002 and 2005. In 200 4, the country experienced 160 firearm murders, more than 450 firearm woundings , and 1,500 firearm incidents that did not result in injury (Trinidad a nd Tobago Police Service, n/d). A major factor contributing to the surge of guns-related criminality in the region is the trafficking of narcotics, which has facili tated the availability of firearms. More specifically, the firearms required for protec tion of contraband during transportation are smuggled in along with drugs. Within these environments that promote the demand for weapons, reducing gun ownership is a di fficult undertaking. Better gun registries, marking, and tracking can help, as can improve d gun interdiction in po rts. In the long term progress will hinge on changes in the drug trade, changes in the \"gun-culture,\" and progress in the implementation of internationa l treaties and agreements on small arms and light weapons, such as the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Drug Trafficking and the Netherlands Antilles The drug trade is a prime driver of crime across the Caribbean. This report examines unusual interdiction efforts in the Netherlands Antilles, wher e authorities estimate that 75 percent of crime is drug-rela ted. Some 60 percent of all the cocaine seized in the Caribbean in 2004 was seized in the Netherla nds Antilles, and cocaine seizures increased dramatically between 2001 and 2004. Confronted with large numbers of peopl e attempting to smuggle drugs by plane, authorities implemented a \"100% Control\" strategy, by which passengers landing in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam and originat ing from the Dutch Caribbean, Suriname, and Venezuela are subject to extensive se arches. Persons found with drugs on their person had the drugs confiscat ed and were immediately de ported to their country of origin but were not arrested. Rather than attempting to scare off potential smugglers with xthe threat of incarceration, the Dutch appr oach was based on increasing the rate of interdiction to the point that smuggling becam e unprofitable. In other words, the focus was on the drugs, rather than the couriers. The authorities estimate that between 80 a nd 100 couriers per day were passing through the airport in 2003. This was cut to an estimated 10 a month by October 2005. While displacement effects would need to be tallie d to properly evaluate the impact of this intervention, the 100% Control strategy has apparently disrupted what was once a major trafficking route. Commercial air flights are only one of the vectors through which cocaine transits the Netherlands Antilles and not necessarily th e most significant one. The 100% Control approach has seized 7.5 tons of cocaine in 2.5 years, but multi-ton seizures can be made in a single instance of maritime interdiction. Detecting maritime trafficking requires intelligence work and a dedicated interdiction force. Even eliminating the Netherlands Antilles as a drug transit area altoge ther would not stop the flow of drugs, and displacement effects are inevitable. Nonetheless, focusing on the drugs rather than the couriers is a powerf ul approach because it defeats the \"shotgun\" technique, where traffickers are willing to sacrifice an endless stream of gullible couriers as long as sufficient quantities of drugs arrive for them to make a profit. It has proven itself to work in the case of the Netherlands Antilles, and could be tested in other contexts, including other Caribbean countri es suffering from drug transshipment. The Antillean example also highlights the need for cooperation between Caribbean transshipment countries and destination countries in maritime interdiction. Youth Violence in the Dominican Republic Deaths and injuries from youth violence c onstitute a major public health, social and economic problem across the Caribbean, wher e youth are disproporti onately represented in the ranks of both victims and perpetrators of crime a nd violence. Moreover, in many Caribbean countries violent crimes are being committed at younger ages. The Dominican Republic is one of the countries in which this pattern has become more stark over time, as rates of crime and violence overall have incr eased. In 2005, homicides of those aged 11- 30 accounted for approximately 46 percent of total homicide deaths. A wide variety of risk factors contribute to the prevalence of yout h violence, including poverty, youth unemployment, large-scale migr ation to urban areas, drug trafficking, a weak education system, ineffective policing, the widespread availability of weapons, drug and alcohol use, and the presence of organized gangs. Nonetheless, youth violence is preventable . A broad range of strategies for preventing and reducing youth violence have been implemented in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere. Evidence from evaluations (unfor tunately, almost exclusively in developed countries) documents that most highly e ffective programs combine components that address both individual risks and environm ental conditions, by building individual skills xiand competencies, supporting parental eff ectiveness, improving ch ances for youth to access and complete their secondary education, improving the social climate of schools, providing second chances, and promoting ch anges in involvement with peer groups. The best youth violence interventions ta rget specific populations of young people associated with risk factors, such as school leavers, those involved with delinquent peers, gang members, and those exposed to family violence or substance abuse. Targeting high- violence communities with a holistic approa ch to address violence and emphasizing violence prevention directed at children a nd youth, as exemplified by the Barrios Seguros program in the Dominican Republic, is a very promising\u2014albeit not yet formally evaluated\u2014approach.

Early child development interv entions and effective paren ting training for poor and at- risk children and their families are some of the most cost-effective investments in reducing youth violence and delinquency over time. Incentives for youths to complete their secondary education have al so proven to be effective. Overall, reducing \"mano dura\" or repressive programs in favor of expanding prevention strategies (including prevention-focused law enforcement) would represent an effective and potentially cost-saving stra tegy. Finally, promoting interv entions that reduce gun and alcohol availability\u2014and their social accepta nce\u2014among youth can play a crucial role in countries like the Dominican Republic, where the use of both is widespread at young ages and the links to violence are significant. xii Criminal Justice Systems Many countries in the Caribbean have experimented with reform of their crim inal justice systems, and the experience is mixed. This chapter focuses on the criminal justice reform experience of two countries : the Dominican Republic an d Jamaica. Two important lessons emerge: (i) the need to pursue bette r coordination among institutions, including the introduction of information systems capab le of tracking systemic performance and generating a set of performance indicators, and (ii) the desirability of linking criminal justice reforms to a broader, multi-sector strategy of crime and violence prevention. Performance indicators should not be the produ ct of ad hoc efforts to measure outputs currently of interest. Instead, basic data on work proces ses should be routinely gathered and transferred to centralized databases, wh ere it can be reviewed and analyzed for its broader implications. Once in place, such systems provide a very potent tool for reviewing organizational performance and identifying and diagnosing problems. They also facilitate the creation of ne w indicators as they are needed. A key performance indicator for the police is the \"clearance\" rate at which dockets leave the authority of the police and become the primary responsibility of the prosecuting authority. Another important indicator is the nu mber and nature of complaints against the police. The most common indicators for measur ing prosecutorial performance are the rate of convictions and the percentage or num ber of prisoners awai ting trial. Prison performance can be measured at a basic level by the rate of escape and amount of violence in prisons. The performance of the prison system in rehabilitating inmates can be measured by the re-arrest rate within a specified time period. Governments also need inter-agency govern ance mechanisms and incentives to help individual agencies in the justice sector align their work with system-wide goals. If sector-wide governance mechanisms are to succeed, their authority must go beyond performance measurement to include real execu tive powers (see Vera Institute of Justice, 2004) 2. The recent history of justice reforms in both Jamaica and the Dominican Republic illustrates the need for such interagency mechanisms and effective performance evaluation systems. Public Policy of Crime and Violence Preven tion: National and Regional Approaches In the Caribbean and most other regions, effort s to prevent violence have fallen into two categories: sector-specific a pproaches\u2014such as criminal justice, public health, and conflict transformation and hum an rights\u2014and cross-sectoral approaches\u2014such as crime prevention through environmental design and citizen security. These approaches are complementary. For example, criminal justic e reform initiatives (e.g. improved policing and better rehabilitation in pr isons) can be pursued simultaneously with citizen security 2 An example of sector-wide coordination currently limi ted to performance measurem ent is the role played by National Commission for the Coordination of the Reforms in Chile. xiiiprograms that employ social prevention in terventions and crime prevention through environmental design. In other words, there is no one \"magic bullet\" or single approach that can address all the risk and protective factors for crime and violence. It is important to note that many of the issues facing th e Caribbean transcend national boundaries and require a coordinated regiona l response. Demand for drugs emanates from Europe and the United States; deportees are sent back to the region from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada; and many weapons that are trafficked are sourced from the United States. CARICOM has undertaken several important steps to deal with emerging regional security issues. Perhaps the most important regional initiative in the area of crime and violence reduction was the Regional Task Force on Crime and Security (RTFCS). The Task Force identified the following principal se curity threats to the region: illegal drugs, illegal firearms, corruption, ri sing crime against persons and property, criminal deportees, growing lawlessness, poverty and inequity, and terrorism. For the areas of illegal drugs, illegal firearms, terrorism, and deportees, th e report included a sh ort discussion of key issues and challenges and a l ong list of detailed recommen dations at both national and regional levels (CARICOM, 2002).3 The Task Force presented its report to a meeting of Heads of Government in July 2002 and the recommendations of the Task Force were endorsed by this meeting. Caribbean heads of government endorsed a new Management Framework for Crime and Security in July 2005. This framework establ ishes a Council of Mini sters responsible for security and law enforcement, a Policy Advisory Committee, and an Implementation Agency to implement CARICOM polic y initiatives in this area. Yet no regional strategy in these areas can hope to succeed wit hout significant support from OECD countries. This support has so fa r been limited predominantly to security sector reforms initiatives and drug interdiction, but has been lacking in the areas of weapons control and deportees. Nor does good policy making to reduce crim e and violence happen by accident. The Regional Task Force on Crime and Secu rity (CARICOM, 2002) called for the development of national crime control master plans and the establishment of national crime commissions to ensure multi-sectoral collaboration. National pl ans allow for cross- sectoral collaboration and serious discussions about the priorities in resource allocation. Equally importantly, they offer a vehicl e for the involvement of civil society organizations, where much of the expertise in violence prevention resides. While the Task Force recommendations have been heeded in some countries, in some they have not. Preparation of a nationa l plan should be a prior ity in these countries. Crime and violence are not immutable. While the Caribbean faces serious challenges, especially in the areas of drugs, guns and youth violence, intelligent policy making at the national and regional levels can make a diffe rence. Given the high social and economic 3 The key findings from these sections have been incorporated into the relevant sections of this report. xivcosts associated with crime and violen ce, the development of sound policies and programs is a key development priority for the region.

CONVENTIONAL CRIME: AN OVERVIEW The Caribbean countries are hi ghly diverse in terms of their politica l structure, population size, and level of development. They share the experience of a colonial past and a geography which places them in the path of the international drug trade. According to figures from the United Nati ons Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Interpol, the overall Cari bbean murder rate of 30 pe r 100,000 is higher than for any other region of the world. Th e region also has high levels of other violent crime, and violence against women is widespread. 1.1 Crime is arguably the number one social issue for much of the Caribbean, with its only serious rival being economic development (see World Bank, 2005a).4 Leaders are coming to realize, however, that the two issues are strongly related.5 Crime drives away investment, both foreign and domestic, and c onsequently slows gr owth. The Caribbean has been described as the most tourism- dependent area in the world, and crime is anathema for this industry.6 A second key industry\u2014the fi nancial services sector\u2014is threatened by white collar crime and money laundering.7 The region is also one of the areas of the world most affected by brain drain, and there is evidence that crime is feeding this exodus in some areas.8 In these and many other ways, it is clear that crime is impeding the development of the Caribbean. 1.2 The Caribbean is especially vulnerable to crime for several reasons. It suffers from the disadvantage of being situated be tween the world's source of cocaine (the Andean region of South America) and its pr imary consumer markets (the United States and Europe) (UNODC, 2006).9 As small islands, Caribbean c ountries and territories have large coastlines and territorial waters to co ntrol relative to their ability to fund law enforcement coverage. Small criminal justice systems are easily overwhelmed in terms of police, courts, and prisons. Police must deal with seasonal tourist inflows, and, in some countries, the number of annual visitors actu ally exceeds the size of the local population. The Caribbean has some of the highest pris oner to population ratios in the world, and overcrowding interferes with the rehabilitation process.10 Finally, a number of countries 4 The open-ended question \"What would you say is th e single most serious challenge facing our country today?\" was asked to a representative sample of the population of the islands of St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua a nd Barbuda in Spring 2005. \"The crime rate\" was the most popular response, with 45 percent of respondents mentioning it as a first or second priority. The next most common response was \"the rising cost of living\", mentioned by 26 percent as a first or second priority. 5 See Annex 1.1 for quotations from Caribbean leaders on the threat posed by crime. 6 See Annex 1.2 for a discussion of the importance of tourism in Caribbean economy. 7 See Box 2.1 for discussion of an example of white collar crime in the Dominican Republic. 8 See Annex 1.3 for a discussion of the links between emigration and crime. 9 In 2005, nearly all the world's co caine came from Colombia (54 percent), Peru (30 percent), and Bolivia (16 percent). Most of this cocaine was used in North America (about half) and West/Central Europe (about a quarter). Cocaine prices in these countries were also generally higher than in other markets. 10 See Annex 1.4 for discussions of Caribbean police forces and prison populations. 2have experienced periods of political instability, which may have a long-term impact on crime.11 1.3 Discussions of crime typically disti nguish between \"organized crime\" and \"conventional crime.\" Organized crime typically refers to criminal enterprises (crime organizations that operate in similar fashion to businesses), while conventional crime includes all the common law offenses of murd er, rape, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, fraud, and the like. This chapter discusse s conventional crime, while the following chapter provides an overview of organized crime in the Caribbean. T HE DIVERSITY OF THE CARIBBEAN 1.4 To those unfamiliar with the area, \"the Caribbean\" conjures rather uniform images of picture-postcard isla nds. The truth is that, on the contrary, it would be difficult to imagine a region that displays more diversity than the Caribbean. The area was colonized by Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and each power left its mark on the language, culture, and politics of the ar eas it held. Some countries retain varying degrees of dependence on these powers. Some countries are highly developed, such as Barbados, which appears 31st in the world in the United Nations 2006 Human De velopment Index rankings, just above the Czech Republic. Others are extremely poor, such as Haiti, which ranks 154th, below both Kenya and Zimbabwe (see Figure 1.1) (UNDP, 2006). Populations vary from about 4,000 (Mont serrat) to over 11 million (Cuba). 1.5 This final factor, the uneven distri bution of the region's population among countries, considerably compli cates crime analysis. While th ere are 20 to 30 countries and territories in the Caribb ean (depending on how they are counted) some 88 percent of the population is found in just five countri es (see Figure 1.2). Since many islands are actually parts of larger countries (for exam ple, the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands while Martinique , Guadeloupe, and French Guiana are French d\u00e9partments ), they are often excluded from discussions of regional issues. If only fully independent countries ar e included in the analys is, Cuba comprises a third and the Dominican Republic and Haiti t ogether half of the regional population. 11 Key among these areas are Jamaica, which has experi enced political violence sin ce the 1940s, and Haiti, which has had repeated periods of instability since independence in 1804. 3Figure 1.1: Ranking of Cari bbean Countries in the Human Development Index 154104103948988857168595752515031 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160HaitiJamaicaGuyanaDominican RepublicSurinameSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesGrenadaSt. LuciaDominicaAntigua and BarbudaTrinidad and TobagoBahamasSt. Kitts and NevisCubaBarbados Ranking Among All Countries of the Word in HDI Source: Human Development Report 2006. 1.6 Thus, the Caribbean is highly diverse, but the population of the Caribbean is concentrated in a few countries that may not represent the experiences of the smaller islands. For example, while the majority of the countries and territories are English- speaking, the bulk of the population is Spanish-speaking. Cuba comprises over a quarter of the total regional population (a third of the independ ent Caribbean), and its society and politics are unlike those of the other islands. Haiti makes up a fifth but is a unique case due its extreme poverty and history of political instability and violence. Often both Cuba and Haiti are excluded from analysis due to data availability, but this also presents problems: it is difficult to speak of \"the Caribbean\" while excluding almost half the region's population, and doing so gives disproportionate weight to the experiences of the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. 1.7 For this reason, it is difficult to comp are the Caribbean as a region to other regions in the worl d in terms of crime. Does the Cari bbean have a serious crime problem? Figure 1.2: Population Distribution of the Independent Caribbean Jamaica 7% Haiti 23%Dominican Rep 25%Cuba 32%All others 13% Source: UN Population Division. 4It depends on which countries are included in the sample, and any generalization will gloss over a tremendous variety of experiences. But at least one international comparison, done by the UNODC based on standardized data sources, suggested that the Caribbean suffers from more murder per capita than a ny other region of the world (see Figure 1.3) (UNODC, 2005). Figure 1.3: Murder Rates by Region 112334789172222262930 - 5 10 15 20 25 30 35Middle East and Southwest AsiaNorth AfricaWest West AfricaCaribbean Murders per 100,000 population Source: UNODC Crime Trends Surveys and Interpol, 2002 or most recent year. HOW TO MEASURE CRIME ? 1.8 In general, crime data are extremel y problematic, and the Caribbean region provides an excellent case study of just how deceptive they can be. The best source of information on crime comes from household su rveys, such as the standardized crime surveys conducted under the aegis of the In ternational Crime Victims Surveys (ICVS). Unfortunately, only one country in the Caribbean has particip ated in the ICVS: Barbados. Information from other survey sources can be interesting, but rarely approaches the degree of precision needed for sound analysis of the crime situation. For example, the Latinobar\u00f3metro poll covers 18 countries in La tin America but only asks the most general questions about crime. 1.9 The official crime figures published by national governments are much more problematic. They are generally based on pol ice statistics, and the police figures are 5largely based on cases that are reported to the police by the public. Unreported cases cannot be recorded, and there is good reason to believe a great deal of crime is not reported in the region. Making comparis ons across jurisdictions is even more complicated, because the prec ise rate of under-reporting va ries between countries, and countries where the criminal justice system enjoys a good deal of publ ic confidence tend to have higher rates of reporting. On the othe r hand, as Chapter 3 shows, it is precisely in the most crime ridden-areas that reporting rates are the lowest. 1.10 In addition, definitions of crime vary greatly between countries. Even for what seems like an easily defined offense such as murder, definitions vary widely, and crimes like burglary, robbery, and se xual offenses are defined very differently across jurisdictions. These differen ces are strongest when comparisons are made between entirely different legal trad itions, and there are many in the Caribbean. In addition, the point in the criminal justice pr ocess when an alleged offense is recorded as a crime differs greatly between countries. This complicates comparison between civi l law jurisdictions (such as in Spanish-speaking Caribbean coun tries) and common-law jurisdictions (such as the Anglophone states of the Caribbean). Box 1.1 Crime Definitions The following definitions of crime types are used by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the biennial Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems: Intentional homicide is death deliberately inflicted on a person by another person, including infanticide. Assault is physical attack against the body of another person, including battery but excluding indecent assault. Rape is sexual intercourse w ithout valid consent. Robbery is the theft of property from a person, overcoming resistance by force or threat of force. Theft is the removal of property without the property owner's consent. Automobile theft is the removal of a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner of the vehicle. Burglary is unlawful entry into someone else's premises with the intention to commit a crime. Kidnapping is unlawfully detaining a person or persons against their will (or national equivalent, e.g. using force, threat, fraud or enticement) for the purpose of demanding for their liberation an illicit gain or any other econ omic gain or other material benefit, or in order to oblige someone to do or not to do something. 1.11 Another issue is the useful ness of crime rates in ve ry small countries. Small countries typically stand out in the global rankings of a num ber of variables when these figures are calculated as a rate per 100,000 citi zens, because a relatively small number of incidents can result in high ra tes. Many countries and territo ries in the Caribbean have populations of less than 100,000. Low populations also make interpre tation of rates over time difficult, since trends tend to be erra tic. The figure below showing murder rates in Anguilla (population 10,000-16,000, depending on s ource) illustrates this point. Since 1995 Anguilla has experienced either zero, one, or two murders per year\u2014yet the 6difference between zero and two murders is enough to move Anguilla from a low to a high murder rate (see Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4: Murders per 100,000 Population by Year, Anguilla 10 010 009 017 16 8 024681012141618 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004Police recorded murders per 100,000 Source: Anguilla Statistics Unit. 1.12 Crime rates are based on the ratio of crimes to full-time residents, but the actual population of small countries with large tour ist industries can swell considerably during peak tourism periods. For example, the Baha mas, with a resident population of about 321,000, received nearly 1.5 million stay-over tour ist arrivals in 2003 (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2004). Any of these people could have become a crime victim or perpetrator during their stay, so the ratio of crimes to the reside nt population can be deceptive. 1.13 To complicate matters further, there are frequently significant discrepancies in crime rates within a country depending on the so urce of the data. In the case of homicide rates, police and public health data sometimes differ substantially. The case of Guyana is instructive: two different murder counts are published in the same statistical bulletin\u2014 one from the police and one from the ministry of health. This difference is not surprising since public health definitions differ from thos e used in the criminal justice system, but the ratio between the two varies also consid erably over time. The public health figures show a clear increasing tr end, while the police figures do not (see Figure 1.5). 7Figure 1.5: Number of Murders in Guyan a, Police and Public Health Sources 91 7479 335167 0102030405060708090100 1999 2000 2001Murders per 100,000 Police Ministry of Health Source: Guyana Bureau of Statistics, 2005. 1.14 UNODC attempts to overcome some of these difficulties through its biannual Survey on Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, or CTS. A questionnaire is sent to all United Nations Me mber States giving standardized definitions of each crime type and asking the respondents to fit their crime figures into the appropriate categories. Of cour se, this is a difficult exerci se, and it is not clear how carefully each respondent complies, but it does provide a better basis for comparison than the figures published by the national police forces. 12 In the discussion that follows, the CTS data is used, but this data must be tr eated with caution for al l the reasons described above. HOMICIDE AND ASSAULT 1.15 Murder figures are generally considered th e most reliable indicator of the violent crime situation in a country, since most murd ers come to the attention of the police, which is not the case with crimes like robbe ry and domestic violence. But definitions of murder still vary widely. In some countries , attempted murder is included, since legally this is deemed equivalent to the completed ac t, while in others \"culpable\" homicides (the killing of another through r eckless behavior) are included. 12 Unfortunately, not all Member States supply this information, or they do so erratically, and so global coverage is far from complete. Obviously, countries with extreme stability problems are not able to provide reliable statistics, and it is precisely in these areas th at the problems are likely to be worst. For example, little police data are available for Haiti, a country wh ich is probably one of the more dangerous in the region. 81.16 For these reasons, it is best to use standa rdized data (such as those gathered by CTS or Interpol) for comparative analysis. Unfortunately, the data from both CTS and Interpol are far from complete in this regi on. Time series CTS figures for the Caribbean are limited to four countries and Interpol fi gures to two, and even these two data sets differ in many respects. 1.17 Aside from the police statistic s, public health authoritie s maintain records of the numbers of murders in many countries, wh ich are collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) and their regional affiliates. These public health data are available for a wider range of countries than are CTS data, including very small countries. Public health definitions of murder are generally more expansive than those of criminal law, so these figures will be grea ter than those reported to the UNODC and Interpol. 1.18 According to figures published by the WHO from 2002, a number of Caribbean countries record a rate of death due to violence 13 in excess of the unweighted average of the 191 countries reporting worldwide, but far below the rates of countries like Colombia, Sierra Leone, or El Salvador (see Figure 1.6). These countries include countries with acknowledged violence issues, such as th e Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as some surprises, such as St. Kitts and Ne vis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. WHO data for Jamaica are clearly in error. Acco rding to WHO data Jamaica has one of the lowest rates of intentional violence in th e world. According to the police statistics, however, the homicide rate was 56 per 100,000 residents in 2005\u2014one of the highest rates in the world (Jamaican Constabulary Force, 2006). 1.19 Where no standardized data are available, national police statistics can give us a sense of trends within a country over tim e. The Jamaican Constabulary Force makes long-term comprehensive statistics available to the public, and the trend for Jamaica is quite remarkable (see Figure 1.7). After a p eak during the politica lly-driven violence of the 1980 election, murder rates dropped to pre- election levels and were relatively stable throughout the 1980s. It was during this period of time that many Jamaican criminal groups (\"posses\") were active in the crack cocaine markets of the United States (Gunst, 1995). Ironically, as the crack trade declined, Jamaican murder rates went up. This may be due to former traffickers turning to income sources more directly rooted in violence, such as extortion. It may also be a symptom of the declining political control of the \"area dons\" in the \"garrison\" communities and the pro liferation of a larger number of \"corner dons,\" more likely to victimize their own c onstituencies (Mogensen, 2005), or it may also be related to the deportation of some Jamai can criminals that had been preying on the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada (see Chapter 6). 1.20 Between 1982 and 1997, the homicide rate more than doubled in Jamaica; from 2003 to 2005 alone, the homicide rate rose from 36 to 58 per 100,000, before falling to 49 per 100,000 in 2006. Jamaica authorities attribute the 15% declin e in the homicide rate in 2006 to law enforcement action. While the recen t decline is encouraging, murder rates in Jamaica remain among the highest in the world, and similar rapid reductions in the past 13 Violence in this context is defined as intentional violence minus suicides and war deaths. 9have not abated a long-term upward trend. Sti ll, more than 200 peopl e are alive today that would not have been had the murder rate remained at 2005 levels.

An average of about 75 to 125 murders occurred annually since 1978, aside from brief peaks in 1991 and 2002-2003. The most recent increase has been attributed to gang warfare in the Buxton area (Guyana Government Information Agency, 2004). Gi ven the small population (about three quarters of a million people), the murder rate is quite volatile and has varied from a low of about 10 per 100,000 in 1986 and 2000 to a high of 27 per 100,000 in 2003. As noted above, the police figures differ considerably fr om Ministry of Health figures, which were higher to varying degrees in 1999 (33 murders per 100,000 versus 12), 2000 (51 versus 10) and 2001 (67 versus 19). 1.22 Shorter time series on homicide rates ar e available for the Dominican Republic, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago (see Fi gure 1.8). All three countries show rapidly rising rates over the 1999-2005 period. In the Dominican Republic, the homicide rate almost doubled, from 14 to 27 per 100,000. In St . Lucia, the rate more than doubled, from 9 to 20, and in Trinidad a nd Tobago the rate more than quadrupled, from 7 to 30 per 100,000. 10Figure 1.7: Homicides per 100,000 in Guyana and Jamaica 0111213151415171618 12131225 1416 49 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 YearPolice-recorded murders per 100,000 Guyana Jamaica Sources: Jamaica Constabulary Force, 2006 ; Guyana Bureau of Statistics, 2005. 1.23 According to the police statistics, the French d\u00e9partements (provinces) in the Caribbean also show remarkably high murder ra tes, despite their relative affluence. Out of 100 French d\u00e9partements , Guiana ranks first in terms of homicide, suffering a total of 94 murders in 2004, for a police recorded murder rate 51 murders 100,000.14 Guadeloupe and Martinique ranked third and fourth of 100, with 11 and 10 murders per 100,000 respectively (Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire, 2005). 1.24 In sum, homicide rates in the Caribbean are quite high by world standards. For the majority of countries for which time series data are available, homicide rates seem to be rising quite rapidly. Guyana is a notable exception to this trend. 1.25 While most murders make it to the attent ion of the police, lesser assaults are clearly highly reliant on reporting. The count ry's attitude toward domestic violence is pivotal, as is the level of trust in the lo cal police. Figure 1.9 repo rts assault rates for countries with available CTS data. Even Do minica, with its 93 assaults annually per 100,000 citizens, is far in excess of the unweight ed average of 10 for the 89 countries for which comparable data are available. The Ba hamas reports the highe st rate in the CTS dataset: 1,697 per 100,000, twice as high as th e second highest rate recorded: 754 per 100,000 in Swaziland, a world leader in murder. This high rate is probably attributable to genuinely high levels of violence, possibly aff ected by the tourist influx, combined with high rates of reporting to a trus ted police force. Victimization surveys are needed to even 14 This is much higher than its closest rival, Southern Corsica, which registered 21 murders per 100,000. 11approximate true levels of assault, yet sta ndardized victimization surveys have rarely been undertaken in the Caribbean.

But given the fact that most of the rapes reported did occur, high rape rates do reflect a serious problem. Acco rding to the latest available CTS data, three of the top ten reco rded rape rates occur in the Caribbean, including the top rated: the Bahamas. A ll countries in the Caribbean for which comparable data are available experienced a higher rate of rape than the unweighted average of 102 countries respondi ng to the CTS: 15 rapes per 100,000. Figure 1.10: Rape Rates in Caribbean and Comparison Countries 0151825344551112121133 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140Saudi ArabiaWorldwide AverageTrinidad and TobagoBarbadosDominicaSt. Kitts and NevisJamaicaSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesSwazilandBahamas Reported Incidents of Rape per 100,000 Source: Crime Trends Surveys - United Nations (various years). 1.27 According to police records in the Dominican Republic, women between the ages of 15 and 34 account for nearly two-th irds of all violent deaths among women, despite only representing 36 percent of the female population (ALEPH, 2006.) Those at highest risk are young women working as domestic laborer s and those having recently ended an intimate relationship. In approximate ly 63 percent of cases , the perpetrator is the victim's husband (boyfriend) or ex-hus band (ex-boyfriend), followed by mothers (14 percent) and fathers (10 percent) (C aceres, F. and G. Estevez, 2004). 1.28 Police statistics offer only a very imperf ect picture of violence against women, since the majority of these inci dents are not reported to police. To get a more precise idea 15 Violence against women was defined by a declaration of the General Assembly of the United Nations (Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Wo men, 1993) as \"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arb itrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\" 13of prevalence rates, one must use victimiza tion surveys that focus on violence against women. Unfortunately, as is the case with other crimes, there are no victimization surveys using a common methodology that have been widely used across the Caribbean to document levels of violence agains t women (see Ellsberg and Heise, 2005).16 Consequently, we are left with isolated, c ountry-specific data on prevalence rates; while this is undoubtedly better than relying on country-specific offi cial crime reports, it does not allow cross-country comparisons. 1.29 One notable exception is a regional study car ried out in nine Caribbean countries in 1997 and 1998 on adolescent health. According to this study, 48 percent of adolescent girls' sexual initiation was \"forced\" or \"somew hat forced\" in these nine countries (see Halcon et al, 2003).17 In Kingston, Jamaica in the ear ly 1990s, 17 percent of 13 and 14 year-olds had been raped or been victim s of attempted rape, and 33 percent had experienced unwanted physical c ontact or verbal enticements to have sex (Walker et al., 1994). 1.30 While there has been no comparable methodology used in a large number of Caribbean countries on domestic violence, national level prevalence studies generate surprisingly similar victimization rates. In Haiti, a recent DHS survey found that 28.8 percent of ever-married women had been beat en by a spouse. Older data from nationally representative surveys undertaken in An tigua and Barbuda and Barbados in 1990 indicated that 30 percen t of all women in each country had been victimized by physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner at some point in their lives (see Heise et al, 1999).18 These lifetime prevalence rates are with in the range of those found outside the region in a study recently undertaken by the Wo rld Health Organization. Rates of lifetime physical violence ranged from a low of 12.9 pe rcent in urban Japa n to a high of 61 percent in rural Peru, with a non-population weighted average prev alence rate of 36.3 percent over the 15 study sites in the ten countries (Garc\u00eda-Moreno, C. et al., 2006). 1.31 In sum, violence against women seems to be endemic in Caribbean countries\u2014 as it is in most countries around the world. PROPERTY CRIME 1.32 As the preceding sections have shown, th e rate of murders is the single best crime statistic for comparative analysis. Data on property crime are far less reliable, since the rates of reporting the various offenses vary so greatly between jurisdictions and across time. In wealthier countries, a greater share of the popula tion may have insurance and thus strong incentives for reporting victimiza tion. These countries may appear to have much higher rates of property crime than poorer areas. Similarly, in some countries 16 Standard victimization surveys do not do a good job of capturing violence against women. Special protocols are needed, both to protect the safety of interviewers and respondents, and to elicit accurate answers. 17 32 percent of male adolescents' first intercourse wa s forced. The nine countries and territories were: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, British Virg in Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, and St. Lucia. 18 In Antigua and Barbuda, the sample was of women ages 29-45, while in Barbados it was women 20-45. 14reporting minor crimes is seen as a civic duty, even if the prospects for a positive outcome are poor. If there were good victim survey data indicating the level of under- reporting, the police figures could be interp reted in this light. Unfortunately, only Barbados has participated in the ICVS surveys. 1.33 Generally speaking, the best reported prope rty crime is vehicular theft, and it is often used as an indicator of overall propert y crime levels. There are two problems with doing this in the Caribbean. First, the opportuni ties to successfully st eal a car are limited on small islands, so vehicular theft rates may not be indicative of overall property crime levels. Second, since not everyone owns a car, the rate of property theft should properly be calculated as the number of incidents per motor vehicle in the country, not per 100,000 population. However, recent and reliable inform ation on the number of vehicles in the Caribbean is not available. 1.34 The fact that reporting rates are key determinants in the levels of recorded crime is demonstrated by the available statistics on other forms of property crime. Australia leads the world in reported burglary rates, with Dominica scoring third, after Denmark (United Nations Crime Trends Survey, various years). While it is possible that some of the most developed countries, with low levels of inequality, suffer from extreme levels of burglary, it is more likely that this offense is simply under- reported in countries where it actually occurs more often. 1.35 Theft rates are subject to even higher levels of under-reporting. It is highly unlikely, for example, that Demark has an incidence of major th eft 7,000 times higher than in Poland (3,449 episodes per 100,000 pers ons in Demark, versus 0.5 per 100,000 in Poland). Dominica has the sec ond highest rate of recorded major theft among the 65 countries reporting this figure in the Crime Trends Survey, but the meaning of this distinction is highly dubious. 1.36 Given what is known about other aspects of crime in the region, it is highly unlikely that Dominica, which bills itself as \"the nature island of the Caribbean\" has 20 times the burglary rate and 30 times the theft rate of Jamaica, an island with acknowledged crime problems. 152. ORGANIZED CRIME Organized crime in the Ca ribbean is involved in a variet y of activities, among which the most widespread is drug traffic king. In 2005, it is estimated that about 10 tons of cocaine transited through Jamaica, and 20 tons went through Haiti or th e Dominican Republic. However, the flow of drugs through the region has decreased with the shift of trafficking to the Central American corridor. Cannabi s production for export from Jamaica, the largest producer in the region, also appears to be in a slump. Bu t demand from Europe may be increasing, and much of this traffic transits the Caribbean. Kidnapping and corruption also affect the region. Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago have seen recent and rapid increases in kidnappings . There appears to be wide variation in levels of corruption in the region. A ccording to Transparency In ternational's 2006 Corruption Perceptions Index, Haiti is perceived to be the country in the wo rld with the highest levels of corruption, while Barbados was ranked among the least corrupt. 2.1 Violence in the Caribbean is aggravated by the presence of organized crime. There are no internationally comparable sta tistics on organized cr ime generally, but its activities can be detected in conventional crime statistics, as well as in seizures of contraband, particularly drugs. This inform ation is supplemented by details emerging from criminal cases, as well as criminal in telligence, largely from developed countries. 19 DRUG TRAFFICKING 2.2 Despite their diversity, one thing all Caribb ean countries have in common is that they have long been caught in the crossf ire of international drug trafficking. The Caribbean suffers greatly from the supply from the south and the demand in the north. Drug flows through a country can aggr avate crime in a range of ways: They produce local drug use problems, as cour iers are often paid in product rather than cash and are compelled to sell on local markets. Th is has secondary effects on domestic crime problems, including youth gangs, prostitu tion, and market- related violent and property crime. Drug transactions involve firearms, and firearms are often traded for drugs. Movement of drugs inevitably involves corruption of local law enforcement officials, as well as other civil servants. Laundering the proceeds of drug sales unde rmines legitimate economic activity. 19 Since the United States is the main source of drug demand affecting the Caribbean, U.S. information sources are used extensiv ely in this chapter. 162.3 The good news is that the flow of drugs through the region may be decreasing: The transshipment of cocaine to the Unite d States, the most significant flow in economic terms, has declined, as cocaine consumption in the United States dropped from its high levels in the 1980s (see National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2005). 20 Cannabis production for export from Jamaica, the largest cannabi s producer in the region, appears to be in a slump (see Royal Canadian Mounted Police Criminal Intelligence Directorate, 2005).21 On the high end of the market, Jamaican cannabis faces competition from the growing popularity of indoor-produced sinsemilla in consumer countries in North America and Europe. 22 Partly as a result, cannabis eradication rates droppe d sharply after 1999, though they have recovered somewhat since then (see Figure 2.1).23 The Caribbean has traditionally been the preferred drug transs hipment corridor of Colombian organized crime groups, often wo rking with wholesalers and retailers from the Dominican Republic. For a numbe r of reasons (including effective law enforcement in the Caribbean, the break- up of the major Colombian cartels, and growing stability in Colombia), Mexican organized crime groups have supplanted the Colombian organizations throughout much of the United States. Mexican groups prefer to transship along the Cent ral American coast and then across the U.S./Mexico border. They also prefer to market Mexican-produced cannabis on the low end of the market24 (see Figure 2.2 for the most commonly used transport corridors for the shipment of cocaine to the U.S.). 20 While changes in the methodology of the national household surveys in the United States make long- term national comparisons problematic, cocaine use among U.S. high school 12th graders plummeted from 13.1 percent annual prevalence in 1985 to 5.1 percent in 2005. 21 The one area where the Caribbean continues to dominate is hash oil, a product Central and Atlantic Canada have long imported from Jamaica. Jamaican traffickers in Ontario are responsible for smuggling hash oil directly from the Caribbean and also manufacturing it within Canada. 22 The share of sinsemilla in cannabis samples submitted to the Marijuana Potency Monitoring Project, which tests every seizure in which federal agents are involved, grew from 5 percent in 1985 to 31 percent in 2003. This sinsemilla averaged 14 percent THC in 2003, much higher than most field-grown cannabis. 23 See Annex 2.1 for a discussion of the Jamaican cannabis trade. 24 See Annex 2.2 for a discussion of patterns of drug transhipment by organized crime. 17Figure 2.1: 1999 2000 20012002 2003 2004Hectares eradicated Source: International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, various years.

For example, cocaine use rates in Spai n and England today are close to United States rates (see World Drug Report, 2006).25 Europol reports that 40 percent of the cocaine entering Europe transits the Caribbean.26 25 In 2003, adult annual cocaine usage stood at 2.7 percent in Spain and 2.4 percent in England and Wales. In the USA, it stood at 2.8 percent in 2004. 26 Europol, statements made at the Horizontal Drug Group (HDG) of the European Union, 10 January 2006. See Annex 2.3 for a discussion of cocaine transhipment patterns. 18 Canada also poses an alternative market, with a high level of cocaine use.27 In 2004, large (in excess of 100 g) seizures of cocaine were made entering into Canada from a number of countries in th e Caribbean, including Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Netherlands Antilles, G uyana, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Haiti, St. Lucia, Grenada, Barb ados, Suriname, and Dominica. Since 1993, the United States has beco me increasingly dependent on Colombian heroin (see Figure 2.3). In terms of value per unit volume, heroin is worth more than cocaine, and thus it is still most commonly trafficked using couriers on commercial air flights. Howe ver, many large volume shipments have also been detected. Synthetic drugs seem to be increasingly tr ansiting or originati ng in the Caribbean. For example, on 28 November 2005, 259,338 ecstasy tablets were found when three abandoned bags were seized at the ai rport in Puerto Playa, believed to have originated in the Netherlands and to be destined for the United States.28 In 2005, an LSD lab was discovered on the Dutch side of St. Maarten, (U.S. Department of State, 2006) a relatively rare find for la w enforcement anywhere in the world due to the difficulty of synthesizing this drug. 2.5 Thus, despite recent shifts and as indicated above, large quantities of drugs continue to transit the Caribbean. There are many reasons to expect that the Caribbean will continue to be a key drug transshipment area: Colombia remains the source of most of the United States' cocai ne and heroin, so the Caribbean will remain an attractive transshipment route. The Caribbean has language, historical, comm ercial, and legal ties to some of the major consumer countries, including th e massive tourism industry. These ties include daily direct air fli ghts and container traffic. The Caribbean diaspora, particularly na tionals of Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, are key in domestic drug distribution in parts of North America and Europe.29 Expatriates from Europe and the Un ited States living in the Caribbean further enhance this network.30 The torrent of remittances fr om expatriate populations, as well as a large financial services industry, provides cover for money laundering. 27 Annual use prevalence of 2.3 percent in 2004.

Radhames Antigua Sa nchez, Director CICC, Direccion Nacional del Control de Drogas, 1 February 2006. 29 See Annex 2.4 for a discussion of organized crime in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. 30 Some arrest data reported to the UNODC in response to the Annual Reports Questionnaire gives an interesting perspective into the role citizens of the former colonial powers play in drug trafficking in this region. In Jamaica in 2004, for example, there were n early as many foreigners arrested for drug offenses (221) as Jamaicans (234). The single largest group we re British (although some may have been British of Caribbean ancestry). There were 68 British citizens arrested for cocaine offenses, compared to 79 Jamaicans. Overall, there were more foreigners arrest ed for cocaine offenses (1 24) than Jamaicans (79). Similarly, in Suriname in 2004, 269 Surinamese were arrested for drug offenses, compared to 174 Dutch nationals. 19Figure 2.3: Origin of Heroin Se ized in the United States 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002Share of Heroin Seized South America Mexico Southeast Asia Southwest Asia Source: U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Heroin Signature Program (National Drug Intelligence Center, 2002, 2003 and 2004; Dr ug Enforcement Admi nistration, 1996) 2.6 It is not surprising, then, that of the 20 countries identified as major drug transit or major drug producing countries by the Unite d States government in 2006, four are in the Caribbean: the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica.31 In commenting on this list, however, the Un ited States government has noted the interdiction successes of the Baha mas and the Dominican Republic.32 In contrast, Haiti has received less praise for their cooperation with the United States, and has even faced being designated as a non-cooperating country.33 2.7 On the other side of Hispaniola, Domi nican authorities estimate that, in 2004, most (67 percent) of the cocaine enteri ng their country came by land, which means it came from Haiti. This is actually a substant ial decrease from 2003, when the figure was 90 percent (UNODC, 2004). The Dominican Re public is seen as a \"command, control, and communications\" center for dr ug operations in the Caribbean. It is also used to store drugs, before onward shipment to Pu erto Rico or the United States.34 31 United States Presidential Determination No 2006-24, September 18, 2006. 32 Statement of Acting Assistant Secretary of Stat e for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Ambassador Nancy Powell, Briefing on Ongo ing Diplomatic Activities at the UN and Other Current U.S. Foreign Policy Issues, Foreign Press Center, New York City September 15, 2005. 33 The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has been involved in the arrest of many individuals linked to former-President Artistide's Lavalas party, including former senators and senior police officials, such as the former chief of presidential palace s ecurity and former chief of the anti- drug police. The fact that Haiti does not seize as much cocaine as many of her neighbours is more reflective of law enforcement capacity then drug flows: the Haitian anti-drug police has only abou t 40 members.

Guevara, Chief of Operations of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, before the House of Representa tives Committee on International Relations, 10 October 2002. 202.8 The U.S. list does not include Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. Puerto Rico has the third busiest port in North America, and its commonwealth status with the United States means that any shipments leaving Puerto Rico are not subject to search in the United States. In 2001, the head of the United States Drug Enforcem ent Administration described Puerto Rico as \"an excellent gatewa y for drugs destined fo r East Coast [U.S.] cities.\"35 It has been the tradit ional transit area used by Dominican groups to bring cocaine into the United States.36 2.9 Cuba's relatively low ranking in terms of seizures has been attributed to recent enforcement efforts. According to the Nicaraguan police, seaborne cocaine has abandoned the routes along the Cuban coast due to increased patrolling, and now hugs the coastline of Nicaragua and Honduras.37 2.10 But there are few islands that cannot clai m annual seizures of over half a ton of cocaine at some point in the recent past (T able 2.1). In addition, substantial amounts of heroin have been seized in the Dominican Republic, Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and, most recently, Trinidad and Tobago. 38 The Dominican Republic in particular seems to be seeing an increasing flow of heroin, with seizures growing from seven kilos in 1998 to 122 in 2005. This is not surp rising given the role Dominican expatriates have played in drug distribution in the United States. 35 Statement of R. Marshall, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, 15 May 2001.

For the most part, drug use levels in the Caribbean are lower than in the destinati on markets, suggesting that high levels of organization have typified the market in the past. Today, however, in a number of countries, drugs are dealt on the street by loosely organized groups of young people. O THER FORMS OF ORGANIZED CRIME : KIDNAPPING , MONEY LAUNDERING , CORRUPTION 2.12 Other forms of organized crime affect the region as well. Three forms of important organized crime are kidna pping, money laundering and corruption.40 39 Unfortunately, the survey data on drug use in the Dominican Republic are rather dated. In 2001, heroin users comprised about 4 percent of the treatment population in the country, the highest share in Latin America except Mexico, where the drug is produced (5 percent). Authorities estimate that half of the ecstasy trafficked through th e country is for local use. 40 While there is some evidence that forms of human trafficking occur in the Caribbean, there is little data on the scale of this problem. There were only 56 convictions in the entire Western Hemisphere for human trafficking in 2004, up from 27 in 2003. Compare this to Europe and South Asia, both of which lodged over 1,200 convictions in 2004. See Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, 2005 . 222.13 Official statistics on kidnapping are not reflective of the extent of a kidnapping problem in a country. There are several reas ons for this. Definitions of kidnapping vary greatly, from the very specific offense of a bducting a child for the purpose of extorting money out of parents to more generic laws proscribing moving people against their will. Most kidnapping laws do not distinguish betw een the unlawful remo val of a person for non-financial motives (such as often occurs during a custody dispute over a child) and organized kidnapping for ransom. In some jurisdictions, kidnapping is often a supplemental charge brought in to strengthen a case that was really about something else, such as cases of abduction for the purposes of sexual assault. Perhaps most importantly, many kidnappings go unreported to the police, as this is often a demand made by the kidnappers as a condition for the safe return of the person. In fact, it is precisely in countries where kidnappings are common that reporting ofte n declines, as professional negotiators enter the picture and supplant the role of official law enforcement. 2.14 Thus, it is more useful to look at trends within a country than to compare rates across countries. Using this metric, two c ountries in the Caribb ean have seen rapid increases in their kidnapping ra tes in recent years. The ki dnapping rate nearly doubled in Trinidad and Tobago between 1999 and 2005.41 And in Haiti, the acceleration between September and December 2005 was meteoric : according to 2005 figures compiled by MINUSTAH, 56 individuals were kidnapped in September, 63 in October, 74 in November and 241 in December\u2014almost a ll in urban areas (United Nations, 2006). 2.15 Kidnapping is a relatively new problem for Trinidad and Tobago, possibly fuelled by wealth disparities, ethnic divi sions, and the proximity of the country to Colombia. While suspicion typically falls on the Muslim extr emist group Jamaat-al- Muslimeen,42 there is evidence that less organized criminals are tapping into this lucrative activity. The ransoms can be considerable: more than seven million U.S. dollars was paid out for the release of six members of the Greater Chaguanas Chamber of Industry after they were kidnapped in 2004 (Maharaj, 2004). Th e situation in Haiti may be even more dire, which is remarkable given that the crime really only emerged in the past two years. 2.16 Historically, the Caribbean has been susceptible to mo ney laundering for a number of reasons. It has long focused on pr oviding offshore financ ial services to the United States and European markets, but due to the small state capacity, did not have sufficient oversight resources. It is physically located along one of the world's premiere drug and cash thoroughfares. The tourism sector generates numerous cash-based businesses through which dirty money can flow undetected. The Dominican Republic provides an example of both of these technique s, as transport of bul k cash remains one of the primary means of transporting dr ug proceeds from the United States to 41 These figures are based on information provided by the Central Statistical Office of Trinidad and Tobago. 42 See Annex 2.5 for a description of Jammat-al- Muslimeen's activities in Trinidad and Tobago. 23Figure 2.4: 1012 101718 1319 02468101214161820 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005# of kidnappings per 100,000 population Source: Elaborated from Central Statistical Office of Trinidad and Tobago the country. Local casinos and currency exchange houses are also said to be a major channel.43 Finally, the region is the recipient of a huge number of small cash remittances from the United States and Europe, constituting up to 30 percent of the GDPs of some Caribbean countries (ECLAC, 2005).44 2.17 Considerable progress has been made in combating money laundering in recent years, in part due to measures to block terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering, a Caribbean inter-governmental body, has published a list of \"non-cooperativ e\" countries and territorie s since 2000. Four Caribbean countries and one territory (B ahamas, Cayman Islands, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) were placed on this list in 2000, and Grenada was added in 2001. By 2003, actions in all these countries and in the Cayman Islands led them to be removed from the non-cooperative list. 45 The FATF has been a major factor in Caribbean countries improving their policies to co mbat money laundering (Sullivan, 2006). 2.18 The United States government also publis hes a list of countries where money laundering is believed to be taking place. A nu mber of Caribbean nations are currently listed as \"jurisdictions of primary concern\" for money laundering by the U.S, State Department: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, the Dominican 43 Statement of Rogelio E. Guevara, Chief of Operations of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, before the House of Representa tives Committee on International Relations, 10 October 2002. 44 It is estimated that Haiti's remittances are around US $1 billion, while its GDP is only about US$3 billion. After the collapse of its coffee and offshore assembly sectors, Haiti's top sources of foreign exchange are said to be remittances, foreign aid, and the drug trade. 45 Bahamas and the Cayman Islands were removed in June 2001; St. Kitts and Nevis in June 2002; Dominica in October 2002; Grenada in February 2003; and St Vincent and the Grenadines in June 2003 (Sullivan, 2006). 24Republic, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis. It is important to note, however, that many major financial centers are also on the list, including the United States itself, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germ any, Italy, and the Netherlands , as well as many other countries. 2.19 \"Corruption\" is a broad heading for a vari ety of activities related to the misuse of public office, including the extortion of bribes, procuremen t fraud and related kickback schemes, and the direct embezzlement of publ ic funds. Not all of these activities are \"organized\" in the sense that large networks of individuals are c oncerned, but official corruption is extremely valuable to orga nized crime groups, and these groups play a strong role in promoting it, especially among law enforcement and border control officials. A case of corruption that had se rious impacts on the economy of the Dominican Republic is described in Box 2.1. 2.20 The Caribbean may be vulnerable to corr uption for a variety of reasons. In small states, the educated elite may be widely conn ected by blood, marriage, or social ties, and so it is difficult to distinguish nepotism fr om simple market necessity. Areas with a history of authoritarian governme nt may also be susceptible, as the lack of transparency during these regimes can create a culture of corruption that endures even after the coming of democracy. 2.21 While there are serious methodologica l concerns about Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Inde x (CPI), it remains the standard for international corruption compar isons, and boasts one of the fe w datasets with near-global coverage. In the 2006 CPI, Haiti ranked as th e country perceived as most corrupt in the world (163 rd out of 163 countries). Ranking for some other Caribbean countries were as follows: Guyana (121), Dominican Republic (99), Suriname (90), Trinidad and Tobago (79), Grenada (66), Jamaica (61), Dominica (53), and Barbados (24). 2.22 While Jamaica scores near the worldwide average in cross-country surveys of corruption, bribery and lack of transparency in government contracts are considered by Jamaicans to be important problems. Jamaica ranks poorly in perceptions of favoritism shown by government officials towards well -connected firms and individuals when deciding on policies and contra cts. This is closely linked with the pressure exerted on businesses by protection rackets, and reflect ed in the high perceived costs imposed on businesses by organized crime (World Bank, 2004). 2.23 The best quantified information on corru ption in the region comes from the Dominican Republic, a country that is included in the various cros s-national surveys of Spanish-speaking countries, as well as Transparency International's Corruption Barometer; it was, in fact, the only Caribbean country to be included in the 2005 Corruption Barometer report. According to the Corruption Barometer 2005, some 16 percent of the Dominicans surveyed had paid a bribe in the previous year, the average amount being equivalent to US$274 when adju sted for purchasing power parity. More than half complained that they had to pay a bribe in order to access a public service to which they were entitled and to avoid problems with authorities (Transparency International, 2005). The World Bank's Inve stment Climate Survey showed that 72 25percent of firms operating in the Domini can Republic reported \"being affected\" by corruption, and 21 percent of firms reported pa ying bribes in order to gain government contracts (World Bank, 2006a). 2.24 In the 2005 Latinobar\u00f3met ro survey, 72 percent of Dominicans said that corruption had increased \"a lot\" in the previo us three years, and 34 percent said they expected it to increase \"a lot\" in the next three years. Corruption among the police and political parties was emphasized. At the same time, 30 percent said that some progress had been made against corruption in the last year, but only 39 percent said that corruption would ever be solved (Latinobar\u00f3metro, 2005). Box 2.1: Financial Fraud in the Dominican Republic - The Baninter Case The Banco Intercontinental, S.A., better known as Baninter, began to experience liquidity problems late in 2002, due primarily to the alleged appropriation of funds by the bank's owners, and to a lesser extent because of an increase in deposit withdrawals. The bank had maintained a parallel bank with off-book operations through a system called \"Interbanco.\" This off-book portfolio was of very low quality, consisting of related party lending and inadequate due diligence: some 82 percent of all outstanding loans did not meet the minimum required approval procedures, the necessary collateral, or appropriate documentation indicating a commitment or intention to repay obligations. Registered losses accumulated from 1989 to December 2002 in the Interbanco amounted to US$1.2 billion, and by March 2003, Baninter's overdraft amounted to US$2.1 billion (Procura dur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 2006). In effect, this double accounting system hid overdrafts, representing not only a failure in banking supervision but also fraudulent practices by the bank's managers. The Central Bank provided substantial liquidity support during the 2002-2003 period, leading to a severe decapitalization that was remedied through issuing Central Bank debt at high interest rates. Subsequent audits of the use of these bail-out funds to Baninter revealed further instances of fraud, such as increased lending to related parties and high-ranking bank employees, continued misreporting of liabilities, and repayment of related party deposits and obligations including those in offshore affiliates, all in violation of the Monetary and Financial Law (e.g., banks receiving liquidity support are prohibited from issuing new debt). The total direct cost of the bank bail-out to three failed commercial banks in 2003 amounted to 21 percent of GDP, and Baninter accounted for the lion's share\u2014approximately 15-16 percent of GDP. The social and economic costs went beyond the direct cost of the bailouts: a rapid depreciation of the peso (due to a loss of confidence) led to very high inflation and a serious erosion of real incomes. Approximately 1.5 million Dominicans (about 16 percent of the population) fell below the poverty line in the aftermath of the banking crisis, 670,000 of whom fell into extreme poverty (World Bank and IDB, 2006). Although Dominican GDP growth has rebounded since 2004, the government and Central Bank continue to struggle to service the resulting higher debt stock. As of the end of December 2006, while the legal process continues, no one has been convicted of any crime related to the Baninter fraud. 263. RISK FACTORS FOR CRIME AND VIOLENCE Potential risk factors for cr ime victimization en compass conditions at the individual, relationship, community, and so cietal levels. As a whole Caribbean countries exhibit crime patterns similar to t hose in other countries. Both murder and robbery rates are higher in countries with low economic growth. Murder ra tes are also higher in poor countries and in communities that are poor and have large populations of young men. In Caribbean countries overall, homicide rate s are 34 percent higher and robbery rates are 26 percent higher than in c ountries with comparable ma croeconomic conditions. In general, the analysis implies that policies to reduce crime shoul d focus on improving economic conditions, providing opportunities to young men, and improving trust in law enforcement. 3.1 This chapter assesses the risk factors for crime and violence in the Caribbean. Some studies characterize this t ype of analysis as one of de terminants or correlates. The term \"risk factors,\" which comes from the public health literature, is used here to emphasize that while it may be possible to cau tiously infer causal relationships between crime and other variables, such relationships are not deterministic\u2014the presence of a single risk factor does not guarantee that violen ce or crime will occur. In addition, the use of the risk factors terminology emphasizes that well-designed interventions may succeed in counteracting those risk factors. 3.2 An analysis of risk factors is potentia lly useful in a number of ways. First, a profile of the primary risk factors offers an understanding of who is at risk for criminal victimization. This may be usef ul in targeting intervention s. Second, a profile of risk factors, when combined with theories of cr ime, can lend insights into the social process behind criminal activity, allowing for a better understanding of the nature of crime and ultimately leading to more effective anti-crime policy. C ONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF RISK FACTORS FOR CRIME AND VIOLENCE 3.3 Economists have traditionally conceptua lized criminal behavior as a rational decision made taking into account the expected benefits compared to the expected costs.46 The economic approach tends to lead to a focu s on factors which direc tly affect the costs and benefits of participating in criminal activ ity: the relative returns of crime versus legal activities, the probabi lity of being apprehended and c onvicted, and punishments for those convicted. 3.4 The analysis in this chapter seeks a wider perspective. A useful approach to conceptualize the various influences on crim e and violence is the so-called ecological model (see Figure 3.1), which is broad enough to encompass a wide variety of theories from economics, sociology, and public health. The ecological model identifies four levels of influence on criminal and violent behavi or. Individual factors include characteristics such as education level, marital status, a nd biological endowments. Relationship factors cover relations with peers, partners, and fa mily. At a higher level, community factors 46 A long line of research in this fra mework begins with Becker (1968). 27include the broader context of social relati onships in environments such as schools and neighborhoods. Finally, at the broadest level, th ere are societal factor s such as cultural norms and economic conditions that al so influence violence (WHO, 2002). Figure 3.1: Ecological Model for U nderstanding Crime and Violence Source: World Health Organization (2002). 3.5 This chapter presents two types of analys is. First, it shows results from a macro- analysis of risk factors for crime, usi ng country-level data from around the world. Second, it provides insights from an analysis of household-level cr ime data in three Caribbean countries: Jamaica, th e Dominican Republic, and Haiti. MACRO ANALYSIS OF RISK FACTORS FOR CRIME IN THE WORLD AND THE CARIBBEAN 3.6 Macro-level analyses can reveal how risk factors are associated with crime at the national level. These types of studies fall into two categories. Some studies examine trends over time in national crime rates in a single country and note how they are associated with changes in country-level variab les. Others look at variation in crime rates across countries to determine how various factors may influence crime, sometimes drawing on panel data with multiple observa tions over time for particular countries. 3.7 The different approaches have various advantages and disadvantages. While a study of time trends in a single country can be tailored to take into account the particular circumstances of that country, in most circumstances it is difficult to infer a causal relationship between other variables and crime with national data from just one country. Studies across countries can expl oit the large variati on in crime rates and other conditions across the world. Cross-country studies suffe r from several weaknesses, however. Cross- country crime data is often of questionable comparability; di fferences in official crime rates may reflect differences in definitions and reporting. Additi onally, at best cross- country studies produce estimates of averag e relationships, which may be of limited relevance to individual countries. In principl e, cross-country studies based on panel data should be of greatest interest. Only a few countries, however, produce long time series of crime data. 3.8 A few single-country studies have been conducted in the Caribbean. Ellis (1991) examines annual crime rates in Jamaica for the period 1950-84 and finds that high crime in the country is associated with periods of low economic growth, high unemployment, 28and a large cohort in the 14-24 age group. He concludes that increases in crime in Jamaica can largely be explained as the cons equence of economic decline, aggravated by changes in the population's ag e structure. Albuquerque a nd McElroy (1999) look at the case of Barbados and conclude that increased levels of property and violent crime there have been associated with worsening economic conditions and increased levels of visitor density. 3.9 This section presents a seri es of graphical bivariate comparisons of crime rates across countries with various risk factors and then proceeds to multivariate regression analysis. All the analysis is based on crime data collected from national police authorities by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) through its Crime Trends Surveys. The UNODC dataset used for the re gression analysis incl udes three Caribbean countries\u2014Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago\u2014along with 58 other countries. For the bivariate comparisons, the UNODC data is supplemented by additional data from other sources for some Caribbe an countries (see data sour ce description in Annex 3.1). 3.10 The analysis here is carried out usi ng both homicide and robbery data. Many cross-country studies use only homicide data, because differences in reporting rates and definitions are thought to be minimal for this crime. Robbery is included as well to add a perspective on how risk factors for viol ent crime and property crime may differ. 47 3.11 Figure 3.2 shows a co llection of scatter plots for murder and robbery rates against various variables. For all the plot s, each point corres ponds to a country, and points corresponding to Caribbean countries ar e labeled. The number of points in each plot varies because some variables are only available for a selection of countries. In particular, the number of Caribbean countries for which robbery data is available is limited. 3.12 One pattern that is clear from the scatte r plots is that both homicide and robbery rates exhibit strong inertia over time. In other words, countries that experience high crime rates in one period are very likely to have high crime ra tes in the following period. This can be seen in panels (a) and (b) of Figure 3.2, which show homicide rates in the period 1995-99 compared to those during the peri od 1990-94. There are several reasons why crime may show such persistence. First, crim inal activity may become more attractive to individual criminals both as they become more experienced and as their legal labor market opportunities diminish with the accumu lation of criminal records. Second, a society may fall into a high crime trap if, with a rise in criminal activity, increased social interactions with criminals re duce the social cost of crimin al behavior. Likewise, if the legal system fails to respond to a spike in the incidence of criminal behavior, so that the perceived likelihood of arrest and conviction decreases, future criminal activity may rise as well. The inertia of crime rates also may reflect a link between crime and other variables which are persistent over time. Finally, the inertia pattern may reflect correlation over time in the errors in the data for individual countries. 48 47 Robbery involves violence as well but can be considered a property crime with a violence component. 48 For discussion of some of the reasons for crime in ertia, see Glaeser, Sacerdote, and Scheinkman (1996), Leung (1995), Sah and Mocan, Billups, and Overland (2005). 29Figure 3.2: Cross-Country Correlates of Crime CRIME IS PERSISTENT OVER TIME a) Murder Rate: Late 90s vs. Early 90s BarbadosJamaica St.Kitts Trinidad & Tobago1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population, 1995-99 1 10 100 Homicides per 100,000 population, 1990-94b) Robbery Rate Late 90s vs. Early 90s Barbados Jamaica1 10 100Robberies per 100,000 population, 1995-99 1 10 100 Robberies per 100,000 population, 1990-94 COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER GROWTH RATES HAVE LOWER CRIME RATES c) Murder Rate vs. Growth Rate Antigua & BarbudaBarbadosDominicaDominican Republic GrenadaGuyanaJamaica St.Kitts Trinidad & Tobago1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population -5 0 5 10 % Growth rate of GDP per capitad) Robbery Rate vs. Growth Rate Barbados DominicaJamaica1 10 100Robberies per 100,000 population -5 0 5 10 % Growth rate of GDP per capita WEALTHIER COUNTRIES HAVE FEWER MURDERS AND MORE ROBBERIES e) Murder Rate vs. GDP per Capita Antigua & BarbudaBarbadosDominicaDominican Republic GrenadaGuyanaHaiti Jamaica St.Kitts Trinidad & Tobago1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population 1000 5000 10000 30000 GDP per capitaf) Robbery Rate vs. GDP per Capita Barbados DominicaJamaica1 10 100Robberies per 100,000 population 1000 5000 10000 per capita R2=0.656 (continued) Figure 3.2: Cross- Country Correlates of Crime COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER INEQUALITY HAVE HIGHER MURDER AND ROBBERY RATES g) Murder Rate vs. Gini Coefficient Dominican Republic GuyanaHaiti Jamaica Trinidad & Tobago1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population 20 30 40 50 60 Gini coefficient of income inequalityh) Robbery Rate vs. Gini Coefficient Jamaica1 10 100Robberies per 100,000 population 20 30 40 50 60 Gini coefficient of income inequality COUNTRIES WITH MORE YOUNG MEN HAVE HIGHER MURDER RATES i) Murder Rate vs. Young Men in Population BarbadosDominican Republic GuyanaJamaica Trinidad & Tobago1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population 12 14 16 18 20 22 % of population male age 15-34j) Robbery Rate vs. Young Men in Population Barbados Jamaica1 10 100Robberies per 100,000 population 12 14 16 18 20 22 % of population male age 15-34 MORE EDUCATED COUNTRIES HAVE LOWER MURDER RATES k) Murder Rate vs. Average Adult Education BarbadosDominican Republic GuyanaJamaica Trinidad & Tobago1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population 2 4 6 8 10 12 Average years of education for adultsl) Robbery Rate vs. Average Adult Education Barbados Jamaica1 10 100Homicides per 100,000 population 2 4 6 8 10 12 Average years of education for adults Sources: Own analysis.

This may indicate that higher growth reduces crime, by increasing opp ortunities in the legal labor market for those who might otherwise choose to engage in criminal behavior. The Caribbean countries in the sample have crime rates that are in all cases above the line showing the international tendency by GDP growth rate. In other words, on average countries in the Caribbean have higher crime rates than c ountries with comparable growth rates. 3.14 Countries with higher average incomes tend to have lower murder rates and higher robbery rates (see panels (e) and (f) of Figure 3.2). As with the growth rate plots, these figures show that each of the Caribbean countries for which data is available has a murder or robbery rate above the line s howing the international tendency by GDP per capita. Higher inequality, on the other hand, is correlated with both higher murder and burglary rates. 3.15 The remaining panels of Figure 3.2 show overall correlations between homicide and two other factors that are often linked to high level of violence. Higher murder rates are found in countries with larger populat ions of young men and those with lower average adult education leve ls. Robbery rates, however , show no correlation with education levels or youth populations. 3.16 To attempt to isolate which variables may be driving crime rates, multivariate regression analysis is applied to the da ta. This work draws upon similar analysis conducted by Fajnzylber, Lederman, and Lo ayza (2000) (referred to as FLL in subsequent references) for the 1970-1995 period. Li ke FLL, this analysis is a based on an unbalanced panel dataset from all countries of the world with available data. Each observation is the average of values over a five-year period for a particular country. 3.17 The regression analysis presented here di ffers from the FLL analysis in several ways. First, it incorporates the updated United Nations crime data from the period 1995- 99. (The second half of the 1990s is the last fi ve-year period for which the U.N. data is available for a large number of countries. ) Second, it uses the simpler OLS regression approach, rather than more elaborate regression techniques.49 Table 3.1 presents results from the basic country-analysis. The explanat ory variables used ar e the lagged value of the dependent variable, the grow th rate of GDP per capita, average income per capita (in logs), and the Gini coeffi cient of income inequality. 49 FLL employ the Arrellano and Bond generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator which attempts to control for endogen eity of crime determinants by instrumen ting the explanatory variables with lagged values of the explanatory variables. 32Table 3.1: Cross-Country Analysis - Basic Regression Results Variable Constant 0.914 ** -1.107 ** 0.998 ** Number of countries 61 54 61 54 Number analysis. UNODC for homicide and robbery rates; Penn World Figures for growth rate in GDP per capita and average income (per capita GDP); Deininger and Squire (1996) and World Development Indicators 2005 for Gini coefficient of income inequality. Notes: All regressions are OLS. 3.18 Like the bivariate comparis ons, the regression results s how that there is a strong element of inertia to crime rates and that higher crime rates are associated with lower growth rates. The regressions also show the same result as the scatter plot for average income: wealthier countries have lower homi cide rates and higher robbery rates. In particular, the results from the simplest specif ications show that a 10 percent increase in average income is associated with a decline of 0. 89 percent in the murder rate and a 1.74 percent increase in the robbery rate. The effect of inequa lity on crime implied by the regression results, however, is not statistically significant after controlling for past crime, growth, and GDP per capita. 3.19 Columns (3) and (4) of Table 3.1 display results using the basic specification plus a Caribbean dummy. Those results show that for Caribbean countries in the panel sample (Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago), homicide rates have been 34 percent higher and robbery rates have been 26 percent higher than in countries with comparable income per capita, growth rates, inequality, and past cr ime rates. Table A3.2 (in the Appendix) shows results from specifica tions which also include the average level of adult education and the pe rcentage of the population made up of young men (age 15- 34). Neither shows a statistica lly significant effect on crim e rates. The correlation of higher crime rates with lower education leve ls and large number of young men, apparent in the scatter plots, does not hold after contro lling for past crime rates, the growth rate, and average income. 333.20 Overall, the cross-country analysis can be summarized as follows: There are strong inertia effects to crime, which means that once crime rates are high, it may be difficult to reduce them . At the same time, crime-reduction efforts in the short-term are like ly to have huge long-term gains. As countries develop, violent crime te nds to decrease, while property crime increases. Inequality is associated with both vi olent crime and property crime, but the relationship does not hold after c ontrolling for other variables. Caribbean countries show similar pattern s to the world as a whole, but have higher crime rates overall. 3.21 Why do Caribbean countries have higher crime rates on average? The obvious candidate reason is drug trafficking. Although the countries of the Caribbean are very diverse along many lines, one thing they have in common is that nearly all are used as points for drug transshipment. De Albuquerque and McElroy (1999), among others, have noted that the rise of crime in the Caribbean over time coincides with the expansion of the narcotics trade. The U.S. Government's mo st recent annual report on the international drug trade, Department of State (2006), lists nearly every country in the Caribbean as a \"transshipment point.\"50 Large quantities of drugs are regularly seized by law enforcement in most Caribbean countries; of the top 20 countries in the world in terms of drugs seizures per capita, half are in the Caribbean.51 The Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas are a ll identified by the U.S. report as \"major\" drug transit countries. While the drug trade cl early does not explain all vari ation in crime rates across countries, it is undoubtedly an im portant contributing factor to crime and violence in the region. 3.22 It is very important to recognize the limitations of regression analysis. First, regression analysis provides estimates of aver age relationships between variables. In the case of cross-country regression s, the relationships are aver ages across countries of the world. There are inevitably exceptions which do not fit the average pattern. To take just one example, while the regression results show that higher growth rates are associated with lower crime rates, some countries experience both rapid growth and high crime rates, as has been the case for Trinidad and Tobago in recent years. But the regressions do control for other factors, whic h helps clarify the relationshi p between crime and growth. 3.23 It should also be noted that with all the relationships presented here there are multiple possible relationships between the vari ables. It may be the case that causality runs not from growth rates to crime but in the other direction, so that a higher rate of violence tends to decrease growth. Viewed fr om this perspective, the growth rates of 50 Specifically, the report lists the following countr ies as transshipment points: Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, the Netherlands Antilles, St. Kitts and Nevi s, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Given that such a large number of Caribbean countries are cl assified as transhipment points, it is not possible to introduce a \"drug tran shipment\" dummy variable in the cross-country regressions; such a dummy would be highly collinear with Caribbean region dummy. 51 This statement is based on analysis of the UNODC's drug seizure database. 34Caribbean countries are higher than would be predicted base d on their crime rates alone. It is also possible that the negative correlation between grow th rates and crime rates is due to a third factor which a ffects both growth and crime. 3.24 Econometrics offers a variety of strategi es for attempting to distinguish causal relationships from mere co rrelations. Unfortunately, co nvincing applications face a number of hurdles, foremost among them bei ng data requirements that are difficult to fulfill for cross-country crime regressions. Th e analysis in this chapter does not apply such techniques but instead uses the simplest form of regression analysis, ordinary least squares. Rather than making ha rd claims of causality, the an alysis in this chapter is presented in the spirit of providing suggestiv e evidence on possible relationships between crime and other variables. Note that th e primary finding from the cross-country analysis\u2014the fact that the crime rates of Caribbean co untries are above the rates predicted by purely economic variables\u2014does not rely on any causal story, but rather it suggests that given its economic performance, the Caribbean's crime rates are on average higher than what would be expected. 3.25 In Chapter 4 of this report, cross-count ry analysis is presented on the possible effects of growth on crime. In that case, the focus is necessarily on identifying a causal relationship, but the obstacles to doing so are no less daunting. 52 Also, the identification of any \"causal\" effect of crime on growth de pends on the assumption that past levels of crime are significantly different from current levels of crime, and in any case, this technique relies on technical statis tical properties of the data rath er than on an intuitive or conceptual identification of the causal effect of crime on growth. Consequently, readers should be modest in drawing strong causal conclusions from this analysis as well. RISK FACTORS FOR CRIME AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL : EVIDENCE FROM THREE CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES 3.26 While macro-level estimates are usef ul for providing a sense of average relationships between crime and other vari ables, country-specifi c studies based on microdata are useful for examining the circum stances in individual countries. Micro-level studies also allow for a more detailed exam ination of risk factors at the community, relationship, and individual level. This section considers risk factors for crime victimization, using victimizati on data collected at the household level in three countries: Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. The victimization data for Jamaica comes from the national population census conducted in 2001. The Dominican Republic data is from a household survey in 2005, matched with information from th e national census at the province level. Finally, the Haiti analysis is based on more limited crime victimization questions from a 2001 survey. 3.27 For all three countries, the micro-leve l risk factor analysis uses probit regressions, with crime victimization as an outcome variable and household characteristics as explanatory variables. The set of explanatory variables varies by 52 The growth-on-crime analysis empl oys the Arellano-Bond estimator that is sometimes used, particularly in the cross-country literature, to identify a causal relationship. When measurement error in the data is likely to be substantial, as is typically the case for crime data, the estimator is less reliable. 35country but includes both household and comm unity-level characteristics. Complete regression results from each country can be found in Annexes 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. Results from the regression analysis are summar ized in Table 3.2 and described below.

Notes: Table entries indicate results from multivariate regression results for each variable, for analyses from different countries and crimes. A plus sign indicat es a positive relationship, a negative sign indicates a negative relationship, \"not sig.\" indicates that results fo r the variable in question were not significant at the 10 percent level, and \"n/a\" indicates that the variable was not available for a particular country. See Annex 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 for detailed results. For Jamaica, results shown for violent crime are for murder and those shown for property crime are for robbery. Economic Factors 3.28 For Jamaica, the patterns of crime vi ctimization by consum ption level\u2014of both households and communities\u2014mirror the trends in the cross-national data: increases in wealth are associated with lo wer levels of violent crime a nd higher levels of property crime. In Jamaica, wealthier household ar e much more likely to experience property crime (robbery and the theft of agricultural goods), while p oorer households are more at risk to be victims of all viol ent crime. Additionally, households in poorer areas, even after controlling for the household-level consump tion, suffer higher risk of murder and wounding. On the other hand, households in wealthier areas are more likely to be victims of property crime. This last relationship can be seen in Figure 3.3, wh ich shows a scatter plot of robbery rates versus mean cons umption by neighborhood (census enumeration district.) 363.29 In the Dominican Republic, better off house holds are more likely to suffer from all forms of theft. Even after controlling for household-level welfare, all types of theft occur more frequently in wealthier provin ces. Provincial-level unemployment is also associated with higher levels of personal theft. Figure 3.3: Robbery Rates vs. Mean Consumption by Neighborhood Property Crime is More Prevalent in Wealthier Areas in Jamaica Source: Analysis of 2001 Population and Housing Census. Notes: For the purposes of the figure, observati ons with values of zero for robberies were replaced with the smallest value in the sample. 3.30 In Haiti, wealthier households are more lik ely to be victims of both burglary and mugging. The distribution of vi ctimization by quintile is shown in Figure 3.4. Robberies, burglaries, and muggings disproportionately st rike Haitians in the top two quintiles, who are most likely to have property of valu e. Personal injury victims, however, are concentrated in both the top and bottom quintiles. 3.31 The analysis does not find a consiste nt relationship between crime and inequality. In the multivariate regressions, all but one of the crimes show no relationship to community inequality levels; only the thef t of agricultural products from farms is found to be more prevalent in higher inequality areas. Count er to expectations, in the Dominican Republic vehicle thef t and burglary occur less ofte n in provinces with higher inequality. These findings differ from thos e from a similar study in South Africa (Demombynes and \u00d6zler, 2005) which found local inequality to be co rrelated with both violent and property crime, after controlling for plausible proxies for the returns from crime and non-crime activities. 37Figure 3.4: Distribution of Victimization by Crime and Quintile in Haiti Source: Own analysis of ECVH 2001. Note: The figure shows the percentage of victims of each crime who are in each income quintile. Demographic Factors 3.32 In Jamaica, households in communities in which female-headed households make up a larger share of the population are mo re likely to suffer from murder, shooting, and robbery. This finding is compatible with sociological theories that predict that female-headed households are more prevalent in areas with breakdowns of social ties, which may lead to more violent crime. The opposite relationship holds, however, for mugging in the Dominican Republic, and across a ll three countries there is no consistent relationship at the household level between victimization and female headship. 3.33 The presence of young males in Jamaican households is associated with higher rates of violent crime victimization, and the presence of more young males in the district is associated with higher homicide rates. More males in the househol d, however, are also associated with lower rates of property cr ime, which suggests that they may serve a protection function for the household, even tho ugh they are highly li kely to be victims themselves. 3.34 In the Dominican Republic, the presence of young males in the household is not significantly associated with crime victimization, but the pr esence of more young men in the province is strongly associated with all forms of property crime captured in the survey. In Haiti, however, there is no clear relationship between age structure and the likelihood of criminal Q_4 Richest 38Box 3.1: Haiti's Entrepreneurs of Violence Education 3.35 Jamaican households in less educated area s are more likely to be victims of all crimes. This may reflect the fact that the less educated have worse legitimate wage- earning opportunities and hence the supply of pote ntial criminals in such areas is larger. Patterns are less consistent for the education level of the househol d itself. Households with more educated adults suffer slightly more shootings and woundings but fewer robberies relative to the less educated. 3.36 The Dominican Republic analysis shows so mewhat different results. Households living in more educated provinces are at grea ter risk of muggings, while more educated households are slightly more likely to be victims of burglary and mugging. The Haiti results show no pattern by educat ion level of household members. Urban vs. Rural and Population Density 3.37 In all three countries, crime is chiefl y an urban phenomenon. In both Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, rates of victimiza tion are highest in urban areas for nearly all crimes, (an exception is crop and livestock th eft in Jamaica, which is necessarily more likely to occur in rural areas). These results hold even after controlling for population density. In Haiti, robbery, burglary, and mugging rates are highest in urban areas. All the crimes captured in the victimization surv ey in the Dominican Republic are more Political violence is not a novelty in Haiti's hist ory, and it neither started nor ended with the Duvalier regime, although this regime's violent record was unprecedented. \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier (1957-71) began to institutionaliz e political violence soon after he was elected in 1957, by establishing a force of cagoulards (\"hooded men\") charged with silencing supporters of rival candidates (who challenged the election results), as well as other dissidents, which gradually developed into a more extensive network of spies for the Duvalier regime. More recently, Haiti's democratic experience has fa iled to provide capable and stable governance. Initially, democracy was brutally repressed by the army and their supporters, using armed paramilitary groups that have been a feat ure of Haitian politics since Duvalier's macoutes . From Aristide's return in 1994, democracy was unde rmined by deep conflicts among erstwhile democratic allies, resulting in a political stalemat e that lasted almost fr om Aristide's return in 1994 until his departure in 2004, and which undermined economic growth and state building alike. Moreover, it transformed important parts of the democratic movement, the urban popular organizations, into agents for the Lavalas party, using brutal violence in struggles over territorial control and state favors. With Aristide's departure, some of these groups are bent on undermining the political process, in collusion with some form er political leaders. Thei r area of operation and influence is in the slums and \"popular areas\" that provide a rich reservoir of potential recruits. Violence and insecurity in these areas is perv asive and these \"entrepreneurs of violence\" are capable and willing to engineer violence for politic al or other purposes, as the line between political and criminal violence has become increasingly blurred. Source: \"Urban Violence in Haiti: A rapid assessment of socio-economic, political, and institutional causes of urban violence in Haiti.\" (World Bank, 2005) 39prevalent in areas with hi gher population density. In Jamaica, however, population density is positively associated with violent crime but negatively associated with property crime. Crime Reporting Prevalence 3.38 An important finding of this study is that in Jamaica, the reporting prevalence is negatively associated with crime rates. In other words, crime rates (as measured by victimization data) are higher where a lower percentage of crimes are reported to the police. This has multiple implications. First, th is suggests that offici al police data distort the true geographic profile of crime, because official data are biased downwards for higher crime areas. Second, the reporting rate can reasonably be plau sibly be interpreted as a measure of confidence in the police, as people will be more likely to report when they trust the police and believe they will respo nd. If this interpretati on is correct, lack of trust and confidence in the police is lower in areas with higher local crime rates. 3.39 This correlation could be explaine d by a number of different causal relationships. One possibility is that lower trust in the police leads to higher crime, because the police are less eff ective when they cannot count on the support and assistance of the population they serve. But causality c ould well be in the re verse direction, with higher crime leading to lower le vels of trust in police. This could be the case if people form their levels of trust based on their obs ervations of local crime levels. Finally, both distrust and high crime rates could be correlate d with a third factor not controlled for in the regression analysis. An unobserved variable , like a high level of social exclusion, could both drive high crime rates and in spire lower confidence in the police. 53 Summary of Micro-Analysis 3.40 Overall, several key points emerge. A lthough the precise rela tionship varies by country, local economic conditions are associat ed with crime. In particular, wealthier areas are consistently more likely to be the targets of property crime. In Jamaica, where information on both violent crime victimization and local conditions are available, violent crime strikes poor more than rich ne ighborhoods. Local inequality and crime victimization do not, however, have a clear relationship across countries. 3.41 The results related to dem ographic characteristics are mixed. Everywhere, crime is concentrated in urban areas, and crime rates are higher where there is a larger population of young males in th e Dominican Republic and Jamaica (for violent crime). Areas with large number of female-headed households in Jamaica suffer higher crime rates, but that relationship does not hold for the Dominican Republic. 3.42 In Jamaica, community levels of trust in the police, as proxied by reporting rates, are related to crime rates. This suggests that measures that increase the trust in police, or address the root causes for the lack of tr ust in the police, may help reduce crime. 53 Soares (2004) examines cr ime reporting rates at the national level, finding that reporting rates are highest in countries with longer periods of institutional st ability, more police per capita, and lower levels of corruption as measured by subjective indices. 403.43 It is important to note that the explanat ory power of these re gressions is fairly low.54 While many risk factors are strongly correla ted with crime victimization, it is still largely a random process from the perspectiv e of potential victims. Consequently, the costs of the threat of crime are universal. POLICY IMPLICATIONS 3.44 The analysis in this chapter points to a number of potential policy conclusions. First, the persistence of crime over time sh own by the cross-country regressions suggests that efforts to reduce crime in the short ru n may have very large long-term effects. Second, while the direction of causality between economic conditions and crime is subject to debate, the weight of evidence sugge sts that increasing levels and growth rates of per capita income reduce violent crime. At the same time, rates of property crime are higher in both countries and communities with higher incomes. 3.45 Additionally, the presence of large populations of young me n is associated with higher crime rates in comm unities. This suggests strongly that crime prevention interventions should be targeted at young men. 3.46 Finally, the fact that crime rates are highe r in areas in Jamaica where trust in the police is lower suggests that policies that im prove trust in the police, or address the underlying causes of a lack of trust in the police, can help reduce crime. Policies which improve the transparency of the police, re duce corruption, and make the police more accountable and accessible to citizens may be e ffective routes to bringing down criminal activity. 54 The highest pseudo R-squared values are 0.077 in Jamaica (for crop and livestock theft), 0.084 in the Dominican Republic (for mugging), and 0.068 in Haiti (for mugging). R2 values refer to the percentage of variation in the dependent variable which can be explained by the independent variables in the regression. In other words, the higher the value of the R 2 , the better job the explanatory variables do in explaining the dependent variable. 414. SOCIOECONOMIC COSTS OF CRIME There are a wide variety of approaches that ha ve been used to ca talog and measure the costs of crime and viol ence. Analyses for th e Caribbean have found t hat fear of crime causes individuals in Jamaic a, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti to avoid activities and locations that are percei ved as exposing them to risk of being victimized by crime. People whose families have suffered from crime report substan tially lower levels of life satisfaction, and this effect is much greater in the Do minican Republ ic than in non- Caribbean countries. Crime al so reduces tourist arrivals in the region, discourages business investment, and stifles economic growth. Cross-c ountry panel data suggests that Haiti and Jamaica could boost economic growth per capita by 5.4 percent per year if they were to bring their hom icide rates down to the levels of Costa Rica. Guyana and the Dominican Republic woul d also benefit subst antially, with potential growth rate increases of 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. 4.1 The literature on crime and violence covers a wide ground, and there are multiple typologies for the possible sorts of costs that could be contemplated. The World Health Organization (2004) draws a distincti on between direct costs (medical, legal, policing, prisons, foster care a nd private security) and indir ect costs (lost earnings and time, lower human capital, lower productivity, lower investment, psychological costs and other non-monetary costs). B uvinic and Morrison (1999) us e a more complex typology and distinguish between the following: Direct costs: the value of all goods and services used to prevent violence or offer treatment to its victims or perpetrators. This has been the most commonly estimated category of costs and includes health costs, police, justice and prison costs, as well as resources spent on private security measures. While the most frequently measured, this category may not be the most important. Non-monetary costs: higher mortality a nd morbidity rates that result in pain, suffering and death, but not necessarily re sult in either expenditures on health care or in easily quantifiable economic losses. Economic multiplier effects: impacts on hum an capital, labor force participation, lower wages and incomes, savi ngs and macroeconomic growth. Social multiplier effects: erosion of social capital, inter-generational transmission of violence and lower quality of life. 4.2 One also might distinguish between short- run costs of all sorts and the long-run effects on growth. An earlier report on you th in the Caribbean by the World Bank (2003a) lists the following costs: 1) arrest, prosecution, and detention of criminals; 2) property loss and damage; 3) medical costs, public programs for victims, and lost income of the victim; 4) intangible costs (pain, sufferin g, and quality of life); 5) security costs; 6) lower tourist receipts; 7) lost income due to incarceration; and 8) lost social capital. 42APPROACHES TO MEASURING THE COSTS OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE 4.3 There are a number of different methodol ogies that have been employed to assess the costs of crime and violence. Thes e include: 1) assessi ng specific costs; 2) adding up total costs using an \"accounting ap proach\"; 3) estimating total cost (more accurately, willingness to pay) using ec onometric methodologies; 4) calculating the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to violence; and 5) estimating effects on economic growth through cross-country regressions.55 4.4 Each of the methodologies has its rela tive strengths and weaknesses. Studies which look at specific costs analyze the e ffects of crime on pa rticular sectors or population groups without attempting to be co mprehensive\u2014i.e., without attempting to calculate the total cost of crime to society. 4.5 Among economists, the more popular appr oach has been to summarize the various costs of crime and violence in a single monetary figure that purports to represent the total cost associated with crime for a particular country. This is frequently done using an accounting approach, which collects data on the costs of crime in disaggregated categories and then sums up over cate gories (Buvinic and Morrison, 1999). This generally involves adding up all the assorted public and private expenditures associated with crime. 4.6 The accounting approach has both advant ages and disadvantages. On the one hand, a single number may be useful for summa rizing the myriad costs, for providing a comparison point to assess the cost-effectiven ess of interventions, and for communicating to economists and business interests used to thinking in monetary terms. It is also attractive in data-poor environments; if in formation is missing for some categories of costs, estimates can be generated using cate gories for which data are available (Buvinic and Morrison, 1999b; World Bank, 2006b). On the other hand, no single measure can capture all imaginable costs and any specificatio n of categories is nece ssarily arbitrary. 4.7 Another approach\u2014which does attempt to measure the marginal benefit of crime reduction\u2014is to estimate individual will ingness-to-pay for marg inal reductions in crime rates. This has been done in the case of Brazil, for example, by using hedonic housing models to estimate a relationshi p between housing prices and crime rates (Hermann and Haddad, 2003). It also could be done using contingent valuation methodology, which uses surveys to measure individuals' willingness to pay for reductions in crime. 4.8 A fourth approach is to estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to violence. The World Health Organization (2 002) has estimates of violence-related DALYs lost for a large number of countries ; DALYs are a widely-accepted measure of the health costs of violence. 55 There are also studies which attempt to measure the marginal willingness-to-pay for reductions in crime. No such study has been conducted in the Caribbean. 434.9 A fifth method is to estimate the effect of crime on growth using dynamic panel regressions. The growth effects approach ha s the advantage that is a summary measure which in principle captures the ultimate l ong-run effects of crime through many channels. 4.10 Rather than choose a single methodology to measure the costs of crime and violence, this chapter reviews a variety of work on its costs in the Caribbean, including several studies that estimate specific costs of crime, an accounting approach to measuring total costs, and estimates of DALYs lost due to violence. Also presented are new estimates of the effects of crime victim ization on a self-reported measure of life satisfaction. Finally, the ch apter builds on recent (2006) World Bank estimates of the impact of violent crime on gr owth to calculate the \"growt h dividend\" that could be produced by reducing the homicide rate in several Caribbean countries. SPECIFIC COSTS OF CRIME 4.11 Several studies in the Caribbean examine specific costs of crime. These necessarily cover a wide variety of types of co sts. Considered here are those that address the effects of crime on tourism, the non-m onetary effects of violence in poor urban neighborhoods in Jamaica, gender-based violence in Haiti, and private sector responses to crime. Tourism 4.12 Because of the key role th at tourism plays in many Caribbean countries, the effects of crime on tourism are of partic ular concern. In 2004, the Jamaican tourism minister said that Jamaica's unprecedented crime level was threatening to derail the tourism industry by scaring away visitors and hurting investment (Associated Press, 2004). A study of popular perceptions of those working in the touris m industry found that crime and violence were perceived as the ma in problem afflicting the tourism industry (Dunn and Dunn, 2002). 4.13 A few studies consider the relationshi p between crime and tourism for the Caribbean. Albuquerque and Elroy (1999) show ed that property crime tends to be disproportionately directed at tourists. None theless, King (2003) showed that the odds of being victimized as a tourist in the Caribbean are low. He suggested that perceptions of the danger of crime do affect tourism but that such perceptions are driven much more by mass media coverage in the sendi ng country than by actual dangers. 4.14 Alleyne and Boxil (2003) examined the relationship over time between tourist arrivals and crime in Jamaica and concl uded that crime has discouraged tourists, particularly from European c ountries, but that the negativ e effect of crime has been mitigated by increased advertising and promo tion and the growth of all-inclusive hotels. All-inclusive hotels, however, are incapable of fostering significant backward linkages to the rest of the local econo my. A new business model fo r tourism that goes beyond airlines, cruise lines and hotels to span th e entire \"destination experience\"\u2014restaurants, taxis, tour operators, cultural and heritage sites and scenic locations\u2014is necessary to 44generate backward linkages (World Bank, 2006a). This new model, however, cannot succeed if tourists are unwilling to leave all-inclusive resorts because of fear of crime. Non-Monetary Effects in Jamai ca and the Dominican Republic 4.15 Other qualitative work has examined th e non-monetary effects of violence. A participatory study in poor urban Jamai can neighborhoods (Moser and Holland 1997) considers the effects of violence. The st udy notes that resi dents of inner-city neighborhoods in Jamaica suffer from \"area stig ma.\" They are judged to be associated with criminals based on where they live, which makes it difficult for them to find employment. The study also considers the intang ible effects of viol ence on social capital, noting that \"violence erodes social relationships, not on ly through death, but by restricting physical mobility and increasing le vels of tension.\" Due to the high levels of violence in parts of urban Jama ica, residents are afraid to leave their homes and interact less often with friends and family who live elsewhere. 4.16 A similar phenomenon is evident in re sponses to the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares de Prop\u00f3sitos M\u00faltip les (ENHOGAR) survey conducted in the Dominican Republic in 2005. Surprisingly large numbers of respondents report that they have stopped doing many activities due to fear of cr ime. As can be seen in Figure 4.1, due to the high levels of delinquency, Dominicans ha ve reduced their recreational activities outside the house. Figure 4.1: Responses to Fear of Crime in Dominican Republic -What Do People Stop Doing Due to Fear? Source: Own analysis of ENHOGAR 2005. Note: Shown are the percentages responding in the affirmative to \"Which of the following activities have you stopped due to fear to crime?\" 4.17 Similarly, survey data from Haiti show that a high percentage of respondents are afraid of going to specific places due to fear of being mugged, attacked or having money or other belongings stolen.

Results from this anal ysis for lifetime physical violence by an intimate partner are shown in Table 4.1.56 Key results are that suffering from physical violence is strongly associated with an in creased likelihood that: i) women do not receive antenatal care; ii) women suffer from genita l sores and ulcers; and iii) both women and their children suffer from anemia. 56 Lifetime physical violence is phy sical violence suffered at any po int in barTo w orkTo the neighborsTo the bankTo visit people in this tow nTo the local marketTo the nearest larger tow nTo Por t- au- Pr inc e 46Table 4.1: Effects of Lifetime Physical Violence by Intimate Partner in Haiti OUTCOME VARIABLE Average net effect of lifetime physical violence by intimate partner (% increase or decrease compared to non-victims) WOMEN 'S HEALTH Weight for Height (centimeters x kilograms) -1,99% Anemia (severity degree 0-3; 0=no anemia; 3=severe anemia) 27,63%* Number of Children -5,46% % of Women who Ever had a Terminated Pregnancy 33,18% Last Child Wanted (index 1 =wanted -3=did not want more children) 5,53% Sexually Transmitted Disease (%) 55,12% Genital Sore /Ulcers (%) 116,22%* WOMEN 'S USE OF HEALTH SERVICES Visited Health Facility (%) 19,68% Antenatal Care (%) -17,88%** Births Assisted by Health Care Professional (%) 1,88% Unmet Family Planning Needs (%) 8,57% Contraceptive Use (%) 22,16% WOMEN 'S EMPLOYMENT Employed and Earning Cash (probability) 2,27%* CHILDREN 'S HEALTH (AGES 0-5) Diarrhea (%) 25,19% Coughing (%) 13,83% Anemia (%) 31,81%* Height for Age (centimeters x age in months) -5,79% Weight for Height (centimeters x kilograms) -3,41% Immunization (%) -13,73% Under 5 mortality (per 1000 births) # 17,43% CHILDREN 'S EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT (AGES 7+) Education Years -12,21% Education Gap 7,95% School Attendance (%) -3,96% Source: Propensity score matching estimates fr om Morrison and Orlando (2005), based on analysis of Haiti Demographic and Health Survey Data. * significant at 10% ** significan t at 5% *** significant at 1% # This is not a population child mortalit y rate.

This section reviews key findings from surveys of businesses on the costs of crime in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. The survey in Jamaica was carried out by Francis et al. (2003) as part of the background work for the 2003 World Bank Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). The results from the cr ime module of the 2005 Investment Climate Survey (ICS) in the Dominican Republic are presented in the country 's most recent CEM, World Bank (2006a). Figure 4.3: Impact of Crime on Vari ous Business Practices in Jamaica Source: 2001 Firm Victimization Survey, described in Francis et al. (2003). 4.20 Managers interviewed for the Jamaica st udy described how crime affected their business practices. Figure 4.3 shows the percen tages of managers indicating that crime had either a significant, somewh at significant, or highly sign ificant impact on particular business practices. Unsurprisingly, security clear ly dominates the impact of crime, with more than half of firms reporting that crim e increased security costs. Managers also indicated, however, that crime affects business decisions in ways that are likely to affect output in the long run. Thirty-nin e percent responded that they were less likely to expand their business because of crime, and 37 pe rcent reported that crime discourages investments that woul d improve productivity. 13%18%22%37%39%51% 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 0OtherIncreased cost of services purchasedNegative impact on worker productivityNegative impact on investments to improve productivityNegative impact on plans for business expansionIncreased cost of security % of Firms Reporting \"Significant\", \"Somewhat or \"Highly Significant\" Impact 48Figure 4.4: Measu res Taken by Firms in Jamaica Source: 2001 Firm Victimization Survey, described in Francis et al. (2003). 4.21 The steps taken by businesses to protect themselves from crime are varied and not limited to security measures narrowly defined. A summary of these responses is shown in Figure 4.4. Physical security measur es are the most common: 58.3 percent have installed protective grills on buildings, 49.3 per cent have special fencing, and 31 percent have installed alarm systems. Nearly half have unarmed guards, and a remarkable 30.8 percent of firms have armed guards. Many firm s (36 percent) have opted to close before dark; this practice has especially high cost s in the manufacturing sector, where second shifts are not used and productive capacity consequently sits idle. 4.22 Among the more troubling costs to busine ss are extortion and protection costs. Extortion occurs when a firm pays an exto rtionist in order to avoid victimization threatened by the extortionist. A protection ra cket, though similar, is distinguished in that the payment is in exchange for protection from criminal behavior from all other sources. To capture both types of coerced payments, the survey inquires a bout both. Notably, 8.5 percent of managers in Jamaica list payi ng for protection as be ing among their crime prevention measures, and 5 percent reported that they were force to pay extortionists. 4.23 Data from the firm victimization survey shows that security costs pose the largest burden for small firms. As shown in Figure 4.5, small firms pay security costs equal to 17 percent of their revenue on average, as compared to just 2 percent of revenue for firms overall. 4.24 Findings regarding crime from the ICS in the Dominican Republic were broadly similar to those from the Jamaica study. Seve nty-two percent of firms surveyed took at least one action to prevent crime. As in Ja maica, substantial numbers of firms reported that they installed security equipment or so ftware, hired security personnel, and closed before dark in response to the threat of crime (see Figure 4.6). 9%31%31%36%37%49%49%50%58% 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 0Hiring protectionHiring unarmed security guard(s)Special fencing accounting/records Installing grill % Using Measure 49Figure 4.5: Private Security Co sts for Firms by Size of En terprise as Percentage of Firm Revenue in Jamaica Source: 2001 Firm Victimization Survey, described in Francis et al.

Sixty-three percent cite crime as a major obstacle to i nvestment. Similarly, 57 percent indicated that their access to financing had declined as re sult of crime, although onl y 10 percent of the firms were actually victims of crime, illustrating the fact that the effects extend far beyond the direct effects on victims.

TOTAL COSTS : ESTIMATES USING AN ACCOUNTING APPROACH 4.26 Estimates using the accounting approach for measuring costs vary in terms of the extent of costs they meas ure. As part as the background work for this report, Holder and Mutota (2006) estimated that the costs of crime in Trinidad and Tobago in 2003 amounted to TT$1.098 billion (US$160 million), 1.6 percent of 2003 GDP. This estimate includes the value of lost productive years due to both fatal and non-fatal injuries, the value of the lost productivity of ex-criminals who have redu ced earnings capability after serving jail time, funeral costs, and business security costs. It doe s not include the costs of public security and other elements of the criminal justice system. 4.27 An attempt at a comprehensive study of the costs of crime in Jamaica was conducted by Francis et al. (2003). They incl uded both private and public costs in their summary measure. The study considered hea lth costs\u2014both those borne by the public health system and those paid by private citi zens\u2014along with the value of lost production due to mortality and injury related to crim e, public expenditures on security, and private expenditures on security. 4.28 Health costs are among the most importa nt costs of crime and violence in Jamaica. Violence has reached such high levels that it puts a substantial strain on medical services. A study of hospital-based data sugge sted that violence is the chief source of injuries in Jamaica. Data collected at thre e hospitals in 1999 and 2000 showed that 51 57%36%54%47% 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 0Worse access to financingHigher spending on formal anti-crime measuresHigher spending on informal anti-crime measuresLower worker productivity % of Firms Reporting Moderate or Significant Impact 51percent of injuries were viol ence-related, with the remainde r classified as unintentional (33 percent) and motor vehicl e-related (15 percent) (Shar on Arscott Mills, 2002). Other studies in Jamaica show similar figures.57 4.29 The Francis et al. study estimated th e public health costs of violence by calculating the share of emergency room admi ssions that are due to violence-related injuries and then multiplying that share by th e total cost of the public health system. Using this method, they find that the total annu al cost to the public health system is J$996 million or about 0.3 percent of GDP in 2001. 4.30 Private health costs for those hospitalized due to injury are estimated based on data from the 1998 Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions. Using data on the average cost of hospital stays, treatment, and medicati on for those hospitalized for violence-related injuries, along with the number hospitalized fo r such injuries, the total private costs from violence-related hospitaliza tion are found to be J$254 million, just under 0.1 percent of GDP in 2001.58 This estimate does not include the priv ate costs of treatm ent to those not hospitalized. 4.31 Apart from direct private health costs, some victims of violence are incapacitated and unable to ca rry out normal activities duri ng periods of convalescence. Survey data suggest that the average length of hospital stay for viol ence victims was nine days. Using information on the average wage and number of people hospitalized for violence, and assuming that a hospitalized vic tim is out of the workforce for two weeks, the value of time lost due to violence-relate d morbidity is estimated to be J$337 million, about 0.1 percent of GDP. 59 4.32 Another part of the cost of violence is the funeral costs for murder victims. Based on a poll of funeral service providers, the study estimates funeral costs to be J$66,000 per person average, for a total cost of J$64 million. The study also counts the time required for funeral preparations, which are found to have a value of approximately J$41 million. 4.33 Additionally, the study consid ers the output lost due to the loss of what the individual would have produced duri ng the year of his or her death. 60 They calculate this 57 Intentional violence cases accounte d for 39.4 percent of cases at emergency rooms at the University Hospital of the West Indies in 1996 and 43 percent of emergency room visits at public hospitals in 2001. (McDonald et al., 1999) and Francis et al. (2003). 58 An earlier study, Mansigh and Ramphal (1993) examin ed the costs of treating interpersonal violence in Kingston Public Hospital and estimated them at a value equivalent to $709 in 2001 U.S. dollars. 59 The study values the time of injury victims using the average weekly wage estimated in the study for murder victims of J$8423. While it is not clear in the study, presumably this average is among those who are employed. Because unemployment is high in Jamaica, this is likely to be an over-estimate of the value of victims' time in terms of wages. If not incapacitated by injury, some victims would be unemployed or out of the labor force rather than working. 60 Note that it would be preferable to calculate the net present value of a disc ounted lifetime stream of wages, rather than take the wages in one year. The us e of just one year's wages gives an underestimate of the future value of the individual's production. Calcul ations like this of the value of a person's life are controversial because they essentially assume that the life of a person with low-earning power is worth less than that of someone who earns more. 52by examining the occupational distribution of a random sample of murder cases in the previous three years and constructing a corresponding average wage. Multiplying this wage (on an annual basis) by the number of mu rder victims, they fi nd a total lost output of J$194 million. 4.34 Security costs dominate the total costs of crime as calculated by the accounting method. In the year examined in the study, the Government's budget for security services, including defense, ju stice, correctional services, and the pol ice, totaled J$10.5 billion or about 3.1 percent of GDP. Govern ment expenditures on the justice system and the police are oriented chiefly towards criminal cases; of all cases f iled with the Resident Magistrate courts in 2001, just 10 percent were civil cases. For the purposes of the costs exercise the full value of public security forces is counted as a cost of crime.

(2003). 4.35 Table 4.2 above summarizes the costs of crime as calculated by Francis et al. (2003). They find that the total costs of crime in 2001 came to J$12.4 billion, which was 3.7 percent of GDP. 4.36 It is important to note what costs ar e not included in th e 3.7 percent of GDP figure. First, this does not in clude the private security cost s to firms shown in Figure 4.7, which average 2.0 percent of fi rm revenue across all firms. 61 The Francis et al. study makes no attempt to quantify non-monetary cost s like the pain and suffering of victims and their families and the psychological effects of living in fear of being victimized. The estimate of crime's effect on GDP also does not take into account the long-run economic or social effects of violence, such as the impact of violence on cap ital accumulation and future growth rates. In part icular, there is a risk of a vicious circle, where violence- plagued neighborhoods receive little producti ve investment and hence offer few productive employment opportunities. The lack of opportunities, in tu rn, could lead youth to engage in violent and criminal activities. Nor does the cost estimate capture the fact that children who grow up in violent environments are themselves more likely to be violent as adults. This last effect\u2014sometimes called \"the inter-generational transmission of violence\"\u2014means that viol ence has significant inertia. 61 Because the firm survey is not re presentative of the population of Jama ican firms and because security costs as a percentage of revenue vary greatly with fi rm size, it is not possible to reliably convert the 2.0 percent of revenue figure into a percentage of GDP. 53DISABILITY -ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS LOST TO VIOLENCE 4.37 Another way to summarize the costs of violence is by examining the Disability- Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost to viol ence. DALYs are the standard international health measure of the burden of disease. DALYs express years of healthy life lost, summarizing both the years of life lost to mortality and the suffering or incapacity associated with morbidity (Mathers et al., 2003 ). An important strength of analysis based on DALYs is that it provides a clear basis to compare the impact of violence on health with impacts from other threats to health. 4.38 The World Health Organization (2002) publishes estimates of cause-specific deaths and Disability-Adjuste d Life Years (DALYs) lost, an d violence is among the listed causes. 62 One weakness of the WHO figures is that they measure only the direct effects of violence on those who are ki lled or injured and do not capture indirect effects on other individuals (such as increased stre ss levels or other reductions in the quality of life due to the fear of violence) or on society more br oadly (such as lowered saving, investment and growth). 4.39 The DALYs lost to violence are calculat ed based on two estimated components: age-specific rates of death (mortality) due to violence, and age-spec ific rates of suffering and incapacity (morbidity) due to violence. The WHO publishes the ove rall deaths due to each cause, including violence. 4.40 The quality of the WHO data varies enor mously by country. The reliability of the WHO data can be considered by examin ing the WHO figures on deaths due to violence with official homicide rates for each country. Figure 4.8 shows a scatter plot of the WHO data for 2002 vs. data from official sources for the closest available comparison period. The official source figures for Jamai ca, the Dominican Republic, and Guyana are the respective governments' published figures for 2002. The Haiti figure is calculated from responses to a 2001 household survey. Figures for other co untries are from government reports for various periods during the 1990s. 4.41 The figure shows that for particular count ries the WHO data are substantially in error. In the case of Jamaica, in particular , the WHO data appear to be significantly flawed: the WHO data for 2002 show a murder rate of 0.5 murders per 100,000 Jamaicans, compared to the rate of 40 pe r 100,000 reported by the po lice for that year. Likewise, the WHO's figure (10.2) for Haiti is less than a th ird of the estimate based on 2001 household survey data (33.9).63 For Guyana and the Dominican Republic\u2014the two other large countries in the region for whic h both official and WHO data are available\u2014 the WHO figures are also substantially belo w official homicide rates. Nonetheless, excluding the two cases where the data are clearly deeply flawed\u2014Jamaica and Haiti\u2014the WHO figures do not appear to show any syst ematic bias with respect to the official figures. For the remaining eight countries, th e WHO estimate is above the official figure 62 Jamaica homicide figures from multiple sources are examined in detail in the World Bank's forthcoming Jamaica Poverty Assessment (2006). 63 Note that the household survey-based estimate for Haiti has a wide confidence interval and is not as reliable as the estimates from official reports. 54in half the cases and below it the other half. These can be seen in the figure as the points that fall above and below th e 45 degree line. This suggests th at although there are problems with the data, for countries other than Jamaica and Haiti, the DALY figures are not necessarily over- or under-stated and may be cautiously interpreted as a measure of violence's cost in terms of health.

The largest numbers of DALYs lost to violence are in the region's largest c ountries: Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Guyana. In terms of population-standardized rates of DALYs lost, Guyana ranks at the top in the WHO figures, followed by St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Saint Kitts and Nevis. It should be noted, however, that because the populations of the OECS countries are sma ll, the population-standardized rates are sensitive to small errors in the DALY figures. 554.43 The rate of DALYs lost to violence in almost all Caribbean countries is above the worldwide average. The exceptions are Do minica, and the two countries for which the data is evidently in error: Haiti and Jamaica.

Overall, relative to all other causes, the impact seems to be relatively small, although this conclusion must be tentative because of the data problems affecting several countries in the region.

Figure 4.10 shows graphically DALYs lost to some of the other major categories. Other major health conditions, including HIV/AIDS, dwarf violence in terms of their impact on DALYs. For the Caribbean overall, DALYs lost to violence ar e equivalent to 24 percent of those lost to unintentional injury. 64 As a whole, the DALY figures suggest that the direct health impact of violence\u2014at least as measured in the WHO figures\u2014may not be the most important part of the effect of crime and violence at a societal level. THE IMPACT OF VICTIMIZATION ON SELF-REPORTED LIFE SATISFACTION 4.45 Another cost of crime and violence is the effect being a victim has on one's quality of life. It is we ll known that exposure to cr ime can have long-lasting psychological impacts on the vi ctims and those close to th em. However, very little empirical research has been conducted on the relations hip between crime and well- being.65 We analyzed the effect of being a victim or having a family member be a victim on subjective well-being, usi ng Latinobar\u00f3metro surveys fr om 18 countries in Latin America.66 The only Caribbean country included in the survey is the Dominican Republic. 4.46 In the Dominican Republic, controlli ng for a wide variety of personal and socioeconomic characteristics, those who have been victimized (or had family members victimized) in the previous 12 months are 8 percent less lik ely to say that they are \"satisfied\" or \"rather satisfied\" with life. The effect in th e Dominican Republic is higher than the average estimated effect of 4.4 per cent for the 14 countries surveyed. Full results from the analysis are shown in Annex 4.1. 4.47 It is possible that this reflects in part not a causal effect of victimization but rather the fact that victim and non-victim fam ilies differ along other lines relevant to self- satisfaction. For example, it may be that victimized families tend to live in particular neighborhoods with characteristics that make people both less likely to be satisfied with life and more likely to be victim s of crime. The long list of cova riates used in the analysis controls for such differences as best as possible using the available data. Overall, the analysis presented here provides reasonably st rong evidence that cr ime has a substantial impact on the quality of life of victimized families and that this effect may be particularly high in the Dominican Republic. 64 The WHO divides injuries into two categories: intentional and unintentional. Subcategories for intentional injuries are self-inflicted injuries, those due to war, and those due to violence. The subcategories for unintentional injuries are as follows: road tra ffic accidents, poisonings, falls, fires, drownings, and other. 65 One exception is Powdthavee (2005) , which examines crime and subj ective welfare data from a 1997 survey in South Africa. 66 The relevant questions in the survey are \"In general terms, how satisfied would you say you are with life? Very satisfied, rather satisfied, not ve ry satisfied, or not satisfied at all? \" and \"Have you or someone in your family been assaulted, attacked, or the vi ctim of a crime in the last 12 months?\" 57THE IMPACT OF VIOLENT CRIME ON ECONOMIC GROWTH 4.48 Another way to assess the co sts of crime is to estimat e the impact of crime on overall economic growth usi ng cross-country panel data.67 The advantage of this approach is that it summarizes the overall economic cost of crime. Because the estimates are based on data from across countries, th ey reflect an average relationship between crime and growth worldwide. This section re views estimates produced using this method as part of a study of crime and violence in Brazil (World Bank, 2006b) and considers their implications for Jamaica. 4.49 In this analysis, violent crime rates are measured using national homicide rates. Homicide rates are typically used for cros s-country crime studies because they are thought to be least subject to variation in definition and reporting to authorities. The analysis follows the literature on the determinan ts of growth: GDP per capita is regressed on homicide rates, controlling for a country's level of inco me inequality, the cost of investment, and average male and female education. 68 4.50 The measure used for this analysis is \"completed homicides\", referring to actual homicides.69 The analysis employs the Arellano and Bond (1991) GMM estimator, which provides consistent estimates of the effect of the explanatory variables on the outcome under the identifying assumption that the explan atory variables are not correlated to the time-variant components of the er ror terms. In all ca ses, the crime data is averages over five-year periods between 1975 and 2000.70 4.51 Estimates are presented in Table 4.3. The de pendent variable is the log of future GDP per capita, while \"Income\" as shown in the table is the log of current GDP per capita. The coefficient estimate on the homic ide rate is significant and negative. This indicates that a country's homicide rate ha s a negative impact on subsequent economic growth71 . 67 Obviously, causality runs in both directions: violence affects growth, but growth\u2014by influencing opportunities for gainful employment\u2014also affects viol ence. Here, we focus on the causal arrow running from violence to growth. See Chapter 3 for a more complete discussion of these causality issues. 68 Data on homicides for 1975-2000 is drawn from the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems. Data on schooling comes from Barro and Lee (2000). Income inequality data comes from Deininger and Squire (1996). 69 This definition may seem tautological, but international data distinguish between completed and total homicides. Completed homicides are actually consummated homicides, while total homicides include both consummated and attempted homicides. 70 Dependent variable is average annual per capita growth. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. A constant was included in the model, as were dummies for time period. Observations are for five-year time periods between 1975 and 2000. Note that in this analysis violent crime rates are measured using national homicide rates. Homicide rates are typically used for cross-country crime studies because they are thought to be least subject to variation in definition and reporting to authorities. The analysis follows the literature on the determinants of growth: GDP per capita is regressed on homicide rates, controlling for a country's level of income inequality, the cost of investment, and average male and female education. 71 The regression estimates imply that violent crime substantially reduces economic growth. A decline of 10 in a country's completed-homicide rate per 100,000 pe rsons is associated with a 2.1 percent increase in average annual growth over the next five years. 58Table 4.3: Cross-Country Regression Estima te of the Effect of Violent Crime on Economic Growth Variable Estimates Income -0.1362 (.017) Inequality 0.0013 (.0005) Male education 0.0120 of investment 0.0000 (.0001) Homicide rate -0.0021 (.0006) Period Dummies Yes Countries 28 Observations 32 Source: World Bank (2006b). Note: Standard errors are shown in parentheses. 4.52 We can consider what these estimates imply for potential gains to economic growth from crime reduction in the Ca ribbean. For 1996-2000, Costa Rica\u2014one of the least violent countries n ear the Caribbean\u2014had a hom icide rate of 8.1 per 100,000 population according to data collected by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. In contrast, the homicide rates in Jamaica, Haiti, Guyana and the Dominican Republic for the nearest available comparable period were 33.8, 33.9, 16.1, and 16.5, respectively. 72 What would be the gain in economic growth for these Cari bbean countries if they were to bring down their homicide rates to that of Costa Rica? Es timates from this \"simulation\" are shown in Figure 4.11. 72 The Jamaica homicide rate figure is the average over 1998-2000 from the UN database. Because recent UN data is not available from the other three countrie s, homicide rates for those countries are drawn from alternative sources and for varying dates: 2001 house hold survey (Haiti), and th e averages of 1999-2004 police reports (both Guyana and the Dominican Republic). 59Figure 4.11 Potential Boost to Annual Ec onomic Growth Rate from Reducing Homicide Rate to Costa Rica Level Source: Own calculations. 4.53 The regression results suggest very large potential gains from reduction in violence for Haiti and Jamaica, the two countri es in the region with the highest murder rates. The coefficient estimate implies that both countries could boost economic growth per capita by 5.4 percent per year if they were to bring th eir homicide rates down to the levels of Costa Rica. G uyana and the Dominican Re public would also benefit substantially, with potential growth rate increases of 1.7 percent a nd 1.8 percent, respectively. 4.54 Because the estimated effects are on a nnual growth, they are cumulative over time, suggesting that over the long term the impact of crime reduction on welfare would be very high. For example, an increase of per capita growth of 1.8 percent\u2014the figure implied by the simulation for the Dominican Republic\u2014would result over 20 years in a cumulative increase of income per person of 43 percent. P OLICY IMPLICATIONS 4.55 There are a number of ways to consider the costs of crime. Each approach illuminates a different aspect of the impact of crime, and no single approach is comprehensive. Even the accounting approach, which attempts to pull together a large variety of costs in a single measure, is lim ited to the extent that some costs of crime cannot be quantified; it is also generally lim ited to the current costs which can be more easily identified, rather than longer-term impacts. 4.56 The work reviewed and presented in this chapter shows that some of the most important costs such as impact on the invest ment climate and economic growth are those that are usually neglected in many analyses and in public discussi ons.

YOUTH VIOLENCE IN THE CARI BBEAN: A CASE STUDY OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Deaths and injuries from y outh violence constit ute a major public health, social and economic problem across the Ca ribbean, including in the Domi nican Republic . Youth are overrepresented in the ranks of both victims and perpetrators in the Dominican Republic, and this pattern has become more stark over time, as rates of crim e and violence overall have increased. A wide variety of risk fact ors contribute to the prevalence of youth violence, including poverty, youth unemployment, urban mi gration, drug trafficking, a weak education system, ineffective policing, the widespread availab ility of weapons, drug and alcohol use, and the presence of organized gangs. None theless, youth violence is preventable; a broad range of viable st rategies for preventing and reducing youth violence exist. Most highl y effective programs combine components that address both individual risks and environmental cond itions, building individual skills and competencies, training parents for greater effectiveness, improv ing chances for poor youth to access and complete their secondary education, impr oving the social climate and safety of school, and pr oviding \"second chances\" to those who have dropped out of the formal schooling system, including school equivalency programs, job and life skills training, and apprenticeships. 5.1 Youth violence is a high-priority, high-vi sibility concern across the Caribbean. Not only has violence grown in most of the region in recent decades, but youth are also disproportionately represented in the incidence and severity of this trend, both as victims and as perpetrators. Moreover, violent crimes are being committed at younger ages in many countries. Yet there is growing evidence that youth violence can be prevented and offenders can be rehabilitated when appropr iate policies and interventions are adopted (WHO, 2002; US Department of Health and Human Services, 2001; World Bank, 2005c; IADB, 2002; Tolan and Guerra, 1994). This ch apter addresses the pressing issue of youth violence and its implications for the Caribbean , with a particular focus on the Dominican Republic. The chapter also provides a set of policy and program recommendations which could prove useful to the region as a whole. 5.2 The overarching conclusion is that although youth vi olence is a legitimate concern for the region, it is neither intracta ble nor are youth \"the problem.\" Rather, as detailed by the World Bank's Caribbean Youth De velopment Report (World Bank, 2003a), youth are a product of a complex set of factors in their environments. They also represent a unique window of opportunity to both prevent an d reduce crime and violence in society at large. Evidence from evaluate d youth violence prev ention programs outside the Caribbean indicates that the earlier the investment in an individual, the greater the chance that violent behaviors can be prev ented through adulthood, and the more cost- effective the investment (WHO, 2003; World Bank, 2005c; Schweinhart, 2005 and Levitt, 1998). There are a multitude of polic ies and programs currently underway across the Caribbean to address youth violence. Unfort unately, very few have been subjected to rigorous impact evaluations a nd, consequently, there is l ittle region-specific knowledge about what works and what doe s not. However, there is in creasing evidence globally on 62the types of youth violence prevention efforts that work, and many of these programs are already being implemente d in the sub-region. SCOPE OF YOUTH CRIME AND VIOLENCE 5.3 This section provides a brief overview of youth crime and violence occurring in the Caribbean, with a special focus on the Do minican Republic. For the purposes of this report, youth violence is defined as homicide and non- fatal attacks perpetrated by or against a person aged 10-29 years of age.73 This age range was selected for three reasons. First, the late adolescent/ear ly adulthood period of 15-29 is ge nerally considered to have the highest risk for all forms of violence globa lly, and is particularly so in the Caribbean. Second, the early adolescent period (10-14 ye ars) is a growing c oncern in the region because both quantitative and qualitative evidence points to violent crimes being committed at younger and younger ages. While still considered to be one of the lowest risk groups across the entire lifespan for be ing a victim of homi cide, young adolescents are observed to be increasingly involved in both homicide and other forms of crime and violence. More importantly, they are the age at which many prevention policies may have a greater chance of success. Finally, the age range 10-29 coincides with that used in the only globally comparable data available on youth violence: World Health Organization statistics. 74 5.4 Data Limitations. As noted elsewhere in this report, general crime and violence data is often difficult to obtain and are often incomplete (see Chapter 1). This challenge becomes even greater when attempting to obt ain information on youth in particular. The problem stems from a lack of common and comparable definitions of youth when it comes to crime and violence, as well as w eak systems for surveillance and monitoring across what are considered minor (under 18 ) and adult (18 and ol der) age ranges. In particular, when attempting to compare da ta across countries, there are very few indicators beyond homicides that are disa ggregated by comparable ages, and the Caribbean has particularly weak youth data co mpared with much of the rest of Latin America. This report has drawn from both av ailable international quantitative sources (WHO, 2002/2003; PAHO; UNODC) as well as from primary quantitative and qualitative sources in the Do minican Republic (ALEPH, 2006). 5.5 Youth are disproportionately represented in Caribbean crime and violence, both as victims and as perpetrato rs, and in many of these coun tries violent crime is being committed at younger ages than in the past. More over, there is a growing concern that in a number of countries, the proportion of violent crimes committed by youth, and especially juveniles, has been increasing (UNODC, 2002). In 2005, young Dominicans aged 11-30 accounted for 46 percent of homicide victims, yet only represented 38 percent of the general population. In Jamaica, youth unde r the age of 25 were responsible for 51 percent of all murders and 56 percent of a ll major crimes in 2000 (World Bank, 2004). In the Dominican Republic, arrests for homicide s by minors under the age of 18 rose over 73 The 10-29 age range thus includes youth and young adults. 74 Note that the age range will depend largely on available data. Much of the standardized WHO data on youth violence use the 10-29 age ra nge, whereas the official UN MDG de finition of youth is 15-24 years old. 63the period 1995-2004 from 2 to 113, with ove r 95 percent male (UNODC, 2002). Similar trends occurred in St. Kitts and Nevis, wher e in 1990 only 1.2 percent of all crimes were committed by juveniles, yet by 1998, this had increased to 17 percent (UNODC, 2002). A worrisome consequence of these trends is that evidence points to the fact that violent behavior in youth has a strong tendency to continue into adulthood (WHO, 2003; Levitt, 1998). 5.6 Youth as victims . How do youth violence statistic s in the Caribbean compare with other countries? Youth homicide rates glob ally have large variations: for males, the numbers range from 2.5 per 100,000 in Canada a nd 5.2 in Chile, to 94.8 in El Salvador and 156.3 in Colombia (WHO, 2002). The La tin America and the Caribbean region boasts the highest homicide rate of men be tween the ages of 15-29 (68.6 per 100,000) in the world, more than three times greater than the global average of 19.4 (Table 5.1). 5.7 In the Dominican Republic in 2002, the adjusted homicide rate was 19.7 (per 100,000) for young Dominicans aged 15-29, compared with 10.2 for all Dominicans (Aleph, 2006). 75 As Figure 5.1 illustrates, homicide deaths for youth have been growing consistently since 2000, partic ularly in the 18-29 age range . In 2005, homicides of those ages 11-30 accounted for approximately 46 percent of total homicide deaths.76 Young males are particularly affected, with a de ath rate of 35.3 (per 100,000 inhabitants) in 2002, which is over 80 percent higher than the global average of 19.4 for young men (WHO, 2002). They are also considerably more likely to be victims of homicide than the rest of the Dominican male population (18.3); moreover, th ey are fifteen times more likely to die from homicide than women as a whole (2.1 per 100,000 inhabitants) and nearly 8 times more than women of th e same age group (3.2) (ALEPH, 2006; PAHO, 2006). 5.8 Violence against young women. Though often different in nature,77 violence against women is also disproportionately borne by youth in the Caribbean. The most widespread type of violence in the Caribbean is that which occurs within families and intimate relationships, where girls and young women are dispropor tionately affected, especially if the violence involves sex (P AHO, 2000). See chapter 1 for more on violence against young women. 75 Data obtained from the Procuradur \u00eda General Statistics Department. 76 Ibid. Results of self-report surveys around the wo rld indicate that an overwhelming majority of those who participate in violence against young people are ab out the same age and gender as their victims; in most cases the offenders are males ac ting in groups (United Nations, 2003). 77 Violence against women was defined by a declaration of the General Assembly of the United Nations (Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, 1993) as \"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coerci on or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\" 64Table 5.1 Youth as Victims: Homici de Rates in Select Countries (per 100,000 inhabitants) Country Year Total All Ages Males All Ages Female Male Age15-29 Female Age15-29 Bahamas 1995-1997 14.9 26.1 -- 48.4 -- Brazil 1995a 16.7 23.0 4.1 81.2 6.5 Chile 1994 3.0 5.4 0.8 6.7 -- Cuba 1997 6.2 9.6 2.7 18.4 5.7 Colombia 1995 61.6 116.8 9.0 212.5 15.0 49.9 2.12 4.435.3 -- 3.22 -- El Salvador 1993 55.6 108.4 8.4 133.1 8.8 Guyana 1994-1996 6.6 11.8 -- -- -- Jamaica 2004a 55.7 102.1 10.5 188.0 14.8 Trinidad and Tobago 1994 12.1 17.1 6.6 21.6 -- LAC average 19.3 34.7 4.0 68.6 6.4 United States 1998 6.9 10.7 3.1 23.6 4.6 Canada 1997 1.4 1.9 1.0 3.2 1.1 World 8.8 13.6 4.0 19.4 4.4 Source: World Health Organization. 2003.

Just as they account for a disproportionate share of the victims of violence, young people are also disp roportionately its perp etrators, especially young men. In most countries, this is a growing trend. Indeed, st atistical data indicate that in virtually all parts of the world, with the exception of the United States, rates of youth crime rose in the 1990s, with many of the criminal offens es related to drug abuse and excessive alcohol use (UNDP, 2003). What little data exist indicate that this phenomenon may be particularly worrisome in the Caribbean. 65Figure 5.1: Homicide Deaths by Age (10- 29) in the Dominican Republic (2000-2005) 0102030405060708090100 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Age2005 2002 2000Number of deaths 0102030405060708090100 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Age2005 2002 2000Number of deaths 0102030405060708090100 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Age2005 2002 20002005 2002 2000Number of deaths Source: Dominican Republic National Police, unpublished data. 5.10 In Jamaica, for example, the country's homicide rate for 2005, considered the highest in the world, was at an all-time high and over 70 percent of homicides were committed by young men ages 16-30. Shares were similar for shootings (78 percent), robbery (74 percent), and rape (68 percent). In the Domini can Republic, of the current prison population, 62 percent of th ose arrested for homicide we re 16-29 at the time of arrest compared to 71 percent of those arrested for robbery. In the first six months of 2006, 61 percent of new prisoners arrested fo r homicide were 16-29 and 70 percent for robbery (Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 2006). 5.11 Crimes perpetrated by minors (under age 18) in the Dominican Republic have also been on the rise over the past decade. Arrests of minors tripled between 2000 and 2003 and started to decline in 2004 and 2005 (F igure 5.2). However, th ose arrests related to illegal arms and drugs have shown no sign of decreasing (Dominican Republic National Police, 2006) In fact, whereas over the past decade the most common crimes committed by minors were petty theft (48 per cent), drugs (11 percent) and assault (10 percent), those that experienced the most cons istent growth were ar rests for homicide and illegal arms, with average annual increases over the past decade of 195 percent and 107 percent, respectively. These were followed by average annual increases in aggressive assault (28 percent) and drug arrests (22 percent).78 As Box 5.1 illustrates, qualitative data supports the quantitative evidence th at younger groups of youth are increasingly involved in violent crime. 78 Author's calculations based on Dominican Nacional Police statistics (1995-2005). 66Figure 5.2: Trends of Minor Arrest over Past Decade in the Dominican Republic Source: Dominican Republic National Police Crime and Victim Data, 2006. 5.12 Youth focus groups reveal some common ch aracteristics of youth perpetrators of crime . The overwhelming majority of youth currently residing in the Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Centros de At enci\u00f3n Integral (juvenile corrections center) are young men (136, compared with 3 women). The primary motivation identified for committing a crime was a desire to escape poverty (ALEPH, 2006). Ot her common characteristics were: growing up in dysfunctional households, having been abus ed and mistreated, getting an early start in a life of crime (with a re ported average age of first cr ime as 13), consuming illegal drugs, and having dropped out of school. 5.13 Gang and drug related violence has also increased in rece nt years, with youth as the most visible culprits of this type of cr ime and violence. Because the criminal justice system in the Dominican Republic does not a llow arrest or incarceration of youth below the age of 13, 79 gangs and drug lords are increasi ngly using younger me mbers to carry out both petty and hard crimes (Box 5.1). This appears to be a tr end throughout the sub- region (see discussion of gangs terism in next section). As reported in the World Development Report (WDR) 2007, younger ga ng members are responsible for a disproportionately large share of offenses. The WDR finds th at the formal association with a gang is powerful: gang members wield more influence on the violent behavior of their peers than violent non-gang members. What is more, youth gang members tend to commit crimes that are more serious and violent while they are gang members than after they leave the gang (World Bank, 2006c). 79 The \"Ley 136-03, C\u00f3digo Ni\u00f1os, Ni\u00f1as, y Adolescentes,\" article 223 states that children under th e age of 13 are in no case to be held criminally responsible, and as such, cannot be held for arrest, nor be given any sanction by official authorities.

Over the past three years, we have seen one particularly cruel method that has taken on a frightening momentum, and its impact on our society's children is devastating.\" \"Young men who we know to be involved in the drug trade (because we have lived in their neighborhood for years) invite young boys\u2014usually 8-12 years old from broken families where the mother has to work\u2014to join in sports activ ities and games in the neighborhood. These young men have nice clothes, shoes, cell phones, an d they become buddies with the children.\" \"Once they gain their trust, they ask them who they love most in the world. The children respond, and are then told, if you do not steal 3 cell phones a day for us, then we will kill your mother' (or whomever else they have confided is their mo st beloved person). A 10 year-old child from the barrio has nothing else to hold on to. We have witnessed in the past 6 months hundreds of crimes committed this way ranging from petty theft to murder. These children never see a way out... .\" - Interview with a group of Catholic nuns who have served in several of Santo Domingo's most violent neighborhoods for over 15 years. May 20, 2006 FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO YOUTH VIOLENCE 5.14 Identification of the key risk factors that contribute to youth violence makes clear that the policy and programmatic respon ses need to extend across a wide range of professional disciplines, includi ng those of public health, edu cation, and skills training. This section summarizes the current literature discussing these factors with a view to informing policymakers on where to most effec tively target interventions. As outlined in Chapter 3, risk factors can be identified at four interrelated levels: i) societal; ii) community; iii) relationships; and iv) individual. In addition to \"risk\" factors, protective factors are also present at each of the four levels, decreasing the likelihood that youth engage in crime or violence. It is worth emphasizing that the presence of a risk (or protective factor) does not ensure that crimin al or violent behavi or will (not) occur\u2014it merely increases the likelihood that it will (not). While th e analysis here focuses on factors for youth violence in the Dominican Republic, where possible the findings will be placed in a wider Caribbean context. 5.15 Recent empirical research conducted on risk and protective factors for youth in the Caribbean concluded that school attenda nce/connectedness are the most important factors in reducing violent yout h behavior. In particular, th e study found that boys (girls) who feel connected to school were 60 percent ( 55 percent) less likely to engage in violent activity. 80 In addition, the study show ed the significant effect s that schools have in reducing drug use, smoking, and alcohol cons umption. The study also found that family 80 Analyses were done on the results of a 1997-98 survey of over 15,500 young people 10-18 years of age in 9 Caribbean countries to identify risk and prot ective factors associated with health compromising behaviors, including violence. See Blum, R.W. et al. (2003). 68connectedness, or the presence of a caring adul t, served as the second most important protective factor. The analys is concluded that both risk and protective factors are cumulative; if protective influences are held constant and predominant risks are added one at a time, risk behavi or rises significantly. Conve rsely, and perhaps more importantly, when risk factors are held consta nt and protective factor s are added, there is an even greater reduction in re ported involvement with violence. 81 5.16 Societal Level : Some examples of risk fact ors at this level are poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, an ineff ective criminal justice system, and drug trafficking. At the societal le vel in general, the Caribbean has had a culture of aggression rooted in slavery since colonial times. Toda y, messages to youth from both regional and international (U.S.) media a nd music in particular, are of ten expressions of rage or alienation\u2014anti-women, pro drugs, pro-violen ce, and materialistic\u2014that influence the decisions that youth make (World Bank, 2003 a). For the Dominican Republic, some of the identified trends at this level are as follows: 5.17 Poverty and Inequality . Being raised in poverty has been found to contribute to a greater likelihood of involvement in crime and violence. It is also often related to youth aggression because of increased stress and f eelings of hopelessness that may arise from chronic unemployment and other associ ated factors (IADB, 2002; Weaver and Maddeleno, 1999). The inverse relationship between family income and juvenile crime is well documented globally (World Bank, 2006d). During the deep economic and financial crisis of 2003-2004, extreme poverty doubled from 7 percent to 14 percent (World Bank and IDB, 2006). Violent crimes also rose dramatically; from 2002 to 2005, the rate of violent death nearly doubled from 1 4.5 to 26.4 per 100,000 residents (Aleph, 2006).82 In addition to poverty, the income inequality de monstrated by drug dons, foreign tourists, and the media encourages engagement in easy money activities, including drugs and prostitution (World Bank, 2003a). 5.18 Youth Unemployment . Between 2002 and 2004 youth unemployment jumped from 23 to 31 percent, or more than twice the LAC average (15.2 percent) and the global average (14.4 percent) (World Bank and IDB, 2006). Although data is not available, it is generally agreed that these figures for urban poor youth are significantly higher. The fact that young Dominicans in (or entering) the labor market are at a disadvantage is consistent with findings from the internationa l literature on the effects of demand shocks (Jimeno, J. and Rodriguez-Palenzuela, D, 2002), as well as those observed throughout the Caribbean, where many countries have es pecially elevated youth unemployment. International comparisons indicate that Barb ados, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago have high rate s compared to the rest of Latin America (Table 5.2). Evidence from the United States has shown that falling wages and local youth unemployment were partly responsible fo r the rise in youth crime in the 1970s and 1980s (World Bank, 2006d). 81 Ibid. 82 Note that violent deaths in the Dominican Republic include homicides and deaths resulting from shootings between police and civilians. In 2005, 18 percent of violent deaths were a result of shootings between police and civilians; the remainder were homicides. 69Table 5.2: Highlights of Youth in Numbers in Latin America and the Caribbean Source: World Bank 2004 , World Bank 2005d, and Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n. 5.19 Urban migration is on the rise, with a high sh are of young migrants who are \"unattached\" to families, schools or employment. Although large youth cohorts in and of themselves are not always associated with in creases in crime and violence, the correlation is stronger when taken in the context of increasing poverty and ra pidly growing cities, such as in the urban areas of the Domi nican Republic (World Bank and IDB, 2006). Migration flows in the Dominican Republic are very high, with more than 2 million people living in a region othe r than that of th eir birth in 2002 (World Bank and IDB, 2006). Whereas 56 percent of Dominicans were living in cities in 1997, that number had reached 64 percent by 2004 (Fares et al ., 2006). Nearly 40 percent of Dominicans choosing to resettle are between the ag es of 20 and 39 (Fares, et al., 2006). 5.20 Drug trafficking. The Dominican Republic's role as a transit country for the drug trade puts many young Dominicans at risk. This macro level trend disproportionately affects youth in two ways. First, given th e immunity of minors from prosecution in adult courts, the relative cost of their involvement in the drug trade is lower than that of their adult counterparts, gi ving them a perverse comparative advantage. Second, remuneration in the narc otics business tends to be in-kind, and this trend is Country Youth Unemployment Percentage of youth population (15-24) Net Secondary School Enrolment Youth Fertility (15-19) Bahamas 15.8 18.0 79 49 Barbados 21.8 15.1 87 46 Dom Rep (2002) Dom Rep (2004)a 23.1 31.0 19.1 19.1 41 38 94 N/A Grenada 27.0 24.5 -- 69 Jamaica 34.0 18.7 75 32 St. Lucia 44.0 20.3 70 46 St. Vincent and the Grenadines 36.0 20.8 -- 22 Trinidad and Tobago 25.4 20.7 72 13 LAC Average 15.2 -- -- 52 United States 10.6 14.2 85 57 70growing in the Dominican Republic, particularly with younger members. 83 This creates a long-term involvement with the industry of illicit drugs, expanding the client base for the drugs and creating a dependency/addi ction among participating youth. 5.21 Community level: Some common risk factors at this level relate to schools, neighborhoods, and police. Examples are lack of school access, school policies, availability of guns, prevalence of dr ugs, unsafe neighborhoods , police abuse and criminal justice responses at th e local level. The presence of these factors in the lives of young Dominicans is as follows: 5.22 Schools . The education sector in the Domi nican Republic is characterized by low enrollment rates, high dropout rates, poor quality, an d weak funding, the combination of which contributes greatly to the genera tion of idle and unskilled youth with few opportunities . Only 53 percent of Dominicans complete primary school and the net secondary school enrolment rate is just 38 percent. What is more, the average score on the grade eight national exam in 2004 was 52 percent (Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Educaci\u00f3n, 2005). As a result, even the lucky few that stay in the system long enough to graduate tend to leave school with a d earth of relevant skills fo r a successful school-to-work transition. When compared to other Caribbean countries for which UNESCO data is available, the Dominican Republic's 1.1 per cent of GDP in education spending in 2004 was by far the lowest among the Latin American and Caribbean countries with available data. 84 The number of youth who can be cons idered at risk\u2014poor, out of school, and jobless\u2014is therefore large and growing . This increase is believed to be \"a key factor in the rise in crime, violence, gangs and other forms of risky behavior , particularly among the poorest segments of this age group, which see fewer prospects for the future\" (World Bank, 2005d). 5.23 Violence in Schools. A disquieting number of stude nts in the Caribbean have witnessed physically violent acts in their schools. As a result many students no longer feel safe in their schools and some drop out (Garner et al., 2003). A 2003 representative sample survey of school childre n in nine Caribbean countries found that one-fifth of the males carried weapons to school in the prev ious 30 days and one-tenth had been knocked unconscious in a fight. Over 40 percent reported that sometimes or most of the time they think about hurting or killing someone else (Halcon, 2003). Evidence suggests that abuse by teachers of students is common (World Bank, 2003a). In the Dominican Republic, most youth (54 percent) in a recent survey repor ted that there was violence in the schools, and 42 percent indicated that they knew of violent acts committed on school grounds (ALEPH, 2006). 5.24 Role of Police. The potential role of the police in crime prevention is weakened by problems within the police force. The majority of respondents in youth focus groups in 83 Interviews with Dominican National Drug Control Agency 2005. 84 Domestic per pupil public expenditure at the secondary level as a share of GDP per capita was just 3.6 percent in 2003, less than a quarter of the LAC average of 17.8 percent. Moreover, it is the only country with available data in the LAC region where public funds for secondary educatio n decreased by more than 20 percent as a share of GDP during the period 1998-2003; over that period the Dominican Republic's funding decreased by 39 percent. World Bank (2006d) 71the Dominican Republic noted that even if they were caught committing a crime, the possibility of buying one's way out through brib es to police was always a feasible option, as well as that of using padrinos (Godfathers) who could inte rvene on their behalf and have court decisions suspended, or even have prison inmates freed (ALEPH, 2006). The national police itself reports an average of 36 shooting deaths per month by the members of its force (ALEPH, 2006). In 2005, 18 percen t of all violent deaths/homicides were a result of police shootings. Though the ages of the victims are not known, anecdotal evidence suggests that a large number of these are youth: one study cited 23 unprovoked killings of street children by los cirujanos (\"the surgeons\", a pol ice unit that conducts night sweeps) in three nei ghborhoods of Santo Domingo ove r an eight-month period (Commins, 2006). 5.25 Availability of guns and other weapons. The proportion of Caribbean adolescent males who carry firearms is ex tremely high. The survey in nine Caribbean countries mentioned above revealed that 20 percent of male students had carried a weapon to school in the previous 30 days, n early as many had been in a fight using weapons (World Bank, 2003a). Evidence suggest s that these figures are much higher for those who are not students. In the United St ates, the equivalent figure for high school students (grades 9-12) was 9 percent, less th an half (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003). In the Dominican Republic, between September 2003 and June 2005 alone, the National Police issued more than 178,000 licenses for owning and carrying firearms, the majority of which were handguns (71 percent), shotguns (14 percent) and pistols (14 percent). According to the Nationa l Police, at least 75 percent of homicides are committed using these type s of weapons (ALEPH, 2006).85 For more detailed discussion of community-level risk fact ors and program responses see Annex 5.1. 5.26 Interpersonal level: The most important actors at this level are the family, peer groups, and teachers, each of which can act as protective and risk factors. For the Dominican Republic, available da ta points to the following concerns at this level. 5.27 Domestic violence, child abuse and corporal punishment. High levels of domestic abuse and corporal punishment thr oughout the Caribbean are severe risk factors likely to promote future violent behavior . A recent survey revealed that 22 percent of ever-married women aged 15-49 had been victim s of physical violence at the hands of a male partner, and 67 percent had suffered emotional abuse (Caceres, 2004). International evidence suggests that children who witness do mestic violence are more likely in the future to engage in delinquent and viol ent behavior (Smith and Thornberry, 1995; Margolin, 1998). Child abuse is also associ ated with an increas ed probability that children engage in delinquent and violent beha vior, as well as increa sed risk of children abandoning the home. More than 40 percent of street kids surveyed by Ni\u00f1os del Camino cited abuse in the home as the leading cause of abandoning their families. Corporal punishment continues to be wi despread in the Dominican Re public and elsewhere in the Caribbean, in both schools and homes, and particularly against boys (World Bank, 2003a). Much international evid ence links use of corporal punishment to later use of 85 Data obtained from the National Police Statistics office. 72violence by children and adolescents; a study in Jamaica has confirmed this link (Meeks, 2001). 5.28 Peers and role models. Most youth in the Caribbean identify parents, entertainers or teachers as role models (Lut her, 2002). However, the historical absence of male adult figures in the household for ro le modeling and ment oring compounds the influence of \"negative\" role models, par ticularly for boys. Drug dons are an important source of admiration due to th eir wealth and power. The drug don and his approachability and interest in recruiting children make him a particularly dangerous role model as youth easily become engaged in his business (World Bank, 2003a). 5.29 Gangsterism and related activities ar e a large\u2014and growing\u2014problem in the region. According to survey data from the Caribbean Youth Development report, 20 percent of male students and 12 percent of female students surveyed reported having belonged at one point to a gang (World Bank, 2003a). This echoes the marked increase in the number and influence of gangs cited in youth surveys in the Dominican Republic, including one conducted with youth ages 14 -17 currently participating in remedial programs where half admitted to belonging to las naciones (ALEPH, 2006). Gangs are highly organized, satisfying the needs of young Dominicans at various levels: at the individual level (through respect, power, au thority, recognition, and financial gain), the relationship level (support, cari ng, friendship, and health servi ces/medical attention), and the community level (rules, tr aining, protection, fina ncial benefits). Gangs are located in all the major cities, though they seem to be expanding into some rural communities. 5.30 Drug trafficking influence. The defining characte ristic of Dominican gangsterism is involvement in drug traffickin g. The scarcity and low pay of legal jobs; the attraction of the \"easy money\"; the exis tence of laws protect ing those under 18 from prison (Luther, 2002), and the marketing of drug dons (Barker, 1995) makes involvement in drug trafficking very attractive to youth (World Bank, 2003a). A recent study showed that gang members were 20 times more likel y to sell drugs than non-members, and 35 times more likely to collaborate with drug dealers. Even when compared to other vulnerable groups (out of school youth, sex workers, \"sankis\"86), gang members were still at least three times more likely to be invol ved in the drug trade. Worldwide, those youth most likely to participate in delinquent or violent activities are usually part of a group, though this association tends to be higher fo r theft, robbery and rape, and lower for premeditated murder and assaul t with the intent to inflic t grievous bodily harm (United Nations, 2003).87 For a more detailed discussion of interpersonal-level risk factors and program responses, see Annex 5.1. 5.31 Individual level: At the individual level, some of the most influential risk factors for youth violence are biological (being male; delivery complications at birth); psychological/behavioral (degree of self regulation and self esteem; low intelligence and low educational achievement, early sexual initiation); and envir onmental (exposure to 86 \"Sankis\" are generally male prostitutes that offer se rvices to tourists in exchange for having their entertainment costs covered, usually food and alcohol. 87 Available cross country statistical data show that 60-75 percent of all juvenile offenses are committed by members of various groups. 73violence and conflict in the family; involveme nt with drugs, alcohol, and tobacco). In the Dominican Republic, some of the ke y risk factors are the following. 5.32 Drug and alcohol use. Although data on drug and alcohol use are scanty, available evidence suggests a widespread so cial acceptance of alcohol in nearly all Caribbean countries, and of marijuana in some, among both in-school and out-of-school youth (Barker, 1995). In Jamaica, over three-quar ters of students repo rt that alcohol and cigarettes are easily obtainabl e and 60 percent believe the sa me about marijuana, while almost half have close friends that sm oke \"ganja\" (National Centre for Youth Development, 2003). In the Dominican Repub lic, alcohol is very accessible and by far the drug most widely consumed by youth. Acco rding to a recent survey conducted among secondary school students, 81 percent had consum ed alcohol at some point in their lives, while 85 percent had had the oppo rtunity to consume (Aleph, 2006).88 A separate survey finds the mean age at first consumption of alcohol to be 13 years (Luther, et al., 2002). Two characteristics unique to the Dominican Re public are the high rate of non-marijuana drug consumption (63 percent of drugs reported used were drugs other than marijuana), and the high prevalence of tranquilizers and stimulants consumed, at 12.8 percent (females) and 6.5 percent (mal es), and 6.2 percent (females ) and 4.4 percent (males) respectively. These figures were the highest in a recent OAS report on drug consumption among seven countries in the LAC region (O rganization of American States, 2004). 5.33 The age of onset of sexual activity in the Caribbean is the lowest in the world (Blum, 2002, as cited in World Bank, 2003a) . Data from the Caribbean Health Survey showed that of the 35 percent of stude nts who reported having had sex, initiation occurred before the age of 13 for nearly two-thirds (includi ng 82 percent of males and 52 percent of females), surpassi ng all other regions for which data is ava ilable (Halcon, 2003). In a related study, early initiation of intercourse was found to be predictive of weapon-related violence and gang involvement (among boys a nd girls), and alcohol use and running away (among girls) (Ohene, 2005) . Teenage pregnancy in particular is a pressing concern as it is an im portant contributor to delivery complications at birth: the Dominican Republic ranks fifth in the Latin Am erica region in number of births among 15-19 year-olds, nearly double the average for the region (Table 5.2). For more detailed discussion of individual le vel risk factors and program responses see Annex 5.1. P OLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRENGTHENING THE RESPONSE TO YOUTH VIOLENCE 5.34 The fundamental challenge in assessing the effectiveness of youth violence prevention strategies in the Caribbean\u2014and in the Dominican Republic in particular\u2014is that although a multitude of programs exist, th ere is virtually no evaluated evidence of such interventions to guide policymakers and practitioners in identifying the relative effectiveness (including cost-effectivene ss) of strategies and approaches. The recommendations presented here therefor e draw on international research and experiences that have been rigorously eval uated and proven effective in order to: i) identify current programs that merit expansi on and highlight elements that could improve 88 These figures are for lifetime prevalence (not annual). 74existing strategies; and ii) suggest complement ary strategies to consider, including some which would require a reassessment of current approaches in light of their relative ineffectiveness. 5.35 Table 5.3 presents widely accepted ex amples of youth violence prevention strategies that have proven effective\u2014 and ineffective\u2014in a range of contexts.89 The framework addresses two importa nt considerations: i) the developmental stages of an individual (from early childhood to ear ly adulthood); and ii) the ecological systems through which risks can be addressed (presented in Chapter 3). The strategies presented here are not exhaustive, but are meant to emphasize the spectrum of possible solutions. No single strategy on its own is likely to be sufficient to address youth violence; multiple, concurrent approaches are required. Since much of the current knowledge of effective approaches and programs is based on internatio nal evidence, care must be taken to ensure relevance for the particular country and co mmunity in which they are implemented. 5.36 In recent years, the Dominican Republic has placed increasing emphasis on finding solutions to the problems of crime and violence in general, and youth violence in particular. As in most countries, this strate gy comprises policies that fall into two broad categories: i) those that are control/treatment oriented, using the police, courts and prison system to control the behavior of individuals who engage in violence; and ii) and those that are prevention oriented, either towards the general popul ation or towards individuals considered at risk. Using the international evidence summarized in Table 5.3 and an inventory of over 50 of the most prom inent public and non-government programs addressing youth violence in the Dominican Republic, 90 this section highlights select strategies and programs that merit particular attention for further evaluation and potential expansion.91 5.37 Provide holistic violence control/prevention approaches targeted to high- violence communities, emphasizing a combin ation of community policing and improved public services . This type of approach tends to addr ess risk factors at all levels, if appropriately implemented. It targets youth an d their families with much needed basic services (early child care, education, health, security) as well as positive alternatives to crime and violence (through second chance progra ms, extracurricular act ivities, life skills and occupational training). Although internatio nal evidence of the impact of community policing on reducing crimes is mixed, it does impr ove the public's perception of safety as 89 Compiled from WHO (2002) ; WHO (2003) ; World Bank (2006); US Surgeon General (2001); Tolan and Guerra (1994), Sherman (1997) and Kellerman et al. (1997). 90 See Annexes 5.4 and 5.5, which are based on Aleph (2006). Programs were inventoried using the ecological framework, assessing both the level of intervention (individual, relationship, community, and society) as well as the level of prevention targeted (primary prevention or universal coverage; secondary prevention targeted to youth at risk; tertiary prevention geared to reducing violence among high-risk youths or preventing further violence from existing perpetrators). 91 Programs were selected based on a series of criteria: i) fall within internationally proven strategies for addressing youth violence or have demonstrated effectiveness in the Dominican Republic; ii) have a significant beneficiary population; iii) can be replicated with existing institutional capacity; and iv) where data is available, are shown to be cost-effective. 75well as the image of the police (WHO, 2003)92 (examples in the Dominican Republic which address part of these ob jectives include Barri os Seguros and Centros Educativos de Fe y Alegr\u00eda). 5.38 Expand access/retention in schools for high-risk individuals and communities, with particular emphasis on incentives for early child development and for completing secondary education.93 International res earch underscores consistently the importance of the protectiv e factor of providing disadvantaged children with a strong start in school through quality early child development programs (ages 0-5), as well as that of keeping children in school\u2014and connected to their school\u2014through their adolescence. Long term follow-up studies of prototypes in a range of countries have shown important effects on reducing violence and other delinquent behavior. Moreover, they have proven more cost-effective in the long run than many other options.94 Examples in the Dominican Republic include the Fund for Early Education (Fondo de Educaci\u00f3n Inicial) and the SO LIDARIDAD program. Neither the Fondo de Educacaci\u00f3n Inicial (not surprisingly, give n its target population) nor th e Solidaridad program offers financial support to keep students in seconda ry school. Given the high rates of school leaving at the secondary level, expandi ng SOLIDARIDAD from basic to secondary education may be worth c onsidering (see Annex 5.1). 5.39 Improve school quality, relevance and efforts to incorporate violence prevention into the curriculum, and increase the involvement of parents. Together with local NGOs, the Ministry of Educa tion is actively reforming the curricula, enhancing teacher training to improve the quality of primary and secondary education and reduce abuse in schools, increasing the re levancy of education, as well as actively promoting non-violence in the curriculum.95 Through its Decentrali zation Plan, it also intends to significantly increase parental involvemen t in school management (World Bank, 2003a). 5.40 Provide \"second chances\" for youth at risk to complete their formal education, obtain relevant job skills, and/or learn relevant life skills. Programs with flexible schedules designed to allow yout h to obtain their primary and secondary education equivalency are a cost-effectiv e way to invest in the human capital development of the large share of youth who have never completed their formal education. Programs offering job skills with job experience (internships) as well as life skills training have been shown to have an important impact on improving the quality of jobs obtained by youth, an important factor in reducing crime and violence (World Bank, 2006b). Examples in the Dominican Republic include Educaci\u00f3n B\u00e1sica Para Adultos 92 See, for example, Buvinic and Morrison 2001. See also DESEPAZ Program in Colombia.

Home visitation is a proven approach to reducing youth viol ence and delinquency which exists in many parts of the world. It is targeted to low-income young mothers and families who are expecting or have recently ha d their first child, and those at increased risk of abusing their children with the objective of providi ng parenting training, support, counseling, child development monitoring and re ferrals to outside agencies. It has proven effectiveness in a rang e of countries with significant long term effects in reducing violence and delinquency, as well as other risk factors such as alcohol abuse (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001; WHO, 2003; Olds DL et al, 1998; Farrington and Welsh, 1999; Blueprints, 2003.) Examples in the Dominican Republic include PROFAMILIA, IDDI, Don Bo sco, Progresando (see Annex 5.5). Complementary Strategies to Consider 5.42 Provide positive role models thro ugh nation-wide mentoring programs . Well- conducted mentoring programs, which tend to be relatively cost-effective, can reduce aggressive behavior, delay the onset of drug and alcoho l usage among youth and boost school retention and performance. These prog rams also have significant impacts on reduced substance abuse, reduced skipping sc hool, and improved rela tionships with their families (World Bank, 2003a; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001; Tierney et al, 2000). 5.43 Open schools after hours and on week ends for supervised extra-curricular activities, training and conflict resolution in high-crime communities . Peak times for juvenile crime are during the hours im mediately after school, yet many youth are unsupervised after school because their pare nts work. After-school programs hold great potential value and deserve serious consid eration in community prevention planning.96 According to a UNESCO study, participating schools in a similar program in Brazil demonstrated as much as a 60 percent reducti on in violence, as compared to other schools in the area. The program also reduced the ra tes of sexual aggression, suicide, substance abuse, theft, and armed robbery (World Bank, 2006b). 5.44 Pilot national youth service programs, or service-learning programs which give youth practical work experience and life skills while simultaneously helping to meet key development objectives at a national or community level. Jamaica has a National Youth Service program that targ ets youth 17-24 who ar e out of school and unemployed. It combines life skills training with 8 months of work exposure in jobs such as teaching aids, health facilitators, early childhood caregivers, environmental aides and information technology (IADB, 200 2). Controlled longitudinal studies of the American Conservation and Youth Corps aimed primar ily at disadvantaged youth 16-24 found that 96 Several controlled studies have found that well-su pervised after-school programs substantially reduce juvenile crime, drug use and vandalism. For more information see: Inter-Am erican Development Bank (2002) and Sickmund et. al (1997). 78program participants in a 15-month follow up we re much more likely to have worked for pay and were less likely to be arrested vis- \u00e0-vis control groups (Jastrab. et al, 1996, 2004; World Bank, 2005c). 5.45 Several strategies have proven effective in reducing significantly the rates of rearrest and recidivism for yo uth with a history of chronic or violent criminal behavio r (Lipsey and Wilson, 1998; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). Two model programs for these youth use a fam ily therapy approac h, and place strong emphasis on skills training and behavioral ch ange for youth and their parents. These include: i) functional family therapy ; and ii) multidimensional treatment foster care using a clinical intervention ta rgeting individual youth with se vere criminal behavior and placing them in trained foster home care as an alternative to in carceration, group or residential treatment. Meta analyses have shown that community-based treatment is more successful than residential treatment and that both types of programs have significantly reduced the number of days of incarceration, overal l arrest rates, drug use, and program dropouts versus control groups (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). 5.46 Reduce emphasis on \"mano dura\" program s that emphasize harsher penalties, increased arrests, and more police controls. Criminalization, incarceration and suppression are inefficient responses to chronic youth of fenders, gang members, and those committing violent crimes. Despite being a common official response by governments, these \"mano dura\" programs have proven to be the l east effective among a range of policy options (World Bank, 2006b). One promising justice system approach with strong deterrent effects is an intensive protective supervision strategy which removes delinquent youths (status offenders) from criminal justice institutions and provides them with proactiv e and extensive community supervision with trained professionals (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). 5.47 Apply existing laws separating incarcerated youth and adults. The imprisonment of child offenders with adults (due to the lack of facilities for young delinquents) is common in the Caribbean (S ingh, 2001, as quoted in World Bank, 2003a). The principle of incarcerating young offenders separately from adults has been accepted in the Dominican Republic, but its application is minimal, with ma ny youth ending up in state prisons. Prison conditions range from \"poor\" to \"harsh \", with overcrowding being a pressing concern (U.S. State Department, 2006). 97 Improving prison conditions and separating young offenders are important re medial policies as both concerns are associated with higher recidivism.98 5.48 Enforce new legislation requiring the registration of guns . Currently, it is enforced by occasional checkpoints where vehicles must produce the certificates of registration for any firearms in the car . Banning guns during periods known for high violence/homicide could also be considered , such as weekends and holidays. This 97 In 2005, 145 people died in a fire in a cell block that was designed to hold 80. 98 There are 4 prisons for minors separated by sex. Minors can be prosecuted in either corrective or criminal status. Corrective status is for minor crim es (simple robbery, delinquency, drug use) whereas criminal status is for larger crimes (murders, aggravated robbery). Corrective imprisonment ranges from a few months up until 3 years whereas criminal imprisonment ranges from 1-10 years. 79approach was successfully implemented by th e municipalities of Cali and Bogota, which witnessed lower homicide rates as high as 20 percent when the ban was in effect (Guerra, 2006; World Bank, 2003b). 5.49 Restrict the availability of alcohol. This has demonstrated positive effects on reducing violence (both criminal and domestic) as well as criminal offenses (both serious and minor related to property and tra ffic) (WHO, 2003). Given the widespread acceptance of alcohol consumption even at ve ry early ages in the Dominican Republic, a concerted effort to treat alcohol as a drug in all anti-drug programs may have considerable impact on reducing violence. Po licies such as highe r taxation of alcohol combined with greater enforcement of minimu m legal age have demonstrated success in reducing consumption among young people in some countries (WHO, 2003b). In Colombia, alcohol sales were restricted with closing times imposed on bars and nightclubs (Guerrero and Concha-Eastman, 2001). CONCLUSIONS 5.50 The most important conclusion of this chapter is that youth violence is a legitimate concern for the region, but it is not an intractable problem. Youth violence is preventable. Although deaths and injuries from yout h violence constitu te a major public health, social and economic problem acro ss the Caribbean, incl uding the Dominican Republic, a broad range of viable strategies for preventing and reducing youth violence exists. Moreover, it is important to remember that youth are not \"the problem,\" but rather a product of the individual, family, community and social environments in which they live. 5.51 In addition to the thematic conclusions presented above, several cross-cutting recommendations emerge. First, there is an urgent need to develop and strengthen data systems which regularly compile and monitor trends in youth violence (including injuries and deaths, both as victims and perp etrators) across key institutions. Current data is extremely weak and inconsistent, and there is little collaboration across entities. In the Dominican Republic, the Procuradur\u00eda General could establish a system by which routine information available from health services , emergency departments, the police, the criminal justice system, and ot her authorities relevant to youth violence can be compared on an annual basis. Strengthening these syst ems will provide valuable information for formulating policies and for evaluating them.99 5.52 Second, there is a clear need to generate scientific evidence on the patterns and causes of youth violence in specif ic social settings, as well as the cost to society of such violence. Perhaps more important, however, is the need to generate knowledge on what works to reduce violence through rigorous eval uation of both impact a nd costs. Only with consistent standards of systematic evaluation of interventions can policy tradeoffs be 99Uniform standards for defining and measuring youth violence should be incorporated in regular surveillance systems. Included in this should be methods to establish the ratio of fatal to non-fatal cases of violence-related injuries, cl assified by the method of attack, age and sex of the victim. Such data can then be used to estimate the magnitude of the youth viol ence problem where only one ty pe of data - such as mortality or morbidity - is available. See WHO (2003). 80legitimately addressed.100 In particular, there is a need for: i) longitudinal studies evaluating long term impacts of interventions conducted in childhood; ii) evaluations of the impact of interventions in sectors some times considered unrelated (e.g., education, health, employment, etc.) on reducing youth viol ence and other risk factors; iii) studies on cost-effectiveness of preven tion (and control) programs. 5.53 Finally, there is a need to improve public awareness of the availability of ongoing interventions, with particular a ttention paid to high-risk communities and youth . A public information campaign should not be limited to potential beneficiaries, but should also extend to public and civil society groups working in this area as there is considerable lack of knowledge of existing pr ograms in other institu tions. Indeed, in the Dominican Republic, as well as across the s ub-region, there are a multitude of programs available to address many of the risk factors facing youth. Ev aluating their effectiveness and sharing this knowledge across countries with similar issues to confront will contribute enormously to future success in reducing youth violence. 100 Consistent standards include: i) the application of experimental design; ii) evidence of a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of violent behavi or or violence-related injuries; iii) replication across different sites and different cultural contexts; and iv) evidence that the impact is sustained over time. 816. CASE STUDY: CRIMINAL DEPORTATIONS AND JAMAICA It has been hypothesized that recent crime trou bles in the Caribbean could be tied to the activities of deportees who have learned crim inal behavior in the developed countries. This report examines the sit uation in Jamaica, which is on e of the Caribbean countries proportionately most affected by criminal de portations. With curren tly available data, it is possible to conclude that it is unlikely that the average deporte e is committing crime in Jamaica. At the same time, it is possible that a minority of deportees is involved in criminal activity. Assisting in reintegration efforts for deported offe nders could be a cost- effective way for deportee -sending countries to pr omote development and weaken international crime networks. 6.1. Each year, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada deport thousands of people convicted of various crimes to thei r countries of citizenship in the Caribbean. Between 1998 and 2004, the United States alone deported over 31,000 convicted criminals to the Caribbean. This chapte r focuses exclusively on the issue of criminal deportees: people who have been forcibly return ed to their country of origin due to their conviction for a criminal offense, such as drug offenses, violent crime, and immigration- related crime. The chapter does not discuss the less controversia l practice of deporting those who have entered the coun try without a visa or violated the terms of their visa or residency permit. 101 6.2. There are few topics in Caribbean crim inal justice more contentious than criminal deportation. On the one hand, as the international community has recognized, \"It is the right of every nation State to decide who can ente r and stay in it s territory and under what conditions\" (United Nations, 2004). Re sidence permits are a privilege granted to non-citizens contingent on their good be havior. Clearly, the commission of a crime does not constitute \"good behavior,\" and few would deny the right of host countries to revoke the permits of convicted criminals. This practice is widespread, and Caribbean countries themselves deport non-citi zen convicts on a regular basis. 6.3. On the other hand, there is a widely held belief in the Caribbean (as well as in Central America) that recent crime troubles can be tied directly to the activities of deportees \"schooled\" in crime in the developed countries, es pecially the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.102 This chapter looks at the situation in Jamaica, which is proportionately most affected by crim inal deportations, and where officials have worried that the country's rising murder ra te may be linked to the growing stock of 101 Criminal deportations are distinct from deportations for simple immigration violations like entering the country without a visa or permit. However, the ranks of criminal deportees do include those deported for crimes that are related to immigration. Examples of immigration-related crimes include modifying visa papers, attempting to bribe an immigration official, lying on an immigration-related document, and smuggling migrants. 102 This view is widely held enough that the CARICOM re presentatives recently suggested that the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights intervene to reduce the flow of deportees. See Smith, S, \"Carib states want a study on the link between deportation and crime.\" Jamaica Glean er, 16 December 2005. 82deported convicts.103 Figure 6.1 shows the figures for both homicides and deportee arrivals in recent years.

Some Caribbean commentators have argue d that it was conditions experienced in the developed countries, not in their coun tries of citizenship, which drove these people into criminality. For example, Dr. Prem Misir, Pro-Chancellor of the University of Guyana, asserts, \"...criminal deportees have be en intensively socialized in the criminal fields in the U.S. These deportees are in full possession of their U.S. criminal tool kit.\" 104 If Dr. Misir is correct, the question then becomes: who is responsible for criminals born in the Caribbean but made in the develope d world? And who should bear the burden of this population, the large and wealthy count ries or the small Caribbean countries? 6.5. Of course, the issues are not as clear cut as this. Deportees are not a homogenous group. There are cases of deport ees who, in all but their pape rwork, were citizens of the developed countries, having b een raised there and holdi ng few connections to the countries of their birth. But there are also th ose who were career offe nders in their home countries before venturing out into trans-national organize d crime, and those who fall somewhere in the middle, whose criminality may be attributed to experiences in both countries. And even if it were possible to dete rmine where a criminal is made a criminal, this would not answer the broader policy que stion: how can developing countries cope 103 In his address at the Opening of the Twenty-Fifth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community on 4 July 2004, in St. George's, Grenada, then Jamaican Prime Minister PJ Patterson referred to \"security concerns arising from the nexus of the narcotics trade, gun-smuggling and criminal deportees.\" He used similar language in a speech at the CARICOM 30th Anniversary Lecture Series at Medgar Evers College in New York on 2 Oc tober 2003, where he referr ed to \"the U.S.-based nexus of the narcotics trade, gun smuggling and criminal deportees.\" In his address to the Joint Session of The St. Lucian Parliament on 1 July 2004, he referred to \"the impact of deportees on the escalating rate of crime.\" 104 Misir, P., \"Government tackling globally-rooted cr imes.\" Accessed on the website of the Guyana Government Information Agency: http://www.gina.gov.gy/archive/researchp/rpgovtacklingcrimes.html 83with regular injections of uprooted convicts? And how can this probl em be resolved to reduce the spread of transnational criminality? 6.6. This chapter lays out the latest available data on the scale and nature of criminal deportation from the United States, the Un ited Kingdom, and Canada to Jamaica and suggests some ways the issue might be re solved for the benef it of all concerned. THE SCALE OF THE EXPATRIATE POPULATION 6.7. To appreciate the scale of the deportations , it is necessary to understand the size of the Caribbean expatriate community. An estimated three million Caribbean-born people were living in the United States at the time of the 2000 Census, about 10 percent of the total immigrant populati on in the U.S. and about 1 percent of the U.S. national population. The 300,000 Caribbean-born people livi ng in Canada at the time of its 2001 Census also make up about 1 percent of th e population of that country. In the United Kingdom, some 250,000 people born in the Caribbean were counted during the 2001 Census. 6.8. In total, 3.5 million Caribbean-born peopl e were living in these three countries in 2000/2001. The figure is perhaps 3.8 million Caribbean-born people as of 2006,105 more than are presently living in the countries of Montserrat, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Ca yman Islands, St. Kitt s and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Aruba, St. Vi ncent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, the Netherlands Antilles, Barbados, the Bahamas, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Suriname, and Guyana combined . 6.9. About 85 percent of these migrants live in the United States, with the largest pool from Cuba, followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Haiti (the four largest independent countries in the Cari bbean). Figure 6.2 show s the Caribbean-born populations in the U.S. from several countri es. Jamaica has the la rgest share of its population living in the United States. For every five Jamaicans living at home in Jamaica, there is one living in the United States, with lower ratios for Cuba (9 percent), the Dominican Republic (8 percent), and Haiti (5 percent). According to U.S. Census projections, the U.S. Jamaican-born populat ion was over 600,000 in 2005 (Department of Homeland Security, 2005). 6.10. In Canada, Jamaicans are the most populous group of Caribbean origin living in the country, with just under 122,000 Jamaican-bor n residents, nearly twice as many as the next largest Caribbean group (Trinidadi ans), according to the 2001 Census. About 150,000 of the 250,000 Caribbean-born people living in the United Kingdom were Jamaican, according to the 2001 Census. In total, about 683,000 Jamaicans were living in the three countries in 2000/2001, or more than a quarter of th e total living in Jamaica at that time. Because these estimates are ba sed on census figures, which may undercount undocumented immigrants, the true number of Jamaican expatriates may be higher. 105 U.S. census projections suggest a Caribbean population of 3.211 million in 2005. Similar projections are not available for Canada and the United Kingdom, but if similar growth were experienced, some 600,000 Caribbean nationals might be seen between the two countries. 84Figure 6.2: Caribbean-Born Populations in the United States 612869608 169 92197737 348 225334692 385411952 01002003004005006007008009001,000 Cuba Dominican Rep.

Poor migrants may be forced to settle in some of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods of their new countries, and may face ongoing margin alization. It is not surprising that some engage in criminal behavior, are arrested and imprisoned. Whether migrants are more likely to commit crime is hotly debated, and reso lving this issue is ha mpered by a lack of clarity on the number of undocumented migrants (Rumbaut et al., 2006).106 6.12. By mid-2004, federal and state prisons in the United States held over 90,000 non-citizens, representing 6.5 percent of the overall prison population and over 20 percent of the federal prison population. The bu rden on state prisons varied considerably between regions of the country. In the high- immigration state Calif ornia, over 10 percent of prisoners were non-citizen s (Harrison and Beck, 2005). Some 29 percent of federal drug defendants convicted during 2003 were id entified as non-citizen s, and more than half (56 percent) had at leas t one prior adult conviction (B ureau of Justic e Statistics, 2005). 6.13. Concerns about immigrant crime and the demands it was placing on the U.S. criminal justice system contributed to the passage of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. This Act made significant changes to the deportations regime, reducing appeals and grea tly expanding the defi nition of deportable \"aggravated felonies\" to includ e a range of lesser offenses. 107 Resources were also 106 At least one study has found that first generation immigrants are less likely to be convicted of a crime than the native born. 107 The term of \"aggravated felony\" first appeared in the immigration context in 1988 in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, where it was limited to mu rder, drug trafficking and firearms trafficking. This was expanded by subsequent legislation and related case law to include a much wider range of offenses, including most violent crime, theft, and immigration-related offenses, such as document fraud and perjury. The 1996 Act amends the definition of \"aggravated felony\" by, am ong other things, lowering the fine and sentencing 85directed to ensure that every deportable convict was, in fa ct, deported. As a result, the number of criminal deportees from the U.S. to the Caribbean more than doubled between 1994 and 2004 (see Figure 6.3). Figure 6.3: Total Criminal Deportations from the U.S. to the Caribbean 3,1353,7054,4265,166 2,6982,499 2,2903,9144,6074,574 4,3425,0184,799 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security.108 6.14. If the number of prisoners in U.S. federal prisons is examined as a share of the total populations of the home countries of the convicts, then Jamaica contributes the most prisoners per head of population. Not surprisi ngly, then, Jamaica is the country in the Caribbean with the largest flow of deportees relative to its population, and its lead is growing (see Figure 6.4). An average of 1,200 convicts per year were deported from the U.S. to Jamaica between 1993 and 2004. 6.15. Jamaicans are also the most deporte d Caribbean population group from the United Kingdom and Canada, largely because they are by far the largest Caribbean population in those countries. Between 2001 and 2004, Jamaica absorb ed an average of 2,700 convicts a year from the three countries . In 2003, Jamaica's own current prison population was 4,744 (Walmsley, 2005), so the infl ux was equivalent to releasing more than half the domestic prisone r population into society ev ery year. In one study on released prisoners in the United States in the mid-1990s, about two-thirds were re- arrested within three years.109 It is therefore not surpri sing that Jamaicans might be concerned about an inflow of convicts of this magnitude. thresholds for many offenses, effectively including relatively minor crimes. Under this law, criminal deportation has been ordered for crimes such as shoplifting and urinating in public. See U.S. Department of Justice Fact Sheet 03/24/97. 108 Data published (Table 43) online at: http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/shared/about us/statistics/ENF03yrbk/ENF2003list.htm 109 Data from the United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, accessed on: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs /reentry/recidivism.htm 86Figure 6.4: Criminal Deportees from the 100,000 Population of Home Country 0.6516273652 0.5321293261 010203040506070 Cuba Haiti T&T Dominican Rep.Bahamas Jamaica2000 2004 Source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 2005.

During the late 1990s, the United States was far and away the leading source of criminal deportations to Jamaica, but th en deportations from the United Kingdom began to rise rapidly. While the bulk of these depo rtations were due to immigration-related crime, the number and the share of drug-rela ted deportations increased dramatically from 2001, nearly reaching U.S. levels by 2004. Propor tionate to the expatriate Jamaican population in each country, the U.K. today has a greater rate of deporting drug offenders than the U.S. This may be due to the fact that cocaine markets are growing in the U.K., 87and Jamaican \"yardie\" groups have traditionally been associated with marketing this drug (see National Criminal Intelligence Service, 2005).110 6.17. Despite this shift, the U.S. has continued to expel by far the largest number of violent offenders, deportin g over 200 convicted murderer s and 128 sex offenders to Jamaica between 2001 and 2004, while the U.K. and Canada combined deported 24 murderers and 32 sex offenders between them. On the whole, however, 81 percent of the criminal deportees sent from the three c ountries between 2001 and 2004 were deported for immigration-related matters, fraud, and dr ug offenses, which include an unspecified share of drug possession cases 111 (see Annex 6.1 for detailed st atistics on de portations to Jamaica from Canada, the U.K., and the U. S. for the 2001-2004, period, disaggregated by reason for deportation). Figure 6.6: Drug Deportations to Jamaica from the Unit ed States and the United Kingdom 159294629864773911 923984 020040060080010001200 2001 2002 2003 2004 UK USA Source: Social and Economic Survey of Jamaica, various years. 110 According to National Criminal Intelligence Servi ce of the United Kingdom, \"Hitherto, criminal groups of West Indian origin, mostly Jamaican, were seen to be most prominent in distributing crack cocaine within the U.K. ... However, as [c ocaine use] has grown, there have been opportunities for others to become involved... [Today,] most of the detected movements of cocaine trafficked from the Caribbean to the U.K. are smuggled by couriers, many under the control of Jamaican and Trinidadian groups.\" 111 Headley's research, cited below, found that about half those Jamaicans deported for drug offenses between 1997 and 2003 were convicted of drug sales and half for drug possession. 886.18. Thus, the vast majority of the offenders deported (81 percent) were convicted of non-violent crimes. Of course, those deported on the basis of non-violent offenses could be violent criminals, and drug dealers in particular may be more likely than other expatriates to commit violence . It is often easier for po lice to deport suspected gang members for immigration violat ions or drug possession, for example, than to bring them to trial for other offenses. Figure 6.7: Breakdown of Criminal Depo rtees by Crime Type, All Three Source Countries, 2001-2004 Fi re arm s an d vi ol e n t cri m e 11%Robbery, burglary, larceny 4%Other 4% Fraud and immigration 43%Drugs 38% 47 136 4948 5 Source: Elaborated from Social and Economic Survey of Jamaica, various years. 6.19. The Ministry of National Security and Justice study cited by the CARICOM Regional Task Force report (2002) found that a majority of deportees had been away for more than five years and that 14 percent of the 1,730 persons de ported in 2001 had been away for more than 20 years. The report sugge sts that deportees who have been away for a long period of time are at higher risk for re cidivism because they are likely to be without a social support system in Jamaica. 6.20. Some commentators have ar gued that many deportees le ft their home countries at a young age and learned criminal behavior while abroad. To examine this hypothesis empirically, Bernard Headley, a Professor of Criminology at the University of the West Indies, examined 5,174 records of criminal s deported from the U.S. between 1997 and 2003. He found that the mean age of entry to the United States was 23 years, nearly out of the high risk age demogra phic of 15-25, and less than 3 pe rcent arrived before the age of five years (Headley et al., 2005). A fifth arrived during the formative period of 16-20, however, during which experiences in both coun tries could have had some effect on the course their lives would later take. Thus, while there are some cases of deportees who left Jamaica at young ages and were largely raised in the United States, they constitute a minority of total deportees. 89Figure 6.8: Age on Arrival in the U.S. of Jamaican Criminal Deportees (Percent of Headley's Sample) 391621 1514 Headley et al, 2005. 6.21. Headley also examined the age at deportation, finding that the vast majority of convicted deportees were no longer young on thei r arrival in Jamaica, with 62 percent being 31 years or older. Normally, these ol der men would be less likely to re-offend, particularly with regard to the sort of ga ng violence with which the deportees are often thought to be associated. 6.22. In summary, the data indicate that th e average age of a criminal deportee entering the United States was 23, the averag e age on deportation was 35, and 81 percent were returned to Jamaica for non-violent offens es. While there is clear ly heterogeneity in the pool of deportees, the averag e deportee does not fit the prof ile of an individual who is likely to be a violent criminal on return to Jamaica. 6.23. On the other hand, Headley's research al so shows that over half (51.2 percent) of the deportees had already b een convicted of a crime in th e United States prior to the one for which they were deported. And even if the majority of the criminal deportees were deported for non-violent offenses, 224 convicted murd erers were included in the flow between 2001 and 2004. Relative to the Jamaica's population, this is not a particularly small number. 90Figure 6.9: Age on Deportation from the U.S. of Jamaican Criminal Deportees (Percent of Headley's Sample) 3161920 1923 0510152025 and olderpercent Source: Headley et al, 2005. 6.24. With current available data, it is possible to conclude that it is unlikely that the average deportee is committing violent crime in Jamaica. At the same time, it is possible that a minority of deportees is involved in criminal activ ity, and a few anecdotal cases have been reported in the pres s. In such small countries, it does not take a large number of offenders to have a large impact, particularly if they assume a leadership role in criminal gangs on their return or provide perverse role models for youth. Specifically with regard to drug trafficking, their transn ational connections and criminal experience could make criminal deportees well-suited for this role. 6.25. Are deportees contributing significantly to Jamaica's crime rate? The clearest way of answering this question would be to keep tabs on the de portees received and determine what share are later charged with an offense. Something like this has actually been done in at least two Caribbean count ries: Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. According to Griffin (2002), of 332 criminal depor tees returned to Barbados between 1994 and 2000, only 43 (13 percent) had been charged with a cr iminal offense at the time of the study. The averag e length of time between arriva l and being charge d with a crime was 17 months, and, with the exception of one murder case, most of the deportees were charged with burglary or drug-related offenses . Similarly, in Trinid ad and Tobago, of the 565 deportees received betw een 1999 and 2001 only 83 (15 percent) had been charged with a crime, of whom almost half (47 pe rcent) were charged with larceny or drug offenses (Griffin, 2002). 6.26. The CARICOM Regional Task Force on Cr ime and Security (2002) reviews the same figures and points out th at these figures sugge st that crime rates among deportees in those two countries are lowe r than those for the local criminal population. The Task 91Force argues that the reoffense rate for local criminals in both Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, and in Jamaica as well, is greater than 50 percent. 6.27. If data is not available that allows us to follow deportees after their arrival in Jamaica, it should still be possible to determin e whether deportees are more or less likely to be convicted of a crime than the local population by examining the share of the prison population that has experienced deportation. Of course, Jamaica's low conviction rates (about 25 percent) mean that a lot of susp ected criminals are ne ver convicted, so the prison population may not be a true reflection of the criminal population of the country. POLICY IMPLICATIONS 6.28. Whether the deportees are responsible for rising crime in Jamaica is a researchable question. Much support could be brought to this conten tion if the share of those charged with or convicted of crime were shown to disproportionately contain deportees. The government of Jamaica is currently sponsoring research in which deportees, gathered through responses to newspaper ads soliciting interviews, are questioned about their pa sts and their behavior. 112 Whatever the conclusions of this research, the question of who is resp onsible for these people will remain. 6.29. The United States, the United Kingdom, a nd Canada absorb much of Jamaica's talent, importing nurses, teachers, athletes, and skilled professionals. In fact, an estimated 85 percent of Jamaica's skilled labor emigrate s, largely to these three countries (Ozden and Schiff, 2006). Legally, sovereign states ar e privileged to eject those parts of the migrant population that do not meet standa rds. Morally, though, these countries might feel some sense of responsibility for the de portees, especially for those who were raised in the ghettos of three of the richest countries in the world. 6.30. There are several possible approaches th ese powerful countries could take to cushion the blow of criminal deportations on the islands to the south. In the United States, for example, most convicts are released from prison into some form of community supervision. Conditions are also placed on th eir release, encouraging legal employment and discouraging association with former criminal associates, for example. These protections and condition s are not present when a convict is deported. 6.31. Of course, providing parole officers a nd halfway houses involves some costs, and a key reason for the current drive in immigr ation enforcement, at least in the U.S., is to reduce the country's massive corrections bill. But these cost s would likely be less if the programs were conducted in Jamaica. For th e convicts that left Jamaica as children, whose families may remain abroad, some fo rm of cultural orient ation and networking would be essential if a return to criminality is to be avoided. 112 A forthcoming study conducted by Jamaica's Ministry of National Security and the Planning Institute of Jamaica, will examine the relationship between deportees and crime. The study was not available for review at the time of this writing. CARICOM is also carrying out a survey on deportees in some member countries, the results of which are exp ected to be available in early 2007. 926.32. The CARICOM Regional Task Force on Crime and Security (2002) recommended that member countries establish Offices for the Resettlement of Deportees modeled after a program in St. Kitts and Nevis, where the Re turning Nationals Secretariat is charged with facilitating reintegration of deportees. The Secretariat provides counseling and offers assistance in findi ng jobs, locating housing, and using social services. In Jamaica, a chur ch-based group known as the La nd of My Birth Association has recently started to offer similar serv ices to some deportees (Davidson, 2006). 6.33. The industrialized countries provide a variet y of forms of aid to the Caribbean to support development. Subsidizing reintegratio n for deported offenders could be a very cost effective way of achieving such an end. It would save society the cost, as well as the trauma, of recidivism; reduce criminal ju stice costs involved in processing and incarcerating repeat offenders; and promote the stability essential to attracting investment and promoting tourism. The end result might be less emigration, reducing the burden of deportation for everyone. 6.34. Moral obligations aside, it is in the self -interest of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada to avoid returning dange rous convicts to environments where they are highly likely to offend again. The United St ates in particular does not benefit from having unstable states ju st outside its borders. Drug dealers are likely to make use of their connections in both countries to promote furt her trafficking, and all three countries suffer from cocaine and cannabis imported via th e Caribbean or by Caribbean nationals. Exporting criminals could contribute to the bu ilding of transnationa l criminal networks. 6.35. Deportation thinking seems to rest on the premise that the borders are impregnable, when anyone involved in immigr ation enforcement knows that this is far from the case. Few countries would consider allowing early release of convicts in order to \"deport\" them to a neighboring city, wh en this is essentially what deportation accomplishes. It provides immediate relief fr om corrections expenses, but it releases offenders into an increasingly mobile global community. Headley's sample included over 500 cases where the subject was being deported for at least the second time in the six years included in the study. 6.36. In short, it is not possible for these th ree countries to simply export their crime problems south. Coming to terms with transn ational crime will require dealing with problematic migrants cooperatively. 937. CASE STUDY: DRUG TRAFFICKING AND THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES The drug trade is a prime driver of crim e across the Caribbean. In the Netherlands Antilles, authorities estimate th at 75 percent of cr ime is drug-related. Some 60 percent of all the cocaine seized in the Caribbean in 2004 was seized in th e Netherlands Antilles, and cocaine seizures there increased dramatically between 2001 and 2004. Confronted with large numbers of peopl e attempting to smuggle drugs by commercial flights, authorities implemented a \" 100% Control\" policy of sc reening large numbers of passengers for drugs. Drugs were confiscated from the courie rs, but in most cases the couriers themselves were not arrested. The program has been very successful in reducing cocaine smuggling via air courier, and could be tested in ot her contexts, including other Caribbean countries sufferi ng from drug transshipment. Th e Antillean example also highlights the need for coope ration between Caribbean tr ansshipment countries and destination countries in maritime interdiction. 7.1. Despite their diversity, the Caribbean c ountries share a comm on affliction: they are geographically positioned in the world's largest drug transit zone. South America produces nearly all the world's cocaine. The United States a nd Europe are responsible for 88 percent of global retail sa les of cocaine, a market worth some US$70 billion in 2003(UNODC, 2005). The gross domestic produc t of the entire Caribbean was US$31.5 billion in 2004. (ECLAC, 2006). In other words, the value of the drug flows through the region may exceed the value of the entire licit economy. 7.2. Drug trafficking is associated with signi ficant increases in crime, particularly violent crime and the use of firearms, as vi olence or the threat of violence regulates transactions in this market. In addition, dr ug trafficking is associated with money- laundering, trafficking of fi rearms, and corruption. Drug use is associated with increases in both violent crime and various types of property crime. For more on recent drug trafficking trends in the Caribbean, see Chap ter 2; for regional policy responses to drug trafficking, see Chapter 10. 7.3. CARICOM's Regional Task Force on Cr ime and Security, speaks of a three- pronged strategy to intern ational drug control: Eradication or altern ative development for producer countries (e.g. Colombia, Peru and Bolivia for cocaine) Supply restriction through in terdiction operations for transit countries (e.g. Caribbean states); and Demand reduction for the main consumer countries (e.g. North America and Europe).(CARICOM, 2002) 7.4. This chapter examines interdiction efforts in the Netherlands Antilles. The Netherlands Antilles are an autonomous part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. They are comprised of two groups of is lands located about 900 km apart: 94 Curacao and Bonaire, located in the sout h of the Caribbean, near the coast of Venezuela; St. Eustatius, Saba, and St. Maar ten, in the Eastern Caribbean.113 7.5. The Netherlands Antilles have a populat ion of 183,000 people , (United Nations, 2004; United Nations, 2005)114 about 75 percent of whom live on the island of Curacao. The country is relative ly well-developed, with a GDP pe r capita among the highest in the Caribbean, good infrastructure, and an economy based on tourism, fina ncial services, and oil transshipment. 7.6. The Netherlands Antilles was chosen as a case study for two reasons. First, it is one of the Caribbean territories most afflic ted by the drug trade and is among the world leaders in cocaine seizures per capita. Second, the government of the Netherlands Antilles, in collaboration with the Dutch government, has undertaken innovative and seemingly successful policies to interdict the supply of cocaine. 7.7. About 100 times more cocaine per capita was seized in the Netherlands Antilles than in the United States in 2004\u2014over nine tons, or just u nder 50 grams of cocaine for every man, woman, and child on the islands.115 Some 60 percent of al l the cocaine seized in the Caribbean in 2004 was seized in the Netherlands Antilles, and cocaine seizures increased dramatically between 2001 and 2004 (Figures 7.1 and 7.2).116 7.8. The increased flow of drugs though the region is beli eved to have a powerful impact on the local crime situ ation. The Netherlands Antilles authorities estimate that 75 percent of the crime on the islands is dr ug-related. On March 12, 2004, the Antillean government proposed a state of emergency due to the levels of crime afflicting the society, opening the door for both Dutch and An tillean military to participate in internal security operations. This was in response to a ra pid increase in the number of crimes seen in Curacao. Drug-related murders increased from 12 in 2002 to 29 in 2003. Other islands experienced similar problems. The murder rate in St. Maarten went from 20 per 100,000 in 2001 to 47 per 100,000 in 2003.117 113 St. Maarten is half of an island, the other half bein g St. Martin, a French territory. Aruba was part of the Antilles until 1986, when it became a separate country w ithin the Kingdom of the Netherlands. While drug trafficking through Aruba used to be a major issue, it is much less so today. Aruba was removed from the US State Department's list of major drug producing and transit countries in 1999. The reason for this decline is unclear. 114 World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision and World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision, http://esa.un.org/unpp, accessed 25 July 2006. 115 The Netherlands Antilles ranked eighth in the world in terms of gross cocaine seizures in 2004, just behind the Netherlands and just ahead of Bolivia and Brazil. 116 In addition to a possible increase in real volumes transiting the region, the dramatic rise in seizure figures is likely the result of a shift from an early focus largely on airport interdiction to intelligence-led operations against major traffickers, which only began to pick up around 2001. This was also the time that the Coast Guard of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba (CGNAA) came on line, after being equipped with three cutters in 1999. 117 Information on population and number of murders from the Central Bureau of Statistics Netherlands Antilles Statistical Yearbook as quoted on thei r on-line database: http://www.cbs.an/stat.asp. 957.9. As Figure 7.2 shows, the Netherlands An tilles have not alwa ys been at the epicenter of the global cocaine trade.118 Recently, a number of things have changed. Law enforcement efforts have made it less likely that cocaine shipments depart directly from Colombia than in the past, and more likely that they come from a secondary country, particularly Venezuela. Between much of th e Venezuelan coastline and the rest of the world lie the islands of Curacao, Bonaire, and Aruba, so maritime cocaine shipments are likely to pass through th e territorial waters of these countries. In addition, there is much commercial sea traffic between Venezuela and the Netherlands Antilles, which are just a few kilometers offshore. 119 This traffic provides cover for drug shipments that can then be forwarded by sea or by air. Figure 7.1: Kilograms of Cocaine Seized in Caribbean Territories in 2004 Netherlands Antilles 60%Bahamas 5%Trinidad UNODC Delta database. 7.10. The islands' continued membership in th e Kingdom of the Netherlands has also been important. While cocaine use in the Un ited States is down since the 1990s, it has been increasing in Europe. The European por tion of the Kingdom of the Netherlands is one of the two main points of entry for cocaine to Europe.120 The Netherlands Antilles have suffered from high rates of unemployment since the closure of the Shell refinery in 118 In the early days of the Colombian cartels, large volumes of drugs were flown by private planes into the United States, their main destination. Improvements in radar response put an end to this, and shipments became increasingly maritime. Again, most sea routes from Colombia to the U.S. did not pass through the most populous areas of the Dutch Caribbean. 119 Curacao is less than 65 km off the coast of Venezuel a. Venezuela is the source of 52 percent of imports to Antilles. See Economist Intelligence Unit, \"Netherl ands Antilles Country Report.\" London: EIU, June 2006. 120 The other being Spain. About 65 percent of the cocaine seized in Europe in 2004 was seized in Spain and the Netherlands. According to Eur opol, \"Cocaine is also shipped fro m South America to Europe via the Caribbean Islands. This in part can be explained due to the historical links that exist between the Caribbean and some European countries, for example Curacao and the Netherlands ...\" See Europol, \"Drugs 2006.\" The Hague: Europol, 2006, p. 3. 96the late 1980s, creating a pool of potential couriers with European passports ( Central Bureau voor de Statistiek , 2006).121 Figure 7.2: Kilos of Cocaine 11 23-1 ,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,0001 0,000 1 980 1 981 1982 1 983 1984 1 985 1986 1 987 1988 1 989 1 990 1991 1993 1 994 1995 1 996 1997 1 998 1 999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Source: UNODC Delta database. 7.11. A final factor in the remarkable seizure to tals relates not to the existence of the flow of drugs but rather to their detect ion. Assisted by the Dutch Royal Navy and the Coast Guard for the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba (a common agency of the three countries in the Kingdom), Antillean law enforcement has intercepted some massive shipments in recent years, shipments that might have been missed by less well-resourced agencies, or only apprehended on arrival in Europe. Further, both the Antilleans and the mainland Dutch have also taken an innovativ e approach to stopping what had been a virtual stampede of couriers on commercial air flights. At least until recently, they have had a \"drug focused\" (as opposed to courier-foc used) interdiction policy at the airports, a policy that is discussed further below. D RUG TRAFFICKING ON COMMERCIAL AIR FLIGHTS : AN INNOVATIVE POLICY RESPONSE 7.12. It is estimated that 30 tons of cocaine enter Europe on commercial air flights every year, and that Schiphol International Airport in Amsterdam has been one of the primary points of entry (Eur opol, 2006). In 2000, 4.3 tons of cocaine were seized at Schiphol (INCB, 2001), and by August 2001, the fl ow of cocaine from the Netherlands Antilles had reached crisis proportions. An innovative approach became necessary. The first priority became stopping the ingress of drugs, even if that meant identifying more couriers than could possibly be prosecuted. 121 In 2005, unemployment was 15 percent on Curacao, including 44 percent among youth. 977.13. Toward this end, the \"100% Control\" pol icy was implemented, in which flights landing in Schiphol originating from the Du tch Caribbean, Suriname, or Venezuela are subject to extensive searches.122 Rather than attempting to scare off potential smugglers with the threat of incarcera tion, the Dutch approach was ba sed on increasing the rate of interdiction to the point that smuggling becomes unprofitable. In other words, the focus was on the drugs, rather than the couriers, and was based on incapac itation, rather than traditional deterrence. Europol described the mechanics of the policy in this way: Crews, passengers, their luggage, the car go and the planes are systematically searched. Couriers with amounts of less than 3 kg of cocaine are not detained, unless they are arrested for the second time or another criminal offense is involved. Instead, the drugs are confiscated and the smugglers are sent back . Couriers who have been identified are re gistered on a blacklist, which is provided to KLM, Dutch Caribbean Airlines and Suriname Airways (Europol, 2005, emphasis added). 7.14. Detecting the couriers is not easy, becau se most carry the cocaine in their intestines. These \"swallowers\" ( slikkers ) ingest little balls ( bolletjes ) of cocaine, an average of 90 per courier, usually wrapped in two latex glove fingers and coated in wax (National Ombudsman, 2006). 123 If one of these bursts, the courier usually dies of an overdose. Consequently, this form of courie ring appeals most to people who are reckless, desperate, or ignorant. In other words, it appe als to people who are di fficult to deter with the threat of incarceratio n in a European prison. 7.15. The first recorded case of cocaine swallo wing in the Netherlands Antilles was in 1983. This form of couriering appears to have been exploited early on by West African organized crime groups, which have utilized body couriers to tr affic drugs between markets all over the world. The great advantag e of using commercial flights is that any criminal entrepreneur with a small amount of capital can try, and th is makes the method attractive to the loose, flat ne tworks that typify West Afri can organized crime. The West Africans soon abandoned personally couriering the drugs in favor of hiring people less likely to be searched, starti ng with Brazilians. Today, East Europeans feature prominently in the courier ranks. However, arrest statistics of the Dutch Royal Military Police, responsible for enforcement at Schiphol Airpor t, show that 46 percent of those arrested for drug offenses in 2004 were Antilleans (Trimbos Institute, 2005). 7.16. West African networks also pioneered the use of the \"shotgun\" approach, where multiple couriers are placed on the same fli ght with the hopes that a few will get through. Traffickers recognize that law enforcement au thorities can only arrest a limited number of couriers on any given day, as each require s extensive paperwork and subsequent court time. Once a few are detected, attention turns away from the rest of the passengers. By sending several couriers on one flight, traffickers are virtua lly guaranteed that some of 122 In practice, flights from Ecuador and Peru are also subject to 100% control, as all flights from these countries stop over in the Dutch Caribbean. 123 It has also been alleged that cat or goat intestines have been used as wraps as they are apparently more difficult to detect. 98their drugs will get through. At least, that wa s true before the 100% Control strategy was put in place. 7.17. Drug smuggling remains an attractiv e option for young islanders. While Antilleans are Dutch citizens and thus benefit from extensive social protections, just getting by may not be enough for some young pe ople. Caribbean youth often speak of the \"easy money\" to be gained through the drug trade, as compared to the near impossible employment situations many face (World Bank, 2003a). Partic ipation in the drug trade offers a tempting way to earn some re latively significant income quickly. 7.18. Under 100% Control, suspect ed couriers are taken as ide and questioned. Once officials have a firm basis for suspicion, th e suspects are given the option of proving their innocence by submitting to a body scan. Alternatively, they ar e kept in custody until their intestines empty themselves, whereupon culpab ility is positively ascertained. The Dutch authorities even offer a receipt for the drugs ta ken, so that couriers can explain the loss to their employers. 7.19. The strategy appears to have been re markably successful. Between 1 January 2004 and 1 April 2006, just under 4,000 flights were examined, 6,147 couriers were identified and 7.5 tons of cocaine were seized, 124 accounting for more than half of the cocaine seized at Schiphol airport. This amounts to 1.2 kg per courier, over 70 percent of whom carried the contraband internally (National Ombudsman, 2006). Figure 7.3 shows the decline in the number of couriers detect ed arriving from Cura cao at Schiphol. While the controls have remained quite consistent throughout, the number of couriers detected has dropped dramatically, from a peak of 463 couriers in the sec ond quarter of 2004 to less than 20 per quarter t oday, a 96 percent reduction. 7.20. The actions at Schiphol ar e only part of the story.125 The approach was actually initiated at Hato Internationa l Airport in Curacao in 2002, and today is being extended to other airports in the Netherlands Antilles, particularly St. Maarte n. Here, all passengers are screened and those identified as potential couriers are questioned. Those identified as couriers are given the option of proving their innocence, and thus being allowed to board the plane, by submitting to an x-ray scan. Only about one in ten suspected couriers elect to be scanned, and some of these are prov en to be guilty. Those who refuse are not allowed to board the plane and are not given a refund on their ticket, so failure to board is tantamount to an admission of guilt. 124 To put this quantity in perspective, it is more cocaine than was seized annually in any but the top 10 cocaine-seizing countries in 2004. 125 The importance of the actions on the Antilles side is demonstrated by the lesser success of the 100% Control strategy for couriers originating from Suriname, an independent country where cooperation has not been as close with the European Dutch. 99Figure 7.3: Couriers Detect ed Arriving at Schiphol from 343463 415 161 3/2005 4/2005 2006 2/2006 Source: Netherlands Ministry of Justice. 7.21. When this procedure was initiated, up to 100 people a weekend were denied boarding. Between mid 2002 and 2004, at least 13,000 people sacrificed their air ticket rather than face the body scan (Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, 2005). 7.22. Thus, the remarkable seizures at Schiphol were just the residua l that evaded the initial screening. On this basis, the author ities estimate that between 80 and 100 couriers per day were passing through the airport in 2003. This was cut to 10 a month by October 2005 (Bureau for International Narcotics a nd Law Enforcement Affairs, 2006). This reduction was accomplished not by draconian se ntencing of the mules, but by making the route unprofitable to the tr affickers organizing them. 7.23. The impact of this screening on organi zed crime was manifest in the violent response the airport team freque ntly encountered in the earl y days of the program. In 2003, they suffered at least seven firearm attack s in the airport, as well as threats and assassination attempts while off duty. At one stage, the body scan team was forced to suspend operations due to the threats they had received. 7.24. On those occasions where couriers are prosecuted and convicted in the Netherlands Antilles, they are given, in some cases, an alternativ e to incarceration: passport forfeiture. As part of a sentencing ag reement, convicted couriers surrender their passport for a specified period of time (up to three years). The Netherlands Antilles government has collected over 800 passports in this way. As with the 100% Control strategy, the intent is to incapacitate the c ouriers without the co sts of incarceration. 1007.25. While displacement effects would need to be tallied to properly evaluate the impact of this intervention, the 100% Control strategy has apparently disrupted what was once a major trafficking route. Of course, th e resources required to individually scrutinize every flight and passenger come at a cost, but these expenses are likely to be less than those of processing and in carcerating an endless stream of hapless mules. 7.26. The 100% Control strategy is not wit hout its critics. The Dutch National Ombudsman126 recently issued a report critical of the program in several respects (National Ombudsman, 2006). The Ombudsman rega rds as particularly objectionable the detention and search of innocent people, which comprise about one quarter of all suspects, and their treatment even when exonerated.127 Earlier practices, which involved body cavity searches, were abandoned on th e advice of the Ombudsman. The policy has also been attacked by national leaders from the Dutch Caribbean. Suriname's President Ronald Venetiaan called the policy \"inhumane, barbaric, and primitive.\" 128 It was also loudly condemned by Anthony Godett, who was set to become Prime Minister of the Netherlands Antilles before he was incarce rated on fraud and corruption charges. 7.27. This places the Dutch in a difficult positi on. They have a strategy that apparently works, and that is intended to be both more humane and more cost effective than incarcerating those that risk de ath by swallowing kilograms of cocaine. To be effective, however, a large number of people need to be searched, including some who may prove to be innocent. A more restrictive approach would risk failing to capture a sufficient share of the drug flow to make the route unviable. 7.28. Abandoning the approach altogether is unthi nkable, as there is evidence that the former torrent would resume immediately if there were a break in policy. For example, on December 26, 2005, two flights from Cu racao to Schiphol were offered to accommodate the flow of returning tourists, one of which was scheduled uncharacteristically early in the morning. Ap parently, couriers assumed that controls would be lighter or absent for the earlier flight, but had an unpleasant surprise when they arrived at Hato International. Dozens of no-shows left the fully -booked flight half empty. 129 7.29. Since Schiphol airport is now seeing only a courier a week from Curacao, the detention of innocent people is likely to be minimal, but re -routing may mean that other airports are likely to adopt a similar strategy,130 so the challenge of creating an even- handed and less controversial approach remains. There is a need for further research on the costs and benefits of the 100% Control sy stem, and frank discussion of the ways it 126 This office is tasked with investigating complaints against civil servants on behalf of the public. 127 As of mid-2006, some 2,271 people proved to be 'negatieve slikkers' out of 8,576 people searched, according to information pr ovided by the Netherlands Ministry of Justice. 128 Cairo, I, 'Suriname to complain against Dutch dr ug inspections'. Caribbean Net News, 20 March 2006. 129 Anecdote relayed in an interview with the Dutch Ministry of Justice, 27 July 2006. 130 The Netherlands is not the only country in the worl d to receive flights from the Antilles, or to find couriers on those flights. For example, Canada arrest ed at least eight trafficker s carrying over 100 grams of cocaine apiece on commercial air flights from the Antilles in 2004, according to the UNODC Major Seizures Database. 101could be improved. The fact that some di fficulties have been encountered with implementation does not mean the central principle\u2014drug, rather than courier, interdiction\u2014has been invalidated. 7.30. Of course, commercial air flights are only one of the vectors through which cocaine transits the Netherlands Antilles, a nd not necessarily the most significant one. The 100% Control approach has seized 7.5 tons of cocaine in two years, but multi-ton seizures can be made in a single instance of maritime interdiction. Si nce the share of sea shipments seized is almost certainly much less than the share of air couriers apprehended, it is likely that the vast majority of the cocaine traffic is maritime. MARITIME TRAFFICKING 7.31. The first boat trip cocaine encounters on the Netherlands Antilles route is the short passage from the coast of Venezuela to Curacao, about 65 km away. This trip is essential whether the drug will ultimately be trafficked by sea or by air. Traditionally, go- fast boats carrying between half a ton and a ton of cocaine have been used. But in 2004, the authorities noted a shift to smaller shipments (50-500 kg) in smaller, slower boats, including fruit and fishing boats (UNODC, 2004). 7.32. On arrival in the Netherlands Antilles, cocaine destined for onward maritime shipment is generally consolidated. An estimated 230 tons of co caine enter th e European Union annually via maritime shipments a nd air freight, an unknown share of which transits the Netherlands Antil les (Europol, 2006). Large seagoi ng vessels have been used to bring this contraband to Spain, increas ingly via West Africa. The extent of containerized traffic of narcot ics to Europe is debated. Ther e are few concrete cases, but U.S. authorities suggest that th is is an active trafficking vect or (U.S. Department of State, 2006). 7.33. The United States also receives cocaine from the Netherlands Antilles, often trafficked via go-fast boats and in the holds of leis ure sea craft from St. Maarten to Puerto Rico, but this flow is not considered a si gnificant source of the United States' supply. However, law enforcement cooperation betw een the United States, Colombia, and the Netherlands Antilles has led to some si gnificant drug arrests in recent years. 7.34. Detecting maritime trafficking requires intelligence work and a dedicated interdiction force. In 1996, the Coast Guar d for the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba (CGNAA) emerged as a distinct entity after acquiring three cutters designed for combating drug traffickers. It continues to work with the Royal Navy of the Netherlands (RNN) in making major seizures. In 2004, the Netherlands Antilles saw their largest seizure ever when some 2.5 tons of cocaine and 28 kg of heroin were seized. But since that time, numerous large maritime seizures have been made: On June 25, 2005, 1.8 tons of cocaine was seized by the CGNAA and RNN (Netherlands Ministry of Justice, 2006). On July 21, 2005, a Venezuelan craft ca rrying 792 kg was seized (Netherlands Ministry of Justice, 2006). 102 On August 27, 2005, a joint U.S./Dutch effort seized over two tons of cocaine from the Bolivian flagged M/V Sea Atlantic (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, 2005). 7.35. While final seizure figure s for 2005 have not yet b een released, these three seizures alone would amount to about half the cocaine seized in 2004, a record year. 7.36. Of course, the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba are situated between Venezuela and Europe, just off the Colombian border. This location means that shipments directly from Venezuela to Europe often pass thr ough Antillean/Aruban waters incidentally. In short, the CGNAA and the RNN are doing a lot of Europe's interdiction work close to the source. These seizures may have little to do with the Netherlands Antilles or the Antilleans. 7.37. All indications are that Venezuela will c ontinue to grow as a conduit for cocaine, and this is likely to mean that maritime se izures in the Netherlands Antilles will remain high. As the Colombian government continues to make progress, those elements of the FARC and the AUC committed to conflict or criminal incomes are likely to withdraw into Venezuela. The small Caribbean countries will need international support if they are to continue to form the front lin e in maritime cocaine interdiction. POLICY IMPLICATIONS 7.38. Looking strictly at the seizure figures, one might see the disproportionate use of the small Netherlands Antilles for drug traffick ing as an indictment of Dutch drug policy. The reality is more complicated than that. The Netherlands Antilles are somewhat unique in their geographic vulnerability, particularly with regard to maritime trafficking. In essence, they constitute Europe 's (and, to a lesser extent, th e United States') first line of defense against drug shipments coming from the Venezuelan coast. The high seizure figures are largely a product of remarkab le police work, and should be commended, not condemned. 7.39. The fact that the Netherlands Antilles are preferred by air c ouriers is another matter. This is undoubtedly tied to the fact th at the Netherlands is a key drug distribution center for Europe, which in turn is tied to the perception that the Dutch are soft on drugs. But here again the Neth erlands have risen to the challe nge and, at considerable expense and effort, have managed to stem what was once a major source of cocaine supply to Europe. Not only that, they managed to do so in a way that did not destroy the lives of the troubled youth and addicts that comprise the corps of international drug mules. 7.40. Of course, even eliminating the Nether lands Antilles as a drug transit area altogether will not stop the flow of drugs, a nd displacement effects are inevitable. French authorities are already assert ing that Charles de Gaulle airport is increasingly being targeted by air couriers, and lesser airports are also seeing increased drug traffic. In August of 2006, almost 40 kg of cocaine was seized from French and Dutch nationals in six separate incidents at Orly airport in France. Cocaine seizures in nearby Trinidad and 103Tobago have skyrocketed since the program really began to take off in 2003, although whether this is strictly a di splacement effect is unclear. Figure 7.4: Cocaine Seizures in Trinidad and Tobago 9457391 9517 9 71 7813 7203821 17 3 17 35901 ,892 -2004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,8002,000 1 992 1 993 1 994 1 995 1 996 1 997 1 998 1 999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005kg of cocaine seized Source: UNODC Delta database. 7.41. Despite their success, the Dutch seem intent on disavowing the drug-centered interdiction approach, having faced considerab le international criticism before all the numbers were in. Today, they are quick to insi st that all couriers wi ll be prosecuted, but often neglect to mention that this is only po ssible because the numbers have declined so radically, due in no small part to the fact th at not every courier was prosecuted in the past. This reluctance to promote drug-centered interdiction is unfortunate, because the 100% Control experiment represents an i nnovation worthy of further promotion and testing. 7.42. Of course, Caribbean countries may object to the intense scrutiny of passengers arriving from their countries. But the alterna tive, involving the arrest and prosecution of many Caribbean nationals for drug trafficki ng, may be even less palatable. Officials positively identified over 6,000 couriers arriving at Schiphol from the Dutch Caribbean in less than three years, at least half of whom were Antilleans. In the absence of a drug-focused policy, all these people mi ght be in Dutch jails today. 7.43. Focusing on the drugs rather than the cour iers is a powerful a pproach because it defeats the \"shotgun\" technique, where traffickers are willi ng to sacrifice an endless stream of gullible couriers so long as suffici ent quantities of drugs arrive for them to make a profit. It has proven itself to work in the case of the Netherlands Antilles, and could be tested in ot her contexts, including other Caribbean countries suffering from drug transshipment. Once there is clear evidence that a particular routing is being used by drug mules, measures similar to the 100% Control approach could be ta ken at both source and destination airports. Drug-focused interdicti on bypasses the couriers, who, willing to risk their lives for a few thousand Euros, are unlikel y to be deterred by threat of incarceration. 104Instead, it speaks directly to the traffickers in the language they und erstand: it renders drug routes unprofitable. 7.44. The Antillean example also highlights the need for cooperation between Caribbean transshipment countries and destina tion countries in maritime interdiction, as called for by CARICOM's Regional Task Force on Crime and Security (CARICOM, 2002.) Given that small Caribbean countries have inherent limitations in law enforcement capacity, a little assistance can go a long way. 7.45. Of course, this case study does not deal with all elements of the drug puzzle in the Caribbean; the Caribbean Regional Task Force on Crime and Security identified several challenges beyond su ccessful interdiction: On the demand side, to reduce demand and treat and rehabilitate drug abusers. On the supply side, to find ways to count er the attraction of cultivation of illicit crops as a means of livelihood. In terms of rehabilitating those convicted of drug possession, to introduce a penal system that places greater emphasis on uniform, non-custodial sentences for drug abusers and minor drug offenses, with th e aims of promoting rehabilitation, and reducing prison overcrowding. 1058. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CRIMI NAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS TO THE CONTROL OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE : A CASE STUDY OF JAMAICA AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 131 Criminal justice reform is a key com ponent of broader multi-sector approaches to reducing crime and violen ce in the Caribbean. In recent years, tr aditionally organized, criminal justice institutions have been fa ced with demands that they respond more effectively to increasing le vels and new forms of crime and violence. Ongoing debates over the ability of crim inal justice organizations to reduce crime levels make it clear that their impact can be overstated and that improv ing sector performance at best affects the proximate\u2014and not the fundamenta l\u2014causes of crime. None theless, in response to citizen demands many nations in the Caribbean region are attempting to reform and modernize sector institutions, combining higher budgets (to allow increased staffing and the creation of more servic e units) with impr oved management, upgrading of personnel and personnel administration, new technologies, and the in troduction of new operating procedures. Most of this work has been done with police, courts, prosecutors, and public defenders; very little has been attempted with prisons despite th eir potential role in deterring crime and rehabilitatin g offenders. There is also an increasing focus on developing management inform ation systems and perform ance indicators for better problem diagnosis, tracking of system out puts, monitoring reform programs, and increased accountability to ci tizens. This chapter reviews these developments in the context of two of the larg est countries in the region: Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. It also reviews some of the statistics generated as a means of tracking recent trends and gaps in reform stra tegies. Although most reform efforts have focused on individual institutions, two important lessons emerge: (i ) the need to pursue better coordination among institutions, including the introduction of in formation systems capable of tracking systemic perf ormance, and (ii) the desir ability of linking criminal justice reforms to a broader, multi-sector strategy of crime an d violence prevention. INTRODUCTION : CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN CIVIL AND COMMON LAW SYSTEM 8.1 Although there has been a tendency in th e Caribbean to over-rely on law-and- order responses to crime and violence (as op posed to other, more prevention-oriented approaches\u2014see Chapter 9), the criminal jus tice system remains an essential tool in crime and violence control and, to some ex tent, in their prevention. Academics and researchers specializing in the topic remain divi ded as to the real impact of the criminal justice system on reducing crime. As James Q. Wilson\u2014an early proponent of the strict responses to crime and the author of the original \"broken windows\" thesis\u2014has written, 131This chapter is based on a background paper by Todd Foglesong (Senior Progra m Associate at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York and Senior Research Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government) and Christopher Stone (Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Professor of the Practice of Criminal Justice, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University). The authors are grateful to Andres Rengifo and Glendene Lemard for research assistance and reviews of drafts of the background paper. Additional material on Jamaica was provided by Florence Darby (independent consultant), and on the Dominican Republic by Linn Hammergren (World Bank). Linn Hammergren and Stephanie Anne Kuttner drafted this chapter. 106\"There is no silver bullet that will redu ce crime, much less eliminate it...[N]o one can satisfactorily explain changes in crime rates \"(Wilson, 2004). 8.2 This uncertainty, however, cannot be an excuse for inaction, especially for governments facing increasing levels of crime and violence and citizen demands that they do something about them. This is still more critical in countries whose criminal justice systems have languished unattended for decades, lack the technical and human resources to respond to less traditional types of cr ime, have not adopted new standards of transparency and accountability, or have them selves been penetrated by political and occasionally, criminal elements. 8.3 Criminal justice reform is part of a broader law and justice reform movement that began twenty years ago in the Latin Am erican region, and somewhat more recently, in Eastern Europe (Hammergren, 2002). Le ssons can be drawn from this broad international experience, as well as from experiences in the Caribbean (IADB and Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development, 2000). 8.4 One frequent observation is that criminal justice reform can be very difficult, if not impossible, absent sufficient political wi ll. Stakeholder support that reinforces the political will to reform is equally indisp ensable and thus a good understanding of reform supporters and potential detracto rs, both within the criminal justice system and society more broadly, is key to designing the appr opriate reform strategy. A second important lesson is that success of these efforts depe nds on aligning the work of the different institutions within the system, and of the sy stem as a whole with a larger, multi-sector crime and violence prevention strategy. Until recently, these two elements tended to be overlooked, occasionally with very unfortunate results. 132 8.5 In the Caribbean region, the two major legal traditions or families, common and civil law, have taken somewhat different approaches to crim inal justice reform. In the civil law systems (and especially those of Span ish and French origin), the initial emphasis was on modernizing criminal procedural codes to effect a shift from inquisitorial to more accusatory systems and incorporate more ri ghts for the defendant. The due process emphasis was a logical reaction to the abuses of prior authoritar ian regimes and also 132 A donor-sponsored effort to recreate a Haitian police force in the 1990s, for example, floundered in part because of inadequate attention to other elements of the criminal justice chain. Courts and prosecution continued to operate much as before in processing cases - slowly, inefficiently, and impaired by politicization and corruption - and moreover provided no more check than they ever had on police abuses. Prisons, which received still less atte ntion, were quickly overcrowded by those arrested by the police, meaning that inmates suffered from inhumane conditions, we nt long periods without being seen by a judge, and occasionally protested by stagin g riots and further damaging alread y inadequate facilities. This truncated reform has been reviewed critically by many experts, including some who were involved in its implementation. For a summary of the initial process, see Rachel Neild, \"La Reforma Policial sugg ests, Neild does not discount the successes of the effort, she is quite clear that failures to attack rela ted problems like political intervention and an unreformed judiciary were already (in 1998, when the article was written) threatening to undercut the accomplishments. 107followed trends already underw ay in continental Europe.133 The incorporation of crime control objectives came slightly later, so that some of the initial legal changes occasionally appear to conflict with the pur suit of crime control. While there is no inherent contradiction between due-process and crime-control in procedural codes, codes written to advance only one of these objec tives can undermine progress in the other.134 More importantly, it is increasingly recogni zed that law reform does not automatically advance either end, and thus that more attention must be pa id to rationalizing organizational structures, improving internal management and oversight, human resource development, and the introduction of new techno logies and technical skills. Progress here has been spotty, partly because of the fina ncial investments required, and partly because of the resistance of interests vested in the inefficiencies of the traditional systems. 8.6 In the common law countries, legal change has been less emphasized and more importance has been given to upgrading and st rengthening institutional capacities. As in the civil law countries, there is an emerging consensus on the importance of integrated reform programs that simultaneously improve and coordinate the functioning of different actors and institutions within the criminal ju stice system\u2014that is, to ensure linkages between police reform, reorganization of prosecution agencies, strengthening of the judiciary's capacity and inde pendence, and modernizing corr ectional systems. However, as in the civil law nations, effecting coordi nation in fact is far more difficult than espousing it in principle. 8.7 Traditional criminal justice systems from both legal families react to crime by incapacitating offenders though in carceration, sending a deterre nt message to potential offenders, and providing the society with a se nse of justice. The approach is usually popular with the public, but as even sympatheti c experts like Wilson not e, its efficacy is subject to dispute; it still requires sophisticat ed strategies, inter-inst itutional coordination, and strict oversight; and absent these conditions, it can lend it self to corrupt and abusive application. 8.8 More modern systems stress additional elements: (i) preventive policing; (ii) more strategic approaches to prioritizing crim es for investigation and prosecution; (iii) rehabilitation of prison inmates and re-entry programs to reduce recidivism; and (iv) use of alternative sentencing, fast track procedures, and concilia tion with the victim for minor offenses. All of these additions are intended to make more e fficient use of resources and 133 Throughout Latin American and the Caribbean, entr enched authoritarian regimes often used the police and other criminal justice agencies as a means of repre ssive control. Even after a democratic transition, the structures and practices introduced fo r this purpose may be hard to eradi cate, but unless they are reversed, other reform activities are unlikely to work and may even have perverse consequences. Community policing and other preventive tactics in the hands of a corrupt, irresponsible police force may be an invitation to harassment of citizens. More independent judges insufficiently monitored by their own institutions may remain susceptible to bribes and favoritism. 134 As just one example, many of the early reformed code s stipulated that within ten days of the initiation of an investigation, the person(s) targeted had to be informed so that they could prepare their defense. While for simple crimes this may pose little problem, for those of a more complex nature (e.g. drug trafficking, money laundering, and grand corruption), the provision could stop the investigation in its tracks. Poorly drafted provisions about police-prosecutorial coordination also commonly aggravated conflicts between the two institutions. Hammergren, op cit. 108to maximize the impact on discouraging crime before it happens or on limiting its further effects. 8.9 The following sections first describe the criminal justice reforms currently under way in the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. This brief overview provides the context for a subsequent comparative performance anal ysis based on statistics recorded by the two countries. A final secti on discusses governance structur es that are conducive to successful reform. COUNTRY CASES : TWO APPROACHES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM The Dominican Republic 8.10 The Dominican Republic, while one of the few civil law countries in the Caribbean, is a quintessential example of th e broader Latin American justice reforms. Trujillo's thirty-one year dictatorship (1930-1961) was ac companied by a centralized, ad hoc domination of all governance institutions, in cluding those in the justice sector. With the advent of democracy, this system wa s quickly replaced by party-based, patronage politics in which governmental elites used public employment as a means of consolidating coalitions and rewarding followers. 135 Low official salaries and massive turnovers at the end of ever y administration increased the incentives to seek irregular supplements and to dedicate little effo rt or time to one's official job. 8.11 In the justice sector, the results were predictable\u2014inefficiency, high levels of corruption and abusive practices, poor serv ice delivery, and low public confidence (Hasbun et al., 1999). In the 1990s, public discontent with the situation, spearheaded by a local NGO, FINJUS, provoked a series of reform measures (Salcedo, 2003).136 The first set involved: the introduction of a new system for appoin ting Supreme Court justices,137 the Court-supervised renewal of a good part (70 pe rcent) of the rest of the bench via transparent, merit-based examinations of seat ed members and aspirants; the creation of a judicial career path; and, incr eased funding to improve judi cial salaries and finance equipment, infrastructure, and training programs. 8.12 A second, more far-reaching reform wa s the adoption of a new criminal procedure code in 2002. In line with regional tr ends, the code featured more accusatorial 135 Low-level police officers were one exception. Since their jobs are dangerous and poorly paid, there is not an abundance of would-be recruits. Higher-level officials, however, were frequently chosen for their political connections, not their probity or inclination to encourage better police work. For a discussion of the general problem, with some reference to the police and judiciary, see World Bank, Dominican Republic Public Expenditure Review: Reforming Institutions for a More Efficient Public Expenditure Management. Washington, D.C.: the World Bank, Report No. 23852-DO, March 15, 2004. 136 For a discussion of the reforms and of the complaints leading up to them. 137 Justices had formerly been appointed by the legislature. The change was introduced by constitutional amendment in 1994 but not put into effect until 1997. It established a judicial council, headed by the national president and with members from other branches of government and the private bar, which met solely for the purpose of filling vacancies in the co urt. The council's deliberations and the list of candidates were made more transparent, thereby, at least in the first round, discouraging appointments based solely on political allegiance. 109elements and a greater role for public prosecu tors and defense. With donor assistance, the old public defense system, based on court-appoi nted lawyers, was converted to a formal career with measures to supervise public defenders' performance. This eliminated a major source of corruption; many former de fenders were known for taking and offering bribes and charging for theoretically \"free\" representation of indige nt clients. Donors have also been active in supporting program s to improve and professionalize public prosecution, but here progress has been fa r slower. A career system has only been partially implemented for ordinary prosecutors, with the Attorney General and the district prosecutors (who oversee other members of th e institution in their respective geographic jurisdictions) still appointed and removed by the Executive. 8.13 With strong support from local NGOs, a new police law was enacted in 2004. Its aim was to demilitarize the national force, promote professional development, improve internal oversight, and incr ease accountability to civil society (Bobea, 2003; Grullon, 2003). Unfortunately, the law's implementation has faced resistance from those within and outside the police force inte rested in retaining the trad itional practices. While there have been some interesting experiments w ith new policing techniques (see Box 8.1), the institution's public image remains poor, and th ere are strong indicatio ns of continuing police involvement in criminal activities a nd in shaping investigations to favor the politically and economically powerful. 138 8.14 The Dominican criminal (and wider) justi ce reform thus remains half-completed. There are progressive elements in all the basic institutions who are interested in promoting further change, but more efforts are needed to finish the job of rooting out the corrupt and inefficient (Par ticipaci\u00f3n Ciudadan\u00eda, 2004).139 With the exception of the largely untouched prison area and public de fense, budgets are arguably high enough and the sheer quantity of employees sufficient to do better, but there are problems related to how resources are used, the quality of profe ssional and support staff, and the incentives shaping their behavior. 138 For a discussion of police corruption, see DR1, January 20, 2005 citing comments by a delegation of experts from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York and from FLACSO, http://www.dr1.com/new s/dnews012005.shtm . The former notes that the \"difficulties include the low wages paid to police officers, the bad reputation the fo rce has for rampant corrupti on in the ranks, and lack of facilities to do the job.\" FLACSO's accompanying comment is that \"crime in the DR is closely linked to the corruption levels within the police and the unskilled police officers\" See also the U.S. State Department country report on human rights for 2005 ( http://222.state.gove/g/drl/rls ) which notes problems originating in a failure to vet police recruits and World Bank Country Memorandum on the Dominican Republic which notes (p, 156) that 48 percent of firms surveyed reported paying bribes to police. http://www- wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menu PK=64187510&pagePK=64193027&piPK=64187937&the SitePK=523679&menuPK=64154159&searchMenuPK= 64258544&theSitePK=523679&entityID=000090 341_20061122101801&searchMenuPK=64258544&theSitePK=523679 139 On court and prosecutorial inefficiency in handling corruption cases, FINJUS has been particularly outspoken, noting that as of early 2005, and despite numerous high level scandals (most notably Baninter and PEME, the job-creation program), there had yet to be a single conviction. See www.redinter.org/Dem ocracria-al-dia/41135 . 1108.15 Both the criminal procedures and poli ce reforms arguably placed too much faith in the ability of law to alter behaviors a nd to overcome traditional practices. Slowness in reforming the public prosecution and the police force has so far impeded more radical change. There are also unfortunate signs of so me backsliding in the judiciary, especially in the handling of corruption cases involving political and economic elites (Participaci\u00f3n Ciudadan\u00eda, 2004). Cases have been dismisse d, delayed or had charges reduced because of what the judges term prosecutorial inco mpetence and what the prosecutors claim is judicial collusion. As this an d the troubled relations betw een police investigators and prosecutors suggest, the reform has also pa id insufficient atten tion to the need to coordinate activities across institutions. 8.16 Thanks in part to donor support, the police, judiciary, prosecu tion and defense have established systems to track activities in each institution. The court's actions in this area in fact date to before the reforms. Ho wever, it is not evident that the resulting information is being used to monitor reform progress and detect problems, and there has so far been no effort to link the databases of th e separate institutions so as to be able to assess their joint handlin g of cases in which they all participate. Although the Dominican Republic has recently established a national council to develop a multi-sector strategy for dealing with crime, the country's track record with such special committees has not been positive. Often composed of agency heads or prominent local experts, they frequently possess moral authority, but few resources a nd technical staff to support their work. Jamaica 8.17 As a former British colony and current member of the Commonwealth, Jamaica already has a common law, accusatorial just ice system. Pending the establishment of a Caribbean Court of Justice, it s court of last resort is th e United Kingdom Privy Council. Its Appeals Court is the highest local body. At the next level, its Supreme Court includes a panel to try major felonies, and anothe r to handle gun issues. The more numerous magistrate courts have criminal divisions to handle minor crimes. Their approximately fifty members also serve on a series of specializ ed courts for traffic, family and juvenile matters. Jamaica also has roughly 8,000 justices of the peace. As they are not lawyers, their judicial role (for exampl e, sitting on the 14 Petty Sessi ons Courts) is restricted to handling very minor disputes. Their more co mmon functions are clerical or notarial, signing passport applications, cer tifying the identity of applicants for drivers licenses and the like. 8.18 Contrary to practices elsewhere in the Commonwealth Caribbean, the 1962 Constitution created a separate prosecution body, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), thus eliminating the use of police pros ecutors for criminal cases in any of its courts. The 7,200-member Jamaica Constabular y Force (JCF) is responsible for most policing. Its efforts can be supplemented in some areas by the Jamaica Defense Force (JDF). The country has eight adult prisons and four juvenile detentio n facilities, all of which are overcrowded and in physical disrepair. Segregati on of other groups (e.g. the mentally ill) needing special attention, reha bilitation and reintegration programs, and programs for young offenders are either defici ent or non-existent because of resource constraints and popular opposition to pu tting more funds into prison reform. 1118.19 Jamaica has faced a high and increasing leve l of violent crime for the past thirty years, with drug trafficking and or ganized gangs playing a major role.140 While crime has traditionally been highest in urban areas and especially in the inner-city slums of the Kingston metropolitan area, poli ce contend that their anti-crime measures have forced criminals into rural areas where rates are rising as well. Prison crowding and public outrage are also increased by th e delays in investigating and prosecuting criminal cases. The small court and prosecution system s are swamped, and the non-use of plea bargaining and alternative disput e resolution (ADR) for minor crimes tends to delay trials inordinately. While corruption, especially in the police, is sometimes blamed for the perceived failure to bring the guilty to justi ce, more important factors appear to be the inadequate numbers of judges and prosecuto rs, poor police and general system image, especially in low-income communities, and a consequent tendency for citizens to take more direct methods in hand (Darby, 2006). 141 Poor community relations have been aggravated by what the government calls a \"s uppression of crime cu lture\" originating in the 1974 Suppression of Crimes Act. The act ga ve the police extensive search and seizure powers without a warrant. Only repealed in 1993, it is said to have influenced an entire generation of police officers who felt empowered to act without due process constraints. 8.20 Over at least the past decade, the gove rnment has introduced a number of measures to improve overall efficacy and efficiency while eliminating abusive practices. Donors have been instrumental here, although also facing complaints of a failure to coordinate their own actions. Citizens and NGOs have also been invited to participate in these efforts. As regards expe diting court cases, measures include the establishment of night courts, a drug court, and regional gun courts, as well as th e expansion of the number of magistrates; the enforcement of the rule that Clerks of Courts (prosecutors in the Magistrates Courts) be attorneys, the inclus ion of a trained court administrator in each court, training of stenographers for Ma gistrates Courts, a 2000 amendment to the Criminal Justice (Reform) Act of 1978 that allows j udges to impose non-custodial sentencing options, a Criminal Justice (Pl ea Negotiation and Agreements) Act (2004) and, in civil justice, the development of new Procedures Rules, case management systems, and ADR mechanisms. The government proposes to extend the case management system to criminal cases as well. In January 2006, the cabinet announced a five-year program to reform the justice system , to coordinate its own actions as well as donor assistance. Although not legally manda ted, both the courts and the DPP have begun to provide Parliament with periodic reports on their activities. 8.21 On the police side, the revocation of the Suppression of Crimes Act represents a first step. In 1999, the Police Public Compla ints Authority (PPCA) was established. While functioning, it investigates only a fraction of fatal shoo tings by police, in a country with one of the highest rates of police ki llings in the Western Hemisphere. Amnesty International reports the PPCA h ead as saying that \"he did not consider it appropriate or possible to hold the Jamaican police accountable to the same standards as other countries, 140 A poll done by Stone Polls in August, 2006, found 64 percent mentioning crime as the most important problem, followed by joblessness (20.7 percent) and leadership (1.7 percent) 141As Darby notes, there are problems with police corruption as well, especially as regards collusion with drug gangs. 112due to the high level of gun-related crime in the country,\" (Amnesty International, 2001). The government has also introduced a number of initiatives to partner with law agencies in other countries as a means of combating organized criminal gangs, improving security in marginalized communities by providing trai ning to and facilitati ng partnerships with community members, strengthening border co ntrol of illegal drugs, creating community action committees to encourage community-bas ed crime control, and creating a Police Civilian Oversight Committee. Like the reforms in the other sector agencies, most of these are too new to evaluate their chances of success or even sustained implementation. 8.22 Although sheer quantities of human and fi nancial resources ar e often less of a problem than claimed, it would be hard to contend, given the levels of crime and violence, that they are not problematic in Jamaica. Existing resources might be more efficiently deployed and controlle d, and there is certainly room for managerial and legal change to combat court delays. However, the low judge and prosecutor to population ratios (3.2 and 3.1 per 100,000 inhabitants as compared to the Dominican Republic's 7.0 and 8.0 respectively and a Latin American aver age for judges of 8.1), while characteristic of the English style common law system, s eem inadequate to the existing challenges either in processing cases or detectin g and prosecuting police malfeasance. 8.23 There is also an interesting lesson here for the Dominican Republic in the failure of Jamaica's accusatory system to meet citi zen performance standards, especially since both countries currently confront complain ts of uncontrolled police abuse, poor community relations, and low clearance rates for major crim es. Clearly an accusatory system does not resolve these problems automa tically, and more direct actions must be taken. A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE : PERFORMANCE STATISTICS AND INDICATORS 8.24 The somewhat disappointing returns to many standard reform initiatives have prompted researchers, policy makers, and practitioners of legal and judicial reform to search for better ways of assessing the pe rformance of justice systems and tracking progress in reform programs (World Bank, 2005b) . Their universal conc lusion is the need to improve the statistics collected by orga nizations on their own operations and to encourage the development of management information systems and their constant monitoring and analysis by thos e making organizational policy. 8.25 Management information systems can be used to: i) diagnose and measure the nature and scope of the initial workload (e.g., numbers and types of cr imes reported); ii) evaluate the performance and operational effectiveness of individual institutions within the system (e.g., numbers of po lice investigations complete d and of cases transferred from police to prosecutors, percentage of investigations or tried cases resulting in a conviction, recidivism rates upon re lease from prison, etc.); iii) determine whether the individual instituti ons in the system (police, prosecutors, j udicial system, prisons) are 113working in alignment ;142 and iv) identify the impact of the system on the broader objective of reducing crime and violence. They can also be used to develop a series of indicators to track the most critical outputs and impacts and to he lp outside observers understand and evaluate the reformers' efforts. 8.26 Indicators are best produced not by ad hoc efforts to measure outputs currently of interest, but through the routine registrati on of basic data on work processes by those carrying them out, and the transfer of key in formation to centralized databases where the data can be reviewed and an alyzed for its broader implications. When the process is linked to the wide-spreading adoption of auto mated \"case\" files, it should not represent extra work for the front-line employees. Such systems, once in place, provide management a very potent tool for review ing organizational performance and identifying and diagnosing problems. They also facilitate the creation of new indicators as they are needed. 8.27 The following sections draw on statistics currently recorded by the governments of the Dominican Republic and Jamaica to deve lop a series of comparative indicators on the performance of their criminal justi ce system. As the accompanying discussion suggests, the indicators are us eful in signaling where prob lems may exist, but a full understanding of their significan ce and causes requires a contex tual analysis of additional statistics and quite probably a review of the raw data on which they are based. M EASURING THE SYSTEM 'S WORKLOAD : REPORTED OFFENSES 8.28 The first of all variables th at must be tracked is the workload that the criminal justice system experiences. While the uniform ed police in particular undertake a variety of tasks that does not involve the processing of individual cases, the number of reported offenses is the single best indicator of systemic workload. This information can be used in tandem with knowledge of the resources requ ired to process an average case to get a sense of whether current resources are pr oportionate to the sc ale of the problem. 8.29 Having a unified set of national statistics on crime is critical to understanding organizational performance and improving cr ime prevention inte rventions\u2014recognizing, of course, that under-reporting may mean that only a small fraction of certain crimes will be reported. Unfortunately, the government of the Dominican Republic is unable to generate a unified set of national figures on the numbe r of crimes recorded. The collection of information about offenses in th e Dominican Republic is left to the separate agencies of law enforcement (such as the National Division for the Control of Drugs) and, within the national police, divided up by different divisions responsible for their 142 Systemic alignment allows the disparate elements of the criminal justice system to work together in harmony. It, for example, would allow: i) the prosecution to reinforce and multiply the effectiveness of the police, rather than inadvertently undermining police actions; ii) the provision of services to victims of past crimes to improve citizens' confiden ce in the criminal justice system a nd hence contribute to the reduction of future crimes; and iii) the appropriate sentencing of those committed of crimes (youth facilities, prisons, alternative sentences, etc.) to maximize rehabilitation. 114investigation. Because these se parate institutions use different language, frames, and reports to record these data, there is no clear national por trait of all crime.143 8.30 Jamaica, in contrast, aggregates inform ation about all reports of crime in the department of statistics of the Jamaican Constabulary Fo rce (JCF). The JCF receives reports from commanders in each parish and then sorts them into six categories of \"major crimes.\" Unfortunately, at least according to one police official, the reliability of these figures is suspect.144 The Jamaican Constabulary Force had some 7,200 ranking personnel at the end of 2005 to deal with 1,674 murders, yielding a ratio of 4.30 officers per murder.145 For comparative purposes, in Sout h Africa, there are some 120,000 police officers and 19,000 murders, for a ratio of six to one.146 In the Dominican Republic in 2005, there were about 26,000 police officers (Cen tro de Estudios de Justicia de las Am\u00e9ricas, 2004-2005) and 2,400 murders in 2005, for a ratio of about 11 to one.147 While useful as a first approximation of workload, international comparisons of police/murder or police/population ratios are sometimes problematic.148 INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES Police Performance Indicators: Clearance Rates for Homicide 8.31 As in almost all countries, the police in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic routinely measure their \"clearance\" rate at which dockets leave their authority and become the primary responsibility of the prosecuting authority. 149 This is a key performance indicator for both uniformed pers onnel and investigating officers, as both parties play a key role in gathering information and witnesses, and apprehending suspects. Acceptance of the case by prosecutors and judicial au thorities indicates that the police have built a sound case. Police do not generally track the processing of the case through the justice system or otherwise mo nitor the rates at which arrests yield 143 Within the national police, the function of analyzing crime and violence is greatly dispersed. Beneath the Office of the Chief of Police (J efatura), there are a few data analysts as well as a Department of Statistics, along with a more recent creation, the Department of Mapping. The Division of Criminal Intelligence (DINTEL), formerly the S ecret Service, has its own analytical unit and statistics division. The Division for the Investigation of Crimes (DICRIM) is supported by a Department for the Analysis and Processing of Information, but its subordinate opera tional investigative units, such as the Departments of Homicide, Robbery, and Auto Theft, also have their own data collectors and analysts. Each of these departments and operations, moreover, receives di fferent quantities and types of information. 144 Interview with senior police official. 145 This is below the official allocation of roughly 8,000 positions, an indication of accompanying recruitment problems. 146 http://www.saps.gov.za 147 The Dominican government does compile national homicide figures, released through the office of the Attorney General. 148 Differing distributions of types of crime across countries, different policing models (preventive vs. reactive, beat patrol vs. car patrol, etc.) mean that comparing ratios across countries is problematic. More fundamentally, the number of offens es reported is endogenous: improved police-community relations will result in more incidents reported to police and lower pe rsonnel to offense ratios, but this may be the result of good performance rather than an indicator of insufficient personnel and associated poor performance. 149 The police consider a crime cleared if a person is arrested for the offense or if they conclude that the crime was committed by a person who subsequently dies. Some police forces also consider a crime cleared if they have named a suspect (usually in an arrest warrant) who has not yet been apprehended. 115convictions, as this largely depends on the act ivity of prosecutors. Of course, the police continue to play a role right up to the time of conviction, and therefore it is important that the performance of the system as a w hole be monitored by a higher authority. 8.32 The national police force in the Domini can Republic does not track clearance rates for homicide separately from other cr imes against the person (e.g., robbery, assault). Nevertheless, unpublished information compiled by the police about the number of reported violent crimes for which the police had made an arrest shows that in the last four months of 2005 and first month of 2006, the police recorded 1,643 \"crimes against the person\" and made arrests in 33 to 40 percent of such cases. 8.33 Analysts in DICRIM, the Division for the Investigation of Crimes, are trying to improve this indicator, for in its present form it does not distinguish between old and new cases (e.g., one cannot tell what portion of th e 111 cases solved in September came from the 83 cases pending in August). They also hop e to separate homicide from assault and robbery, which they suspect have lower rates of clearance, but they have yet to overcome the technical and administrative hurdles to such an assessment. 8.34 A more discriminating measure of cleara nce rates can be composed with data collected by the Stat istics Department of the Jamai can Constabulary Force. Table 8.2 shows how this Department sorts reported homicides into categories by \"motive\"\u2014that is, the circumstances which a police investigator or statistician considers to have caused the act of violence. 150 It records clearance rates (\"C/up\") for each type of newly reported homicide.151 These vary from a low of zero in cases of drug-related mu rders in 2005, to a high of 83 percent for \"other criminal acts\" in the first six months of 2006. Table 8.1: Homicide Clearance Rates in Jamaica by \"Murder Motive,\" 2005 and 2006 (January 1-July 16) C/up C/up N % N % Drug Related 15 2% 11 73.3% 15 2% 0 0.0% Gang Related 159 44 224 61 Domestic 22 3% 14 63.6% 26 3% 18 69.2% Other Criminal Act 335 47% 278 83.0% 423 46% 260 61.5% Not Yet Established 48.7% 928 100% 339 36.5%Murder Motive Reported % of total Reported % of total2006 2005 8.35 As a measure of police performance, clearance rates are key. The job of detectives or judicial police is to build a prosecutable case against a suspect in each instance of serious cr ime they record. Of course, cases may emerge to be unfounded or 150 Mr. Barrett, the deputy director of the statistics department, explained that, in reviewing police reports of homicide and other crimes, the disparity between th e reported facts of the ca se and the account of the investigator sometimes compels him to redefine the motive for the murder. Personal interview, July 17, 2006. 151 A separate table tracks the number of murder s from \"previous years\" that are cleared. 116the interests of justic e may not support a prosecution, so clearance rates will never be 100 percent. Furthermore, \"clearances\" achieved at the scene of th e crime\u2014through witness identification, direct police obs ervation, or even the death of the suspect\u2014are weaker indicators of performance, since they are inflated by good fortune and violent confrontations.152 But given that the share of these \"eas y\" clearances is not likely to vary over time, police can still strive to better the rate at which they handle the more difficult cases.153 8.36 In order to give an assessment of how these clearance rates compare internationally that is fair to the police, a dditional information is required, including the number of active cases per homicide detectiv e. In general, though, the overall homicide clearance rate in Jamaica is comparable to th at in other countries with sound police forces and similar levels of economic development. External Accountability Measures : Complaints against the Police 8.37 Of course, high clearance rates cannot be the only indicator by which the police are judged. Excessive zeal as we ll as baser motives can lead police to run afoul of the law, and success in combating crime must be leavened with respect for human rights. For this reason, it is essential that the number and nature of co mplaints agains t the police be tracked. 8.38 Complaints against the police are a mi xed indicator. On the one hand, they reveal sometimes shocking misconduct, and the media coverage given to these events can undermine confidence in the system. On the ot her hand, they indicate that the public has sufficient faith in the system to report these offenses. Changes in the number of offenses recorded, particularly in periods of transition, could be more indicative of an increase in citizen awareness and participa tion in the complaints system than of real changes in the incidence of misconduct. 8.39 In Jamaica, two separate bodies collect complaints from civilians against the police: a Department of Internal Affairs within the JCF and the Police Public Complaints Authority (PPCA) within the Ministry of Just ice. There is little pub lic information about the work of either of these en tities. Still, there are signs th at the government of Jamaica is trying to improve their effectiveness as accountability mechanisms. The National Security Strategy for Jamaica, promulgated by the Ministry of National Security in May 2006, recommends that, as part of the strategic review of the JC F, there be an assessment that would \"examine legislative and higher le vel administrative structures, such as the Police Services Commission (PSC) and Police Public Complaints Authority (PPCA), in 152 Some police forces, including the JCF, consider a crim e cleared if the suspect is killed. In nearly one- quarter of the cases of robberies considered cleared by the JCF, the suspect had been killed by police officers or civilians. 153 Additional refinements to the clearance rate could help the police promote equity in their policing and adherence to certain human rights standards. For example, police statisticians could develop a measure of equity by distinguishing between clearance rates in poor versus affluent districts\u2014recognizing, of course, that factors beyond the police control in the short ru n such as problematic police-community relations may reduce clearance rates in poorer districts. 117order to facilitate an effective civilian oversight mech anism for proper accountability for its performance and conduct,\" (Min istry of National Security, 2006). 8.40 In the Dominican Republic, the Office of Internal Affairs is charged with holding police accountable for misconduct. Its dire ctor is appointed by the President, not the Chief of Police, and thus enjoys some independence and autonomy. This office has an independent investigative capacity within its staff of 214, although its resources are stretched. It can initiate its own investigatio ns as well as act on complaints it receives from the public. In the past, when this o ffice recommended disc iplinary proceedings against police officers, these we re typically adjudicated by a police tribunal. Increasingly today, however, according to the new director, complaints substantiated by the office are brought before ordinary courts.154 8.41 Between August 2005 and May 2006, the period for which detailed information is available, the department received 637 complaints, an average of two per day.155 Nearly three-quarters of these complaints we re substantiated thr ough investigations, an extraordinarily high percentage for any country. Just over ha lf of the complaints (319) involved allegations of physical aggression or death threats by officers. This indicator suggests both high levels of misconduct and go od performance by the Office of Internal Affairs in holding individual police officer s accountable to profe ssional standards. 8.42 The office is currently designing a str onger information management system, which should improve both the reliability and the range of data available for performance measurement. If that new syst em were to include information (currently not recorded) about the complainants, it would allow the office to measure the equity in its own responsiveness, especially to poor and vulnerable groups. 8.43 In neither Jamaica nor the Dominican Republic do the formal accountability mechanisms reach beyond oversight of the police. There is no national justice commissioner or ombudsman for the receipt a nd investigation of complaints against other institutions in the criminal justice system. Prosecution and Adjudication Performance Indicators: Prisoners Awaiting Trial or Sentence 8.44 The most common indicator for measuring prosecutorial perfor mance is the rate of convictions. While a certain share of cases accepted from the police may be dismissed in the interest of justice, the decision of the prosecutorial aut hority to undertake the expense of a trial must be hinged on a belief that the accused is guilty and the case can be 154 Interview with General Daisy Liriano. 155 In 2005, the department of internal affairs investigated nearly 7,000 matters of disciplinary and other infractions. It requested indictments for 123 officers, and submitted another 363 to the police tribunal to consider their suspension or remova l from the national police force. In addition to this sum, 111 officers were suspended, and another 96 released from the fo rce as a result of complaints of domestic violence, improper use of firearms, robbery, and other acts. See \"Memoria Annual 2005,\" unpublished report, National Police. 118won. The number and nature of convictions therefore remain the primary measure of prosecutorial effectiveness. 8.45 But in addition to effectiveness, the effi ciency and the equity of the prosecutor's work are key. Trial verdicts must be delivered as quickly as possible so that the innocent may be released and the guilty can undergo rehabil itation. Failure to do so has serious consequences, including overcrowding of pris ons. As a result, the share of prisoners awaiting trial is a another ke y indicator of criminal justice system performance. 8.46 In countries where the system has collaps ed, such as Haiti, as many as 80 to 95 percent of all inmates may be awaiting trial, (Vera Institute of Justice , 2006; National Center for State Courts and USAID, 2006)156 and the situation is nearly as bad in many parts of the Caribbean. Undue delays in the processing of cases are a violation of the human rights of prisoners awaiting trial. In addition, in countries like the Dominican Republic, where prison cells are seriously overcrowded, rehabilita tion work becomes impossible, and again, human right s concerns emerge. It is t hus essential that criminal justice systems strive to reduce the share of prisoners awaiting trial (see Clouatre, 2002).157 8.47 Good management statistics can help iden tify the problems and their sources and track the impact of reform measures. However, few courts, and neither of those surveyed here, currently capture sufficient statistical data on system-wide performance to permit this kind of analysis158. Thus, we are left with one gl obal indicator, the percentage of unsentenced prisoners. 156 \"Prolonged Pretrial Detention in Haiti\", July 2002 gives the lower figure. A recent study by the National Center for State Courts indicates that in Port-au-Prince, the numbers in 2005 approximated 95 percent, although nearly all the detainees faced charges for major felonies. 157 There are several ways of doing this. One is to in crease the efficiency of th e prosecutorial process, which involves coordinating a wide range of criminal justice actors. The police must take the capacity of the justice system into acco unt when engaging in discretionary arrest s, such as those encountered in mass \"sweep\" operations. Judicial hours must be reasonable. (In many countries, judges sit for absurdly short hours each day due to entrenched tr aditions that have not responded to present-day reality. In Haiti, for example, the courts of first instan ces (Courts of Assizes) conduct hearin gs on serious felonies only twice a year, thereby extending pre-trial detention periods Court management (record keeping, scheduling practices) is important. The provisio n of pre-trial screening and legal reforms can allow for the release of many non-violent accused who would otherwise be held with no bail or with bail set beyond their means. 158 Where adequate records are kept at the courtroom leve l, analysts can use case file samples to investigate potential problems - delays and their causes, differential treatment of parties or types of cases, and even signs of corruption. However, absent direct access to web-based, electronic files, this is time consuming and costly work. For an example, see World Bank, 2003, An Analysis of Court Users and Uses in Two Latin American Countries. Washington D.C: The World Bank, Report No. 269666 119Figure 8.1: Sentenced and Un-sentenced Pr ison Inmates in the Dominican Republic: May Unsentenced 8.48 In the Dominican Republic between May 2003 and September 2004, when the new code of criminal procedure went into e ffect, the total population in custody declined from 16,491 inmates to 12,806. As the Figure 8 .1 shows, most of this reduction came from the ranks of unsentenced inmates and the number awaiting the outcome of appeals.159 From September 2004 through May 2006, however, there has been no major change in the number of inmates. The number of unsentenced prisoners initially declined, but then rose again toward the end of 2005; th is group still comprises nearly 70 percent of all persons in custody.160 Prison Performance Indicators: Escape s, Deaths, and Violence in Custody 8.49 The role of the prison system is to prevent prisoners from committing crimes while in custody and to work toward their rehabilitation. The fo rmer goal is easily measured in the rate of escapes and the amount of violence in pris ons. The latter, often summarized in some form of recidivism ra te, is much more difficult to capture. 8.50 Figure 8.2 shows the indicators measured in the Dominican Republic, including deaths in custody and non-lethal violence. The indicators are difficult to inte rpret in this 159 On average, another 100 to 140 inmates were in custody each day pending the ruling of a cassation court. 160 Prisons in general are substantially over-crowded: the system has a legal capacity of just over 9,000. 120form because they show absolute numbers ra ther than rates per prison population. As seen in the earlier discussion of pretrial de tention, the prison population in the Dominican Republic was substantially highe r in 2003 than the stable level it maintained from 2004 through mid-2006. When recalculated as rates, the level of deaths in custody appears to be steadily increasing from 48 deaths per 10,000 prisoners in 2003, to 58 in 2004, and to 68 in 2005. The figures for the first five months suggest that the prisons may be experiencing their first decline in recent years, back down to an annu al rate of 49 deaths per 10,000 prisoners. The prison administra tion does not report the reasons and circumstances of these deaths, so the rela tive contribution of crowding, illness, and violence to these problems cannot be determined. 8.51 The changes in the number of escapes (F igure 8.2) are perplexing whether or not these are calculated as rates. The huge annual swings in the numbers of escapes reported make any comparisons with other countries mean ingless, since the security of the prisons will seem relatively loose or tight dependi ng on the year. In 2006, there were 24 escapes in the first five months of the year.161 Figure 8.2: Prison Deaths, Escapes, and Recaptures, Dominican Republic 77 7588 62 1250 2258 27 16 1614 0102030405060708090100 2003 2004 2005 2006 (estimated) Deaths Escapes Recaptures77 7588 62 1250 2258 27 16 1614 0102030405060708090100 2003 2004 2005 2006 (estimated) Deaths Escapes Recaptures77 7588 62 1250 2258 27 16 1614 0102030405060708090100 2003 2004 2005 2006 (estimated) Deaths Escapes Recaptures Source: Direcci\u00f3n General de Prisiones, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica Notes: In 2005, an additional 138 inmates died during a fire. The estimate for 2006 is based on 26 deaths, 24 escapes, and 6 recaptures in the first five months of the year. 8.52 The Department of Correctional Services in Jamaica also tracks this kind of information with additional de tail, including the level of non- lethal violence. The prisons in Jamaica report substantial reductions fr om five years ago in both the number of unnatural deaths and the numbe r of violent inci dents in custody (Figure 8.3). In 2001, 161 The number of \"recaptures\" in 2 003 exceeds the total number of esca pes because of a large number of escapes in the preceding years. 121there were 17 unnatural fatalities out of a tota l of 33 deaths in pris on. In 2005, there were 8 unnatural deaths out of a total of 20. In 2000, there were 153 violent incidents reported in adult institutions. This number decreased to 92 in 2005. The numbers of violent incidents appears to have increased in 2004 and again in 2005, but the Director of the Department of Correctional Serv ices attributes this to bett er systems of reporting. There were seven escapes from prison in 2004, and none the following year, although a \"massive escape\" from the Tower Street facility was apparently foiled in 2005.162 Figure 8.3: Unnatural Deaths and Violent Incidents in Jamaican Prisons, 2000-2005 153185 105 355492 817 6228 020406080100120140160180200 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005violent incidents in custody unnatural deaths Source: Department of Correctional Services, Annual Report, 2005. 8.53 The Department of Correctional Services in Jamaica is eager to develop a wider range of indicators, including measures of re cidivism. The Department is beginning to collect and report information on the number of persons admitted to prison who have previously been incarcerated. At first glance, an increase in this number might appear to reflect an increase in recidivism, but it is equally or more likely to reflect changes in the performance of other institutions of the system. For example, if increases in the numbers of police lead to increases in arrests, the numbers of prisoners with prior incarcerations should increase. If sentencing legislation is toughened, if prosecutors become more aggressive in their charging d ecisions or more effective at obtaining convictions, or if judges become more punitive in their sentencin g, the result will be an increase in the number of prisoners with prior records of in carceration, even if recidivism remains flat. Perhaps most likely of all, if community su rveillance of people re turning from prison becomes more effective\u2014as is occurring in almost every country\u2014then returning prisoners will be especially vul nerable to re-arrest and re-i ncarceration, creating a false impression of rising recidivism. 162 Some of this information is now available on the website of the Department of Correctional Services, http://www.dcsj.net/p/stats.htm 1228.54 A better measure, and one more widely used globally, is the percentage of prisoners released in a particular year who ar e re-admitted within three or five years. This indicator is also ambiguous\u2014responsive to en forcement efforts as well as changes in actual criminal conduct by releas ed prisoners\u2014but it is be tter than the alternatives. Moreover, it could be calculated by the Department of Correct ions on its own, once it puts in place record systems that accurately identify new persons admitted with their prior records. 8.55 Even better, however, would be systems that track the re-arrest of released prisoners, or surveys that captu re the experiences of released prisoners in much shorter time periods. Such data, focusing on recidivism in the first month, quarter, and year after release, would allow officials and prevention programs to identify some of the proximate causes of re-offending. I MPACT INDICATORS : USING CRIME AND ARREST DATA FOR CRIME PREVENTION 8.56 The discussion above has shown that the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, while making serious efforts to improve, st ill have a way to go in improving their performance measurement and the basic functi oning of their criminal justice systems. The systematic collection of pe rformance statistics, the gene ration of key indicators, and benchmarking for improvement should become a routine part of crim inal justice system management, and performance against these indicators should be published and used as part of the budget allocation pro cess. These figures should also be made available at the precinct level, so that local constituencies can hold their public servants accountable. 8.57 Could the criminal justice systems in these two countries be doing more to reduce crime and violence? That question ne cessitates looking beyond the indicators discussed above and delving more deeply into the mechanisms by which the activities of the justice sector actually c ontribute to reductions in crime and violence. In countries around the world, officials are asking themselv es such questions, producing a global shift of strategic thinking within criminal justice. 8.58 More sophisticated indicators must captu re the extent to which the criminal justice system acts proactively to eliminate the proximate causes of crime and violence. Such a criminal justice system would analyze crime patterns and use arrest powers strategically. Measuring and Understanding Cr ime: Analyzing Crime Patterns 8.59 Officials in the Dominican Republic are experimenting with ways of using the data that allow them to see more deeply into the proximate causes of crime that law enforcement might then target. Specificall y, the police in the Dominican Republic are beginning to track the level, timing, and moveme nt of crime as part of the Barrio Seguro Program, using digitalized maps and census da ta from the National Office of Statistics (see Box 8.1 for a description of the Barrio Seguro Program.) An initial draft of a \"calendar of crime,\" prepared by the Unit for the Analysis and Processing of Information within DICRIM, records the time and days in which offenses committed in public in each 123of the neighborhoods tend to o ccur (Secretary of th e State of Interior and Police of the Dominican Republic).163 8.60 These efforts to measure and understand crime are promising not only because the police can adjust the freque ncy, routes, and number of o fficers on patrol in response to this analysis, thereby increasing the effi ciency of deployments, but also because the public can use this knowledge both to avoid victimizati on and to more effectively participate in efforts to reduce crime. Measuring Impacts of Specific Criminal Justice Instruments: Reducing crime by using arrest powers strategically 8.61 Because the police often conceive of arrest as the end of their work, prosecutors and courts see it as the begi nning, and the work of managers of jails and prisons can be burdened by unnecessary arrests, governments need impartial assessments of the system-level impact of arrest on crime and justice. 8.62 Based on data supplied by the police, it is possible to estimate that there currently are between 50,000 and 55,000 arrest s each year in the Dominican Republic. Few of these roughly 50,000 annual arrests are pursued further by the justice system. According to data from the Ministerio P\u00fablico, judges granted 12,237 requests to continue an arrest in the twelve mont h period of September 2004 to August 2005. In 5,318 of these instances (43.4 percent), a judge la ter ordered the suspec t held in pretrial detention pending the outcome of trial. 164 Beyond this, very little can be said as the government does not track the proportion of people arrested who were later held accountable for their behavi or by the justice system. 8.63 The use of arrest powers by the police in the Dominican Republic, in short, is not typically followed by prosecution an d even less likely to be followed by imprisonment. From a crime reduction perspectiv e, this might be a good thing. If serious crime is reduced in areas where such stops are made, the police may be making an important contribution to pub lic safety. Moreover, if th e police are conducting stops within the law, and if the consequences for those stopped are brief and bearable, then the police may be using arrest powers in ways that reinforce the rule of law. However, to ensure this is the case, there need to be syst ems in place to verify that arrest powers are being used efficiently and within the law. 163 These efforts are being supported by a partnership be tween John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Secretary of the State of Interior and Police of the Dominican Republic. See the report on the website of the Ministry, www.seip.gov.do/2006/web/acuerdos_documentos.php 164 The Supreme Court is in the process of installing a sy stem by which to track th e number of requests for arrest and detention that are granted by the judiciary. Personal Communication with Nestor Borroa, Department of Statistics, Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. 124Box 8.1: Using Crime Data and Analysis to Formulate a Multi-Sectoral Crime Prevention Strategy: the Barrio Seguro Program in Capotillo In July 2005, the government of the Dominican Republic launched the Democratic Security Plan (Plan de Seguridad Democratica). This plan was prepared by the Secretary of Interior and Police, the National Police and the Office of the Attorney General with th e support of the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights, the John Jay College of New York, the Univ ersity of Florida and Newlink Political Consulting firm. The Plan includes both preventive and control measures to reduce crime. The Plan established specific objectives based on the diagnosis of the security problem in the Dominican Republic. Based on a situational analysis and after id entifying the cities/barrios with the highest level of crime, a pilot plan called Barrio Seguro (Safe Ne ighborhood) was implemented in Capotillo with the intention to both reduce and prevent crime. Capotillo, compared to seven other crime-affected neig hborhoods in the National District, had recorded the highest levels of incidents related to drug trafficking, street delinquency, armed robbery, organized crime and gangs, as revealed by background analysis for th e Democratic Security Plan . From January to August 2005 there were 30 homicides recorded in Capotillo; th is is equivalent to an annualized homicide rate of 118 per 100,000 residents. The inability of the police to control crime in Capotillo had led to deterioration in public confidence: only 17% of the population believed that the police was doing a good job, and 80% of the population considered th e police to be corrupt. Barrio Seguro was designed on the basis of data reporte d in the Democratic Secur ity Plan. The program began in August 2005 and key interventions included: Increased police patrols in 30 previously identified hot spots. The addition of 230 specially trained police to patrol Capotillo. They were equipped with 3 new vehicles and 14 motorcycles for street patrol, as well as with a refurbished police station. Situational crime prevention meas ures included infrastructure im provements to: i) facilitate access to and exit from the area; ii) provide street li ghting; and iii) create new recreational areas for public use. Investments targeting youth included: constr uction of new classrooms and development of cultural workshops and sports clinics. General prevention programs included literacy programs and civic educational promoted by the office of the First Lady through its Progresando Program which is targeted to educate and help single mothers and their children. In total, the government allocated RD$46 million pesos (US$1.4 million) to execute the Plan in Capotillo. Barrio Seguro began to demonstrate positive results in Capotillo after only two months. Assaults and robbery declined 85 percent between early August and the end of September, 2005. No crime-related death was reported in this two-month period. From January to August 2006, there were 9 homicides in Capotillo, compared to 30 registered during the same period in 2005\u2014a 70 percent reduction. The su ccess of the Plan in Capotillo inspired its replication in 12 other neighborhoods, beginning in January 2006. While it is too early to definitively categorize Barrio Seguro as a success story (the project has not yet been subject to a rigorous impact evaluatio n), the approach is promising. It incorporates many principles that have shown to be effective internationally: i) co mplementarity between prevention and control initiatives; ii) policing focusing on hot spots and based on quantita tive data on crime patterns; iii) use of situational crime prevention measures; and iv) involvement of the community and civil society organizations. 1258.64 Specifically, two features of the arrest s raise concerns. Only a small proportion is reviewed by prosecutors or scrutinized by courts, and the stops themselves are not subject to independent oversight. A modern ju stice system that relies on stops and arrests for minor offenses to suppress crime still ne eds a means to assure that the police are acting within the law in their interactions with the public. Equally important, the impact of these stops and arrests on crime is uncerta in, for the police do not yet analyze whether their stops are followed by a re duction of crime in the imme diate vicinity of the police actions. 8.65 In the case of Jamaica, it is possible to provide a superficial analysis of the relationship between arrest a nd reported crime. In 2005, according to police data, there were 15,746 arrests in Jamaica. In the sa me year, there were 8,461 reported \"major\" crimes\u2014murder, shooting, rape, carnal abuse, robbery, burglary, larceny. There were, in other words, nearly twice as many arrests as major reported crimes. This ratio suggests that the Jamaican police are using arrest powers to deal with many \"minor\" offenses.165 8.66 In Jamaica, there is reason to worry that the use of ar rest powers is not strategically targeted on high crime areas. The overwhelming majority of arrests in Jamaica took place in \"rural\" regions\u2014that is, outside the metropolitan area where nearly half the population resides. The name \"rur al\" may be misleading, since many rural areas have urban centers with populations over 100,0 00. Still, 72 percent of all arrests took place outside the metropolitan area, while 57 pe rcent of all major crimes were reported inside the metropolitan area. 166 It is possible that recorded crime is lower outside the metropolitan area precisely because arrest power s are used so vigorously; alternatively, it is possible that crime is heavily under-repor ted in \"rural\" areas, or, as police now claim (see above) that urban criminals have been dr iven outside the major cities. Still, this anomaly calls out for further investigation. 8.67 A third way to measure the strategic use of arrest powers is to examine the relationship of arrests to imprisonment. This calculation can be made in both Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. In Jamaica in 2005, the average daily prison population was reported as 3,982, approximately one-fourth of the number of annual arrests. In the Dominican Republic that year, the pris on population was 12,858, or roughly the same ratio to arrests as in Jamaica. Again, these ratios could indica te that arrests are being used to manage crime in many cases wholly apart from penal sanctions. This use of arrest powers to manage crime directly, rather than me rely to take an offender the first step on the way to prison, is increasingly c onsidered a sign of good police strategy if it is targeted, measured for its effect on crime, and reviewed by an independent authority (Weisburd and Braga). It is important that these steps be taken in the Dominican 165 For example, state and local police departments in the United States in 2004 cleared 62.6 percent of murder offenses, 55.6 percent of aggravated assaults, 41.8 percent of forcible rapes, and 26.2 percent of robbery offenses. The data for major property crimes sh owed that agencies cleared 18.3 percent of larceny- theft offenses, 13.0 percent of motor vehicle theft offenses, and 12.9 percent of burglary offenses. 166 The data on recorded crimes and police arrests come s from the Department of Statistics of the Jamaican Constabulary Force, which generously shared information and insights about crime analysis and problem identification. 126Republic and Jamaica, especially in light of local critics' contention that such practices serve other, less desirable purposes.167 CONCLUSION : FROM ORGANIZATIONAL REFORM AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TO INTERAGENCY GOVERNANCE 8.68 In both case study countries and th roughout the Caribbean, the on-going organizational reforms and stepped-up efforts to measure performance will require concerted attention over the n ear to medium term. However, to achieve their broader goals, the reforms will also require inter- agency governance mechanisms and incentives for individual agencies to align their in dividual programs. If sector-wide governance mechanisms are to succeed, their authority must go beyond performance monitoring to include real executive powers. 168 The recent history of police and justice reforms in both Jamaica and the Dominican Republic illustrates this need. 8.69 Today, both governments are poised to introduce better instruments of interagency governance. In December 2005 a nd again in May 2006, the Ministry of National Security of Jamaica disseminated for public comment a green paper on public safety, in which it proposed, among other th ings, to locate responsibility for the implementation of such a strategy in the office of the Prime Minister (Ministry of National Security, 2006). 169 In July 2006, the Presiden t of the Dominican Republic decreed the establishment of a National Security Council, w hose job is to \"plan, produce, coordinate, and evaluate the use of inter-in stitutional information for the prevention of crime.\"170 8.70 The plans for the Security Council in the Dominican Republic are more advanced than in Jamaica, and yet its succe ss is not assured. In order to succeed, the new National Security Council will need a staff and other resources that make it a real instrument of governance, as well as a composition that does not simply represent the leadership of individual agencies or re peat membership on other inter-governmental committees. It will also need special skills to ensure the alignment of criminal justice system statistics and indicat ors and to coordinate effo rts to prevent crime. 8.71 Finally, in both Jamaica and the Domini can Republic, innovations in governance should look beyond the criminal justice system for assistance in crime prevention. Victim services, indigent defense, addiction treatment, other pub lic health services, and youth programs might all be brought to gether in the service of reducing crime and violence. 167 See Bobea, op cit. As Bobea's article predates the new Dominican police law, which she helped to promote, there may have been positive changes since its enactment. However, considering long-standing, and well-documented abuses in that country, the introduction and careful monitoring of a more strategic and transparent approach to the use of a rrests would seem especially essential. 168 An example of sector-wide coordination currently limited to performance m easurement is the role played by the National Commission for the Coordination of the Reforms in Chile. For a discussion of these challenges, see Measuring Progress Toward Safety an d Justice: A Global Guide to the Design of Performance Indicators Across the Justice Sect or, Vera Institute of Justice, 2004. www.vera.org/indicators 169 The non-government organization, Jamaicans for Justice, released a parallel strategy paper, \"Road Map to A Safe and Secure Jamaica,\" whose prepara tion was supported by an opposition leader. 170 For a report of the decree, see www.presidencia.gov.do/frontend/articulo.php?id=4225 127Governance structures need to be created to ma nage these efforts as part of a coordinated crime prevention strategy. 1289. GUNS AND CRIME: A CASE ST UDY OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO171 The rise of crime in the Cari bbean has been characterized by the increased use of more powerful weapons, resulting in higher mo rtality levels. In 2004, Trinidad and Tobago experienced 160 firearm mu rders in 2004, 450 firearm woundings and 1500 non-injury firearm incidents. A major fact or contributing to the surge of guns-rel ated criminality in the region is the trafficking of narcotics which has facilitated the availability of firearms. The firearms required for protection of the contraband during transportation are smuggled in along with the dr ugs. Within these en vironments which promote the demand for weapons, reducing gun owners hip is a difficult undertaki ng. Better gun registries, marking and tracking can help, as can improved gun interdic tion in ports. In the long term progress will hinge on changes in the drug trade, changes in the gun culture, and progress in the implementation of interna tional treaties and agreem ents on Small Arms and Light Weapons. 9.1. As violence has increased in the Caribbe an, so too has the use of firearms. Increasingly, more powerful w eapons are being used, resulti ng in higher mortality levels. The Caribbean has a long history of smuggling, a nd, as in the past, firearms are used in the transportation of illegal goods. \"Guns and the illegal trade in drugs have formed a symbiotic relationship which has seen the emergence of increasing violence throughout the communities regionally\" (WINAD, 2006). This chapter describes th e situation in the Caribbean with respect to guns, crime, and violence. Trinidad and Tobago was selected as a case study, as it has seen a particular sh arp rise in firearm-re lated violence over the last few years. 9.2. The CARICOM Regional Task Force on Crime and Security recently commissioned a report on the proliferation of small arms and light weapons (SALW) in the Caribbean (CARICOM, 2002). The resulting report identified three levels of SALW proliferation in the region: countries with established high levels and patterns of armed crime (Jamaica); countries with emerging high levels of armed a nd organized criminality (Guyana, Trinidad and Toba go); and countries with indications of increased use and availability of small arms (A ntigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines). 9.3. At that time, it was determined that, among CARICOM countries, only Jamaica fell in the first category, with indications th at military-type weapons were available and that paramilitary units were operating (Bu rrows and Matthias, 2003). If such an evaluation were done today, Trinidad and Tobago might also be included in this tier, as the murder rate has doubled since 2002. W ith 160 firearm murders in 2004, these were just the tip of the iceberg with above 450 firearm woundings and 1,500 non-injury firearm incidents. 172 171 This chapter is based on a background paper prepared by Yvette Holder, consultant. 172 Crime Reports from the Trinid ad and Tobago Police Service. 129Figure 9.1: Distribution of In jury Deaths by Type of Injury: Trinidad and Tobago, 1999-2003 050100150200250300 19992000200120022003 YearInjury deaths Firearm Injuries Sharp Injuries Blunt Injuries Source: Central Statistical Office, Trinidad and Tobago. 9.4. For many countries of the English-speaki ng Caribbean, the majority of assaults and homicides were committed in past year s with blunt or sharp weapons. The trend toward increased use of firearms in the commission of crime began in the 1970s in Jamaica, so that a court was established in 1974 solely dedicated to gun-related matters. In Trinidad and Tobago this change began in 2000. Before 2000, firearms were responsible for less than one-t hird of all homicides. By May 2006, this percentage had risen to 74 percent (see Figure 9.1 and Table 9.1) . The percentage of homicides attributed to firearms in Trinidad and Tobago lies well wi thin the range of rates of 60 percent to 93 percent seen in Latin Am erica (Guerrero, 1998). 9.5. The share of woundings committed with a firearm has actually decreased as the number of murders with firearms has incr eased. This is likely a reflection of the increasing lethality of w eapons used (see Table 9.2 ).

SOURCES 9.6. There are several sources for these firear ms. They may be diverted from legal owners in the country, or they may be pu rchased overseas (legally or illegally) and smuggled into the country. Diverted weapons come from both private owners and the protective services. In Trinid ad and Tobago, authorized user s of legal arms are robbed and sometimes killed for their weapons. Army and police guns go missing at intervals, and weapons that are stored at police statio ns for safe-keeping, especially those whose owners may be deceased, are also targets for di version to criminal use. It is believed, however, that diverted firearms are not the main source of weapons involved in crime. That role is filled by weapons smuggled into the country (Holder, 2006). 9.7. Smuggled firearms are sourced from Sout h and Central American manufacturers of light arms, among others. Suppliers are from Brazil (which is licensed to manufacture Beretta, Colt, and Taurus makes); Venezuela (Smith & Wesson); Mexico; and the Dominican Republic (Klare and Anderson, 1996) . These countries all make firearms for domestic sale and for export, ostensibly to governments and licensed private owners. 9.8. Weapons manufactured or otherwise avai lable in South America are smuggled through Venezuela, Suriname a nd Guyana to Trinidad and Tobago via fishing vessels and private pleasure boats. Some proceed to the United States and Europe, all part of the northward shipping of contraband. Weapons from the United States and Canada are transported southward in the shipping of th e proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs. 173 9.9. Guns and other weapons are also availa ble from disbanded guerrilla troops in post-conflict situations. Some of these are weapons that were supplied covertly two decades ago by the Cold War powers to friendly insurgents in the region. Within the Caribbean region, there is a st ock of weapons surplus from previous armed conflict such as the Grenada intervention. Other countries with armed instability such as Haiti, 173 Certain established routes have been defined (Burrows and Matthias, 2003). These are: Jamaica southwards through the Caribbean island chain; Guyana/Trinidad and Tobago northward through the same chain; St. Lucia - St. Vincent and the Grenadines - Martinique triangle, and; St. Maarten - Antigua - St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 131Nicaragua and Guatemala can also be source and destination countries for the supply of illegal arms. 9.10. Another major source of firearms is th e United States, the world's leading manufacturers of arms. Producti on, sale and exports of all ar ms from the United States are subject to a variety of laws and regul ations which govern the conditions under which the sales may occur and stipulate the use to which firearms may be put, even when transferred to a third party. These laws and regulations pose few or no obstacles to those wanting to buy a handgun, and unevenly enforced export regulations have made the U.S. a major supplier of illicit arms to Latin America and the Caribbean. Latin American governments report that more than half of all unlawfully acquired firearms were of U.S. origin (Klare and Anderson, 1996). 9.11. One of the main strategies employed by ar ms traffickers to procure guns is the use of \"straw purchasers.\" These are acquaintan ces, relatives or persons hired to purchase guns in the United States from gun dealers, at gun shows or directly from manufacturers. 174 Larger orders are sometimes proc ured through use of counterfeit importation certificates, with the involvement of gullible or corrupt local government officials of the transit country. Trading on th e knowledge that end- use checking is sloppy, these shipments are procured for an apparently legitimate use and then forwarded to a third country. Guns thus obtained become part of the stockpile of weapons available on the black market. 9.12. Finally, there are also cases of persons purchasing firearms at a gun shop in a foreign country and bringing them into th e country undetected among luggage. Guns so purchased may or may not be licensed and regi stered for use in the destination country. 9.13. All of these guns, procured from th e above-mentioned sources and by the various mechanisms, contribute to the stockpile of circulati ng illicit firearms. However, due to poor forensic investigation of firearm -related crimes and non-existent tracking of firearms, it is not possible to know what cont ribution each of these sources makes to the problem of guns and criminality in Trinidad and Tobago. R EGISTRATION OF FIREARMS AND SEIZURES OF ILLEGAL WEAPONS 9.14. In Trinidad and Tobago, the Organized Crime, Narcotics and Firearm Bureau (OCNFB) was established in 2004. Under the Firearms Act, the Commissioner of Police is empowered to keep a national Firearms Regi ster, although the actual existence of this database is unclear. 174 Attention has focused on a group of Californian handgun manufacturers\u2014including Jennings, Bryco and Lorcin\u2014whose weapons have been implicated in many violent crimes in the U.S. and whose security arrangements are said to have been questionable. The weapons, mainly 9 mm and more recently .38 pistols are available, affordable (approximately US$ 50), small enough to be easily concealed but lethal. Wintemute, G. \"Ring of Fire: The Handgun Makers of Southern California.\" Davis, California. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontlin e/shows/guns/ring/companies.html 1329.15. Seizures of firearms by the police a nd, more recently, the Organized Crime, Narcotics and Firearm Bureau have risen fr om 132 in 2000 to 199 in 2005 (Table 9.3). It is not clear whether this increase is due to increased enforcement efforts or to a greater supply of illegal weapons. 9.16. The vast majority of the weapons sei zed are the 9 mm pist ols and .38 revolvers commonly used by criminal groups everywhere . Military weapons are rare. The seized weapons are disposed of according to the dire ction of the Magistrate presiding over the case. They may be returned to circulation e ither as additions to the Police armory or auctioned. This adds to the fluidity of the le gal status of weapons and makes the need for identification and tracking even more critical.

DEMAND 9.17. Understanding the epidemiology of guns a nd criminality, is clearly useful in design interventions and monitoring thei r effectiveness. One way to do this systematically and thoroughly is through the use of a tool used in determining risk of injury: Haddon's matrix (Haddon, 1972). The ma trix examines the characteristics of persons involved in gun- related crime, the instruments or vectors/agents, and the physical circumstances and socio-economic factors that contribute. The analysis is conducted along a temporal axis for each component, looki ng at the factors that pre-dispose, those that facilitate during the ev ent, and those that hinder recovery after the event. 9.18. The application of the matrix to gun-relat ed crime and the issues that may affect it are illustrated in Table 9.4. The discussion below will focus on some of the principal risk factors for hosts (young men of low socio- economic status); the physical and social environment (ghettos, garrison communities and gun culture); and agent/vector (drug trafficking and gun-related criminality). VICTIMS , PERPETRATORS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT 9.19. Across the region, certain characteristics are common to both perpetrators and victims in gun violence. Res earch conducted in Latin Amer ica and the Caribbean shows 133that the majority of victims and perpetra tors of violence are young men of low socio- economic status, with a low level of educat ion and poor prospects for income generation, who have witnessed violence at close range . These findings are consistent with those from a study that showed the effects of soci o-economic status, educat ional levels, family functioning and exposure to violence on le vels of aggression and delinquency in Jamaican children (Samms-Vaughan, 2000) . In Trinidad and Tobago, more than half (59 percent) of the victims of fatal fir earm assaults were males aged 15\u201434 years. 9.20. Across the hemisphere, the communities from which at-risk persons originate and in which the acts of gun-related criminal ity tend to be concentrated bear many similarities. Called \"ghettos\" in North (depending on the country) and \"garrison communities\" in the Caribbean, they tend to be urban, densely populated and underserved, with lo wer than national levels of most social indicators and standards of living. The term \"garrison community\", orig inally described the urban enclaves of violence such as Trench Town in Jamaica, which supported the competing political parties in the 1960s and 1970s. No w it refers to those communities where poverty and violence combine to produce a space of high levels of personal insecurity for community residents (WINAD, 2006) . Not only in Jamaica, but also in Guyana (Buxton) and Haiti (Cite Soleil) as well as in Trinid ad and Tobago (Laventille), these communities are the foci of crime and violence.

DRUG-TRAFFICKING AND GUN -RELATED CRIMINALITY 9.21. A major factor contributing to the surge of guns-related crimin ality in the region is the trafficking of narcotics, which has f acilitated the availability of firearms. More specifically, the firearms required for protec tion of the contraband during transportation are smuggled along with the drugs. The illegal dr ugs are also traded for foreign exchange 134and for illegal firearms from the U.S. Thes e weapons are used fo r protecting turf, for intimidating customers and competitors, for empowering recruits into the distribution networks (or gangs), for maintaining disciplin e within them and for executing informers. In fact, drug trafficking has sp awned a vibrant industry, namely, guns for hire (see Box 9.2)\u2014a service particularly usef ul to addicts who need to commit crimes to support their habit and hence perpetrate more violent crimes. From this has spun off another criminal industry, contract murders (Holder, Y. 2006) . Figure 9.2 shows how na rcotics, firearms and related crimes have seen a similar upward trend in recent years. 135Table 9.4: Modified Haddon Matrix Applied to th e Analysis of Gun-Rela ted Criminality (GRC) Host (victim, perpetrator) Agent/vector (firearm and bullets) Physical environment (location) Social environment (societal) Pre-event (before gun-related criminal act) Factors predisposing to involvement in GRC - male youth, low SES, aggressive, poor education, under- employed Factors predisposing involvement of guns viz. availability of and access to guns - drug-trafficking, inability to trace guns and identify and destroy supply routes, lax control of gun import/exports Physical environments pre- disposed to GRC - certain locations, times etc. Factors in the socio-economic environment that pre-dispose for GRC-GRC as an acceptable form of social behavior or employment; corruption; narco-trafficking Event (when gun is taken out and fired) Personal factors protecting or exposing persons involved in GRC Factors affecting ability to inflict injury - lethality of guns and ease of use Factors of the physical environment that facilitate GRC-exposure of victims or protection of perpetrators Factors of the socio-economic environment that facilitate GRC e.g. protection of perpetrators including non-involvement Post-event (after victim is shot)) Factors that lessen the effects of the event on persons involved in GRC e.g. emergency treatment, rehabilitation of victim; apprehension, detention and rehabilitation of perpetrator Factors influencing ability of gun to inflict injury after the event e.g. availability of gun for re-use in another crime Factors that influence the effects of GRC e.g. escape routes for perpetrators; emergency routes for victims; rapid response to events culminating in swift justice Factors that affect the results of GRC e.g. emotional and financial support to families (of both victim and perpetrator); risk of reprisals expeditious and just resolution of cases - ineffective policing, outdated and irrelevant legislation, weak judiciary Notes: GRC = Gun-related crime; SES = Socio-economic status 136Box 9.1: Young Men, Drugs, and Guns POLICY IMPLICATIONS 9.22. Consideration of the issues described in Haddon's matrix should guide the formulation of interventions. If acts of gun-re lated violence are considered as an event in a spectrum of actions that begins with those f actors that operate during the pre-event phase of the matrix, then decision makers are presented with a host of opportunities to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of gun-related criminal acts. Those inte rventions that act upon factors that predispose involvement in gun-related crime and the envir onment are discussed in more detail in the chapters on youth violence, drugs, criminal jus tice reform, and the policy chapter. Here, the discussion is limited to those inte rventions that are sp ecific to guns and cr iminality. Table 9.5 lists the various possible interventions that are specific to guns and ranks them according to their potential impact as well as priority and difficult y. Few of these interventions have been subjected to rigorous evaluation, particular ly in the Caribbean context. However, some have shown enough promise that they are worth trying and are discussed below. 9.23. Gun Control: Since there is no domestic manufact uring of firearms in the English- speaking Caribbean, one obvious option would be to ban guns altogether. Effectiveness of such a measure is highly debatable, how ever, as shown by the experiences in other countries. In fact, opponents of gun control laws po int out that Jama ica, despite banning guns, has had an increasing gun homicide rate, as did the Unite d Kingdom and some states in Australia. In Trinidad and Tobago, young men, especially those just out of prison and those with little prospect of employment, are targeted by drug suppliers who control the communities, empowered by the illegal guns that they possess and the prof its of their illicit trade (WINAD, 2006). These recruits are approached with a quota of cocaine and the necessary weapons to protect their turf. Refusing the offer will mean contin ued hardship and deprivation, or even death. The situation is further exacerbated by political patronage, wher eby these communities are the beneficiaries of poverty alleviation projects which are often controlled by the community drug supplier. Despite the great risk of death or injury and the les ser risk of detection, the sale and distribution of narcotics within the territory have proven lucrative for those persons engaged in the trafficking. Established in structured networks with suppliers, distributors, couriers, retailers, and enforcers, there are 66 known gangs with more than 500 members, according to the Ministry of National Security in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Some of these gangs now engage in kidnapping, with ransom demands that include heroin and cocaine. In addition to these economic fact ors, sociological factors also pl ay a role in the fascination of male youth with guns. Disadvantaged, disenfranchised, dispossessed, influenced by a constructed stereotype of masculinity which embraces violen ce, and threatened by surrounding social and economic forces, young males feel empowered by th e possession of a gun. With a gun, they can instill fear, settle disputes to their satisfacti on, command respect and demand sexual favors. Indeed, for the first ten months of 2005 in Jamaica, 16 percent of rapes were at gunpoint (Amnesty International, 2002) . For $TT 100, the price of a gun and ammunition, a young man with nothing apparently going for him, can purchase some self-esteem for one hour. With a gun and in a group of others who share the same nega tive feelings, a \"posse\", he is protected, he belongs and he has worth. Forces such as these drive the demand for firearms. Source: Holder, 2006 137Supporting this view is the fact that in variou s countries of the region, a \"gun-for-rent\" market has emerged, effectively sidestepping potential supply reductions. Howeve r, various measures can be put in place that can ma ke gun control more effective. 9.24. Most gun control legislation in the Caribbean is aimed principally at legally acquired firearms, is poorly enforced, and has little imp act on illicit guns. A systematic strategy that is more likely to be effective is one that first addresses the acquisition of illegal firearms, as it is believed that only a minority of re gistered arms are used to co mmit crimes. The first step in blocking the illicit trafficking of light arms woul d involve tight controls of vendor and purchaser, with strictly enforced regulations governing: Local sales with thorough background checks, cl ose scrutiny of purchasers to deter the use of \"straw purchasers\" and an index of suspic ious persons who purchase more than one gun in a stipulated time period. Annual inspection and licensing of firearms with follow-up may also serve as a deterrent. Exportation of firearms with documented appr oval after thorough checks by the supplying or manufacturing state on the bona fides of the purchasers, the use to which the firearms would be put and verification of their final destination. These checks should involve the authorities of the receiving state incl uding the issuance of an import license. Importation of firearms with the issuance of an import license by the authorities of the purchaser's state. Transfer of firearms as per exportation and importation with notification of the supplier state. Preventing the illicit trafficking in light arms is a responsibility to be shared among the producing, selling, and destination states, whethe r intermediary or end-users, with open and transparent communication among all. A good place to start is with th e signing, ratification, and enforcement of international treaties an d conventions such as the United Nations Protocol on the Illicit Traffi cking in Firearms and the Organization of American States' Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Traf ficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and other Related Mate rials. Many states in the region have not signed, much less ratified, thes e international agreements (see Box 9.2 on the UN resolution and Plan of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons.) 175 175 Arms control was also an important issue at the 2004 Hemispheric meeting of the Ministers of Security in Quito. LAC countries called on all gun manufacturing countries\u2014and on the USA in particular\u2014to tighten up their gun manufacturing and export measures to reduce the diffusion of guns in the region. 138Table 9.5.

Improved interdiction of illegal guns. Until cessation of the black market trade in light firearms becomes a reality, a \"stop-gap\" measure is to thwart as effectively as possible all efforts to land illegal guns. For the island countries of th e Caribbean, this requires intensive surveillance of the coastline by naval police equipped with suitable watercra ft. This is an expensive but necessary undertaking, especially for small isla nd countries, as improved marine surveillance serves several purposes. Not only does it deter arms trafficking but also dr ug trafficking, piracy and trafficking in people. 9.26. The second means of illegal entry of firearms is their carriage through an official port of entry (air or sea) without detection. Legally en tering yachtsmen or airline passengers, and their possessions, are subject to search by customs of ficers who are trained to seek dutiable goods and drugs, not firearms. To stem this, it is imperative that customs officers be trained to search for guns, to be able to recognize their component parts and to be aware of the methods of concealment of firearms and ammunition. 9.27. Marking, Registration and Licensing: The final source of firearms for use in criminal activity is the in-country diversi on of legally acquired firearms a nd ammunition to illegal use. To prevent the re-use of weapons in gun-related crim es, it is critical that guns should be traceable and that weapons seized should be securely stored and properl y disposed of. This requires effective procedures for acquisition, marking, licensing, registration, operation and storage. The impact of gun violence has not gone unnoticed by the international community, albeit quite late. Since 2001, at several international fora, many un der the aegis of the United Nations, world leaders expressed grave concern at the negative effects on development, peace, security and human rights posed by the illicit trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons. The United Nations General Assembly endorsed a resolution addressing the negative hu manitarian and developm ent impact of illicit or excessive Small Arms and Light Weapons and propos ed a Program of Action that calls on States to take steps to curtail the illicit tra ffic of Small Arms and Light Weapons. The Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects defines measures that governments of member states should take to control the black market trade in arms. It not only makes recommendations on the control of imports, exports and transfers to prevent diversion to illicit use, but also requires member states to \u0083 Make illicit gun production/possession a criminal offense \u0083 Establish a national coordination agency on small arms \u0083 Identify and destroy stocks of surplus weapons \u0083 Keep track of officially-held guns \u0083 Disarmament, Demobilizations & Re-integra tion (DDR) of ex-combatants, including collection and destruction of their weapons \u0083 Support regional agreements and encourage moratoria \u0083 Mark guns at point of manufacture for identification and tracing \u0083 Maintain records of gun manufacture \u0083 Engage in more info rmation exchange \u0083 Ensure better enforcement of arms embargoes \u0083 Include civil society organizations in efforts to prevent small arms proliferation Sources: WHO, 2001; UN, 2001. 140National gun registries are rare in the Caribbe an. Licensing and use of firearms should also include an emphasis on the control of and account ability for ammunition, and not just for the firearm. Careful oversight needs to be given to the secure storage of firearms (both private and public storage), with clear guidelines on storag e requirements, strict control with rigorous inspection procedures including a checklist, reporting format, pe riodicity, audits of ammunition and general accountability. These protocols need to apply to civilian user s, rifle clubs, private security firms, Police Services, and the Defense Force. 9.28. Criminal Justice System: Firearms enforcement requires police officers with the necessary forensic technology a nd knowledge to effectively ga ther, preserve and present evidence. This technology should include a forensic facility that especially provides for firearm forensics and ballistic examinations required fo r solving gun-related crimes. For every state to possess this facility may be burdensome and expe nsive. But it should certainly be possible to have it available in the largest Caribbean states or, at the very least, as a shared regional resource. The establishment of a \"Gun Court\", such as th e one Jamaica has had since 1974, would expedite the processing of firearms cases. 9.29. Data: Analysis of the situation with respect to gun-related criminality, the investigation and solving of cases, the monitoring of interven tions, all require data\u2014which does not currently exist in an easily accessible or useable form. Fu rthermore, with respect to guns and criminality, given the linkages with other c ountries within the Caribbean region and on the American and European continents, these data need to be comp atible and comparable so that it may be shared among all stakeholders. Registri es with information on purchaser s, gun markings and tracings, databases on ballistics, on gun transfers and movement s are but a few of the useful data tools in the fight against guns and crime. Mechanisms need to be instituted for the sharing of information within countries across agencies and sectors and across countries to facilitate the tracking of firearms used in the commission of crimes a nd the identification of persons engaged in the smuggling of firearms. Box 9.3: Gun Buybacks One well-known intervention that has been used to withdraw illegal guns from circulation has been that of gun buybacks. Attempted in several countr ies in Latin America and the Caribbean, buybacks have met with variable success. The exercise in Saint Lucia, where $EC 2,500 (about US$1,000) was offered for each illega l working gun tendered, was hailed a su ccess for recovering 150 guns in the course of ten months. Yet the Trinidad offer of $T T10,000 (about US$1,600) per firearm attracted few takers (Holder, Y. 2006). Proponents of gun buybacks maintain that every gun turned in is one less available for perpetrating crime, while opponents argue that the guns turned in are not the ones used in crime. The international literature on the effectiv eness of gun buybacks is rather pessimistic about their effectiveness (U.S. Surgeon General, 1999; Cook et al., 2001; Kennedy et al., 1996; Sherman, 2001; Retuer and Mouzos, 2003). 14110. PUBLIC POLICY OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION: REGIONAL AND NATIONAL APPROACHES Policy makers have several complementary approaches at their disposal with which to address crime and violence. Sector-specific approaches\u2014suc h as criminal justice, public health, and conflict transformation/human rights\u2014have a role to play, as do cross-sectoral approaches, such as crime prevention through environmental de sign and citizen security. The criminal justice approach is the most widely known and used, but it does have limitations and should not be the sole approach employed. Public health approach es are appropriate for addressing youth and gender-based violence, and crime prevention th rough environmental design has the potential to rapidly lower crime in specific locations. In terms of policy making at the regional level, CARICOM has taken several important steps to deal with crime and violence, focusing on thos e issues which transcend national boundaries; perhaps the most important has been the creation of the Regional Task Force on Crime and Violence. At the national level, the formulation of national plans to addres s crime and violence is crucial, since these plans allow for cross-sect oral collaboration and promote serious discussions on priorities in resource allocati on. There are multiple entry points for public policy to reduce crime and violence. The key is to select policies and interventions that have a proven track record of success or that are extremely promis ing. A mix of highly cost effective long-run approaches (including investment in prevention programs with young children and families) can be combined with other interventions (such as situational crime prevention) that can provide quick impacts on crime. 10.1 This chapter provides an overview of sector and cross-sectoral approaches to crime and violence prevention in the Caribbean. It then makes the case that crime and violence are an issue of economic development for the region and th at an integrated, multi-sectoral response (encompassing more than the criminal justice system) is needed. Finally, the chapter offers some preliminary recommendations at th e national and regional levels. SECTORAL AND CROSS -SECTORAL APPROACHES 10.2 In the Caribbean and most other regions, e fforts to prevent violence have focused on urban violence (except in post-conflict situ ations). Table 10.1 summarizes these efforts, distinguishing between sector-speci fic approaches (such as criminal justice, public health, and conflict transformation and human rights) a nd cross-sectoral approaches (such as crime prevention through environmental design, community -driven development and citizen security), and identifying the goals, types of violence addressed and typical interventions for each (Monseret al., 2005). Sector-specific approaches 10.3 Among sector-specific approaches, the criminal justice approach is perhaps the best- known; it tries to reduce crime and violence thr ough higher arrest rates, higher conviction rates, and longer sentences. Cr iminologists often disti nguish between deterrence effects (dissuading 142potential criminals from committing crimes) and incapacitation effects (preventing criminals from committing crimes because they are imprisoned). The criminal justice approach aims to reduce crime through both deterrenc e and incapacitation effects. 10.4 The criminal justice appro ach\u2014which involves work with police, prosecutors, the judiciary, and prisons\u2014is favored by politicians who want to generate rapid decreases in crime and violence. Police and judicial reform is urgent both to reduce impunity and address deeper issues involving justice, corrupt ion, and human rights abuses; impunity plays a large role in promoting economically-motivated crime in the Caribbean and elsewhere. In the corrections area, serious reforms and additional investment are needed if prisons are to have any prospect of rehabilitating inmates, instead of just preventing them from committing crimes during their stays in prison. 10.5 At the same time, the criminal justice approach has serious limitations: To the extent that police and judicial instituti ons are inefficient and in need of reform, the injection of additional resources without re form may not produce the desired results. In the case of police, there is some evidence from the United States that simply putting more uniformed officers on the street does not reduce crime. Such officers must be in the right place and at the right time, which requi res some sophistication in detecting crime patterns and allocating polic e resources (Felson 1994). There is a risk in pursuing a piecemeal appr oach where individual institutions (police, judiciary, prosecutors, prisons) are reformed one at a time. As Chapter 8 makes clear, the various institutions in the criminal justice sy stem must be aligned with one another. Thus, systemic reform is generally more desirable than piecemeal reform. Other types of invest ment\u2014focused on prevention rather than control\u2014are generally more cost-effective in reducing crime than investments focusing on crime control (Greenwood, 1998; USDOJ, 2004; Sansfa\u00e7 on et al, 1999; World Bank, 2006b). 10.6 The public health approach is another sector-specific approach . Often called the epidemiological approach, it involves four step s: defining the problem and collecting reliable data, identifying causes and risk factors for violent behavior, developing and implementing interventions, and analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of violence prevention interventions (Mercy et al., 1993; WHO, 2004). In the Caribbean, the public health approach has been used with an emphasis on youth violence as well as injury prevention. One example of this approach is the Injury Surveillance System that was created by the Ministry of Health in Jamaica. 10.7 The public health approach has the grea t advantage of being evidence-based. Interventions are tailored to address risk factors that are most important in a given locale, and there is significant emphasis on evaluating the impacts of the interventions. The one disadvantage of this approach is that many of its most important interventions\u2014such as programs to reduce unintended pregnancies an d to promote early childhood development and parental training\u2014may have payoffs in terms of reduced violence only after some time has passed. But not all public health-inspired in terventions have delaye d effects: limiting the 143availability of alcohol and provi ding recreational and mentoring programs to remain in school, for example, may all produ ce relatively quick impacts.176 10.8 The conflict transformation and human rights approach promotes nonviolent conflict resolution through mediation, negotiation, and en forcement of human rights. Often used in post- conflict settings, it has also been employed by NGOs working to promote enfranchisement of marginal communities and their citizens. A nother innovative option is community peace- building efforts which directly involve ci tizens; according to Harriott (2004), popular involvement at the community level can strength en the moral authority of the state's control institutions, as well as improve th eir effectiveness. This approach also focuses on the state's role in ensuring citizens' rights to be free from victimization and the th reat of violence (Moser et al., 2005). This approach is employed by the Dis pute Resolution Foundation in Jamaica, which works with warring factions in communities to mediate, establish ceasefires and community codes of conduct, and teach conflict resolution skills. Cross-sectoral approaches 10.9 The crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) and the urban renewal approach are based on the premise that characteristic s of the physical envi ronment influence the amount of crime that occurs\u2014and thus, that crime can be reduced by modifying the physical environment to make it more difficult and risky (and less rewarding) for potential criminals to commit crime. This approach involves interven tions in the planning, design, and management phases of urban development proj ects (Moser et al., 2005). Importantly, this approach can address not only objectiv e levels of crime, but also residents' fear of crime. It is usually used in the context of community-based, multi-sector \"urban renewal\" programs that attempt to address the causes of crime through targeted social, economi c, and situational crime prevention measures in specific \"hot spot\" neighborhoods. See Box 10.1 for an example of this approach in Jamaica. 10.10 Citizen security initiatives (also known as \"public safety \"), as developed by several countries in the Caribbean and Latin America\u2014often with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank\u2014are eminently cross-sectoral in nature. They typically involve violence prevention using the public health approach, combin ed with investments in criminal justice and, more recently, crime prevention through envi ronmental design. The best-known of these initiatives has been in Bogota, where homicides rates were reduced by more than half between 1994 and 2000 (Mockus, 2001). The IDB-financed Jama ica Citizen Security and Justice Project is a regional example of this approach. In addi tion, Guyana has just received approval of two IDB loans for a Citizen Security project (that w ill include police modernization and institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Home Affa irs, Crime and Violence Observatory, and community interventions) and a Justice Sector Reform project which will include interventions in the prison system. 176 For a complete list of potential interventions targeting youth violence, classified by developmental stage of youth, level of the ecological model (individual, relationship, community or society), and probable effectiveness, see Chapter 5. 144Table 10.1.

(2005) and Moser and Winton (2002 ). 14510.11 The Community-Driven Social Development approach focuses on rebuilding social cohesion in informal and formal institutions using small, participatory and demand-driven projects that aim to create trust by building on the strengths and assets of poor communities affected by violence. Th is approach has been particularly used to fight gang violence and domestic violence. In the Caribbean, this appr oach has often been adopted by NGOs (see Box 10.2 for a description of such a program in Tr inidad and Tobago), although successful projects increasingly are adopted and scaled-up by gove rnment programs such as the DFID-supported Citizen Security Initiative in Jamaica. REGIONAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS CRIME AND VIOLENCE 10.12 The preceding chapters have made clear that many of the factors contributing to crime and violence in the Caribbean\u2014drug and we apons trafficking, money laundering, and deportees\u2014transcend national bounda ries. As such, they call for regional or international approaches and interventions that go beyond the lo cal- or national-level responses described in the previous section. 10.13 Regional cooperation in combating transnatio nal organized crime and drug trafficking requires a standardized legal regime. The internat ionally accepted vehicle fo r this standardization is the United Nations system of drugs and crim e conventions, namely the three drug conventions (the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the 1971 Co nvention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention against th e Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) the Conve ntion against Transnational Organized Crime (including the protocols on Trafficking in Persons, Smuggling of Migrants, and Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms) and the Convention agai nst Corruption. While nearly every country in this region has ratified the drug conventions, complia nce is much less in the case of the crime conventions, particularly the firearms protocol and the Convention against Corruption. 10.14 Some of the Caribbean's regional security institutions were de signed to deal with earlier, more traditional threats to national security. The Regional Security System (RSS), for example, was created in 1982 by the Eastern Caribbe an States (and Barbados) in response to the threat perceived from the Marxist government of Grenada.177 Its Memorandum of Understanding stipulates that if a member state's security was threatened, it has the right to request assistance from other members of the RSS. Initially, the RSS was conceived as a mutual defense treaty against external aggression or internal coup attempts. 10.15 Much later, in 1996, the memorandum of understanding was upgraded into a treaty. This greatly expanded the scope of issues that the RSS would tackle. Article 4 of the treaty describes the purpose of the RSS to be the promoti on of cooperation in: i) interdiction of traffic in illegal drugs; ii) na tional emergencies; iii) search and rescue; iv) immigration control; v) fisheries protection; vi) customs and excise contro l; vi) maritime policing; vii) natural and other disasters; pollution control; ix) combati ng threats to national security; x) prevention of smuggling; and xi) the protection of offshore inst allations and exclusive economic zones (Dillon, 2004). While the RSS's remit has expanded dramati cally, its capabilities have not. Consequently, its ability to deal with issues such as drug and arms trafficking is limited. Important limitations 177 Grenada, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis--did not initially sign the RSS MOU. 146include the obvious fact that it s operations are not Caribbean-w ide and that there is limited coordination between the RSS a nd the national police forces of the OECS countries (Dillon, 2004). Box 10.1. Crime and Violence Prevention Comp onents in Bank-Financed Integrated Slum Upgrading Operations - Jamaica Inner Citi es Basic Services for the Poor Project The World Bank is supporting the operationalization of local crime and violence prevention in Jamaica through the development of a specific project component in the Inner Cities Basic services for the Poor Project. The component seeks to take advantage of th e infrastructure and social investments taking place and mainstream prevention at the local level into the overall project. In terms of the approaches described above, the component adopts an urban renewal appro ach complemented with a ci tizen security focus at the local level. The component focuses specifically on the reduction of the very high levels of homicide, youth violence, and associated risk factors in the participating in ner cities. Particularly important are the synergies between infrastructure provision, upgrading, and situational prevention on the one hand, and community-based \"social prevention\" activities on the other. Th e overall objective is a comprehensive intervention at the neighborhood level that is closely coordinate d with other relevant donor, government, and non- governmental programs addressing crime and violen ce and their associated risk factors in these neighborhoods. The component has five subcomponents: Diagnostics : Crime and violence mapping of the micro areas using police statistics and where possible using Geographical Information Systems (GIS); the victimization section in the baseline surveys; and, community-based and situational diagnostics. Situational prevention : measures that reduce opportunities for particular crime and violence problems through spatial interventions such as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) methodology and urban renewal. This me thod is mainstreamed in the infrastructure works of the projects through the training of the architects, engineers and other technical staff. It includes the planning and installation of social in frastructure such as community centers, playing fields, public lighting, and zinc fence remova l and installation of safe alternatives. This methodology is quite new in the LAC region but has been successfully piloted in countries such as Chile, Brazil, and Colombia. Social Prevention : support of both immediate mitigation and conflict resolution activities in addition to other preventive and capacity enhancement interventions that will have a medium- and long-term impact on levels of public safety. In particular, the component finances a menu of initiatives in five broad categories to be tailored to the individual needs of each community: (1) mediation and conflict resolution; (2) alternative livelihoods and skills development; (3) family support services, (4) youth education and recreation; and (5) CBO capacity-building. Community Liaison Officers: The role of these technical expe rts in community organization and crime and violence prevention at the neighbor hood level is to: carry out community-based diagnostics; formulate participatory community safety plans and strategies; liaise and coordinate with other relevant agencies and associations, in particular with Community Safety Councils and the Police; coordinate closely with those desi gning infrastructure to ensure integration of CPTED principles; identify an d work with at-risk youth in the community; organize and mobilize the community around the concept of safety though commun ity campaigns (e.g. community clean-up/painting days, community safety festival, etc.); initiate additional projects such as summer camp for at-risk youth. Monitoring and Evaluation component: Evaluations of the components have been designed and will be carried out. While evaluation data fro m these Bank-financed projects are not yet available, similar community-based integrated in terventions have yielded dramatic results. 147Box 10.2. The Pride in Gonzal es Initiative, Port of Spai n, Trinidad and Tobago: A Community-Driven Social Development Approach 10.16 CARICOM has undertaken several important steps to deal with emerging regional security issues. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) was created in 1992 by a ministerial meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, to a ddress the issue of money laundering. The CFATF Secretariat monitors members' implementation of the Kingston Ministeria l Declaration through the following activities: Self-assessment of the implemen tation of the recommendations An ongoing program of mutual evaluation of members Co-ordination of, and participation in, tr aining and technical assistance programs Biannual plenary meetings fo r technical representatives Annual ministerial meetings 10.17 In the area of drug trafficking, CARICOM established the Secretariat Regional Coordinating Mechanism for Drug Control in 1997. CARICOM members have signed several international conventions and multilateral plans of action. Member states are signatories to the Barbados Plan of Action of May 1996; the Ac tion Plan of October 1996 for the implementation of the Anti-drug Strategy in the Hemisphere; th e Bridgetown Plan of Action emanating from the May 1997 Caribbean/U.S. Summit; and the European Union/Latin Americ a/Caribbean Action Plan following the first EU/LA/Caribbean Summit in June 1999 (CARICOM, 2000). While Caribbean countries have signed many multilateral agreements, most activities to combat drug The Pride of Gonzales initiative was begun in 2003 in a violence-ravaged, Port of Spain suburban community of approximately 1,000 households. It was the brainchild of the community's parish priest after there had been six murders in a five-week period. The initiative is a collaboration of CITY, the Minist ry of National Security, the City of Port of Spain, the Canadian Institute of Planners, the Univ ersity of the West Indies and the community of Gonzales. Some of the successful partnerships include: a partnership with the Ministry of Public Utilities to improve the piped water supply and st reet lighting; a partnership with the Water & Sewerage Authority to upgrade water delivery to the area; and partnership with the Ministry of National Security to provide a different kind of policing. There has been an upsurge in social activities in the community such as football co mpetitions, an Easter extravaganza, Christmas events for children, and an annual children's camp. Other activities include an adolescent/human fo rmation program, remedial education programs, programs in arts (dance, photography, video, and music) and sports. There have been clean-up activities and community notice boards have been set up. An Internet caf\u00e9, three homework clinics, gang intervention activitie s, capacity building for communit y leaders as well as counseling and crisis intervention strategies are all part of the ongoing initiative. The initiative has transformed the community into a model one. Unfortunately, the period of peace was broken in August 2006 by two murders executed in one week. The challenge will be in seeing how the community will respond to this new threat of violence. Sources: Catholic News, July 23, 2006; Sunday Newsday, July 23, 2006. 148trafficking are in the context of bilateral arrangements (mostly with the U.S.) rather than as part of regional initiatives (Dillon, 2004). As a result, most of the focus is on interdiction and supply reduction. 10.18 Perhaps the most important regional initia tive in the area of crime and violence reduction was the Regional Task Force on Crime and Security (RTFCS). The Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM, meeting in Nassau in July 2001, charged the RTFCS to identify the major causes of crime in the regi on and to recommend appr oaches to deal with related problems such as drugs and weapons trafficking. The RTFCS was composed of representatives of each member state, a represen tative of the RSS and of the Association of Caribbean Commissioners of Police. Two of the region's most respected criminologists, Anthony Harriott (UWI, Mona Campus) and Ra mesh Deosaran (UWI, St. Augustine) also participated in the Task Force. 10.19 The Task Force identified the following principal security threats to the region: illegal drugs, illegal firearms, corruption, rising crime ag ainst persons and property, criminal deportees, growing lawlessness, poverty and inequity, and te rrorism; for the areas of illegal drugs, illegal firearms, terrorism and deportees, the report includ ed a short discussion of key issues, challenges and a rather long list of detailed recomm endations at both national and regional levels (CARICOM, 2002).178 The Task Force presented its report to a meeting of heads of government in July 2002; the recommendations of the Ta sk Force were endorsed by this meeting. 10.20 A second important regional study on crime in the Caribbean was produced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2004. Authored by Anthony Harriott, the report offered a series of polic y recommendations focusing on the need to develop national capacity to prepare crime control plans and modernizing of cr iminal justice systems, including the police and correctional services.179 Importantly, this report also called for research to evaluate existing interventions and identify good practice approaches. 10.21 Caribbean Heads of Government endorsed a new Management Framework for Crime and Security in July 2005; this framework esta blishes a Council of Mi nisters responsible for security and law enforcement, a Policy Adviso ry Committee, and an Implementation Agency to implement CARICOM policy initiatives in this area. Steps were also taken to created mechanisms for regional coordination and coopera tion in regional intelligence sharing (RIC, immigration, narco-trafficking, customs) and the accompanying CARICOM Treaty on Mutual Cooperation on Fighting Crime is being passed in to domestic law in various countries (e.g. Guyana's parliament passed this into law in May 2006). 10.22 Thus, there have been serious efforts at the regional level to understand the factors driving crime and violence in the Caribbean and to begin to formulate a re gional policy response. These responses, however, are still in their infancy. For example, small-scale drug interdiction 178 The key findings from these sections have been incorporated into the relevant sections of this report. 179 Specific recommendations for modernizing the police included increasing the use of technology, improving training, applying effective management tools and strengthening accountability, and improving police-citizen relations. The only specific recommendation for reform of correctional systems was to examine alternatives to imprisonment and to reduce recidivism, although no detail was provided on how to achieve this reduced recidivism. 149campaigns have been carried out in coordinated fashion by the region's police forces (under the aegis of the Association of Cari bbean Commissioners of Police) over brief periods of time, but there is limited ongoing international cooperation. In the area of weapons control, the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean has carried out a number of trainings for law enforcement officials on the commercial trade and trafficking in firearms, using a \"t rain the trainers\" methodology. Beyond capacity building, however, regional collaboration in co mbating weapons trafficking has been limited. 10.23 It is important to note that many of the is sues facing the Caribbean transcend regional boundaries. Demand for drugs emanates from Europe and the United States; deportees are sent back to the region from the United States, th e United Kingdom and Canada; many weapons that are trafficked are sourced from the United States. 10.24 No regional strategy in these areas can hope to succeed wi thout significant support from these OECD countries. This support has frequently been lacking, especial ly for weapons control and deportees. As Peter Phillips, the Jamaican Mi nister of National Security commented in the area of weapons control, \"Strategies to interdict the flow of drugs from south to north must be supported by greater efforts to restrict th e flow of guns in the reverse direction.\"180 In the area of deportees, this report identified important interv entions that could be undertaken by deporting countries in order to minimize th e negative impact of deportees on crime in the Caribbean; these interventions have the potential not only to reduce crime in the Caribbean, but also to put a dent in international cr ime syndicates that conduct business in the United States and elsewhere. Similarly, and as pointed out in the case study on drug interdiction in the Netherlands Antilles, Caribbean countries will requir e support from OECD countries to finance some of the more costly elements of interdiction strate gies (naval patrols, radar, etc.). PRIORITY STEPS TO ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS IN CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN THE CARIBBEAN 10.25 Caribbean governments have come to reco gnize that crime and violence are an important development issue. This is buttressed by the evidence in Chapter 4 which documents that crime and violence exact a serious toll on growth in Caribbean countries; conversely, reducing crime and violence will generate growth and reduce povert y. The implication is clear: violence and crime reduction should be consid ered an important element of development policy making \u2014at the national, regional, and international levels. It therefore also means that crime and violence is a key issue for the traditio nal development partners of these countries. To date, support in this area by the donor community has been somewhat piecemeal. Donors need to work closely with their Caribbean partners to coordinate action and assistance across a range of interventions. 10.26 In general, there has been an over-reliance on the criminal justice approach to crime reduction in the region, to the detriment of other complementary approaches which can be effective in reducing certain t ypes of crime and violence. Over the last few years, however, several countries such as Jamaica and the Do minican Republic are incr easingly investing in different approaches. At the same time, it is also crucial to note that certain types of crime and 180 \"The battle for security\", remarks by Peter Phillips (Jamaican Minister of National Security) at the annual Wilton Park Conference (London, September 2005). 150violence\u2014in particular , organized crime and drug trafficking\u2014are largely impervious to prevention approaches; a criminal justice-focused approach is essential in dealing with them. 10.27 The important role that preventive appr oaches can play is now beginning to be recognized: Crime prevention through environmental desi gn (CPTED) has significant potential to generate rapid decreases in property crime and some forms of inter-personal violence. The region is just beginning to explore this kind of situational crime prevention (see Box 10.1). Integrated citizen security approaches have seen initial success in Capotillo in the Dominican Republic (see Box 8.1 for more deta il on the Capotillo experience) and should be explored elsewhere. These programs, by combining modern methods of policing with prevention interventions undertaken by both government and non-governmental organizations, are extremely promising. The public health approach, which focuses on modifying risk factors for violent conduct, is especially promising fo r addressing violence against women and youth violence. A good example of a program targeting risk fact ors for violent behavior are the Centros Educativos de Fe y Alegr\u00eda (Educational Centers of Fa ith and Happiness) in the Dominican Republic, which integrate services for poor and excluded communities, including formal educ ation (pre-K through 12th grades, under agreement with the Ministry), religious education, nutrition and health services, life skills training, vocational training, parenting training, and community mobilization . The conflict transformation/human rights approa ch has not been used in a significant way in the Caribbean. To the extent that violence and crime are \"not simply a matter of ordinary criminality but rather the outcome of a profoundly political power dynamic... [one can] make the case for a more unconventio nal short-term response to this violence\" (Harriott, 2004b). Such innovative options might include community peace-building efforts. Harriott goes on to make the case that direct involvement of citizens and communities \"tends to strengthen the moral au thority of the state's control institutions and improves their effectiveness.\" Recommendations at the national level 10.28 The report of the Regional Task Force on Cr ime and Security shied away from making detailed recommendations at the national level: \"The differences in the nature of the crime problem across the region make it difficult, indeed imprudent, to try to elaborate recommendations that are applicable at the national levels\" (CARICOM, 2002). 10.29 This is an accurate assessment. The region is far too heterogeneous for one-size-fits-all recommendations for interventions at the national level. The chapters in this study, however, do provide sufficient evidence to make a few ke y recommendations that can guide policy making. 1. This report has culled many different source s of data to present as comprehensive a picture as possible of crime and violence in the Caribbean. Yet it is clear that there are major data gaps that hinder policy making at both national and regional levels (see Box 10.3). Chief among them are information systems that allow policy makers (and citizens) to track 151crime trends and gauge the impact of interventions. Also important are victimization surveys , undertaken at regular intervals, which pe rmit comparison of crime levels both over time and across countries. Victimization data is e ssential, both to design interventions and to hold policy makers accountable fo r the results of their stra tegies to reduce crime and violence. Violence against women has become mo re visible in many regions of the world due to the collection of data from internationally validated, specialized victimization surveys. The Caribbean, however, is a notable exception: there is little in the way of serious data collection on violence against women, and none of the data are comparable across countries. Box 10.3. The need for better data on crime The measurement of crime is a complex exercise, considerably complicated by the lack of internationally comparable data. The best data on crime come from standardized victim surveys, such as those conducted under the International Victims of Crime Surveys (ICVS) program. Unfortunately, only one Caribbean country\u2014Barbados\u2014has conducted such a survey. Other victim surveys are helpful, but suffer from a lack of international comparability, du e to differences in methodology. Even standardized victim surveys suffer from several weaknesses. They can be expensive, particularly if the desired sample is large. Large samples are necessary to ascertain variations in crime victimization by geographic region or population group, or to learn more about the nature of par ticular crimes, especially low-incidence crimes such as murder. This informa tion is very useful in designing crime prevention interventions and is not available from any other so urce. General victim surveys also fail to produce reliable data on certain sensitive topics, such as se xual offenses and domestic violence, for which specialized surveys are required. Household surveys fail to capture the impact of crimes on businesses which again requires specialized su rveys. But despite these limitations, ICVS surveys remain the best source of standardized crime information, their grea test limitation being the lack of funding for their widespread and recurrent administration. Data produced by the police on the crimes reported to them is the most commonly used form of crime data because it is readily availabl e, but it suffers from both under-r eporting and lack of international comparability, due to differences in crime definitio ns and administrative recording procedures. The United Nations biennial Survey of Crime Trends a nd Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (CTS) attempts to overcome some of the comparability issues by asking member states to re-categorize crime incidents according to standardized de finitions. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, in the Caribbean only Bermuda and Suriname have replied to the Ninth Survey, which covers the period 2003-2004. Crime is a politically sensitive issue and it is understandable that some governments may be loathe to expose themselves to international comparison. But comparisons are inevitably made on the basis of the raw police figures, and these comparisons are often unfair. Furthermore, crime is increasingly a trans- national issue, and good crime data is essential in the quest for collective solutions. For these reasons, countries that are serious about tackling crime shoul d participate in both the ICVS and CTS programs. Regional organizations concerned with crime issu es, such as CARICOM, can help coordinate participation of members in these data collection programs. 2. Good policy making to reduce crime and vi olence does not happen by accident. The Regional Task Force on Crime and Security (CARICOM, 2002) called for the development of national crime control master plans and the establishment of national crime commissions to ensure multi-sectoral collaboration. National plans allow for cross-sectoral collaboration and serious discussions about the priorities in resource allocation; equally importantly, they offer a vehicle for the involv ement of civil society organizations, where 152much of the expertise in violence prevention resides. While the Task Force recommendations have been heeded in some countries, in some they have not. Preparation of a national plan should be a priority in these countries. 3. National crime control master plans should recognize the complementarity of violence/crime prevention and control. The issue is not of prevention versus control, but rather the appropriate mix for local conditions. It is important to recognize that not all prevention interventions have long gestation periods and not all control interventions will have immediate impacts. 4. The reform of under-performing criminal justice systems should be a priority . Reform initiatives will have a gr eater probability of success if information systems and associated performance measurement indicators are used to chart progress in improving efficiency and quality of services and if attentio n is paid to ensuring that individual agencies in the criminal justice system are in alignment with one another and not working at cross- purposes. Modernization of policing through the use of information systems and problem- oriented policing is a key element of criminal justice sector reform. 5. Youth violence is a particularly important issue in many countries. While there are a multitude of programs in the region to address youth violence, few if any have been subject to rigorous impact evaluation. At the same time , there is a wealth of information about what works in youth prevention in the U.S. and a fe w other developed countries. In the short run, regional policy makers could borrow from this toolkit of proven programs such as early childhood development and mentoring programs, in terventions to increase retention of high- risk youth in secondary schools, and opening schools on after-hours and on weekends to offer youth attractive activities to occupy their free time. In the medium and long run, impact evaluations should systematically document what works in youth violence prevention in the Caribbean. Recommendations at the regional level 10.30 Good policy making at the national level is important but not enough. Many of the issues facing the Caribbean transc end national boundaries and require a coordinated regional response . Important first steps have been taken with the creation of the Regional Task Force on Crime and Security, its 2002 report, and the new Management Framework for Crime and Security, created in 2005. While the creation of the Management Framework is an important step, much remains to be done in terms of fundi ng these new institutions and ensuring that they have adequate staffing and effectively in fluence policy making at the national level. 10.31 Specific recommendations at the regional level include: 1. In the area of deportees , CARICOM has an important role to play in negotiating with developed nations for more support for the rein tegration of deportees. At a minimum, this support can take the form of improved c oordination and information flows between deporting agencies and Caribbean governme nts. More ambitiously, CARICOM could explore options for deporting nations to f und deportee reintegration programs. With or without international financing, more services should be offered to reintegrate deportees, along the lines of those provided by the Office for the Resettlement of Deportees in St. Kitts and Nevis. Serious studies on the issu e of deportees are needed\u2014both to quantify 153the impact of deportees on national crime rate s, and to measure the cost-effectiveness of deportee reintegration programs.181 2. The chapter on drug trafficking provides a successful case of interdiction of cocaine in the Netherlands Antilles. Give n that Caribbean countries are transit and not producer countries for cocaine, interdiction needs to be complemented by other strategies outside of the region (principally demand reduction in consumer countries and eradication and/or alternative development in producer countries). Within the region, policies focusing on mitigating the damage from drug s should focus on limiting the availability of firearms and on providin g meaningful alternatives to youth . 3. Gun ownership is an outgrowth of the drug trade and, in some countries, a legacy of party politics and associated garrison commu nities. Within these environments which promote the demand for weapons, reducing gun ownership is a difficult undertaking. At the regional level, coordination between law enfor cement agencies on intelligence and interdiction are important. At the national le vel or sub-regional level, better gun registries, marking and tracking can help, as can improved gun interdiction in ports . Long run and sustained reduction in the demand for guns, however, will hinge on progress in combating drugs and on changi ng the cultural factors which increase the demand of young men for weapons. 4. In general, regional coordina tion will be essential to minimize displa cement effects . Particularly in the area of drug trafficking, successful national efforts may lead to criminal activities being displaced to other count ries in the region. If displacement is to be avoided, it is essential that information be shared and that policies and interventions be coordinated . Final considerations 10.32 The different approaches to crime and violen ce prevention outlined in the first section of this chapter mean that there are multiple possible entry points to reduce crime and violence. In one instance, the most promising appr oach may be in the context of a slum- upgrading project; in another, in th e context of a reform of the health service; in a third, in the context of a reform of the criminal justice system. There is no one \"ideal\" approach. The common denominator is that su ccessful interventions are evidence-based , starting with a clear diagnostic about types of violence and risk factors, and endi ng with a careful evaluation of the intervention's impact which will inform future actions. 10.33 In general, a successful approach at that national level will involve multiple interventions. Evidence from developed countries sugges ts that some of the most cost-effective prevention interventions focus on children and fa milies. Since some of these may pay dividends only in the medium- to long-run, they must be co mplemented by interventi ons that can generate significant short-run redu ctions in crime and violence. Candid ates in this latter group include integrated citizen security approaches (which , as seen above, combine modern methods of policing with prevention interventions undert aken by both government and non-governmental 181 At the time of the writing of this report, a CARICOM survey on deportees was forthcoming.

Zohoori, N. et al. 2002 in juries in Kingston, Jamaica: a Preventable Drain on Resources. \" Injury Control and Safety Promotion 9(4):255-262. 175 ANNEXES Annex 1.1. Caribbean Leaders on Crime In his 2006 New Year's address, former Ja maican Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said, \"Without a doubt, the high level of violent cr ime remains our most troubling and pressing problem.\" He was not alone among Caribbean le aders emphasizing the issue at that time: crime also featured prominently in the New Year's addresses of Prime Minister Patrick Manning of Trinidad and Tobago, President Bharrat Jagdeo of Guya na, and St. Lucia's Prime Minister Kenny Anthony. Prime Minister Anthony stated that reducing crime will be his government's number-one priority in 2006, displacing unem ployment. In opening the Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago in September 2005, President George Maxwell Richards said the country was in crisis due to the escalating crime ra te in that country, and acknowledged that more than 100,000 people had signed a petition demanding government action on crime. Annex 1.2. Tourism and the Caribbean Economy In 2004, the broader tourism economy was esti mated to be responsible for some 15% of the region's GDP and over 15% of total empl oyment. Recent data suggests that it is growing in significance relative to other sect ors. Some countries - including Antigua and Barbuda and the British Virgin Islands - owe over 75% of their economies to travel and tourism. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, \"C rime, harassment and other forms of anti-social behavior ... are some of the major threats to the development of the [Caribbean tourism] industry. Such proble ms frustrate national and regional efforts to maintain the region's image as a safe, clean and hospitable destination. Whether or not such concerns are supported by data, it is the perception that matters most to the uninformed traveler, including potential trav elers to the Caribbean. (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2004). For example, tourism is by far the largest fore ign-exchange-generating sector in Jamaica, with its gross foreign exch ange receipts almost equa ling the earnings from all merchandise exports. According to one re view of Jamaica's economy, \"...although the number of tourists affected by crime is low (in Jamaica, as elsewhere, the least privileged bear the heaviest burden from crime), fear of crime undoubtedly affects the Jamaican tourism industry. According to one recent su rvey, nearly 70 per cent of hotel owners sampled mentioned crime as an important pr oblem for their business (Bloom et al., 2001).\" Similarly, the government of Guya na, in its 2004 progress report on it Poverty Reduction Strategy, argues, \"The violent crime wave over the last two years had deeply reduced the number of tourists vi siting Guyana (World Bank, 2004b).\" Annex 1.3. Emigration and Crime The seven countries with the highest skilled highest emigration rates in the world are all in the Caribbean (Docquier and Marfouk, 2006 ). Guyana has the world's worst skilled 176 emigration rate (89%), and, according to the 2005 Progress Report on Guyana's Poverty Reduction Strategy , crime and violence are driving human capital overseas: \"In spite of some improvement in the crime and security situation, Guyana continues to lose its critical entrepreneurial and professional skills to migrat ion...the crime and security situation will have to be tackled and dealt with definitively if Guyana is to minimize the migration of its highly trained professionals and entrepreneurs whose skills and resources are needed to propel growth.\" The United Nations Common Country Assessment of Guyana quotes a 2003 survey canvassing 1757 secondary school students in which 47% responded that they would leave Guyana perman ently soon or within five years. Crime, violence and racism were cited overwhelming ly the most prominent negative factors motivating this intended migration (United Nations Country Team, 2005). Annex 1.4. Caribbean Police Fo rces and Prison Populations The number of police per capita in the Ca ribbean is generally high by international standards (with the except ion of countries like Haiti, whic h has one of the lowest rates of coverage in the world). But this figure can be deceptive, as during high season, tourist inflows can swell the population. For exampl e, the Bahamas, with a resident population of about 321,000, received nearly 1.5 million stay-over tourist arrivals in 2003. Further, high police to public ratios in low populatio n countries do not mean the same thing as they do in high population countries. A large sh are of total coverage may be required to cover basic logistic and supe rvisory functions, leaving a pr oportionately smaller share for field duties. In addition, high ratios may co nceal low real numbers, and these personnel may be responsible for large land and sea areas. In a global ranking of 211 countries from the hi ghest prison to public ratios to the lowest, Bermuda ranks second, US Virgin Islands th ird, Cuba fourth, Suriname fifth, Cayman Islands sixth, Belize seventh, St Kitt s and Nevis ninth, and the Bahamas 11 th (Walmsley, 2005). In many countries in the region, the pr ison populations are growing at a rapid rate. The prison population increase in the Dominican Republic (38% over 3.5 years) is particularly notable (Walmsley, 2003). 177 Annex 2.1. The Jamaica Cannabis Trade Jamaica was said to have been the source of one third of herbal cannabis consumed in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s, but it appears to comprise less than 7% of the market today (UNODC, 2004). Jamaica provi ded 14% of the United States market share in 1984, but today this figure is likely much less (President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986). In Canada, cannabis of Jamaican origin incr eased its share in the illicit market from 10% in 1983 to 20% in 1984 (Stamler et al., 1985). Today, it has been largely displaced by high potency local production, and constitutes an estimated 5% of the herbal supply and 10% of the hashish supply, according to the UNODC Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ) 2004. France rece ntly reported that it received 9% of its cannabis from \"the Caribbean\" in the ARQ. Annex 2.2. Patterns of Drug Transshi pment by Organized Criminal Groups The Colombian Cali and Medellin cartels preferred and used the Caribbean corridor starting in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, most of the cocaine enteri ng the United States came through the Caribbean into South Florid a. But interdiction successes caused the traffickers to reassess their routes. By 1998, about 59% of the cocaine went via Central America/Mexico, 30% via the Caribbean, and 11% via direct commercial sea freight or air flights. In 1999, the flows across the Mexican border dropped to about 54%, flows via the Caribbean increased to 43%, and only 3% arrived directly from South America. By 2000, the ratios shifted to 66 percent Central America/ Mexico and 33 percent Caribbean, with a decrease in the use of Haiti and Puerto Rico and an increase in the use of Jamaica. By 2003, the ratio was 77 percent through Central America/Mexico and 22 percent via the Caribbe an. Today, it is estimated that only 10 percent of U.S. cocaine transits the Caribbean . (For details, see the various editions of the National Drug Threat Assessment, pr oduced by the National Drug Intelligence Center of the United States Department of Justice.) With regard to the role of enforcement, The resident's 2005 National Drug Control Strategy says, \"For years, about one-third of the cocaine heading towa rd the United States was moved through the Greater Antilles toward Florida. Approximately 10 perc ent of the total U.S. supply was handled by two organizations, one run by Colombian ... Elias Cobos-Mu\u00f1oz and the second headed by Melvin Maycock and Pedro Smith. A 29-month DEA-led investigation led to the arrest of all three ... as well as more than 50 of their colleagues in Colombia, Panama, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the United States, and Canada. More important, it disrupted organi zations supplying an estimated 10 percent of the cocaine imported into the United States\u2014roughly 30 metric tons per year. In seeming confirmation of this disruption, which was amplified by the deployment of international forces following the ouster of President Jean Bertrand Aristide in Haiti, intelligence estimates assess that there ha s been a significant reduction in the amount of cocaine flowing through the central and eastern Caribbean to the United States\u2014 from roughly one-third of total flow to perhaps 10 percent.\" 178 Annex 2.3. Dates of Large Seizures of Co caine Entering Canada from Caribbean Countries in 2004 The following information comes from the UNODC's Major Seizure Database, as reported by the Canadian government. Jamaica: 3 January, 7 Janua ry, 28 January, 2 Februar y, 14 February (twice), 3 March, 9 March, 13 March (twice), 15 March, 16 March, 24 March, 4 April, 23 May, 8 June (twice), 9 June, 14 June, 18 June, 27 July, 1 August, 7 August, 19 August, 30 August, 4 September, 6 September, 26 Se ptember, 8 October, 28 October, 11 December, and 19 December. Trinidad and Tobago: 5 May, 10 May, 27 May, 19 February, 4 August, 9 December, and two on 13 December. Netherlands Antilles: 7 February (twice), 15 February, 10 March, 21 March, 13 June (twice), and 24 October. Guyana: 12 July, 2 September, 10 September, 14 December, as well as almost 400 ecstasy tablets on 2 September. St. Vincent and the Grenadines: 2 Feb and 27 Feb. Haiti: 20 January, 21 January, and 25 August. St. Lucia: at Toronto, 4 kg on 8 March, 17 kg on 22 Augus t, as well as 1 kg on 3 September. Grenada: at Toronto, less than 1 kg on 9 February. Barbados: at Toronto, 7 kg on 25 February. Suriname: at Calgary, less than 1 kg on 30 March. Dominica: at Trudeau, 7 kg seized on 31 December. Most cocaine entering Europe is transshipped in large container ships destined for Spain or Portugal, but a substantial amount also en ters through commercial air flights to Spain and the Netherlands. It is estimated by Europol that up to 250 tons enters the EU each year by sea, and that many European-based groups source th eir cocaine directly from Central America and the Caribbe an (Europol, 2004). According to local law enforcement, in parts of the Eastern Caribbean the majority of cocaine transiting th e country is destined for Europe, including Antigua and Bar buda (60 percent to the United Kingdom), Barbados (59 percent to the United Kingdom) , Grenada (70 percent to Europe) and St. Lucia (60 percent). Annex 2.4. Organized Crime in Jama ica and the Dominican Republic Jamaican \"posses\" (in the Eastern United St ates) and \"yardies\" (in the United Kingdom) pioneered the crack cocaine markets in thes e countries, as well as being an important source of cannabis. Today, their dominan ce has been reduced. Today in New York, Jamaican criminal groups are the most prominent cannabis distributors overall, 179 particularly for wholesale and midlevel quantit ies. They are also ac tive in other parts of the Northeast, including Philadelphia, Bost on, and Washington, D.C., as well as in the West, including Los Angeles and Phoenix/ Tucson (National Drug Intelligence Center, 2005). According to National Criminal Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, \"Hitherto, criminal groups of West Indian origin, mostly Jamaican, were seen to be most prominent in distributing crack cocaine within the U.K. ... However, as [cocaine use] has grown, there have been opportunities for others to become involved... [Today] most of the detected movements of cocaine trafficked fr om the Caribbean to the U.K. are smuggled by couriers, many under the control of Ja maican and Trinidadian groups (National Criminal Intelligence Service, 2005).\" Dominican groups started out stre et distribution of cocaine in the United States, primarily in the urban areas of the Northeast, though th eir connections with Colombian traffickers. Today, they dominate cocaine w holesaling in the Northeast, particularly in cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, working closely with Colombian suppliers. They are said to supply local gangs such as the Cr ips in the Northeast a nd the Latin Kings in Chicago. Throughout the United St ates, of the 26 pe rcent of law enforcement agencies polled who said there was an association betw een the gangs in their area and organized crime, 13 percent mentioned Dominican drug organizations (National Alliance of Gangs Investigators Associations, 2005). According to the response of the U.S. authorities to the UNODC Annual Reports Questionnaire, Domi nicans were far and away the foreign group most arrested for cocaine and heroin trafficking in 2004. Dominican groups also play a role in the drug trade in other parts of the Caribbean , notably, in Puerto Rico, and are frequently seen as crew members on go-fa st boats. They are also increasingly visible in European cocaine trafficking. Annex 2.5. Jamaat-al-Muslimeen in Trinidad and Tobago In 1990, Trinidad and Tobago was the subject of an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by a radical Islamic group called Jamaat-al-Muslimeen, allege d to have links with Libya and Sudan. The police headquarters was bombed, a governme nt building and the national television station were taken, and the Prime Minister a nd other parliamentarians were taken hostage for five days. During this time, looting and rio ting were widespread in the capitol, Port of Spain, and 31 people were killed. The group surrendered after an amnesty was negotiated, and is presently active as a politi cal party with parliamentary representation. Members of the group have subsequently been prosecuted for serious violent crimes such as murder and kidnapping, including the group 's leader, Imam Yasin Abu Bakr. In 2005, there were five minor bomb attacks in Trinidad in the course of f our months. The fourth of these, on 14 October, resulted in five arrests: Imam Yasin Abu Bakr and four teenagers. All were later released. 180 Annex 3.1. Caribbean Homicide Data Sources Data for the cross-country econometric analysis is taken from the database collected by the United Nations Office of Drugs via its Su rvey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems. The dataset for the econometric analysis was limited to countries for which there were observations in at least three consecutive five-year periods. This limited dataset included three Ca ribbean countries: Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. For the purposes of the scatter plot s shown in Figure 3.2, UNODC data was supplemented by homicide data from a vari ety of sources to expand the number of Caribbean countries in the sample. Sources in clude national statisti cal publications, data gathered from national police forces by De Albuquerque and McElroy (1999b), and in the case of Haiti, a national household survey. In cases where the original data was in terms of numbers of homicides (rather than ra tes), rates per 100,000 population were calculated using population figures taken from the Wo rld Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Due to variations in repor ting rates and defin itions, data from non- UNODC sources is not strictly comparable to UNODC data. Table A3.1 Caribbean Crime Data Sources for Cross-Country Graphical Comparisons Population (2004) % Population (of Caribbean countries with homicide data) Homicide Rate per 100000 Source Antigua & Barbuda 80085 0.4% 6.8 1.2% (2005) Grenada 105747 De 750232 3.3% 16.1 average 1999-2004, govt. e 1998-2000 on \"violent deaths\" reported in ECVH survey St. Kitts & Nevis 46985 0.2% 10.2 average 1990-95, De Albuquerque & McElroy & Tobago 1301307 5.8% 7.4 average 1998-99, govt. report, Central Statistical Office (2006) Note that there is tremendous uncertainty in the figure for Haiti. The 95 percent confidence interval on the 2001 estimate ranges from 8 to 60 per 100,000. The point 181 estimate, 33.9 per 100,000, is derived from a survey-based estimate of 2734 homicides nationally. Using their own survey in Port -au-Prince, Kolbe and Hutson (2006) estimate that there were 8000 homicides in Port-au- Prince during the 22 months following Jean- Bertrand Aristide's overthrow in February, 2004. (This is equivalent to 4364 homicides per year.) In contrast, Art hur (2006) draws from reports of several non-governmental organizations that track homicides in Haiti and estimates that the total for 2005 was far lower: approximately 900 in Port-au-Prince and 50 in the rest of the country.
