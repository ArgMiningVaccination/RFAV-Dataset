In both practices of Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) seasonal cleansing, purification, and a renewal process are recommended to eliminate accumulated physical and emotional toxicities, allowing our mind-body connection to return to a natural state of balance and health. Seasonal cleanses are innate during the equinoxes. The principles of TCM embrace spring and fall cleanses which provide the best opportunities for deeply detoxifying and cleansing the body. Spring, in particular, is a time of regrowth and renewal, and after a dormant season like winter, harmful impurities collected in our organs and tissues need to be flushed. Tips to Support Your Cleansing Organs There are several actions that you can take every day to support your liver, kidneys, lungs, skin and colon. Liver The liver far the top highlighted cleansing organ. The liver is responsible for over 500 functions, including the ability to regenerate itself. You can think of your liver as your filter, it recognizes toxic substances and converts them into materials that can be safely excreted. Although it has many other roles such as secreting bile to support fat digestion and absorption, converting nutrients from foods into substances that the body can use, managing blood sugar levels and breaking down hormones. Your liver is also responsible for regulating blood supply and detoxifying water, drugs, alcohol, caffeine and environmental toxins. Foods for Liver Health: Bitter greens like dandelion, kale, arugula, artichoke, chard, spinach and mustard greens. These stimulate enzyme production and promote healthy bile flow. Some other liver-loving foods are turmeric, garlic, lemons and cabbage - which contain high amounts of antioxidants, and minerals which have both alkalizing and anti-inflammatory effects Supplement for Liver Health: [Black Seed Oil](/pages/black-seed-oil-retailer) can help improve liver function and reduce the effects of liver toxins. Due to its flavour and use for blood sugar irregularities, the plant has been used for centuries as a hepatoprotective agent in traditional medicine. In addition, it has been shown to have potent other anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce the effects of liver toxins by reducing inflammation in the body. Emotions and Liver Health: Emotions do play a role in your health, and negative emotions such as anger, frustration, jealousy, irritability, and resentment may affect or be related to liver health Kidneys Kidneys are essential for keeping our body in a state of balance. They regulate fluid levels and blood pressure, activate vitamin D and keep our blood stable. Each kidney is made up of about a million little filtering cells called nephrons, which filter toxic waste out by excretion through the urinary system. Foods for Kidney Health: Kidneys love watermelon, celery, cucumber, dandelion, parsley, apple cider vinegar, tart cherry and cranberry Supplement for Kidney Health: Supporting the kidneys through urinary tract health is one of many functions of [UTI X](/pages/uti-x). While promoted for UTI prevention, this formula of whole cranberry, hibiscus flower, probiotics, selenium and zinc delivers therapeutic potency of nutrients to support kidney and urinary health Emotions and Kidney Health: The emotion of fear is related to the kidneys, this increases the need for urination and prolonged periods of anxiety and stress may also weaken the kidneys Colon A healthy colon eliminates toxins from the body 1-3 times daily, whereas an unhealthy colon produces toxins and adds a hardness and fullness to our lower abdomen. We need adequate fibre, sufficient water intake, [healthy gut flora](/pages/pro-biotika-nag), and demulcent herbs and foods to support healthy bowel movements and an overall happy colon. Demulcent means these herbs or foods produce a natural gooey substance that coats, soothes and protects the lining of the GI tract, also known as mucilaginous foods or herbs. These can be particularly helpful for calming inflammation and soothing digestive discomforts. Demulcent herbs such as licorice, slippery elm, comfrey, aloe vera, marshmallow root and couchgrass can be taken in a powder, tea or capsule form. Foods for Colon Health: Foods high in mucilage that you can add to your diet include: flax seeds, chia seeds, cassava, plantain, and okra Supplement for Colon Health: Improve intestinal integrity with targeted probiotic strains and N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG). [Enerex Pro Biotika+NAG](/pages/pro-biotika-nag) is designed specifically for cases of inflammatory bowel disease and compromised GI tracts.

Skin The skin is our largest detoxification organ, with so much surface area to function as a detoxification pathway. We can tell a lot about what is happening inside our body by the appearance of our skin. Blemishes are typically a signal of rooted toxins trying to escape. In Chinese medicine, skin mapping is practised, where you can relate certain breakout areas to [what is happening inside of your body](http://www.byrdie.com/face-mapping). Inflammatory oils such as vegetable oils, soybean oil, corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, sunflower oil and safflower oil can negatively affect your skin, along with refined sugars and other processed foods. Since we heal from the inside-out, a clean diet is the optimal approach for supporting this detoxification organ, also try and cease the use of chemical-laden skin care products. Foods for Skin Health: Your skin loves healthy fats and antioxidant-rich foods such as avocado, coconut oil, hemp, green tea and berries Supplement for Skin Health: Nourish your skin from the inside out with impressive botanical seed oils that can be taken internally and applied topically to the skin. Enerex Radiance is crafted from the top 3 impressive botanical seed oils: Organic Sea Buckthorn, Cranberry, and Black Seed Oils. Emotions and Skin Health: The skin and nervous system share a common embryonic origin, meaning the same cells form both the brain and the skin. The skin is very sensitive to stress, anxiety and depression Lungs The lungs oxygenate the blood when we breathe in and release carbon dioxide when we breathe out. Many of us, by habit, take short shallow breaths due to anxiety and stress in our lives and this relates to our overall inability to relax. This is not optimal for this important detoxification pathway. Focus on making your breaths deep and calm. Our lungs need a feeling of space, and when we are without \"breathing room\" the lungs feel constricted, overwhelmed and smothered. Foods for Lung Health: Your lungs love antioxidant-rich foods such as green tea, ginger, turmeric, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, apples and pomegranates. Supplement for Lung Health: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant and precursor to glutathione. Known to support detoxification and help eliminate toxins. NAC is naturally sulphur-containing which helps protect the body from toxic insults and oxidative stress. [Enerex NAC 1000](/pages/nac-1000) provides the highest potency available of pharmaceutical-grade N-acetylcysteine for powerful antioxidant support and glutathione production.
