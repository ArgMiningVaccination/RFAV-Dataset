The Project will include upgrades of the entire street light ne twork within the District that currently consists of approximately 75,000 primarily street a nd alley lights, as well as (i) select overhead guide signs, (ii) internal and external li ghting for approximately 30 \"Welcome to Washington, D.C.\" signs located throughout the Dist rict, and (iii) navigation, underpass, bike trail, and tunnel lights (for a limited number of tunnels). The Project will require lights of different color temperatures appropriate to thei r setting, as further detailed in the Technical Provisions. The District seeks a private partner to: (a) convert existing non-LED and LED District-owned lig hts to LED technology; (b) design and install systems providing for the remote monitoring and control of the street light network that: (i) are fully scalable, reliable, and fast; (ii) use open standards; (iii) and feature dynamic or environment ally responsive dimming capability; (c) upgrade poles and associated infrastructure (includ ing underground infrastructure), where appropriate or required base d on DDOT's condition assessment and a pre-determined process and criteri a for establishing when such infrastructure must be replaced; (d) deliver long-term asset management of the street li ght system pursuant to the terms, conditions, and requirements of the Project Agreement; (e) install smart city technology ( \"SCT\" ), including wireless access points, to leverage the street light system and the District's signific ant fiber optic network (known as Draft for Public Review and Comment 2 \"DC-Net \") for ancillary uses and to deliver broadband Wi-F i coverage that advances the District's goal of city-wide broadband access; and (f) finance the improvements to the District's existing street light network and installation of the SCT. 1.1.3 Project Goals The District has identified seven key goals for the Project. These goals have been developed jointly by DDOT, OP3, and OCTO. (a) Public and Traffic Safety : Reduce traffic-related accidents and injuries in keeping with the District's Vision Zero goals and enhance c rime prevention and detection by providing more uniform and reliable lighting thr oughout all of the District's Wards through the use of LED street lights. (b) Design and Historic Preservation : Design and implement a modernized street light system, including dimming, shielding and other adju stments to minimize impacts on wildlife and eliminate light pollution. Having g iven due consideration to the nature of historic districts, protected landmarks, and the District's status as the nation's capital, there should be no change to the structure of the street light system or style following the conversion to LED fix tures. (c) Smart City Technology : Introduce functionality for the street light syst em to serve as a platform for ancillary uses, including Wi-Fi t echnology, that will help close the digital divide, increase effectiveness and efficien cy of government services, and promote economic development. (d) Energy Efficiency and Performance-Based Delivery : Reduce energy consumption by as much as 50% to 60% per year (an annual saving s of approximately $3 million), resulting in a reduction of approximately 38,000 tons of greenhouse gases annually throughout the District, by installi ng energy efficient LED luminaires that have a useful life that is three to four times longer than the technology currently in use, and implement an impro ved pay-for-performance mechanism that maintains the street lighting system at a higher state of repair. (e) Risk Transfer : Transfer project integration and other commercial risks to a private entity across the appropriate aspects of the Projec t beyond those currently transferred through traditional performance-based c ontracting mechanisms. (f) Stakeholder Engagement : Foster stakeholder understanding and support throughout Project development and implementation. 1.2 Procuring Office; Certain Background Information OP3 will be the procuring office for the Project, w orking closely with DDOT and OCTO. Draft for Public Review and Comment 3 DC-Net provides managed voice, data, and video wire -based and wireless services to all government constituents city-wide over a secure, hi ghly redundant, and high capacity fiber optic telecommunications platform. This stand ards-based platform lays the foundation for all next-generation government and p ublic safety communications throughout the District. DC-Net is a program manage d by OCTO. OCTO owns and manages an extensive subterranean fiber optic network that will serve as the backbone for the SCT solutions desired by the District as a part of the Project. The street lights are powered by electricity suppli ed via a contract currently with Washington Gas and Electric ( \"WGES\" ) and distributed via Pepco's network through a mix of overhead (50%) and underground (50%) power lines . Pepco and Verizon both own a portion of the street light poles in the District (37% and 9%, respectively), while the District owns the rema inder. DDOT owns the arms and fixtures on all of the poles contemplated as part o f the Project. 1.3 Request for Proposals 1.3.1 Introduction By the RFP, the District is seeking from all teams of firms who were shortlisted (\"Proposers\" ) in accordance with the Request for Qualifications for the Project issued on June 21, 2017, as revised on July 21, 2017 (the \"RFQ\" ), Proposals to undertake the design, construction, financing, and asset management of th e Project.

Such separate One-on-One Meetings, if any, will be conducted prior to the District's submission of the proposed Final RFP to Council for approval. 3.4.2 No Objection to ATC Process Each Proposer, by submitting its Proposal, acknowle dges that the opportunity to submit ATCs was offered to all Proposers, and waives any r ight to object to the ATC process, as well as to the District's determinations regarding acceptability of ATCs. 3.4.3 No Liability for Disclosure Under no circumstances will the District be respons ible or liable to a Proposer or any other party as a result of disclosing any of such Propose r's ATC materials, whether the disclosure is deemed required by law, by an order of court, or occurs through inadvertence, mistake or negligence on the part of the District or its re spective officers, employees, contractors or consultants. 3.4.4 No Extension The District's rejection of an ATC will not entitle the Proposer to an extension of the Technical Proposal Due Date, or of the deadlines to submit Summary ATCs or Detailed ATCs, set forth in Appendix B ( Procurement Schedule ). 3.4.5 Modification of the Draft RFP (a) If the District determines, in connection with its review of a proposed ATC or otherwise, that the Draft RFP contains an error, am biguity or mistake, the District reserves the right to modify the RFP to correct the error, ambiguity or mistake, regardless of any impact on a proposed ATC (includi ng that such ATC no longer qualifies or is eligible for consideration as an AT C). (b) If the District does not, in its sole judgment, app rove a proposed ATC because it does not enable innovation in design, construction or performance, but the District, nevertheless, sees the benefit of making the relevant amendments to the Technical Provisions associated with the relevant A TC, the District may, for the benefit of all Proposers, include any or all of suc h amendments in any subsequent draft of the RFP. (c) If, in respect of any proposed ATC the District fin ds acceptable, the District shall either: (i) approve such ATC and the Proposer may incorporate t he ATC into its Proposal; or Draft for Public Review and Comment 36 (ii) make such revisions in any subsequent draft of the RFP that, in the District's sole judgment, it deems necessary to all ow the concept in the proposed ATC to be incorporated into a Proposal wit hout the need for an ATC. When preparing any such revisions to the RFP, the District shall use reasonable efforts to avoid disclosing the concept in the proposed ATC.

If the District responded to any ATC by stating that it would be acceptable if certain conditions were met (including any required third party approval), those conditions will become part of the Project Agreement. After the Preferred Proposer Selection but prior to the Commercial Closing Date, Draft for Public Review and Comment 37 the Project Agreement will be conformed to reflect the ATCs, including any District conditions to such ATC. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this IT P or in the Project Agreement, if the Developer does not comply with one or more D istrict or third party conditions of preapproval for an ATC, or if the Dev eloper fails to obtain a required third-party approval for an ATC, the Developer will be required to comply with the original requirements of the Project Agreement with out regard to the ATC and without being entitled to a change order, or other compensation or relief (whether pursuant to a Compensation Event, Relief E vent or otherwise) as set forth in Article 6 ( Alternative Technical Concepts ) of the Project Agreement. (c) In accordance with Section 3.4.8 ( Confidentiality of ATCs ), ATCs from unsuccessful Proposers may, in the District's sole discretion, b e presented to the Preferred Proposer during post-selection negotiations for pos sible incorporation.

Evaluation Criteria and Weighting Each responsive Proposal that passes the minimum re quirements review described above will be evaluated and scored to determine which Proposal of fers the best overall value to the District. Best value will be determined using a 1,000-point s cale. The Proposer's Total Proposal Score will be computed by adding the Proposer's Financial Prop osal Score, which may be up to a maximum of 700 points, and its Technical Proposal Score, wh ich may be up to a maximum of 300 points. The Proposer's Financial Proposal Score and Technic al Proposal Score will be determined using the methodology set forth in Section 4 ( Best Value Determination ) of this Appendix E ( Proposal Evaluation Criteria and Scoring ). 4. Best Value Determination 4.1 Total Proposal Score Smart Street Lighting Project Draft for Public Revi ew and Comment Instructions to Proposers Appendix E-6 The Proposal offering the best overall value to the District will be determined by computing the Total Proposal Score for each Proposal that passes the responsiveness review and minimum requirements review and responsibility determinatio n using the following methodology. The Total Proposal Score (which may be up to a maximum of 1,000 points) will equal the sum of the Financial Proposal Score (which may be up to a maxi mum of 700 points) and the Technical Proposal Score (which may be up to a maximum of 300 The Technical Proposal score (the \"Technical Proposal Score\" ) for a Proposer will be determined using the following methodology. The Technical Revi ew Committee will evaluate Parts 2 through 5 of the Technical Proposal. Table 1 ( Technical Evaluation Content, Criteria and Evaluati on ) lists the content, criteria and maximum available points for each part of the Technical Proposal to be evaluated. Table 2 ( Adjectival Ratings, Description and Numeric Rating ) lists the descriptions of the adjective and the corresponding numeric rating for each adjective. For each part of the Technical Proposal being evaluated, the Technical R eview Committee will individually evaluate and then as a group assign a consensus adjectival r ating and corresponding numeric rating to each numbered evaluation criterion. The consensus adjectival rating score for each numb ered evaluation factor will be multiplied by the weighting factor for that evaluation factor. Fo r example, if an evaluation factor has a maximum of 50 points available and the Technical Re view Committee awards an adjectival rating of \"Good\" for that factor, then the score for that factor is 4/5 of 50, or 40 points. The weighted scores for numbered evaluation factors will be summ ed to determine the Proposer's total score for each of the parts of the Technical Proposal bei ng evaluated. The total points available for each part of the Technical Proposal are set out in Table 1 ( Technical Evaluation Content, Criteria and Evaluation ). The total scores for each of the parts of the Techn ical Proposal being evaluated will then be summed to determine the Proposer's preliminary Tech nical Proposal Score, which may be a maximum of 1,000 points (the \"Preliminary Technical Proposal Score\" ). The Technical Proposal Score will be computed by mu ltiplying the Preliminary Technical Proposal Score by as Lighting Project Draft for Public Revi ew and Comment Instructions to Proposers Appendix E-7 Table 1 Technical Evaluation Content, Criteria and Evaluation Content Part 2, Preliminary Performance Plans: Preliminary M anagement and Staffing Plan (Contents) : Narrative Organizational Chart Part 5, Attachment A: Key Personnel Resumes Criteria Maximum Points Part 2, Preliminary Performance Plans: Preliminary Management and Staffing Plan (Criteria and Scoring): 1.

The Proposer will provide a schedule of anticipated Quarterly Availability Payments, Expected Electricity Costs, Milestone Payments, and the Smart City Payments (assuming no Deductions) in Table 6 of For m 11 ( Financial Pricing Form ). The Proposers should note that, although each Proposer will also provide its D&C Contract Price on Form 11 (Financial Pricing Form ), the District will not include such information i n computing the Financial Proposal Score. Rather, for purposes of computing t he Financial Proposal Score, the Proposer's price (the \"Financial Price\" ) will be calculated by discounting the values in c olumn G of Table 6 of Form 11 ( Financial Pricing Form ) back from the proposed payment date of those valu es (column A of Table 6 of Form 11 ( Financial Pricing Form )) to the Setting Date. The discount rate for this calculation will be 3.6%. The Financial Review Committee will calculate the F inancial Price on the following basis: (a) for purposes of the Financial Price calculation, pa yment of the Availability Payments will be assumed to be made when such payme nts are earned by the Developer; (b) all Availability Payments occurring during any Cale ndar Quarter will be assumed to be made at the end of that Calendar Quarter for purposes of the calculation in Table 6 of Form 11 ( Financial Pricing Form ). Once the Financial Review Committee has calculated the Financial Price, the Financial Review Committee will calculate the Financial Proposal Sco re using the following Lighting Project Draft for Public Revi ew and Comment Instructions to Proposers Appendix F-1 APPENDIX F SUMMARY AND CHECKLIST OF PROPOSAL CONTENTS RFP Components Forms (if any) RFP Section Cross-Reference Technical Proposal Part 1 - Executive Summary and Administrative Submittal (10 page limit) 1.
