JENNINGS, Deputy Staff Director MARY BERRY GERWIN, Minority Staff Director/Chief Counsel PREFACE If you could drop in on adult learning programs of- fered by the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, Motorola, Inc., or Harvard University, you would be struck first and foremost by the enthusiasm of adult students for learning. Whether the goal is learning to read in order to help grandchildren with their homework, training for changing technology, or studying \"Legal Issues-Consti- tutional and Otherwise,\" for self-interest, the older adult has both a real appreciation for the value of edu- cation and an excitement at having a second chance. Enthusiasm for lifelong learning is a good thing, for statistics tell us that today's Americans are living longer than their ancestors, and statistics also tell us that older Americans will soon be a much larger, more powerful share of our general population. It will be in our own best interest to learn how to take care of our- selves over an extended lifetime, and it will be in our Nation's best interest to enlist the aid of an informed older population that cannot only take better care of itself but also assume a leadership role, sharing its skills and knowledge with the generations that come after them. America was built on the idea of neighbor helping neighbor, generation helping generation. The America of the future will continue this tradition-through edu- cation. Already, college students from Temple Universi- ty are teaching elder Hispanic and Asian refugees to read and to adjust to their new homeland. Retirees are coming to the college campus at the.University of North Carolina at Asheville to take courses at the North Caro- lina Center for Creative Retirement, and they stay on to become tutors, mentors, and career counselors in a pro- gram called SAIL (Senior Academy for Intergenera- tional Learning): retired doctors share their expertise with pre-med students; computerwise retirees work with computer science students on projects to benefit UNCA; (III) older adults who enjoy athletics are matched with uni-versity athletes who share the same career interests.Elders are simultaneously students, teachers, and rolemodels. Americans need a new self-image, a new mirror thatreflects a truer picture of their potential. Lifelong learn-ing is that shiny, new mirror that reflects what wecould be if we learned to maintain our health, to stretchour resources, to remain independent and contributing,to adapt to changes in our technological world, to smile-as we pursue new activities we have never tried before,and to use our knowledge and skills to reach out tothose who need us. In corporate surroundings, senior centers, and univer-sity classrooms all over America, elders are beginningto redefine the concept of old age. Their nontraditionallearning programs are actually creative learning experi-ments born out of need---the need of older people to beas productive as their talents and energies, not theirages, allowed, and the need of America to enlist the aidof experienced elders. Lifelong learning programs arethe explosions heard 'round the country in our agingrevolution.This publication, rather than attempting to be a de-finitive work on education for the older adult, is an in-troduction to the concept of lifelong learning as a key tounlocking resources for an aging society. The picturepainted will be as small as \"The Talk Show,\" a programthat serves about 75 people at the Siouxland SeniorCenter in Iowa, and as big as General Electric. It will beas ethereal as the spirit at the LaFarge Lifelong Learn-ing Institute and as practical as an ABLE (AbilityBased on Long Experience) program. There are pro-grams highlighted for the healthiest older adult learnerand programs for those with Alzheimer's disease. Thisreport will cover formal education, informal education,education in the workplace, and intergenerational pro-grams. It will give you a glimpse of the future throughlifelong learning, and it will acquaint you with lawsthat affect education for the older adult. Agencies thatcan be of help to those interested in lifelong learningwill be featured. Many individuals and organizations need to bethanked for their contributions to this publication. Theywere the Committee's eyes and ears throughout the country so that we could learn about lifelong learning programs in America. State agencies, Federal agencies, businesses and organizations in the private sector, the academic community, and interested individuals all en- thusiastically sent in information. Education seems to touch everyone in a special way. We learned a great deal from their contributions. The Committee would also like to thank Dr. Lydia Bront6 for serving as a valuable resource and for con- tributing an original article to the print. Kevin B. Greely and M. Ann Wolfe of the Congressional Re- search Service contributed the chapters on laws affect- ing education for older adults, and they, as well as the many people who work for the Congressional Research Service, deserve to be thanked for their valuable contri- butions. Donald Fowles of the Administration on Aging kindly provided up-to-date statistics. And finally, credit is due to Daniel Tuite of the Government Printing Office and to Eileen Oberman of the Aging Committee staff for editorial assistance in the development of this print. Committee Fellow Ann Arnof Fishman brings her en- thusiasm and dedication to this examination of educa- tional opportunities for older adults. She merits special recognition as the principal author and editor of this study. DAVID PRYOR, Chairman. WILUAM COHEN, Ranking Minority Member.

Changes bring problems and challenges but mainly demand our ability to make those changes work in our favor. The way we do things today needs to be reexam- ined for future value. In particular, the way we train ourselves to get along in our world-our education- needs to be reexamined. In the past, most\" Americans followed a pattern of school in the early years, work in the middle years, and retirement in the later years. Neel Buell, Director of the Emeritus Institute, Coastline Community College Foundation, sums up how Americans traditionally viewed education: \"Until recently it appeared that many felt that education was like the measles, you were exposed at an early age and then got over it somehow.\" A longer lifespan, however, is a gift given to us with strings attached. For the gift, to be of any value, re- quires the recipient to be educated throughout an entire Aging America, Trends and Projections, 1991 edition. 2 Ibid. 3Ibid. lifetime-to know how to maintain good health, to knowhow to stretch financial resources over a longer periodof time, and to know how to adapt to changes in a tech-nological world. James Birren, founder of the Nation'sfirst school for the study of aging at the University ofSouthern California in the 1960's,4 points out thatlinear education (school-work-retirement) \"can beviewed as a single inoculation that is expected to beadequate for the rest of one's life, whereas * * * life-long education * * * is like a booster shot, in which re-peated exposures over time are required to sustain thedesired level of protection.\" 5 Lifelong learning can improve the quality of life foreach of us as well as influence public and private policy.Included in this Committee publication is a reprint ofan article written by Harry R. Moody for the CarnegieCorporation report Our Aging Society: Paradox andPromise.6 Dr. Moody, Deputy Director of Hunter Col-lege's Brookdale Center on Aging, believes that lifelongeducation can help older people become more self-suffi-cient, more able to deal with the problems of aging, andless dependent on programs funded by a dwindling gov-ernment budget. He sees a potential for promoting goodhealth and preventing illness by teaching older peoplehow to care for themselves, thus possibly reducing thebillions of dollars spent on medical treatment. Moodyfurther encourages programs that retrain older work-ers, opening up new possibilities for a more productivework force, one that competes in the internationalmarket with skilled rather than cheap labor. He pro-motes the mixing of generations through intergenera-tional learning programs, allowing opportunities foreach generation to better understand the other's needs.When people are not segregated by age, they are betterable to see the bigger picture. In other words, communi-ties with large numbers of older people would not votedown taxes targeted for public school improvementssimply because it did not affect them directly. 4 Dr. Birren is currently Director of the Anna & Harry Borun Center forGerontological Research at the University of California, Los Angeles.5 From an address to the Southern Gerontological Society, as quoted inRobert A. Harootyan and Nina S. Feldman, \"Lifelong Education, LifelongNeeds: Future Roles in an Aging Society,\" Educational Gerontology,16:347-358, 1990, pp. 350-351. 6 See Appendix A, p. 87. Americans must first redefine old age and break through the stereotypes prevalent about older people. (The National Institute on Aging offers both a quiz on the effect of aging on the brain and a quiz to test your \"aging I.Q.\" Turn to Appendix B to see how you rate.) 7 Once we have a truer picture of the older American and begin to acknowledge the underutilized potential, we must find ways to tap into their tremendous energy and resources for the benefit of both the individual and soci- ety. As individuals, we will have to learn how to suc- cessfully manage a longer life. As citizens, we will have to pass on our skills to help younger generations. America will enlist its older adults to deal with prob- lems faced by our Nation. Already in place, D.O.V.E.S. (Dedicated Older Volunteers in Educational Service) serve as classroom assistants and offer specialized knowledge to the Los Angeles public schools, SAIL (Senior Academy for Intergenerational Learning) matches retired civic and professional leaders with un- dergraduate students to work together on learning projects at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, and the volunteers of OASIS (Older Adult Service and Information System) undergo specialized training and are then paired for a full school year with first, second, and third graders who have underdeveloped reading and language skills. Today's older Americans, remem-,bering what they felt when President Kennedy called upon them to \"ask what you can do for your country,\" are already redefining old age at a brisk new pace. In the following chapter, Dr. Lydia Bronte, former Di- rector of the Carnegie Corporation's Aging Society Project 8 and now Director of The Long Careers Study, encourages a new attitude toward getting older-it could be a time we looked forward to, a time to finally try all the things we had been putting off, a time full of new enthusiasm for life. Bronth says that Americans don't like old age. But she also says that life is full ofsurprises for this and future generations. Who knows, we might even learn to like ourselves as the \"new\" older Americans. 7 See page 109.8 Our Aging Society: Paradox and Promise, Norton, 1986, is co-edited by Alan Pifer and Lydia Brontk. Chapter 1 THE \"NEW\" OLDER AMERICAN (By Lydia BrontW, Ph.D.) If you didn't know how old you was, how old would you be?--SATCHEL PAIGE. INTRODUCTION During the twentieth century, human life has been more dramatically transformed than at any other period in history. In less than 100 years, Americans have moved from horse-drawn carriages to the automobile, the airplane, and the space shuttle; from kerosene lamps and gas- lights to electric lights and laser technology. We have gone from writing our everyday communications by hand, to using typewriters, then personal computers, then to sending FAX transmissions through telephone wires. In 1900, we needed 10 days to 2 weeks to reach Europe by ocean liner. Today the Concorde carries us the same distance in a mere 3 hours. In 1900, the first functioning airplane had not yet been invented, al- though human beings had dreamed about it for centur- ies. In 1968, less than one lifetime later, we watched as the first man stepped onto the rocky soil of the Moon, his image beamed back to Earth through television sig- nals. The changes in our personal lives may seem less obvi- ous, but they are just as. astonishing. One of the most unexpected is the change in the length of time we live, and in the character of \"old age.\" The new older Ameri- cans are the first generation in history to live in large numbers to their 70's, 80's, and 90's-ages unattainable for the great majority of our ancestors. Most important- ly, the majority of these new older people are in good health. It is a truly unprecedented development. It is also a trend which appears likely to continue: av-erage life expectancies are still rising, and althoughthey rise unevenly-sometimes rapidly and sometimesmore slowly-there is no sign at present that they arelikely to stop. Some demographers predict that the aver-age life expectancy at birth in the United States couldreach 100 by the middle of the next century-perhapseven sooner, depending on as-yet undiscovered scientificadvances. Americans generally dislike the idea of growing old.But life is full of surprises: one of them is that the trendtoward longevity has many positive aspects. THE LENGTH OF ADULTHOOD HAS DOUBLED In 1900, Americans thought that adulthood started atabout age 20 and extended roughly to age 50, an activeadult life of only about 30 years. Now, with life expec-tancies in.the mid to late 70's and still climbing, the or-dinary active adult life reaches from age 20 to 75 or80-approximately twice as long. OLD AGE DOESN'T BEGIN AT 65 Since the 1930's, when age 65 was selected by theSocial Security Commission as the age at which pensionbenefits began, we have believed that 65 was the inal-terable beginning of old age. But this was a somewhatarbitrary definition, based on the German pensionsystem-not on any scientific knowledge about aging.In fact, what is considered \"old\" is as much a matterof social custom as it is of biology. At the beginning ofthis century \"old age\" started much earlier: it was gen-erally thought that a woman was \"old\" at 30 and a man\"old\" at 40. These definitions crept forward very slowly.In the 1930's, sociologist Dr. John H. Riley was told by afriend of his in the Civil Service that as far as hiringguidelines were concerned, the Civil Service defined an\"older woman\" as \"any woman over 35.\"For reasons no one has yet fully deciphered, theperiod of vitality in the middle of life has lengthened aslongevity- has increased. It isn't that people are elderlyat 60 or 65 and we've tacked on an extra 20 or 30 yearsof old age after that. It is that we aren't getting old onthe same schedule any more. Between the boundaries ofchildhood at one end of the life course, and old age at the other, time has mysteriously expanded, somewhat like an accordion. .Physical old age now begins much later than 65 for many people. For some, it has not yet started even when they are in their 80's or 90's. In the study of working older people which I am currently conduct- ing-The Long Careers Study-there are people as old as 92 who do not show what we think of as the tradi- tional signs of physical aging: they are healthy, phys- ically active and energetic, their mental powers are sharp, and they have active work and social lives. Their appearance is what we would expect of a person 20 or 30 years younger than their real chronological age. WE'VE GAINED A SECOND MIDDLE AGE The time added by the new longevity does not belong to the conventional age categories we have been accus- tomed to. It is not part of the 35-to-50 \"middle age,\" and it is just as surely not part of traditional \"old age.\" In effect, a new stage of adult life has been created, brack- eted between these two traditional stages. It is a second middle age, which takes place roughly between the ages of 50 and 75. It's important to remember that while in general the second middle age extends from age 50 to 75, occupying roughly the third quarter of a hundred year life span, in individual experience its end point isn't rigidly fixed. The aging process is highly individual. For some people the second middle age extends into their 80's or even their 90's. A few never seem to get \"old\" in the conven- tional sense at all. They reach what Dr. James Birren calls a \"plateau of healthy functioning\" at some point in their 60's or 70's, and sustain it for the rest of their lives-with no marked physical decline, and, at the end of life, either a short illness or no illness at all. \"OLD\" DOESN'T MEAN \"SICK\" We have grown so accustomed to seeing media pres- entations about the ill elderly that we have lost sight of the fact that at any given time, only about 5 percent of all older people are seriously ill. An additional 10 per- cent have a physical problem which is partially limit- ing. To put it the other way around: 85 percent of our over-65 population are essentially healthy normal adults.They have no real physical problems and they areliving their lives pretty much as other adults do.This may seem unbelievable, because of .the tremen-dous concern during the past decade about long-termcare, Medicare and Medicaid, and Alzheimer's, andabout providing for the growing numbers of olderpeople in our population. But nevertheless, it is there.The vast majority of people over 65 are in good health.As the percentage of older people in our population in-creases, the number of older people will necessarily in-crease-so that the institutionalized 5 percent will be amuch bigger number. But the healthy 85 percent will bea much larger number, too. It is also important to note that because the processof aging is so individual, statistical averages don't pre-dict the path of any given person. Other factors canhave a huge impact on your state of health and lengthof life. For example, health habits and lifestyle becomeeven more important in a longer life-smoking ordrinking to excess or being overweight, for example, canspeed up the aging process and significantly shorten thelength of life. The most physically feeble participant inThe Long Careers Study was one of the youngest-at 67,he was suffering from advanced emphysema as a resultof smoking 5 or 6 packs a day for roughly 30 years. Hewas weaker than the oldest member of the study-a101-year-old biochemist-and he died a month after hisinterview for the study. (The 101-year-old biochemistoutlived the man by 2 years, and continued going to hisoffice to work until just a short time before his death.)Because of the highly individual quality of the agingprocess, we need all of the income and health-care sup-port systems currently in place-none of the advancesin longevity should be seen as a rationale for diminish-ing them. There will always be some people who arephysically old and in poor health in their 60's. And itmay be that the sense of safety given us by the exist-ence of Social Security has helped to make the expan-sjon of longevity possible, by eliminating an importantsource of life stress. MENTAL DECLINE Is NOT A PART OF NORMAL AGING Before Alzheimer's disease became widely known in this country in the 1970's, Americans believed that se- nility was a part of normal aging. Now we know that mental decline is due to specific disease conditions, chiefly to Alzheimer's. Age alone doesn't cause it. The existing scientific research shows that barring ill- ness, aging does not cause decline in mental powers, in creativity, or in the ability to remember things. If you're smart and creative to start with, you'll stay smart and creative throughout your life, unless you're unlucky enough to come down with a specific disease which affects functioning. As our longevity increases, one of the highest items on the national list of priorities ought to be solving the riddle of Alzheimer's. Most of us would actually be quite eager to live longer lifetimes if we knew that the specter of Alzheimer's had been exorcised. THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO MATURITY, ALTHOUGH AMERICANS HAVEN'T YET FULLY RECOGNIZED WHAT THEY ARE-OR EVEN THAT THEY ExIST As a nation we are so hooked on the joys of youth that it doesn't occur to us that some things do get better with time. Some skills, for instance, take a number of years to develop fully; only then does the person really achieve mastery. The skills involved in dealing with human systems fall into that category. It takes time to develop as a manager, an administrator, a company president, a judge, a legislator. Similarly, in professions in which the essential knowledge of the field is dense and highly complex, one must master an immense body of knowl- edge, part of it written and part of it derived from living experience. There are a number of jobs and pro- fessions in which people often continue to very old ages, for the simple reason that once they have attained a high level of skill, it makes sense for them to keep using it and developing it further. Some cultures have known this for a long time-the top management of Japanese companies are often men in their 70's and 80's. It is assumed that the wisdom they have acquired is a bonus for their companies. From our perspective at the moment, there's no reasonto doubt that. There is a second unrecognized advantage to maturi-ty. It seems that there is a point in the developmentalprocess when we stop \"growing up,\" and start \"growingout.\" Many of The Long Careers Study participantsappear to have reached a point where they had resolvedmany of their life's personal tasks; they then began tobe more deeply involved in working on problems affect-ing the larger community. As former Secretary of LaborWillard Wirtz once remarked, our society doesn't have ashortage of major problems. It would make sense to tryto enlist some of these long-lived, experienced andhighly-skilled people in the effort to solve some of thesociety's problems, instead of relegating them to thesidelines. If The Long Careers Study participants are anexample, there are many wise minds in our older popu-lation who might be willing to sign on. IN A LONG-LIVED SOCIETY, WORK AND CONTINUED EDU- CATION WILL REMAIN IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE THROUGH- OUT THEIR LIFETIMES, REGARDLESS OF How LONG THEY LIVE The concept of retirement was based partly on the as-sumption that most people would be physically wornout by age 65 and that they would not live much beyondthat. From this viewpoint retirement was seen as the pot of gold at the end of life's rainbow, the just rewardfor someone who, at 65, is genuinely old and wants littleactivity. Neither of those propositions is true in 1991. The ma- jority of workers hold jobs which do not wear them outphysically. And relatively few Americans are physicallyold by the age. of 65. People who don't like their workwant to retire from it; they are then free to find activi-ties which they do like. And people who have alreadyfound work they love often want to continue it indefi-nitely. The potential for growth, development, and creativityexists throughout life. It is not affected by simple chro-nology. One of the most surprising results of The LongCareers Study is that 20 percent of the participants hadtheir major career peak, or their only career peak, afterthe age of 50, or. in, some cases after the age of 65. Ap- . 11 proximately 10 percent of the group started a new career--or their only career-after the age of 50, and a few began a new career after 65 which proved to be the most satisfying and productive career in-their worklife. Many participants re-entered formal education in later adulthood, one earning a Ph.D. in his 50's and one training as a psychotherapist in her 60's. (At 77 she is still in practice.) Others pursued further learning on a more casual basis, but all felt the opportunity for con- tinued study was one of the great benefits of long life. Your ability to grow and expand, both mentally and emotionally, will last as long as you are alive. It is liter- ally almost never too late to start something new. The only real limitations are our ideas and beliefs, and those we can change. In our time-starved society, where there is never enough time to do everything we want to do, increased longevity is a gift beyond all expectations. Chapter 2 FORMAL EDUCATION I saw an encyclopedia company magazine ad showing a tombstone, inscribed with the words, \"He died at 35, but they didn't bury him until he was 70.\" A true example of how people who stop learning die intellectually, and live lives devoid of mental growth and achievement. What a challenge to those of us in the adult education field to keep everyone on the learn- ing route \"forever.\" 9 INTRODUCTION The older adult, returning to a college campus for the first time in 40 years, has had to have the courage of a Christopher Columbus embarking on a voyage to the New World. Something wonderful was out there, but there were few good maps available for the mature ma- triculant adrift in a sea of youthful faces. Colleges and universities have appropriately revolved around the educational, social, and psychological needs of young adults in their late teens and early twenties. Fraternities, sororities, special interest clubs, and serv- ice organizations form a support system, a home away from home, where students have opportunities to make new friends. Counseling is available on campuses to help young students face problems they might encoun- ter. Intramural sports and physical education courses offer ways to fine-tune young bodies and relieve stress. Academic counselors help students chart their way through a maze of courses appropriate for young adults. Job placement exists to help graduates find entry level positions that offer plenty of room for advancement over the long haul. 9 Robert B. Maxwell, President, AARP, from a speech given to the Coali- tion of Adult Education Organizations, Feb. 21, 1991. (13) As America ages, however, colleges will need to makeadjustments for a changing society. Several colleges anduniversities are already breaking ground in finding cre-ative ways to welcome back older students, while, at thesame time, effectively maintaining a balance betweenthe needs of the young and the needs of the old. Themore creative the approach, the more the two systemscomplement each other. In this chapter on formal education, several collegeswill be highlighted in order to demonstrate key ingredi-ents that make adult education programs work success-fully. Many other colleges could have been included. Itis only important for us to realize, however, that ourcolleges and universities, the highest level of our educa-tion system, are beginning to understand the value andneed of lifelong learning and the warmth and wisdom ofadult education. ROSA KELLER CAMPUS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES Touro Infirmary, The Woldenberg Center for Orleans, 70115-3593,(504) 286-6168 When New Orleanian Rosa Keller, an 80-year-oldsocial activist, encouraged all accredited colleges anduniversities in the New Orleans area to join together tocreate high quality education for older adults, the re-sulting blend was as unique as New Orleans gumbo.This cooperative effort from eight diverse colleges anduniversities allowed educational opportunities that cutacross religious, racial, economic, geographic, cultural,and academic lines in the city. \"The Greater Metropoli-tan New Orleans Consortium for Educational Opportu-nities for Older Adults\" established its headquarters atthe Woldenberg Center for Gerontological Studies atTouro Infirmary, a New Orleans hospital, thus eliminat-ing identification with any one school, and allowing forprofessionals from the Woldenberg Center to offer guid-ance in identifying the needs of older students.The creation of the New Orleans Consortium demon-strates three key ingredients that can vitalize programsfor older adult learners: (1) an individual with ideas and enthusiasmserves as a catalyst to set the program in motion; (2) a spirit of cooperation from existing institu- tions or other sources within a community provides a solid starting base; and (3) a knowledge of and sensitivity to the needs of the older learner encourage and maintain participa- tion. Each educational program will reflect the character of its own particular mix of these ingredients. One of the first acts of the New Orleans Consortium was to set up a system that could dispense information to the older adults in the community in a quick and easy manner. Mrs. Keller came up with the idea of an information clearinghouse. Now, with a single phone call, an older adult in the New Orleans area can find out what courses are available at any of the eight schools in the Consortium. The clearinghouse supplies information on special tuition rates and how to get them as well as names of \"campus contacts\", a staff person on each campus designated to further help older students. Even information about non-college education programs offered throughout the city is given out through the clearinghouse, which prides itself on being able to help callers interested in G.E.D.'s or Ph.D.'s. One of the strengths of the New Orleans Consortium has been this ability to identify and eliminate potential problems from the start. The professionals at the Wol- denberg Center 10 quickly pinpointed strengths and weaknesses of both adult learners and adult education programs through a series of surveys and interviews with older adults currently taking college courses. The data gathered revealed which courses older students preferred, what obstacles hindered them, why they re- turned to school, and whether or not they were interest- ed in completing degrees. All the information gathered proved to be helpful in setting up an educational pro- gram to encourage older learners to come back on campus and into the classroom. The Rosa Keller Campus Without Boundaries was de- veloped by the Consortium to offer \"sampler\" courses that allow adults over 65 an opportunity to take short 10 Howard Osofsky, M.D., Ph.D., Principal Investigator, Cameron J. Camp, Ph.D., Associate Director, and Ann M. O'Hanlon, M.S., Project Co- ordinator, Greater Metropolitan New Orleans Consortium for Educational Opportunities for Older Adults. courses without the pressure of grades. Classes last 2hours and are given once a week for 2 to 4 weeks. Thetopics of the initial sampler reflected the interests olderstudents revealed in the surveys-foreign languages,history, philosophy, and computer literacy. Some of thecourses offered were \"History of World Religions,\"\"Jazz: Hot to Trends of Aging,\" and \"Introduction Computer.\"In addition to offering courses that reflected the inter-ests of the older student, the Rosa Keller Campus dem-onstrated a sensitivity to other needs of older adults.Even though its classrooms were located at differentcolleges, rooms were selected to offer easy visuals andgood acoustics. Faculty members were chosen because oftheir interest and aptitude in working with older stu-dents. Great attention was given to ease of transporta-tion--closeness to bus lines, distance from parking lots,accessibility to classrooms and libraries, and safety ofan area. Classes were scheduled at times older studentsseemed to prefer. Registration was designed to offerguidance, support, and ease. This slight tinkering withthe existing system created an encouraging atmospherefor older students and set up a pattern for successfulparticipation. Adult education has a ripple effect, like a stonethrown into water. For older students, the Rosa KellerCampus offers a place to resharpen learning skills, aspringboard for reentry into the academic world, and achance to appreciate the joy and value of a college edu-cation, possibly for the first time. Ongoing research willshow if older and younger students as well as facultymembers experience changes in knowledge and atti-tudes about aging as a result of intergenerationalmixing. The circle becomes wider as older adults who benefitfrom their learning experience begin to give somethingback to the community. This New Orleans program hasalready begun to expand to other levels of educationand training for older adults. Recently, under the um-brella of the Consortium, the Louisiana Department ofMental Health funded a grant to train older adults towork as case management aides for emotionally dis-turbed children and mentally ill adults. Those who know the project best, the researchers from the Woldenberg Center, already indicate that the circles are ever expanding and that the size of the \"stone\" thrown was massive: One of the compelling aspects of the Rosa Keller Campus courses is that all eight institu- tions are participating. All have offered class- room space and/or instructors. In the best spirit of cooperation, the course on History of Ethnic Groups in New Orleans will be taught by a white instructor * * * from a public uni- versity and a black instructor from a private university and will be located at a predomi- nantly black public university. The course rep- resents what is best about the Consortium-co- operation in the delivery of quality education for all older citizens.11 \"MY TURN\" Kingsborough Community College, The City University of New York, 2001 Oriental Boulevard, Brooklyn, New York 11235, (718) 368-5079 The \"melting pot\" theory is alive and well at Kings- borough Community College in Brooklyn. In times past, early immigrants introduced their cultures to one an- other, preserving traditions, yet creating a new, unified America in the process. Today's pioneers, however, are groups of retirees, the first to have extended lives due to better medical care. And they are migrating to col- lege campuses by the tens of thousands. At Kingsbor- ough Community College, the person sitting in front of you may have had a triple bypass, while the person sit- ting behind you may still be dealing with acne. As stu- dents talk to each other, ask questions about assign- ments, and study together for tests, the young and the old become friends, and understanding and respect begin to grow. Whenever you hear the sound of laugh- ter, another age barrier has been broken. \"MY TURN\" is the special tuition-free college educa- tion program at Kingsborough Community College that encourages older adults back onto campus. The require- 11 Ann M. O'Hanlon, Howard J. Osofsky, Cameron J. Camp, \"Education across the lifespan: Contributions to the quality of life of older adults.\" In G.H. Pollock & S.I. Greenspan (Eds.) The course of life, (Vol. 7), in press. 18 ments for admission are simple. Students must be NewYork City or State residents who, by the first day ofclass, are 65 or older. Kingsborough's admission require-ment of a high school diploma or a General EquivalencyDiploma has been waived for \"MY TURN\" students.Once an applicant qualifies by age and residence, he orshe simply pays a $25 registration fee, buys books andsupplies, if needed, and becomes part of the general col-lege student population. The program started in 1981 with about 70 students,quickly jumped to 200, and today, about 2,000 studentsparticipate each academic year. Their backgrounds arediverse. Some have never completed elementary school,some have advanced degrees. Their goals are equally di-verse. Those without a high school diploma may applyfor a GED after completing 24 credits at Kingsborough.Others are working toward their third associate degree.Some simply take courses for enjoyment. \"MY TURN\"students may take as many or as few courses as theywant, but Dr. Barbara Ginsberg, the program's director,says the average student usually takes two courses-onethey're really going to study hard for, an academiccourse such as philosophy or history-and one that isjust for fun, such as drawing, ceramics, or a self-im-provement course. The program at Kingsborough Community Collegeshows both sensitivity to the needs of older studentsand respect for their capabilities. The promotional bro-chure, set in question and answer form, sums it upquite well: Q. Are \"MY TURN\" students treated differently orseparated from other students or activities? A. Absolutely not! Aside from being given a special-for-them time for registration, \"MY TURN\" studentsare never apart-they are all an integrated part of theregular student body. Courses and classes, study andhomework, assignments and tests, participation in all'activities, social and cultural events, the use of all facili-ties (gym, library, beach, bookstore, cafeteria, learningcenter, etc.) are the same for all registered KCC stu-dents. When required work is satisfactorily completed,college credit is given.Q. Is there any special assistance given to \"MYTURN\" students? A. Certainly. Because most \"MY TURN\" students have been away from school for some time, that pro- gram includes individual counseling before and during registration. Academic counseling is available through- out the semester. As needed, such services as tutoring, study and help with learning problems, guidance, trans- fer to senior colleges on graduation are available. Other services include: an active \"MY TURN\" club; frequent rap sessions with other students in the program to dis- cuss special problems and answer questions; lectures and forums concerning specific interests of older adults (nutrition, bereavement, work options, health, politics, volunteering, government regulations, etc.); health fairs, social gatherings, outings, workshops. All those and more are part of \"MY TURN.\" As \"MY TURN\" celebrates its first decade, Dr. Gins- berg says the program gets high marks from those who count. Older students report that they feel more vital and more alive. Many of the early group of 200 still come back for additional degrees or just for the joy of learning. Younger students report that* their \"senior\" friends help them truly understand the value of a col- lege education. All report on their mutual respect for each other. That's not a bad \"report\" card for Kingsbor- ough Community College. GERONTOLOGY PROGRAM College of Public and Community Service, University of Massachu- setts/Boston, Downtown Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02125, (617) 287-7330 \"Don't confuse age with ability.\" This quote headlines the pamphlet from the Gerontol- ogy Program at UMass/Boston and sets the tone for a program developed to prepare individuals over 60 to serve as professionals in the field of gerontology. And, who better to care for the elderly than educated elders? The program's student handbook says it best:\"* * * with specialized training in social policy, active older people can significantly improve the quality of life for the state's older Americans. That is, the solutions to aging with dignity rest in the ability of older people to shape their own destinies.\" 12 12 Gerontology Students' Handbook, p.1. Indeed, the 404 graduates of the Programare shaping destinies-their own and those of otherolder adults--with vigor. Graduates have gone on tojobs as diverse as working at the Massachusetts Depart-ment of Elder Affairs, directing a nursing home, leadinga campaign drive for a gubernatorial candidate, work-ing for a State legislator, providing effective leadershipof a home care board, and administering programs forelders. The career aspect of this program coupled with arigorous but innovative educational approach called\"competency-based education\" gives the GerontologyProgram at UMass/Boston a character all its own.Competency-based education simply means that stu-dents demonstrate specific prescribed skills in order toearn college credits. This system works well for oldermature learners who are comfortable demonstrating theconcepts they have learned. For some, action-orientedtasks may be harder than traditional coursework, but iteliminates the pressure of grading while allowing forrigorous testing of intellectual and technical compe-tence. Students receive a State Certificate in Gerontolo-gy after completing two terms of intensive study, anequivalent of 30 undergraduate hours.The State of Massachusetts benefits as well fromthese student endeavors. Gerontology Program studentscontribute to published reports that deal with issues ofimportance to the elderly, such as A Nursing Home* * * Not For My Folks! (a study based on extendedinterviews by students with 68 families who are caringfor aged relatives in their own homes with little or nopublic financial or social assistance). Students have in-vestigated the effects of rising energy costs on olderpeople, researched patient satisfaction with servicesfrom home care agencies, and studied the experiences offamilies who recently placed an elder in a nursinghome. They work closely with members of the State Leg-islature and other key decisionmakers, learning fromthem and at the same time expressing the real needs ofthe elderly to those in power. Allowing mature students to participate in action-ori-ented educational opportunities that would benefit theState was the result of suggestions from the Massachu-setts Association of Older Americans, a major statewideself-help organization. From the start of the Gerontolo-gy Program, MAOA and UMass/Boston cooperated to set \"ground rules\" that would make best use of stu- dents' strengths while being sensitive to special needs of seniors. There are no evening classes. Courses are scheduled so that students need to be at the college only one time per week. Classes are held in buildings with easy access, located near mass transit. Tuition is waived for students over 60. UMass/Boston provides tutoring services and administrative assistance to students re- turning to school after long absences. When thought is given to making it convenient to enter a program, to learn from a program, and to bene- fit from a program, the results are successful on a number of levels. Dr. Scott Bass, Director of the Geron- tology Program and Institute, and Robert Morris, Lec- turer in Gerontology at UMass/Boston, describe the suc- cess of the program in terms of its growth, its workabil- ity within the university, and its ability to offer educa- tional opportunities to students from varied back- grounds: The program has grown during a five year period, with the university providing only modest faculty time * * * and without large ex- ternal funding * * ** The ages of students have ranged from 22 to 81 years, but the average has been 67 years; all but five had a high school education or study in a vocational or technical school. Only a third had college degrees * * *. We have deliberately sought diversity in age, background, previous education, and ethnicity in our admission policies and we have found that students with only primary or high school educations are as able to acquire complicated new competencies as those with college educa- tions.13 We have described the impact of adult education in terms of the ripple effect of a stone thrown into water. Another \"rock\" analogy may now be just as appropri- ate. The students' handbook describes the Gerontology Program at UMass/Boston as a \"stepping stone for many talented people concerned about the elderly.\" 13 Robert Morris and Scott A. Bass, \"The Elderly As Surplus People: Is There a Role for Higher Education?, The Gerontologist, Vol. 26, No. 1, 1986, p. 16. Solid societies, especially aging societies, may well bebuilt of such stones.14 14 The Gerontology Program has been the subject of a case study pre-pared by ICF, Inc., on behalf of The Commonwealth Fund of New York. Chapter 3 INFORMAL EDUCATION When I was young, I was amazed at Plu- tarch's statement that the elder Cato began at the age of 80 to learn Greek. I am amazed no longer. Old age is ready to undertake the tasks that youth shirked because they would take too long.15 -SOMERSET MAUGHAM. INTRODUCTION This chapter on informal learning is more like a tossed salad than a pie crust: a pie crust needs to be perfectly prepared, with all ingredients exact, to taste right; with a tossed salad, however, you just keep adding ingredients until it looks good, and, although the result may be different every time, it will still be deli- cious. The number and variety of informal learning pro- grams are so great that a general survey can never be complete. Something will always be left out. The view presented here will be just a \"taste\" of what's going on in America in informal learning programs for older adults. However, a recurrent theme runs through all these programs, whether it is the Institute for Learning in Retirement at Harvard University or \"The Talk Show'' at the Siouxland Senior Center in Iowa: older people have a tremendous desire to learn. These \"non-tradi- tional\" learning programs are actually creative learn- ing experiments that people have invented so that older adults could have an appropriate and meaningful learn- ing experience. The need and value of lifelong learning will be most evident in this chapter. Informal learning programs best reveal the depth and breath of the vitali- ty, creativity, and productivity of older Americans. 15 As quoted by Harold Helfer, \"Old Age Highs, Lows,\" The Washington Times, June 28, 1983. (23) 59-854 -92 -2 CHEROKEE NATION OF OKLAHOMA Adult Education Program, P.O. Box 948, Tahlequah, Oklahoma74465, Reva Reyes, Project Director, (918) 456-0671, (918) 458-0484 One day, in a rural Oklahoma community calledRocky Mountain, rain came pouring down and watercovered the roads. Rocky Mountain community maystill have some houses with no indoor plumbing, but italso has adult education classes. Reva Reyes, Project Di-rector for the program, says the adult students whoattend classes voluntarily, on their own time, evaluate aprogram by \"voting with their feet.\" If instruction feelsgood and meets needs, students participate. If it doesn't,students leave. On that rainy night in Adair County,Oklahoma, two Native American women who livedquite a distance away, did make it to class on time-bywalking over a mountain to get there..The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma offers adult educa-tion programs for ABE (literacy) and GED (high schoolequivalency) for Native Americans from the 14 countiesunder the original tribal jurisdiction. The unique as-pects of the program-a staff trained to understand theneeds of the older Native American adult learner, amethod of teaching that builds confidence as well as vo-cabulary, and a record-keeping system that enablesevery student to succeed-are intricately woven togeth-er to create a rewarding learning environment. As theweaving of baskets- gives students a way to preserve avalued heritage, the weaving of learning componentsgives them an academic heritage.Staff development is the first component. Teachersfor the programs are trained for many tasks. They mustfirst find out if a community wants classes by visitinghomes, talking to community leaders, attending events,and being where the people are. They ask potential stu-dents to let them know what hours and days would bebest for classes, and they find out what social servicesmight be needed. Eyeglasses and hearing aids are pro--vided, and transportation and medical screenings arearranged. Teachers become advocates for the needs ofpeople who live in these isolated regions, helping witheverything from income tax preparation to matching uppeople who need wood for stoves with programs thatprovide it. The teachers and the program are there to help the older adult student improve every aspect of life. The method of teaching is geared to the needs and priorities of the older adult learner who is also Native American. Time is a precious commodity, so students write directly into workbooks instead of copying materi- als. They work at their own pace while instructors move from student to student giving whatever individual in- struction is necessary. In addition to ABE and GED courses, students are offered mini-courses on Cherokee literacy (reading and writing the Cherokee language in- vented by Sequoyah), tribal history, the art of basket weaving, beading, and other areas of interest such as voter registration. The blending of academics with cul- tural activities motivates students to learn, to have pride in one's heritage, and to become better citizens. Perhaps the most unique aspect of the program is the record-keeping system. Beginning students, given diag- nostic sheets, are urged not to guess at any answers, as the purpose is simply to find out which books and mate- rials are appropriate, not to grade student performance. From this point on, progress is recorded on a master skills checklist-skills already mastered are marked, and the student can easily see which skills will be stud- ied next. As each skill is mastered, the checklist is marked, and when students. near the level at which GED is taken, a practice exam is taken. This system seems to eliminate test anxiety throughout the entire learning process and to increase self-confidence by al- lowing students to feel good about the material they have learned each day in class, a sort of instant positive reinforcement on a regular basis. Ms. Reyes says it best: \"As students see the skills mount up on the sheets, they have a sense of pride in their learning ability and con- trol over their learning process.\" Because the skills sheet is a highly detailed and individualized curriculum guide prescribing precisely what is to be taught and in what order, teachers do not have to waste time plan- ning lessons. Skills sheets can be correlated with grade levels, if needed. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma Adult Education Program offers a learning experience where everyone succeeds and no one fails. For the older adult partici- pants, just getting a GED is not the point. This is a per- sonal choice for learning that is made by many: grand- parents who want to be better role models for thegrandchildren they care for; men who had to workwhen they were boys and couldn't go to school; womenwho grew up in isolated areas that had no schools. Ac-cording to Reva Reyes, kids may not know what it's allfor, but these Native American older adult students ap-preciate the joy and value of an education. ELDERHOSTEL 75 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110 Being 60 in America means you are finally oldenough for entry into Elderhostel, and Elderhostelmeans studying glaciers while in Alaska, astronomy inSan Francisco, natural photography in Colorado, arche-ology in Hawaii, dulcimer playing in Kentucky, andMozart in New York. For many older Americans, this isthe adventure of a lifetime. In 1990 alone, about 215,000people participated in this educational program; 230,000are expected in 1991. The Elderhostel program is remarkable not only forthe large number of people it serves and the variety ofcourses it offers, but also for the spirit of cooperation itfosters among educational and cultural institutions inthe United States, Canada, and over 40 countries over-seas. Since the program began in 1975, over 1,500 col-leges, universities, museums, and environmental educa-tional centers have joined together to provide a networkthat offers low-cost, short-term, residential academicprograms for adults 60 and over. The programs in theUnited States and Canada usually last 1 week, pro-grams abroad 2 to 3 weeks. Hostelers literally \"go backto school\" for that period of time. They live in dormito-ries, eat at the cafeteria, take up to three specially de-signed courses, and participate in extracurricular activi-ties, field trips, and cultural events. Elderhostel issimply college in a more compact form, modified tomeet the needs and interests of the mature.At a growth rate of 15 to 25 percent since 1986, Elder-hostel continues to offer older adults education mixedwith excitement. A catalogue of courses abroad is pub-lished three times a year, and the destinations andtypes of courses offered are dazzling. You can travel toAustralia to study gold mining, aboriginal culture, orthe Great Barrier Reef. You can study jungle ecology while in Brazil, Alexander the Great in Greece, marine and environmental science in Bermuda, or French art at the Louvre Museum. Catalogues of courses in the United States and Canada are published four times each year. What fol- lows is an extremely small sample from the Spring 1991 United States/Canada catalogue, but glancing over these course offerings is perhaps the best way to catch the Elderhostel spirit. It has been said that education plus experience equals wisdom. Adding adventure to that equation must equal Elderhostel.

Thefulfillment of that dream lies in education, but pro-grams for refugees have traditionally offered education-al opportunities for youngsters and young and middle-age adults. What of elderly refugees who face both theloss of home and culture and the changes of growingold? Many remain in their homes, caring for the young-er children, becoming more and more isolated, andeventually depending on younger family members fortranslating, problem solving, and surviving. When sucha role reversal takes place, and the wise elder becomes \"the child,\" a new stress is added to a family already handling too many changes.16 The American dream is not a promise, it is opportuni- ty and it is hope. Project LEIF-Learning English Through Intergenerational Friendship-is a program that offers hope to elderly refugees. Founded in 1985 by the Center for Intergenerational Learning at Temple University, LEIF trains college-age volunteers to teach English to older immigrants and refugees. Volunteer training is critical to the success of the program, and that training includes learning about the native cul- tures of the students, acquiring techniques for teaching both literate and nonliterate students, and using oral history, games, humor, and music as bridges for teach- ing reading and writing. The older students often begin their weekly lessons at learning centers, giving them a chance to leave their homes and venture out into the world. Other lessons may take place in the student's home, allowing the young adult teacher to learn more about the life of the elder student. Lessons are practi- cal, focusing on speaking skills that help the refugees make friends with their neighbors and deal with every- day situations. Social events, such as potluck suppers and field trips for tutors, students,. and their families expand the world of the elderly refugee .even more. Dr. Nancy Henkin, Executive Director of the Center for Intergenerational Learning, and Gail Weinstein-Shr, former director of Project LEIF, paint a poignant pic- ture: * * * it is the small successes that give the program real meaning. One elder went to the post office with his tutor, and then tried it by himself for the first time. Another elder now answers the phone with a cheerful \"hello\" rather than picking up the phone in confused silence or not answering at all. Tutors tell hap- pily of the delicious food and warm reception that they are given when they make their weekly visits. One tutor's family gave her stu- dent's family a Christmas tree and the two 16 Gail Weinstein-Shr, \"Family and Intergenerational Literacy in Multi- lingual Families,\" NCLE Q & A, Center for Applied Linguistics, Aug. 1990, pp. 7-12. families decorated it together. The stories goon.17 In the past 5 years, Project LEIF has brought togeth-er over 600 elders and students. The program is defi-nitely a \"win-win\" situation. In the Logan area of Phila-delphia, older refugees from Southeast Asia, China, andLatin America begin to share in the American dreamthrough education. College students learn about a dif-ferent culture through caring and responsible citizen-ship. This mix of youth and age, foreigner and Ameri-can, teacher and student blend together, resulting inthat intangible quality that makes the diversity ofAmerica work. LEARNING-IN-RETIREMENT CENTERS/INSTITUTES \"Learning-in-retirement centers\" and \"institutes\" arelearning centers within a college or university thatoffer programs selected, attended, and often taught byits older adult members. The New School for Social Research in New York es-tablished the first program of this type in 1962, callingit the \"Institute for Retired Professionals.\" The Univer-sity of California at Berkeley followed in 1973, andtoday, there are approximately 100 such learning cen-ters in the United States. The Institute movement iscontinuing to grow at a rapid pace.Milton Stern, Dean, University Extension, Universityof California, Berkeley, sums up the reasons for suchmomentum: As is so frequently the case when, like theFAX machine, something is useful and attrac-tive, it is rapidly snapped up by Americans,and so it is with organizations for Learning inRetirement (LIRs). They are coming along onea week these days on campuses of larger uni-versities, liberal arts colleges, and communitycolleges. Some of them are quite large. All ofthem seem to be characterized by energeticleadership, frequently retired educators or pro-fessionals, who themselves feel the need for in- \" Nancy Z.

It's easy to get sentimental about LIRs, but to my way of thinking, they can be seen, not as organizations for lonely hearts, but for lonely minds, and that, at least, is the way we have looked at them. While I am a supporter of inter-generational education, I also believe firmly that, just as teenagers have their own age group cadres, so older people need a place to call their own, in which they can live up to their potential. Institutes and learning-in-retirement centers may have similar characteristics, but each is unique, reflect- ing the creativity of its membership. DUKE INSTITUTE FOR LEARNING IN RETIREMENT The Duke Institute for Learning in Retire- ment * * * is a year-round educational commu- nity on the Duke campus-a place where men and women, 50 and older, can enjoy daytime courses, good conversation, and the companion- ship of peers in a stimulating and congenial at- mosphere. * * * Members teach classes, lead study circles, serve on the Board and its com- mittees, act as class assistants, help with the recordkeeping, make the coffee, and perform other tasks, large and small. * * * Most classes last 12 weeks and meet once a week for 1 hours * * * DILR teachers are a mixture of peer members, Duke professors, Ph.D. candidates, independent scholars, and community experts * * *. Class participation ranges from researching and presenting papers for study circles to simply enjoying lecture series.'s Members have access to the Duke libraries, swimming pools, language labs, and faculty dining. room. They may audit university courses at 10 percent of the uni- versity course fee and with the permission of the profes- sor, and they may participate in Alumni Travel tours. is Description from the Duke Institute for Learning in Retirement Winter 1991 Handbook, pp. 2-3. A sample of DILR courses includes specialties such asDuke Forest Walks and Lunchtime Language Tablesand courses such as \"The Gift of Laughter,\" \"AmericanArt,\" \"World War II: Its History Who Were There,\" and \"Italian theEasy Way.\" HARVARD INSTITUTE FOR LEARNING IN RETIREMENT The Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirementoffers courses as diverse as \"Fairy Tales,\" How Illness Affects the Arts.\" PLATO SOCIETY The Plato Society (University of California at Los An-geles), -in addition to offering courses, helps with orga-nizing carpools and plans whale watching trips. TheColloquium, a series of biweekly meetings which bringstogether the entire membership of the Society, selectsprestigious lecturers drawn from the resources of theUniversity. Plato Society retreats, held between termsin an off-campus residential setting, provide an intenselearning experience and an opportunity for deepenedacquaintance with several dozen fellow members. ACADEMY OF LIFELONG LEARNING The Academy of Lifelong Learning (University ofDelaware) offers over 100 courses each semester to the1,200 members. All courses are peer-taught. The Acade-my has an outreach program, with about- 160 programsoffered at retirement centers and nursing homes. NORTH CAROLINA CENTER FOR CREATIVE RETIREMENT The North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement(University of North Carolina at Asheville) under thedirection of Dr. Ronald Manheimer has fairly explodedwith programs and services, almost redefining the con-cept of an institute. What is unique about the Center isits dual emphasis on life enrichment and communityservice. The College for Seniors gives adults 55 and over theopportunity to come to the UNCA campus to take liber-al arts courses in a peer-led teaching and learning pro- gram. There are no exams and no grades, and courses are as varied as \"Ceramics-an Artistic Opportunity,\" \"One Hundred Decisive Events in History,' \"Warriors, Kings, Saints, and Scholars--The Greats of Medieval England,\" and \"Understanding South Americans; Their Politics and Their Problems.\" A social support system complements academic studies: brown bag lunches with a UNCA political science professor before a presidential election, trips to art exhibits, dessert and group tickets to a campus play. The Senior Academy for Intergenerational Learning (SAIL) matches retired civic and professional leaders with undergraduate students and UNCA faculty to work together on learning projects. The SAIL \"Senior Fellows\" volunteer their time and share their expertise with the undergraduates. Retired physicians serve as mentors to pre-medical students, university athletes are matched with senior adults who share career interests, and computerwise retirees work with computer science students on projects to benefit UNCA. \"Senior Fellows\" serve as guest lecturers and research consultants at the request of faculty. Though retired, these volunteers continue to contribute to their professions and their community through SAIL. Leadership Asheville Seniors (LAS) are given an in- tensive learning experience that gives them an over- view of the needs of the region. After completing LAS training, these volunteers can choose a volunteer activi- ty that offers them both satisfaction and use of their past experience. The training program for LAS partici- pants is three-fold: political leaders, agency heads, and civic leaders share indepth community information through lectures and problem-solving sessions; LAS par- ticipants take part in activities to improve their leader- ship skills; and they participate in actual case studies concerning agencies or issues and report their findings. Life Journey groups, are outreach humanities pro- grams that offer reading and group discussion led by trained volunteers at various sites, such as churches and community centers, in rural counties in western North Carolina. Subjects have included \"Great Ideas, Ancient and Modern, That Changed the World,\" and \"The Two World Wars, Roaring Twenties, and Great Depression.\" Other humanities programs offered by the Center are those led by paid, trained scholars through a grant from the National Endowment for the Human-ities. Entitled \"The Carolina Special-Railroadsthrough the Carolinas and Beyond as Reflected in Liter-ature and History,\" these programs extend across fourstates-North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, andVirginia. Public libraries become the local cosponsor.The Senior Wellness Program includes a 16-hourcourse, and graduates of the course can become Well-ness Ambassadors, helping with Senior Wellness Day,an* annual spring event cosponsored with a local hospi-tal that is a day-long series of workshops and screen-ings. Two mall-walking programs, again with hospitalcooperation, offer early morning mall programs that ad-dress topics related to fitness. A Retirement Planning Program offers corporationsand individuals retirement seminars. The Research In-stitute studies the economic and social impact of in-migrating retirees in the region as well as other topicsappropriate to the older adult.Perhaps the brochure from the North Carolina Centerfor Creative Retirement entitled \"Discover the Possibili-ties\" says it best: \"The North Carolina Center for Cre-ative Retirement is a laboratory for the state and thenation. The Center's mission is to develop innovativemodel programs in community leadership, volunteer-ism, technology transfer, retirement planning, peerlearning and teaching, health promotion, product as-sessment * * * in short, the broad spectrum of opportu-nities and issues that help enrich the lives of retire-ment-age people and, in fact, benefit Americans of allgenerations.\" ORGANIZATIONS Francis Meyers, President ALIROW, 1607 AngelusAvenue, Los Angeles, CA 90026.Ronald Manheimer, Director, Center for Creative Re-tirement, University of North Carolina at Asheville,Asheville, NC 28804-3299.

POETRY PROGRAM St. Francis House Adult Day Health Care, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, 4735 Perkins Road, Baton Rouge, Lou- isiana 70808 (She) even began to carry a folder of her poetry, informing us that her grandchildren. were very excited to hear the poems that she had been writing each week. * * * (She) spent a weekend composing, on her own, several poems and a short story about Halloween which were read at the * * * Halloween party.\"19 This description of a creative woman belies the pic- ture most of us hold of an elderly woman suffering from short-term memory loss and depression. But Dr. Fredda Blanchard-Fields believes in the power of the frail el- derly: \"The goal of each of the projects we develop is to assume that, (regardless) of the severity of the demen- tia, there is always something left.\" If caregivers under- estimate a .client's competency and treat him or her ac- cordingly, an elderly person may feel and act even more helpless. Although some impairments are due to dis- ease, others may be due to lack of motivation or lack of encouraging surroundings. Dr. Blanchard-Fields directs the development of poetry and art programs at the St. Francis House Adult Day Health Care. The adults at St. Francis range from physically disabled, alert adults to adults with mild to severe dementia. Programs focus on developing an indi- vidual's potential (what a person can still do) and on in- creasing the individual's feeling of control. Shannon Triche, an undergraduate psychology major, developed and implemented the poetry program under Dr. Blanchard-Fields' direction.20 The purpose of the poetry program is simply to make poetry writing possi- ble, relying on the poet's own experience and inspira- tion. Poetry is explained as a pure expression of feel- ings. Rhyming is not necessary,. and, in almost all cases, clients dictate their poems. This not only removes pres- sure for those with limited education or poor memories but also allows time for encouragement and help with 19 Description provided by Fredda Blanchard-Fields, Associate Professor of Psychology, Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University.4 20 O program is based on the methods and ideas from a book by Ken- neth Koch, I Never Told Anybody (Random House, New York, 1977). the writing process, giving clients confidence in them-selves and their ability to write poetry. The poets rangein age from 20 years to 93, with the average age being70. Classes are held weekly, and beverages are served.Poets are never forced to share their poetry with others;writing is for the pleasure of self-expression. The over-whelmingly positive feedback from coordinators andother client-poets encourages writers to allow theirpoems to be shared. The following quotes are taken di-rectly from program descriptions.Class One: Childhood Memories. \"We asked clients tofirst think about the place they were born. Then tothink about what they remembered most about thatplace; what kind of house they lived in; * * * etc. Thisfirst poem was more of a narrative than a poem, but wefelt that it was important to simply get something onpaper so that the clients could immediately see results.There was much reminiscing and clients were encour-aged by the positive feedback from the other membersof the group when the poem was read aloud.\"Class Two: Colors. 'For the poems about colors, wesuggested that the clients think about their favoritecolor. Then think about what that color reminded themof: a place, a feeling, a season, etc. * * * in some cases, itwas difficult to keep the clients focused on the subject.\"Class Three: Quiet. \"For the class on 'quiet,' weprompted the clients to write about the quietest thingsor times they could think of * * *. Less prompting wasrequired this time, and the clients seemed more focused. Class Four: Music. \"For the 'music' poems, we playeda cassette tape of Harry Connick, Jr., a New Orleansmusician. We requested that the clients listen to themusic for a few moments, and then write about how themusic made them feel, or what it reminded them of. Itwas during this class that some of the clients began toinject humor into their poems. * * * Class Five: I, the Ocean. \"For class # 5, we tried some-thing a little different. We played an album of oceansounds * * * and explained that, for this poem, wewould be writing as though we * * * were the ocean. After five classes, clients feel comfortable enoughwith writing to enjoy more flexibility. They begin tocome up with ideas of their own. Frail elders, initially shy and withdrawn, now delight in hearing their poems read aloud to the entire day care center, enjoying thepositive, complimentary feedback. Some even take it upon themselves to encourage nonparticipants to try at least one class. The poem that follows is a result of the poetry class, although the goal was the process rather than the product: GRANDFATHER It is a peaceful evening. The dinner bell rings. I'm walking along the hall, and I see Grandmother. She tells me to stay upstairs with Grandfather While the rest of the family eats. Grandmother doesn't want him to be alone. I am very happy. I enter the room. He asks for his hairbrush in his usually demanding way. Laughing on my way to his dressing room, I tell him, \"Your hair looks fine.\" He has such beautiful white hair. I brush his hair, and as I turn to replace the brush, he demands, \"I told you to brush my hair.\" I look at him and watch as he slumps in the chair. I place my hand on his forehead,And I realize sub-consciously, he is dead. I call downstairs. The family rushes to the bedroom. As my uncle places him gently in the bed, I suddenly realize How inadequate we all are. SENIORNET 399 Arguello Boulevard, San Francisco, California 94118, (415) 750- 5030 According to President Bush, broccoli may be out but computers are in. The April 25, 1991, edition of The Washington Post reports that President Bush is learn- ing how to use a computer and that Mrs. Bush is al- ready computer literate and travels with a laptop. The Bushes are part of a movement that Mary Fur- long set into motion in 1986 when she started teaching computer skills to older adults as a research project. Today's older Americans want to be computer literate, and Mary Furlong's research project has evolved into SeniorNet, a nonprofit organization21 that consists of 41 SeniorNet learning centers where classes in word proc- essing, database management, spreadsheets, and tele- communications are taught. Over 12,000 members (in- cluding independent members who are not near learn- ing centers and who use their own computers and modems) have gained computer knowledge through Sen- iorNet, and many are linked together by a national on- line computer network that enables them to communi- cate with one another. SeniorNet works with local sponsors to organize learning centers where older adults can learn about using computers and meet other people with similar in- terests. The learning centers are run by volunteers, sen- iors who have computer skills and are willing to share them. Francisca Middleton, in a speech presented at an AARP Conference on Resourceful Aging in 1990, stated an overlooked benefit of the program: \"We feel that we are breaking down stereotypes about older adults andtheir involvement, or lack of involvement, with technol- ogy. First of all, there are seniors out there who do have these skills. Secondly, and probably the most startling of all to many people, there is a real hunger among sen- iors for learning about this new technology that came about long after they were in school, and even after many of us retired from the business world. Every one of our sites has a long waiting list of people eager for classes.\" As demographics in America change, old patterns break down and new patterns emerge. Learning aboutcomputers represents more to older Americans than spreadsheets and databases. Ms. Middleton describes the SeniorNet computer network as an \"un-geographic community' where people hold private conversations, make public statements, and participate in forums, just like in any other. community. Lifelong learning may be most evident as Americans, through the modem and the mouse, use modern day technology from childhood to old age to learn and to 21 The Markle Foundation has provided initial and ongoing core support for this nonprofit organization. have fun and to communicate. Could computer-ese be our new intergenerational language? SHEPHERD'S CENTERS OF AMERICA 6700 Troost, Suite 616, Kansas City, Missouri 64131, (816) 523-1080 Dr. Lydia Bronte has described the \"new\" old age as a time for growing \"out\" as well as growing up, and the elders who attend Shepherd's Centers certainly exem- plify this attitude toward aging. These participants are not passive recipients. They welcome responsibility for themselves and for others. They socialize so they won't be lonely, they learn so they won't be left behind, and they reach out to other elders who need their help. They know that they are the first generation of elders in the United States to have enough power to make changes that will influence the next century. Thus, the goal of Shepherd's Centers is to help older adults devel- op leadership skills and extend their independence in order to better serve themselves and others. The original Shepherd's Center began in 1972 with six volunteers and seven participants. Today, there are 95 Shepherd's Centers in 25 States, making up a net- work of 15,000 volunteers serving 175,000 older adults. Empowering older adults to help themselves and to help others is a concept that obviously works well. All Shepherd's Centers are founded on principal char- acteristics: 1. Older people are seen as a potential resource rather than as a social problem. 2. Responsibility for their lives and the develop- ment of programs for their peers and community is vested in older adults themselves. 3. The center acts as a voluntary watchful pres- ence in the community, showing concern about all older people. 4. Financial support comes from the private sector, especially from congregations, businesses and foundations-but not from government. Partici- pants themselves contribute from 30 to 60 percent of the cost of operating a center. 5. A Shepherd's Center is cost-effective; it uses church and synagogue space for its offices and de- livery of programs, and is staffed by peer volun-teers.22 Adventures in Learning is the educational aspect ofevery Shepherd's Center. Older adults are both teachersand students, planners and participants. Classes areusually once a week. There are few rules regarding class attendance and participation, and there are notests, no grades, and no academic credits. Classes, areusually held during the day and are organized on anacademic semester or quarterly basis. Fees are easily af-fordable, ranging from free to $15.00 for a full quarter of classes. Adventures in Learning is usually held in abuilding that is underutilized during the week. Muchthought is given to the convenience of the location, thebuilding, and the willingness of the institution to pro-vide services. A \"Noon Forum\" is offered in many cen-ters as a time when all students, teachers, and volun-teers come together to share a meal and friendship. Dr. Elizabeth Welch gives a good description of theprogram at the Shepherd's Center of Greater Winston-Salem, North Carolina: We in the Winston-Salem Shepherd's Center offer nine classes during the day to meet indi- vidual interests and needs. The variety of choices encompasses the humanities: religion,art, music, dance, hobbies, and.creative writing. Health in its many aspects, caregiving, sub- stance abuse, small group discussions, and envi-ronmental stewardship classes are also popular. Consumer education, financial planning, legal \"know-how\", Social Security, insurance, andlocal, state, and federal legislation are fre-quently offered. Other well-attended classes in- clude travel, genealogy, local history, current affairs, and second careers. Outstanding com-munity leaders teach these courses as a com-munity service for the twice-a-year, eight-week sessions of the Adventures in Learning experi- ence. Beyond the individual classes, however, is theunique binding element in the Adventures in 22 Meeting the Challenge and Qpportunity of an Aging Society, preparedby the Shepherd's Centers of America. Learning, a session called the Core Class. We offer this component when no other classes are scheduled, before the fellowship lunch so that all of the registered participants can attend to- gether. The purpose of the Core Class is always to. prepare us for our responsibilities and re- sponsiveness as citizens who, for the next centu- ry, will be the major makers of decisions and formulators of policies for ourselves and our country. We will determine the quality of life of our society and how it affects not only our own lives now, but the lives of generations yet to come. It is an awesome challenge, and one for which we, the older majority, must become better prepared and motivated.23 Dr. Welch considers today's older Americans \"people of destiny.\" \"For this role of leadership in the making we shall need all the knowledge and wisdom from our accumulated experiences. The Shepherd's Center con- cept with its Adventures in Learning opportunities for motivation and education become the critical answer to the demands of this time. * * * As informed citizens, we will be motivated to become actively involved in service to our world. And in doing so, we will be personally moving closer toward that goal of becoming what each one is potentially capable of being. \"24 THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 3444 South, 14th and Inde-pendence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20250-0900, (202)720-2920 The 1986 National Invitational Conference on Rural Adult Postsecondary Education gives an excellent de- scription of the difficulties faced by rural adult learn- ers: \"Rural adults report many of the same problems in continuing their education as those reported in the adult learner literature. But the common barriers of in- convenient class scheduling, family responsibilities, and time constraints were augmented by the rural problems 28 Elizabeth Welch, New Roles in a New Age. 24TJbd. of long commutes, poor road systems, bad weather, and geographic isolation.\" 25 Rural adults are able to overcome some of these diffi-culties in finding appropriate learning sources throughthe services of the Cooperative Extension Service. The Cooperative Extension Service was established by Con- gress in 1914 as an informal educational organization. It combines the services of the U.S. Department of Agri-culture (USDA), county governments, and State land-grant colleges and universities (colleges and universities authorized by Congress through the land-grant acts of 1862 and 1890). University and USDA specialists and research scien-tists develop programs for the public that are passed onto Extension staffs in more than 3,000 counties through-out the country. There is feedback between these staffsand those who develop the programs so that practical educational programs meet specific local needs. Farmers can learn about agricultural weather, markets, pest control, crops and soils, livestock and poultry, farm ma- chines and buildings, farm safety, and safe use of pesti- cides. Technical help is provided on how to manage nat-ural resources, such as wildlife, fish, and forests. Other types of information are distributed to rural families who learn how to manage financial resources, how to conserve energy, how to provide good nutrition to their families, and how to develop effective parenting skills. The Extension Service relies heavily on volunteers, and there are over a million Extension homemakers and other volunteers who assist with the teaching. Edu- cational information is presented through public meet- ings, demonstration projects, tours, personal visits, tele- phone calls, direct mailings, publications, computers, and mass media. Listed below are a few of the programs that the Coop-erative Extension Service targeted specifically toward the older population: 26 ARIZONA continues to provide educational resources and workshops for older persons. \"Analyzing Long-Term 25 \"The Learners: From Barriers to Affirmations,\" Proceedings 1986, Na-tional Invitational Conference on Rural Adult Postsecondary Education, p. 9. 26 Descriptions for Arizona, Nevada, and West Virginia are provided byJeanne M. Priester, Extension Service, USDA, submitted December 1990,for the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging Report. Care Insurance\" is a comprehensive educational pro- gram for use by volunteers .or professionals to teach older people how to analyze a policy and to aid in select- ing long-term care insurance. Another teaching guide addresses critical legal issues such as \"Durable Power ofAttorney, Living Wills and Medical Power of Attorney.\"In NEVADA, 200 older adults increased their abilityto live independently in later years. At the workshop, they shared many ideas actually in use to make iteasier and safer to live in one's own home despite tem-porary or permanent disabilities. One hundred andtwenty older women participated in workshops onmodel programs to increase independence for rural elders and 42 newly widowed persons reported theywere helped to deal with new responsibilities by a mail-out series \"Newly Alone in Later Years.\" Two emerging issues which new programs will address are (1) late lifeplanning (including living wills and addenda, funerals and alternative arrangements) and the importance ofcommunicating these plans to family members and (2) recognition of the role of friends and neighbors as care- givers. WEST VIRGINIA has received a grant from a private foundation to develop a model that can be replicated by Extension agents throughout the country. \"Preventi- care\" is an educational health promotion program for older people. The 20-year-old Preventicare program has been run by a private foundation and has been avail- able only in West Virginia. Through it, participants have adopted lifestyles that promote their health and physical well-being and their quality of life by main- taining mobility, health, vitality and independence. The donor desires to institutionalize \"Preventicare\" and to make it available nationwide. This challenge has been accepted by West Virginia Extension. The Texas Agricultural Extension Service has devel- oped a program to train older minorities to teach their peers at the nutrition sites where they gather. Exten- sion agents work with the Nutrition Site Manager, and together they train older minority representatives to reach their peers throxgh videotapes. True-to-life epi- sodes show minority families. working out problems, such as high blood pressure or late onset diabetes (aimed at the black elderly) and being overweight as a risk for high blood pressure or depression following widowhood (developed for Hispanic elderly and recorded in Span- ish). The minority peer educator leads a discussion fol-lowing the videotape. Key points are reinforced as the group participates in the discussion and becomes active- Iy involved in seeking solutions to the important health,nutrition and mental health problems shown in the vid-eotapes.27 HUMANITIES PROGRAMS Dr. David Shuldiner, Humanist-in-Residence for the Connecticut Department on Aging, defines humanities programs as educational.programs that explore and in-,erpret the human experience. Whether the subject studied is history, literature, phi- losophy, folklore, contemporary social issues, or studies of music and the arts, Shuldiner believes that good hu-manities programs are those that involve participants in both lively discussions and reminiscences that canadd information to the subject being discussed. Humanities programs are indeed learning programsbut this act of learning often involves movies, trips to a museum, a visit to a local historical society, the creation of a play recreating the lives of local residents usingtheir own words, mounting an exhibit using photo-graphs and memorabilia, or sewing an historical quilt. A few humanities programs are listed below, each one different, each one valuable: NEW JERSEY COMMITTEE FOR THE HUMANITIES The New Jersey Committee for the Humanities has created several landmark humanities projects. A panel of literature scholars developed book discussion pro-grams for use at retirement communities, senior cen-ters, and libraries that serve the elderly. A panel of mu- sicologists developed a music history program for non-readers. A large-print poetry series was produced for those with eye problems. A project called \"People and Stories\" is aimed toward both English and Spanish- speaking seniors. The program is updated each year to appeal to new audiences.28 27 Minority Peer Educator Project, Texas Agricultural Extension Service.28 Esther Mackintosh, Humanities Programming for Older Adults, p.10. CHEMETKA COMMUNITY COLLEGE College for Older Adults, P.O. Box 14007, Salem, Oregon 97309, (503) 399-5139 Chemetka \"Writing Your Life Story\" and \"Oral History\" classes for older adults. Getting a perspective on a lifetime through classes such as these serves as a valuable learning expe- rience for people as they age. It not only seems to give a meaning to life's ups and downs, but also helps the writer see directions for future growth. The classes are scheduled off-campus at senior centers, nursing homes and other sites. The focus of the writing classes is on \"getting the story out\" rather than on learning grammar or improv- ing style. Positive feedback is important to the writers, and group leaders encourage classmates to listen non- judgmentally as each writer shares a story. For oral history classes, the technique is different. Interviewers record individual life stories that are tran- scribed and read back to students for comments and changes. These stories may also be shared within a group. There is historical significance to these particular types of humanities classes. At Chemetka, the life histo- ries and life stories are often typed by local high school students and sometimes bound or even printed by a local press. Collections of stories written by students have been published by the college. A text by life story instructors, \"Deep Down Things: A Guide for Writing Your Life Story\" is available from Chemetka Community College for $5.00. SENIOR MULTI-PURPOSE CENTER Community Services Building, 6 Gauntt Place, Flemington, New Jersey 08822, (201) 788-1359 The following letter from Eileen Hodge, Supervisor of the Center's senior citizen activities, tells how a human- ities program was born: \"When I became Supervisor of Senior Citizen Activi- ties here in Hunterdon County almost five years ago there was a great deal of instruction and programming around crafts. Senior citizens could receive instruction and supervised practice in upholstering, lampshademak- ing, needlework, cake decorating, etc. All of* this was done by volunteers. On a more formal level, there werelessons in painting with oils and watercolors and. doingwhatever one does with pastels. \"Believing that we offered very little intellectual stimulation, I set about trying to remedy that situation. The Center had received one grant from the Endow- ment for the Humanities to cover a five part literature/ discussion series. Presenters were professors and in-structors from various colleges and universities aroundthe state. The books were provided to participants freeof charge-also covered by the grant. Presenters werepaid $150 per presentation. The grant was applied forjointly by the Parks and Recreation Department andthe Senior Multi-Purpose Center-both county agencies.\"When I tried to get a similar grant the next year Iwas told that we were no longer eligible-that it wasmeant to be seed money and if we wanted to continuethe program we should use local resources. And so ourrelationship with our community college was born. A few isolated lectures/discussions by one very willingEnglish instructor led to a more ambitious undertaking modeled on a program the college was doing in conjunc-tion with the Somerset County Library. (Our collegeserves both Somerset and Hunterdon Counties.) ElderQuest was planned by a joint committee of seniors andthe Community Outreach Director from the college andmyself. Many speakers were chosen from the college'sspeakers bureau. Others were from local agencies andinstitutions. All were volunteers. \"The outcome was wonderful. The library began ex-panding its programming to address senior concernswhere formerly it had concentrated on juvenile pro-gramming. Last spring a series of lecture/discussions was sponsored jointly by the library and the SeniorMulti-Purpose Center, but funded by the library. It wascalled 'Portraits of Aging in Art & Literature' and thelectures were presented by an Art History Professor from Rider College and a Humanities Professor fromTrenton State. The program was so well-received that alocal nursing home replicated the art parts for their cli-entele and opened it to the general public.\"The Parks Department has begun serious efforts to(create programs) for the senior population and also toprovide supplementary transportation to events spon- sored by others. Because we are a rural county, trans- portation is a major issue for senior non-drivers, who can easily become socially isolated. The park has spon- sored workshops on story-telling, sugaring, birding, etc., and musical events. We also. call on their personnel to present programs on natural science right here at ourcenter. \"Rutgers Cooperative Extension has been very helpful in cooperative programming providing retirement semi-nars, fitness seminars, speakers on horticulture, home economics and such. The Office on Aging and Coopera- tive Extension have jointly planned and executed a few formal programs, e.g., a multi-part Caregivers' Informa- tion Series for those caring for frail and ill elderly pa- tients in the home. Also a seminar on Choosing a Nurs- ing Home and a three part Pre-Retirement Seminar. We often call on Extension personnel for individual presentations such as 'Cooking for the Heart Patient' and 'Container Gardening.' \"There are some great mini-course outlines published by AARP and requiring an appropriately qualified person from the center or a volunteer from the commu- nity to lead them. Materials are dirt cheap. 'We also call on the Historical Society, Foundations, Interest Groups, Schools, Colleges, Religious Congrega- tions, Government bureaus, all possible community sources of educational programming. People are wonder- ful about donating their services and some are just waiting to be asked. ***\" ORGANIZATIONS AND RESOURCES Many organizations could be of great help to those in- terested in humanities programs for older adults. Esther Mackintosh has compiled \"Humanities Program- ming for Older Adults\" for the Federation of State Hu- manities Councils. It is an excellent resource as an over- view of humanities programming. The following list of organizations is reprinted from that publication with permission: The mission of the National Council on the Aging is to serve professionals who serve older adults, with senior centers as their core constituency. The organiza- tion provides training, research, information and techni- cal assistance to those working in this field. In 1976, with a grant from the National Endowment for the Hu- manities, NCOA developed the first of a series of large- print anthologies, called collectively \"Self-Discovery Through the Humanities,\" to be used in reading anddiscussion groups for older adults. There are now six-teen volumes available, focusing on such themes as\"The Search for Meaning,\" \"Words and Past: 1914- 1945.\" Each volume consists of fiction, essays, and illus-trations, divided into sections appropriate for individualdiscussion sessions. The books can be purchased from NCOA along with discussion leaders' guides, tapes, andpublicity posters.

Al-though available to all ages, they serve the older adult'sneeds quite well. The General Educational Development Tests (GED), the External Diploma Program (EDP), andEnglish as a Second Language (ESL) will be highlighted below, along with examples of how Lane Community. College in Oregon and the Texas Senior Citizen Centerhave put some of these programs into place. GENERAL EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT TESTS American Council on Education, One Dupont Circle, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, (202) 939-9490 The GED Tests (Tests of General Educational Devel- opment) were developed by the American Council onEducation in 1942 for returning World War II service- men. The Tests give adults who did not graduate fromhigh school a chance to get a high school equivalency diploma, making them qualified for college enrollment,training programs, and job advancement. For some, the reward is the satisfaction of attaining a lifelong goal. The tests, which last 7 hours and 35 minutes, are given in five areas-writing skills, social studies, science, liter-ature and the arts, and mathematics. Candidates mustwrite an essay as part of the Writing Skills Test. How-ever, the focus of GED Tests is not on facts and defini- 29Ibid., pp. 15-17. 30 Ibi. tions, but rather on knowledge and skills gained from experiences and information learned during a lifetime. More than 24,000 adults over the age of 50 took the GED Tests in 1990. Of these, approximately 25 percent said they planned to attend a community or junior col- lege, while another 25 percent planned to continue studying on their own. Fewer than 10 percent reported no further study plans. Persons may prepare for the tests by reading self- study books, by watching programs on public television stations and cable channels, or by participating in class- es offered in most communities. Approximately 90 per- cent of older adults studied to prepare for the, tests,with more than half taking a formal class and 10 per- cent studying on their own. THE EXTERNAL DIPLOMA PROGRAM The Center for Adult Learning and Educational Credentials, Amer- ican Council on Education, One Dupont Circle, N.W., Washing- ton, D.C. 20036, (202) 939-9475 The External Diploma Program (EDP) allows mature adults to receive high school diplomas through a two- phase process. First, the adult's basic skills (reading, writing, mathematics, and entry level job skills) are evaluated, usually by a counselor on a one-to-one basis. The counselor advises the participant on the strengths and weaknesses of the skills and offers a list of estab- lished community resources that can be used for im- provement. After a course of self-education, the adult returns to the EDP office for retesting. In phase two of the program, the adult learner dem- onstrates competencies by undertaking tasks that are as practical as they are revealing. A student might be asked to \"find\" a house in a new community. This simu- lated task would involve the ability to interpret a lease, evaluate expenses and income, write letters of inquiry or complaint, use maps, etc. Each adult also receives credit for one individual life achievement, usually a vo- cation. After all the competencies are demonstrated with 100 percent mastery, there is a review by an as- sessment specialist, and a high school diploma is then awarded through a local school board. The EDP allows the adult learner to be in charge of his own learning process. Other features that would appeal to the mature adult would be the flexibility intime and location, the credit given for workplace andlife achievements, and the continuous feedback that isgiven to program participants. ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE TESOL, Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages, Inc.,1600 Cameron Street, Suite 300, Alexandria, Virginia 22314, (703)836-0774 English as a Second Language (ESL) is an educationalprogram that enables non-English speaking people tospeak, read, and write English at a survival level. ESLinstruction is divided into four skill level classes toserve students with very different educational back- grounds. The skill levels are classified as beginning,low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and advanced. In-structors work with the students not only on languageimprovement but cultural orientation as well. TESOL (Teachers of English to Speakers of OtherLanguages, Inc.) is a membership association thatserves as a clearinghouse for those who want to knowwhere to take ESL classes and for those who want to betrained as tutors and teachers of non-native speakers. LANE .COMMUNITY COLLEGE 1059 Willamette Street, Eugene, Oregon 97401-3171,.(503) 726-2252 Lane Community College in Eugene, Oregon, in addi-tion to offering educational programs throughout its col-lege system, has a tremendous number of pre-collegelevel alternative programs for adults. The Adult Basic Education (ABE) program teachesbasic skills and the application of those skills in dailylife. Reading, writing, and arithmetic at beginning andintermediate levels are stressed. Literacy programs andAdult Basic Education for Students With Special Needsare also available. As students progress, they can go onto GED preparation programs or the Adult High SchoolDiploma program. The Adult High School (AHS) has two options: (1) aclassroom-based program, a traditional system of class-es, instructional activities, and assignments, and (2) theLife Experience Assessment Program (LEAP) thatawards credits based on previous secondary educationand proven. skills and knowledge. A flexible program plan allows for completion of remaining credits. Stu- dents may combine life experience credits, directed study, and course work taken through Adult High School or college credit classes to complete their diplo- ma requirements. English as a Second Language (ESL) classes are of- fered both during the day and in the evening. Each stu- dent takes an English language skill test and is placed in the appropriate class. Volunteer tutors assist stu- dents with both language skills and cultural orienta- tion. TExAs SENIOR CITIZEN CENTER The Texas Senior Citizen Center Literacy Survey (June 30, 1990) indicates that 1,500 seniors participated in literacy programs developed at 105 senior center lit- eracy sites. Over 1,000 teachers, tutors, and volunteers used one-to-one and classroom teaching methods to teach English as a Second Language, citizenship train- ing, and reading improvement. Factors for the success of the program included the availability of transportation, classes held during morn- ing hours, familiar peer settings in senior centers and nutrition sites (56 out of the 105 sites), and the financial help of the Meadows Foundation. The Survey adds: \"In some areas of the state, senior citizens have lived in Texas most of their lives but never learned English well enough to take the required citizenship tests. Reading improvement has helped in- crease self-confidence to the point that some long-time legal aliens have sought to become United States citi- zens.\" LAFARGE LIFELONG LEARNING INSTITUTE 1501 South Layton Boulevard, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53215, (414) 383-2550 John LaFarge was a Jesuit Priest who believed that \"all men and women, no matter what their background, physical limitations, or age should have the opportunity to improve.\" 31 So when the School Sisters of St. Fran- cis started a small program in 1967 where retired mem- 31 \"History of LaFarge Lifelong Learning Institute,\" LaFarge Lifelong Learning Institute. 59-854 -92 -3 bers of their order could continue to learn and to grow,they chose the name LaFarge Lifelong Learning Pro-gram. Incorporated in 1969 as a nonprofit, nondenomi-national learning institution, the LaFarge LifelongLearning Institute offers men and women, age 50 andover and physically disadvantaged adults of any age,tw 12-week terms of classes, with over 125 courses eachterm. During the 1990 spring and fall terms, over 2,500people attended courses taught by 145 qualified instruc-tors, all volunteers. John LaFarge truly believed that old age was a pre-cious gift, not a disaster. This philosophy translates intoan intangible quality called the LaFarge spirit. \"Someof the least desirable aspects of aging are eliminated,put to a halt, shelved in the LaFarge atmosphere-thefeeling of diminishing personal worth, the growing lackof confidence, the experience of loneliness, and less op-portunity for socializing and sharing.32 In the LaFarge atmosphere, older students are seenas \"chronologically gifted.\" Maturity has given them arichness of experiences that translates into wisdom. Inthe LaFarge atmosphere, wisdom combined with educa-tion is treasured and encouraged. Each spring and fall, over 2,500 \"chronologicallygifted\" men and women take up the study of French,Polish, World Religions, Current Affairs, Chinese Cook-ing and 120 other subjects. They learn, they grow, theyimprove. In 1987, the LaFarge Lifelong Learning Insti-tute became the recipient of the first American Associa-tion of Retired Persons Institute of Lifetime LearningAward. SENIOR CENTERS The National Institute of Senior Centers reports thatover 8 million older adults participate in approximately9,000 senior centers throughout the United States.Learning activities can be a vital component of thesecenters, and the type of learning available will reflectthe personality of both leaders and participants. \"TheTalk Show\" at the Siouxland Senior Center represents acreative educational program that serves under 75people even though the Center serves about 60,000 3 2 Ibd people; the description of programs at the Iowa City/ Johnson County Senior Center demonstrates a variety of programs offered to the 75,000 people the Center serves. Whether large or small, a senior center becomes \"a visible symbol of the community's concern about its older residents.\" *3 THE TALK SHOW Siouxland Senior Center, 217 Pierce Street, P.O. Box 806, Sioux City, Iowa 51102, (712) 255-1729 The Talk Show is a weekly gathering of seniors at the Siouxland Senior Center in Sioux City, Iowa. The pro- gram is a free-wheeling program that provides plenty of opportunities for Seniors to meet newsmakers, discuss current events, or possibly talk to a doctor or lawyer. The Talk Show has been a cornerstone program of the Siouxland Senior Center ever since its inception in the early 1970's. The founder of the program was the first Director of the Senior Center, Beulah Webb. Ms. Webb reports the program started because she became tired of people gossiping about each other at the Center. Consequently, she asked them to come with current events the next week-they did and that was the begin- ning. The program has evolved over the years to its current format. Each week from 10:30 a.m. to 12 noon, an aver- age of 65 seniors meet to hear about a selected topic and to discuss it. The purpose of the program continues to be to inform seniors about issues or subjects of inter- est and to offer them the opportunity to discuss their opinions. IOWA CInY/JOHNSON COUNTY SENIOR CENTER 28 South Linn Street, Iowa City, Iowa 52240, (319) 356-5220 The Iowa City/Johnson County Senior Center served about 75,000 people during 1991. The Center offers a tremendous number of educational courses in the ap- plied arts (watercolors, oils, and ceramics), in the per- forming arts (chorus and reader's theater), in art appre- ciation (guest musicians, monthly art exhibits and dis- cussions, dance performances and theater previews), in 3 What is a Multipurpose Senior Center?

How could we when we have folks here in their 70's and 80's?\" F. Peter Libassi, Senior Vice Presi- dent, The Travelers. INTRODUCTION Two trends, chugging along like locomotives, are on a collision course, and the U.S. business community is caught in the middle: the American work force is shrinking and the population that it will need to draw from is growing older. How America will handle this future collision and still remain competitive in the world market will be through adaptability of both work- ers and employers and through lifelong learning. Business executives like Frank P. Doyle, Senior Vice President, General Electric Company, promote adapta- bility and lifelong learning; business organizations like the Committee for Economic Development research these theories; and, everyday folks in ABLE programs from Arkansas to New York just put the ideas into practice. To understand the problem, you have to understand the significance of the \"baby boomers,\" those 77-million- plus people born during an 18-year period after World War 11 (1946-64). The baby boomers caused an increase in our population that has been described by demogra- phers as looking like \"a pig in a python\" 3 on popula- tion charts. As baby boomers begin to retire, the work force that follows them will be much smaller. That means there will be fewer people in our work force to produce goods and services for the country, to provide funds for government programs, and to take care of the young and the.old. 34 Huey B. Long, \"Educational Gerontology: Trendi and Developments in 2000-2010,\" Educational Gerontology, 1990, Vol. 16, p. 318. (59) THE CHALLENGE, ACCORDING TO DOYLE Frank Doyle, in a speech to the Children's Bill ofRights Conference held by the New Hampshire Alliancefor Children and Youth, puts the problem in real fig-ures: \"Current trends predict an increasing shortage ofavailable workers; it has even been predicted that bythe year 2010, the job supply shortage may reach ashigh as 23 million jobs found wanting for lack of avail-able and qualified candidates.\" 35 Problems, to men like Frank Doyle, require solutions,and he promotes the adaptability of both employee andemployer and the use of education \"virtually fromcradle if not quite to grave:\" 36 America's historic economic power, I believe,has been based on our people power. We have aflexible, adaptable, even agile economy; we area society of motivated, mobile and talentedpeople. American workers like to change occu-pations, employers and jobs; they do so moreeasily and more effectively and more frequentlythan any other workers in the world; they do soin part because they have the basic skills thatmake them adaptable. The adaptability of ourpeople may be the nation's most formidableeconomic strength. * * * Adaptability assumesa certain threshold of skills, underpinned bythe fundamental ability to learn. When schoolsfail to foster the ability to learn, they defeatthe possibility of lifelong learning.37 The lifeblood of adaptability is lifelong learning.Young children need to be made ready for school,schools then need to cultivate and nourish the ability tolearn, and public policies and corporate programs needto equip people for jobs instead of supplying jobs forpeople. Doyle believes that successful businesses of the 1990'swill be those that adapt to developing the potential ofpeople in the workplace and those that place high value 3s Frank P. Doyle, \"Compassion and Competitiveness: Investing inAmerica's Children,\" New Hampshire Alliance for Children and Youth,Children's Bill of Rights Conference, Nashua, New Hampshire, Nov. 28,1990, p. 3. 36 Ibid., p. 2.37Ibid., p. 6. on workers' skills and flexibility. Companies will need to create attractive work practices and training pro- grams, possibly bringing back early retirees to work in training centers. Retirement age will be raised, and flexible retirement programs will be offered in order to retain skilled workers: Those firms that invest in human resources with the greatest speed and creativity will gain. The successful companies of the 1990s will invest as aggressively in human resources to achieve higher productivity,, as the successful companies of the 1980s invested in cost-cutting and product and process technology.38 According to Doyle, business will pick up more and more of the expense of lifelong learning, and a deficit- constrained government will pick up less. The corporate world will realize that it is the direct beneficiary of training investment, and it will see education and train- ing, not as philanthropy or corporate responsibility, but as productivity and profitability through the competi- tive edge of a trained, flexible labor force. Doyle says. the $20 billion a year for in-house education and train- ing that corporate America pays now is \"only a drizzle before the deluge.\" 3 The most successful companies of all will be those that elevate their level of creativity, and commitment to human resource issues before it is necessary, just as companies that anticipated the need to restructure and globalize thrived during the 1980s. Companies that do not change before they must will be defeated by their competitors who do. * * * The winners will be those companies and those governments who welcome people-power, and do not resist it as a challenge to their own.40 38 Frank P. Doyle, \"People-Power: The Global Human Resource Chal- lenge for the '90s,\" The Columbia Journal of World Business, Volume XXV, Numbers 1 & 2, Spring/Summer 1990, p. 38. 3 9Ibid., p. 43.40Ibid., p. 45. THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Business organizations delve even deeper into theproblem of keeping the American business communityinternationally competitive in the face of these prob-lems. The Committee for Economic Development (CED)is a private, nonprofit, and nonpartisan research andeducation organization composed of 250 top business ex-ecutives and presidents of major universities. Their goalis to study and find solutions to social and economicissues that affect America's future economic health.Hot off the press from the CED is a new study calledAn America That Works: The Life-Cycle Approach to aCompetitive Work Force. The CED study concisely statesthe problem, the challenge, and the solution: THE PROBLEM/CHALLENGE \"America has entered an era of fewer entrants intothe work force and an aging population. * * * The chal-lenge for business and public policy makers will be todevelop qualified workers to fill the increasing numbersof knowledge and technology-driven jobs. Without aneducated, able citizenry, America will suffer lowerliving standards, with far too many of its people shutout from the opportunities our economy and society willhave to offer.\" 41 THE SOLUTION \"The ability to make the best use of human resourcesis now a strong competitive edge for both countries andcompanies. In the new world of fewer workers andhigher-value jobs, the advantage will go to those nationsand businesses that invest in their people, recognize.andremedy underutilized potential, and produce an educat-ed and an adaptable population.\" 42 CONCERNING LIFELONG LEARNING \"Achieving this competitive advantage will requirenew approaches to education and the management ofhuman resources that emphasize learning, flexibility, 41 An America That Works: The Life-Cycle Approach to a CompetitiveWork Force, Executive Summary, p. 1.42Ibid, pp. 1-2. and productive participation in work and society throughout the entire life of an individual.\" 4 In the past, we have approached problems by artifi- cially grouping them into categories, such as by age group or subject matter. The CED proposes a more nat- ural means of solving our problems, a plan called the life-cycle approach that \"links each stage of life and work to the next. * * * Youths will one day be adults, and adults will grow old.\" *4 They suggest that public and private policies \"help children reach school healthy and ready to learn, prepare young people for rewarding work and community participation, enable adults to be self-sufficient, and help older citizens remain active and independent.\" 45 Concept is translated into concrete as the CED study offers specific suggestions for the government, for busi- nesses, and for individuals. Of the many detailed sug- gestions offered, only a few can be listed here. For younger children, the CED recommends full funding of Head Start for every eligible child. It recommends that businesses enter into reciprocal agreements with schools in which concrete job commitments are linked to im- proved educational outcomes. For adults, it recommends that firms budget for education and training just as they do for investments in physical capital and that changes in U.S. tax policies be made to stimulate new investment in employee education and development. For older adults, the CED says that both private busi- ness practices and public policies discourage work by older people. Early retirement may have made sense in times past when there were fewer jobs and more job ap- plicants, but it will not make sense in tomorrow's world where there will not be enough skilled people for neces- sary jobs. They suggest changes in the Social Security regulations that discourage work by people 65 to 69 years old because of reduced benefits. In addition to en- couraging work among the \"young old,\" the CED sug- gests a reexamination of how we deal with the needs of the \"old old.\" Briefly put, the CED points out in great detail how changes need to be made to improve each generation's 43 Ibid., p. 2. 44 Ibid., p. 6. 45 Ibid., p. 2. 64 ability to help both itself and the generations that comebefore or after. Problems will not be eliminated, but theburden will be greatly reduced for all, and America willmove ahead in a smooth, natural flow. THE BUSINESS OF BUSINESSES Now, down to the business of businesses. What are in-dividual companies doing to tap into underutilized olderworkers who were previously unneeded? Perhaps themost indepth look at creative programs and opportuni-ties for older workers can be found in a publicationfrom the AARP called Using the Experience of a Life-time.46 The booklet draws its information from NOWIS,the National Older Workers Information System, a com-puterized system of data from over 200 older workeremployment programs currently in place in the privatesector. NOWIS was developed by the University ofMichigan's Institute of Gerontology and is maintainedby AARP. What follows -is a sample of educational programshighlighted in Using the Experience of a Lifetime. Theinformation given below is used with permission: Grumman Corporation offers Mid-CareerTraining Programs and courses in managementand professional development that appeal tomiddle-aged and older workers who might wantto try new careers. In addition, Grummanoffers courses specifically targeted to womenthat enable them to update their skills, retrain,develop new skills, and define career goalsupon returning to the work force after raisinga family. General Electric's Aerospace ElectronicSystem Department established a special\"Technical Renewal Program\" for engineerswho needed new skills to stay current with.changing technology. GE encourages continuededucation for all employees. Crouse-Hinds ECM aggressively offers train-ing opportunities to all its workers. Long-timeemployees can upgrade their skills or use cross-training to enhance job security. Most partici- 46 Using the Experience of a Lifetime, AARP, 1990. pants in these particular types of programs are between 45 and 65 years of age. Retiring em- ployees can participate in the Tuition Assist- ance Program which prepares them for part- time or second careers. AT&T Bell Laboratories consistently empha- sizes training. AT&T Bell Laboratories in New Jersey offers Continuing Education Programs that encourage personal growth as well as pro- fessional excellence of technical and adminis- trative employees. The courses are taught both in-house by AT&T staff members as well as local university faculty. The grading system is simply pass/withdrawal, and withdrawals are not recorded in employee files. About 19,000 employees enroll each year in about 500 CEP courses that are offered. Programs other than CEP may vary from short workshops to semes- ter-long courses to utilization of individualized learning centers where video and audio tapes and other study materials are available. Since 1986, the company has required every employee to take 20 hours of education annually. Pitney Bowes, Inc., offers a retirement educa- tional assistance program in which employees and their spouses over 50 are eligible for tui- tion reimbursement up to $300 a year per person, continuing for two years after retire- ment, for a maximum of $3,000 per person. Courses in real estate, secretarial and business skills, financial planning and academic subjects can lead to second careers or provide additional income following retirement. A second program available to employees offers full reimburse- ment to employees for academic courses lead- ing to a degree or for job-related studies. McDonald's Corporation has its own special educational program called McMasters that provides skills training and job placement for persons 55 and older. The program is a partner- ship between McDonald's and a government agency, such as a State Department of Aging. Approximately 80 to 100 employees are trained each year per McMasters program. Aerospace Corporation operates both manage-ment and technical training programs, as wellas offering a variety of full-time tuition reim-bursement plans. In addition, Aerospace allowsemployees to design their own special studiesthat may last from 3 to 6 months. The employ-ee is paid during that time as well as receivingreimbursement for educational expenses. Theexample given in AARP's publication is of a 55-year-old engineer who used this opportunity todesign a program to study the feasibility ofwind-generated power sources. LEARNING COALITIONS Perhaps the most encouraging lifelong learning pro-grams today are those that result from unusual coali-tions of government, businesses, and individuals. Twocreative, career-oriented programs that succeed becauseof new combinations of support-the Union City OlderWorkers Day Care Training Program and OperationABLE of Greater Boston, have been highlighted below: UNION CITY OLDER WORKERS D'AY CARE TRAINING PROGRAM 138-39th Street, Union City, New Jersey 07087, (201) 348-2754 or219-47th Street, Union City, New Jersey 07087, (201) 348-2750 Although the location is New Jersey, this pilot pro-gram to train seniors to take care of children in daycare centers is definitely a match made in heaven. DanaBerry, the director of the Union City day-care centers,sums it up quite well: \"The outstanding thing aboutseniors is that they have patience. Everything withthem doesn't have to be done yesterday. And this calm-centeredness has a very positive effect upon children.Seniors in this program also have a sense of humor anda commitment. If they didn't enjoy children and want tobe with them, they wouldn't lie here.\" \"'4 When this type of caring is combined with a good,solid training program, the result is excellence. TheUnion City program is the only one of its kind that isaccredited by the National Association for the Educa-tion of Young Children, an accrediting organization of 4 \"They Call Her 'Grandma,'\" DCAdvisor, Spring 1989, Vol. 2, No. 3. child-care programs. It is unique because it operates in two sites and 11 satellite day-care programs in care- givers' homes and offers a multi-cultural and bilingual experience. The 160-hour comprehensive training program lasts 8 weeks and offers classroom training in child discipline, nutrition, and arts and crafts. Trainees also work along- side child-care professionals in the Union City day-care centers. Graduates go on to work as aides in day-care centers or latchkey programs, as nannies, or as child- care providers in their own homes. So far, 224 people have participated in the program, 221 of that number have graduated, and all graduates have been placed in child-care jobs. Ms. Berry says there is a secondary ben- efit as well-trainees report that they are better grand- parents because of their learning experiences and that they pass on better parenting skills to their own grown children. The program, the brainchild of Sandra Krivit of Krivit Associates, shows how much can be accomplished when the public and private sectors work together. The Hudson County Office of Employment and Training pays for the 8-week training program. The Union City Day Care Program provides early childhood specialists to teach. The Division on Aging, using funds through the Job Training Partnership Act and Title V of the Older Americans Act, subsidizes the participants both while they are in the program and up to 6 months after- wards while they look for work. Hudson County Green Thumb and the Urban League help fund the $3.35 an hour that the trainees receive. The seniors who go through the program will benefit because they will acquire paraprofessional training, sup- plemental income, a valuable purpose in life, and a way to help others in their community. Parents in low- to middle-income families will benefit because they can now find low cost, high quality day care in their area. Children will benefit because they will be cared for by trained, day-care professionals, who bring with them the positive qualities of maturity-patience, experience, appreciation of employment, and \"hug-ability.\" OPERATION ABLE OF GREATER BOSTON World Trade Center, Suite 306, Boston, Massachusetts 02210-2078,(617) 439-5580 Operation ABLE (Ability Based on Long Experience)is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to promot-ing employment opportunities for individuals aged 45and older. The first ABLE, founded in Chicago in 1976,was the brainchild of Shirley R. Brussell, who is stillExecutive Director of the original Chicago ABLE.Today, there are 11 full-fledged ABLE-like programs inother cities and 6 baby ABLEs still in formation.Since the founding of the Boston chapter in 1982, theBoston ABLE has helped more than 15,000 middle-agedand older workers find full-time, part-time, and tempo-rary employment. Currently, the Boston ABLE is in the process of open-ing up a computer skills training center, The CareerTransition and Technology Training Center for OlderWorkers. Robin Battista, Executive Director, feels thatthis new computer training center is a first step in solv-ing the computer skills gap among America's workforce. \"If older workers are to compete successfully inthe labor market and thrive in the -workplace, theymust be comfortable with technology and develop appro-priate skills.\" Ms. Battista believes there are three fac-tors that distinguish ABLE's computer skills trainingproject from others: 1. The target population is workers aged 45and older. The rapid change in technology andshifting international markets has made work-ers age 45 and older in Massachusetts vulnera-ble to job loss. Since 1985, scores of Massachu-setts companies across several occupational sec-tors have reduced their work force throughmassive personnel cuts, attrition, and early re-tirement programs. Middle-aged workers andolder workers have often been most affected bythese cuts. These workers face extreme hardship in se-curing work in their later years. Older workersare handicapped in the job search process be-cause many of them have never looked for a jobduring their working years. They are alsohandicapped because of covert and overt age discrimination in the job search. And the lack of computer literacy hampers their opportuni- ties even for entry-level positions. This project will remedy the lack of basic computer \"know- how\" and \"technophobia\" among older work- ers. 2. A cooperative effort between business and ABLE is central to the Center. IBM is contrib- uting the hardware, software, and related equipment. Digital Equipment Corporation has developed the training curriculum. Both com- panies have assigned staff to assist with the planning and implementation of the Center. A Business Advisory Council, consisting of repre- sentatives from companies who will hire gradu- ates, is being established. ABLE has demon- strated that strong partnerships with the busi- ness community are essential for positive place- ment outcomes to occur. .3. Funding for the Center has been commit- ted by a diverse donor base-private founda- tions, corporations, and the local City govern- ment. To date, $200,000 has been raised; and IBM and Digital Equipment Corporation are contributing approximately $200,000 in in-kind services to the Center. Chapter 5 AMERICA'S FUTURE THROUGH LIFELONG LEARNING In the decades to come, there will be fewer children and greatly increased numbers of el- derly. Every aspect of American life will be af- fected. * * * Will we have a better society or a worse one? It depends on us.48 AT THE CROSSROADS We are at an opportune moment in our American his- tory, a crossroads of sorts. We need to stop for a moment, look in all directions, then proceed ahead. The baby boomers, the 77 million Americans born after World War II, are aging, and, as elders, they will be numerous, powerful, and highly motivated to have a good quality of life as they grow old. They have influ- enced our society and caused changes at every stage since their birth, and there is no reason to expect that pattern to change. They age in a world where scientific and medical advances will enable them to live longer, not as frail elders but as a generation which has been given what Dr. Lydia Bront6 calls a \"second middle age.\" They will function in a world where the work force values the skills they have acquired over a life- time and where new technology allows them to contrib- ute for a longer period of time than their forefathers who toiled away at manual labor. They will set the pace and lead in their old age as they have done in youth and middle age. This leadership from elders comes at a time when America desperately needs not only skilled workers on the job, but also role models, mentors, and intelligent caregivers for its children, qualified volun- teers for its schools, tutors for its immigrants and refu- gees, and help with its environment. Volunteer groups 48 Our Aging Society. Paradox and Promise, eds. Alan Pifer and Lydia Bronte, jacket. of wise elders are assuming the mantle of leadership fora society that has worshipped youth too long. Implementation of lifelong learning will be one of thegreat achievements of the baby boomers. This need foreducating older adults-for pleasure, for work, and forsurvival-will cause a dramatic shift in private andpublic policies. The focus on dealing with problems willhave to be on prevention through education rather than on treatment after the fact. Lifelong learning can'tmake us \"healthy, wealthy, and wise,\" but it couldcome close. HEALTHY One of the great fears of today's society is that babyboomers will cause a tremendous financial burden tothe country as they need more and more medical carein old age. A report issued by the Institute of Medicineentitled \"Extending Life, Enhancing Life\" says theUnited States spends more than $162 billion annually to treat health problems of the elderly and that the costof caring for disabled older people \"will double in thenext decade unless ways are found to prevent or delaydisabling illnesses.\" 49 The report encourages that money be spent on scientific research both to improvethe quality of life for America's aging and to make aneconomic difference. Julius Krevans, chairman of thecommittee that produced the report, says that \"if re-search found a way to delay by only one month an el- derly person's entrance into a nursing home, the nation could save $3 billion a year.\" 50 Jacques 0. Lebel, President of the New Jersey Coun- cil on Senior Citizen Education, also advocates a shift inspending priorities, recommending that funds be repro-grammed away from treatment and custodial services for the elderly and over to educational intervention (prevention). \"Current data * * * clearly shows * * * that an extended independent existence followed by abrief period of rapid decline prior to death can becomethe pattern of normal aging in our society. But prereq-uisite to that pattern are a number of behavioral and Attitudinal changes (improved health care, better nutri- 49 The Associated Press, \"Studies Could Lower Costs of Aging,\" TheTimes-Picayune, New Orleans, LA, June 13, 1991, A-23, col. 1.50Rid. tion and fitness, improved coping skills, etc.) all of which will only come about through a system of greatly increased educational intervention.\" This marriage of scientific research and educational intervention to produce healthy aging is already taking place. Dr. Matilda White Riley of the National Institute on Aging has long been an advocate of the scientific benefits of learning experiences for older people. A recent article in The New York Times (\"The Aging Brain: The Mind is Resilient, It's the Body That Fails\") reports on scientific studies that suggest that the aging brain can indeed be capable of functioning and learning at a normal level, and that decreases in function may be due not to aging but rather to disease or lack of use.51 The August 1991 issue of Prevention magazine in- cludes an article on the future of \"memory pills.\" The Alliance for Aging Research has issued a report entitled \"Aging Research on the Threshold of Discovery\" that alerts the nonscientific public to potential scientific breakthroughs that could dramatically affect our aging society. Demographic statistics support the need for healthy elders. Scientific research and educational intervention add quality to the aging process. But, theory and re- search become reality only when programs that teach healthy aging begin to spring up for every social and economic group. Imagine a program that teaches adults a healthier, new way of life. It exists: More than 30,000 people have participated in the medically supervised programs at the Pritikin Longevity Centers. The average age of the participant is 53, and the Center at Santa Monica graduates about 2,600 people a year. The Pritikin program focuses on diet, ex- ercise, and stress reduction. Its basic goals are to have the participant show great improvement while at the Center and to learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle when he or she gets back home. Pritikin uses education as the motivating force to change unhealthy habits into a new, healthier way of living. Classes and workshops abound on weight control, stress management, heart disease, hypertension, cancer protection, lifestyle 51 Gina Kolata, \"The Aging Brain: The Mind is Resilient, It's the Body That Fails,\" The New York Times, Apr. 16, 1991, Sec. C, p. 1. col. 1. changes, and nutrition. The Pritikin philosophy also in-cludes aggressive research, and more than 20 studies ofwhat has been accomplished through a Pritikin \"educa-tion\" have been published. .Imagine a 10-day, pre-retirement program that offersretirees a chance to have a healthier old age. It exists:Canyon Ranch, a health spa in Arizona, created \"El-dercamp,\" a ten-day program that offered an all-ex-penses paid vacation to 33 Tucson seniors who werehealthy but sedentary men and women between theages of 60 and 70. They served as volunteers for a multi-disciplinary study on healthy aging. One of the goals ofthe study was to see if \"a 10-day 'camp' for newly re-tired people works to make significant improvement intheir health, that can be reproduced elsewhere.\" 52 MelZuckerman, CEO, Canyon Ranch, reports on the docu-mentable changes in the group over a six month follow-up period: \"Overall we have seen continued weight loss,drops in cholesterol, increases in flexibility, increasedcardiovascular fitness, increases in psychological status,decreased smoking and increased exercise levels. Also,we have documented changes for the better in immunefunction and we are just beginning to analyze our dataon EEG brain changes. We are hoping to see 'youngerlooking' brains at the three month point than at the be-ginning of the program.\" Imagine a program that reaches out to minorityelders and teaches them how to avoid prevalent dis-eases. It exists: The AARP offers a free-loan program that includes avideotape and booklet entitled \"Healthy Aging-Making Health Promotion Work for Minority Elders.\"The videotape profiles five successful programs for mi-nority elders:-\"Paso a Paso\" (Texas) for Hispanic elders;-\"Self-Help for the Elderly\" (California) for Pacific/Asian elders; -\"Growing Older with Health and Wisdom\" (New Mexico) for American Indian elders;-\"Washington Seniors Wellness Center\" (Washing-ton, DC) for Black elders; and 52 Dr. Phil Eichling, as quoted in Carolyn Niethammer, \"Seniors Redis-cover Joys of Life,\" Canyon Ranch Round-Up, Summer 1990, p. 6. -\"STAY WELL\" (New York) for multicultural elders. The booklet lists common health risks for specific older minorities and the modifiable risk factors. It then suggests program ideas for preventive care. Key strate- gies for organizing health promotion programs are pro- vided, and guidelines for developing programs for mi- nority elders are listed. A list of national organizations that can help is given as well as the addresses for the model programs shown in the video and ideas for other programs and activities. Imagine a program that teaches those with disease how to function at a higher level. It exists: At the Southern Baptist Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, the Arthritis Center offers a variety of pro- grams led by healthcare professionals who are trained and certified by the Arthritis Foundation to help people control arthritis. PACE (People with Arthritis Can Ex- ercise) teaches proper exercise to increase joint flexibil- ity, range of motion, muscle strength and cardiovascu- lar conditioning. An arthritis self-help course teaches self management principles that will help persons with arthritis increase their capabilities and develop more confidence. The Arthritis Aquatic Program is a class for swimmers and non-swimmers. The Arthritis Communi- ty Forum teaches through 2-hour seminars facts about arthritis and other rheumatic diseases including the latest medical/surgical treatment and the psychological aspects of dealing with a chronic disease. There is also a speaker's bureau for clubs, organizations, or senior citi- zens groups who are interested in learning more about arthritis. The programs mentioned above are but a few of the many that exist, and they are only the beginning. Imag- ine an America that promotes healthy aging, an Amer- ica that is enthusiastic about living all stages of life to the fullest. It is indeed a more worthy goal than the future America we now envision, one that will carry the financial burden of supporting 77 million elderly baby boomers. WEALTHY Some possible implications of lifelong learning on fi- nancial matters have already been discussed: money spent on research and educational intervention canmean less money spent on health care treatment andcustodial care; and money spent on training workersthroughout a lifetime can mean a more productiveAmerican work force. But, there's even more to begained from lifelong learning from a financial point ofview if you consider the impact on an individual's qual-ity of life and even on that person's ability to survive.Consider the testimony of a 90-year-old man who ap-peared before a California legislative hearing on life-long learning: Do you expect anyone to be able to functionwith what he learned over 75 years ago whenthere was no computer, telephones had just ap-peared, there were few cars, FAXes were un-heard of, banking was done in person, and welived a much less complicated life? Lifelonglearning is a necessity just to keep up, to saynothing of getting ahead!\" 6 5 The changes that will take place in the next 75 yearswill be just as dramatic, making lifelong learning still anecessity. Add other conditions, such as the possibilityof an elder becoming ill, being a refugee, living aloneand apart from his or her family, or lacking an abilityto generate income other than possible Social Security,and you'll see a particular need for financial planningfor our later years. Retirement at 65 and living until 95demands preplanning, and preplanning demands thatwe learn how to do it the right way and in enough time.Lifelong learning can do this. James E. Birren, Director of the Anna & HarryBorun Center for Gerontological Research at the Uni-versity of California, Los Angeles, adds another layer tothe importance of lifelong learning to our financial wellbeing: \"Older persons face many daily decisionsthat affect their ability to remain healthy, in-dependent and productive. One of the most im-portant risk factors for erosion of health andindependence in the later years is low educa- 5s As quoted by Brenda B. Ross, Chair of the Education Committee ofthe Senior Citizen's Advisory Committee, Orange County, California, AreaAgency on Aging. tion and its correlate of poor consumer decision strategies. This is particularly true in a chang- ing society with new information, products, services, and new marketing strategies. Con- sumer education for older persons is needed to help them conserve their resources and maxi- mize the quality of their lives * * *. Increasing the consumer effectiveness of older adults will relieve their need to rely excessively on some- one else for supplies, money, or other supports. This is particularly important in times when the public budgets may not be able to respond with sufficient resources. Career training, retirement planning, and consumer know-how should be part of enlightened eldering. Our financial well-being needs to be woven into the frame- work of lifelong learning programs. At Mainstream,the Retirement Institute of Westchester Community Col- lege, Valhalla, NY, over 6,000 older adults a year study for self enhancement, for improved health, for job place- ment, and for survival. Dr. Reva Greenberg, Main- stream's director, says the students range from vital, educated and financially secure to frail, low-functioning and economically vulnerable, and the courses offered re- flect their needs. The curriculum includes enrichment, skills building, computer technology, educational travel, pre- and post-retirement, and work force education and training. Consideration and constructive thought are given to the special needs of the Hispanic elderly, the developmentally disabled, the bonding of the genera- tions, and health and wellness. The Center for a Mature Work Force offers training for paid and volunteer work. Project Transition is a center for displaced homemakers. Seniors learn telecommunications at the Mainstream SeniorNet Computer Learning Center, and OUR TIME: Living the Later Years is a weekly cable T.V. series co- sponsored with the Westchester County Office for the Aging that allows the older person to learn at home. Greenberg says the list of programming possibilities is as endless as the well of human potential. AND WISE Wisdom for the 21st century does not come out of the mouths of babes. What follows are observations from enlightened elders, from those concerned with. issues forelders, and from some who simply see the tomorrowstoday. A concern for the future is the need for in-clusion of older participants from all socioeco-nomic levels in the educational programs. * * * It should be relatively easy to design programsand recruit older persons of higher socioeco-nomic status. These programs must be balancedwith those for people with less education, limit-ed literacy, little knowledge of English, andfewer coping skills. Financial support from thefederal government and foundations shouldgive first priority to these individuals and toprograms that meet their needs * * *.-DavidA. Peterson and Pamela F. Wendt Universityof Southern California. My program brings me in contact with theproblems of the aging adults. They live goodproductive lives and then sickness and tragedyhappens and their life changes. I try to bringout the good things in life and try to revivetheir self confidence again. I introduce them toan agency where they can be useful and at thesame time learn some of the new things inbusiness. Eventually as they learn new things,their interest sharpens in what is going on inthe world. Soon they become real people again* * *. I found retirement the most boring partof my life. I turned it around and have beenturning others around ever since. I enjoy know-ing that at 82 I can still be a caring humanbeing.-Aseneth Sweet, Division on Aging, NewJersey. The vision we have of the future of the adulteducation system is one that allows adults, re-gardless of educational level or ability, to enterthe appropriate program easily through quickassessment and referral in a local skill clinic,and to get the education and training theyneed. The education and training will be com-petency-based so adults progress as they master the material. Programs will be learner- and family-centered allowing the individuals who participate to receive the education and skills to become self-sufficient and to make a better life, not just for themselves, but for their fami- lies and children. The programs, offered through a coordinated delivery system involv- ing federal, state, and local education and training programs and social services as needed, will have standards and measures of accountability assuring high quality. And final- ly, these education and training programs, in part through the use of technology and dis- tance learning, will be available in every rural, suburban and urban community.-Betsy Brand, Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education, U.S. Department of Education. a goal of the 19-year-old Adult Health and Development Program, the seven-year-old Camp Rediscovery, and the National Network Plan for Intergenerational Health is to tighten the social fabric of the country by bringing people together to work toward common pur- poses. Barbara Tuchman refers to this era as the Age of Violence. The increase in man-made causes of violent deaths reinforces her point. When we bring approximately 200 people to- gether each semester regardless of their status in health and well-being, race and ethnic back- ground, age, etc., stereotypes and labels are abandoned as people are seen as individuals.- Dan Leviton, Ph.D., Professor, Health Educa- tion, University of Maryland. (The) holistic view of the family influence upon education from the youngest child through grandparenthood is especially gratify- ing to me. Demographics show that the aging will live long enough to influence several gen- erations.-Lindy Boggs, former Congresswoman from Louisiana. It is still true that an adult going back to school is the surest way to set a good example for educating children.-Lamar Alexander, Sec-retary of Education. My mother, I think, was 93 when she got some notoriety * * *. She signed up for a course atSt. Andrews College. She wanted to take a his-tory course. She wanted to take ancient history.They said, \"We've got such an interesting pro-fessor here in the course on modern history.\" She said, \"No, thank you, I lived through allthat.\"-Senator Terry Sanford (D-NC). CONCLUSION Older Americans want to learn, are able to learn, andbenefit themselves and others through learning. This isa valuable piece of the American puzzle as we plan ourfuture as Americans who are living longer in a societythat is aging. At the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, elders learn toread so they can help their grandchildren with home-work. At UMASS/Boston, elders return to college to getdegrees in gerontology so they go out into the world tohelp other elders. At Pitney Bowes, elders acquire newjob skills so they can keep up with changing technologyor prepare for a new career. At churches, synagogues, community centers, corpora-tions, college campuses, hospitals, and homes aroundthe country, older people are learning, learning, learn-ing. They bring experience to education, and the result is a unique combination that enables them to helpthemselves and to help others. Lifelong learning is not a quick fix, but rather a slowand steady-moving train. Academicians, business people, educators, politicians, and scientists are beginning tojump aboard. There's room for everybody, but the pas-sengers who have the first-class tickets are the elders. Today's elders are the pioneers; the baby boomers, asthey become elders, will weave lifelong learning intoAmerica's fabric; and a new group, the \"echo baby boomers,\" is just being born and will grow up to become elders who take lifelong learning for granted. All elders who learn in order to maintain their health and theirmental flexibility, and especially those who use theirlearning to give something back to society, are full par- ticipants in America's future. They've simply taken that slow-moving but steady train from \"I think I .can, I think I can, I think I can\" 5 to \"I thought I could, and I did!\" 5 Watty Piper, The Little Engine That Could. Chapter 6 COMPLETING THE CIRCLE: INTERGENERATIONAL MENTORING Somehow we have to get older people back close to growing children if we are to restore a sense of community, a knowledge of the past, and a sense of the future.-MARGARET MEAD. Growing up has always been hard. Growing up in America today-facing the unusual stresses of drugs, sex, AIDS, lack of job opportunities-is too hard on our children without the day-to-day caring of mature adults. We call that type of guidance mentoring. It's the help- ing hand that an older generation extends to a younger generation that pulls it, child by child, into healthy adulthood. Nature demands that we nurture our chil- dren until they're ready to leave the nest. Young people who are asked to make that long, hard trip from child- hood to maturity without sufficient guidance have not grown enough feathers for the flight. Lack of sufficient mentoring can take place any- where, at any level: in a one-parent home where that one parent is overstressed and has too little time; in a two-parent home when both parents work and come home too tired at the end of a busy day; in families where children live hundreds of miles away from grand- parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins; at schools, where staffs are being cut back and teachers are too busy to provide enough one-on-one attention; in part-time, after- school jobs where standing over a fryer does not equal old-fashioned apprenticeships; in an age-segregated soci- ety that keeps its young and its old apart. Times have surely changed, but our responsibility to guide our chil- dren into maturity has not. We are a mentor-poor socie- ty, and that is a poverty more devastating than hand- me-down clothes and simple food. The answer is out there, but only a few have seen the solution. Yet, it's quite simple and natural. Our aging population is the fastest-growing group in America (83) today. Statistics say the 85 percent of that aging popula-tion will be essentially healthy, normal adults. Olderpeople want to stay active and involved. They have thetime and patience to give children. They are exactly theright type of role models we need to supplement theguidance provided by parents and teachers. The needsof the young dovetail very well with the skills of elders.There are some excellent mentoring programs scat-tered throughout the country that match up these twoage groups. In McCrory, Arkansas, volunteers with theFoster Grandparents Program were recently honoredfor. their work in the elementary school there. Some-times they read; sometimes they tutor; they're simplythere to supply that special one-on-one attention for thechildren when they need it.In Los Angeles, DOVES (Dedicated Older Volunteersin Educational Services) place almost 1,000 carefully se-lected and trained senior volunteers in district schoolsto supplement the work of teachers. The students re-ceive individual attention; older folks feel needed be-cause they are needed; and a caring and sharing rela-tionship between the young and the old can just natu-rally happen. DOVES tutor students in all subjects aswell as assist in playground activities, clerical work,arts and crafts, libraries, translating, career education,auto mechanics, electronics, computer technology,homework, gymnastics, storytelling, carpentry, schoolplays, field trips, cooking, gardening, and nursing assist-ance. Another program, a nationwide program, is sponsoredby OASIS (Older Adult Service and InformationSystem). OASIS, a national nonprofit organization forindividuals over 55, is sponsored nationally by The MayDepartment Stores Company, as well as local sponsors.One facet of OASIS, its Intergenerational Tutoring Pro-gram, pairs a child in the first, second, or third gradewith a trained volunteer who becomes that child's tutor,mentor, and friend. They work together 1 hour perweek for an entire school year. OASIS provides the teaching curriculum, all trainingand tutoring materials, and recruits its volunteers fromits membership. Each school system identifies the chil-dren who will participate and chooses a program coordi-nator to work with the volunteers. These volunteers aretrained in an easy-to-learn, well-recognized teaching method that draws on the personal experiences of both the tutor and the child in order to develop the child's oral and written communication skills. When children are encouraged to change their own thoughts into writ- ing, the written word takes on new meaning and new value. Volunteers also learn about motivational tech- niques and how to use the experiences in their lives to enrich the lives of their students. Today, this program is in 12 cities across the country. In St. Louis alone, it operates in eight school districts and involves about 400 volunteers. At the University of North Carolina at Asheville, under the auspices of the North Carolina Center for Creative Retirement, there is a very special program callid SAIL (Senior Academy for Intergenerational Learning). SAIL matches retired civic and professional leaders with undergraduate students to work together on learning projects. The SAIL \"Senior Fellows\" volun- teer their time and share their expertise with the un- dergraduates; retired physicians serve as mentors to pre-med students; university athletes are matched with adults who love sports and share their career interests; computer-wise retirees work with computer scientific students on projects to benefit UNCA. This chapter has only scratched the surface of the mentoring movement in America. For those who might want to learn more about the subject, an indepth view of mentoring can be found in a publication entitled: The Kindness of Strangers: Reflections on the Mentoring Movement, by Marc Freedom,.

Moody) * \"OuR AGING SOCIETY: PARADOX AND PRoMISE,\" EDITED BY ALAN PIFER AND LYDIA BRONTE, W. W. NORTON & Co., NEW YORK- LONDON, 1986 [Reprinted with permission from the Carnegie Corporation of New York] America's /emergence as an aging society has pro- found implications for the role education plays over the course of life. As Philippe Aries has shown, education has a strategic role in society, for its structure serves to shape our image of the life cycle as a whole.' A century ago, a \"modernized\" life-cycle emerged which expressed a view of the life course that linked education to the mass industrial economy and drew rigid boundaries be- tween the stages of life.2 In this modernized life-cycle, education, work, and leisure were assigned sequentially to the life stages of youth, adulthood, and old age. Today the advent of an aging society has begun to challenge this pattern. Education is no longer tied ex- clusively to youth, and we have begun to see declining numbers of young people among those age groups that traditionally have been served by colleges. Higher edu- cation has already responded to this demographic change with modest steps toward non-traditional learn- ing, but there have been far fewer changes in education- al philosophy, financing, or curriculum. Business and industry have promoted their own view of education in * The author is greatful for support from the Andrew Norman Institute for Advanced Study at the Andrus Gerontology Center, University of Southern California, as well as the Mina Shaughnessy Fellowship Program of the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education during the period this article was written. 1 Philippe Aries, Centuries of Childhood (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962). 2 Gerald Gruman, \"The Modernization of the Life Cycle.\" in D. Van Tas- sell, K. Woodward, and S. Spicker, eds., Aging and the Elderly: Humanistic Perspectives in Gerontology (Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities (87) 59-854 -92 -4 terms of \"human-capital formation,\" but programs for the post-industrial economy haverarely included older workers.These modest and halting steps are a weak responseindeed to what must be seen as the decisive demograph-ic revolution of the twentieth century: the aging of soci-eties throughout the industrialized world. Loosening theboundaries between life stages and making them moreflexible seems desirable, but fails to address the realquestion: how can the dramatic rise in life expectancybecome the basis for new social productivity-for a gen-uine abundance of life? What role can learning play inpreparing individuals at every stage of life for a societywhere most people can expect to live to old age? Thesechallenges will demand a change in the relation be-tween education and life stages. THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN IN AN AGING SOCIETY Support for Public Education For over a century, public policy has supported uni-versal mass education for children and young people.That public support is now threatening to decline, inpart because of our society's shrinking proportion ofchildren and its growing proportion of elderly. Today,only 20 percent of American voters have school-age chil-dren, and opinion surveys show that older people arefar less likely than other groups to support school-taxincreases.3 In the past, public support in this countryfor the education of children and young people depend-ed on a variety of sources, and was an expression of thedemocratic ideal of common citizenship that united allgenerations. Public support for education was based ona willingness on the part of parents to make sacrificesin order that one's children may have a better life, andobligations to the next generation were tied to an ideol-ogy of social progress and upward mobility.In recent times, this older ideal of citizenship hasfaded, leaving the desire for economic growth the -chiefrationale for public support of education. Today, eventhis economic rationale has been weakening, since edu-cation no longer guarantees a good job. While schools 3 See Samuel H. Preston, \"Children and the Elderly in the U.S.,\" Scien-tific American, Dec. 1984, pp. 44-49. and colleges once had a monopoly on education, because they granted credentials that had value in the job market, the comparative advantage of credentials has fallen today, while competition for good jobs has height- ened. Growing numbers of people are described as \"overeducated\" or \"underemployed.\" Under these con- ditions, it becomes more difficult to justify educational expenditures on the old grounds. As a result, claims for support of public education are based increasingly on labor-market forecasts and on economic planning-on the need for a skilled labor force to attract high-technol- ogy industry, for example. But public support also de- pends on whether voters perceive that schools are doing a good job, and evidence of our public schools' effective- ness has weakened that support., School Reform It was the wide public recognition of these trends, along with a new environment of international econom- ic competition, that were largely responsible for the clamor for \"school reform\" that arose in the early 1980s. But the challenge of school reform, which is open to several quite divergent solutions, has been posed for the public in very narrow terms. The strategy that has received the most public discussion is the one that would thoroughly upgrade public education, particular- ly on the secondary level. In some areas of the coun- try-Texas for example-leaders from high-technology industries have been prominent advocates for such school reform, but, for reasons suggested earlier, financ- ing public education when fewer families have children in the school is a continuing problem. If the general strategy for school reform does not bear fruit in producing a skilled, flexible labor force, then business may opt for a second strategy: targeting pri- vate \"human-capital\" investment in job training for highly specific occupational skills. This strategy has an advantage for corporate planners, since the control of education goals would then remain firmly in the hands of business. The business community could also find allies in the higher education sector; already, over half the colleges in the United States operate joint training ventures with private industry, and the trend is grow-mng.4 It is comforting to imagine that this kind of human-capital investment approach might offer \"second-chance\" opportunities to groups that have so far beenunsuccessful within the formal educational system. Butif resources are invested according to the needs of thebusiness community, we are more likely to see a furthererosion of constituencies for the \"open access\" forms ofeducation that have been vital for the disadvantaged. Inone year, for example, the California community-collegesystem experienced a 25 percent drop in enrollmentafter it had imposed a tuition charge. The issue ulti-mately confronts us with a choice between public or pri-vate control over decisions affecting human-capital in-vestment-what we call education.With an aging population, public education at alllevels is likely to remain on the defensive. Schools willbe further tempted to justify their effectiveness onnarrow economic grounds. But government will contin-ue to be faced with other competing demands, such asthe rising health-care costs of the elderly. When strug-gles are waged through conventional interest-group poli-tics, we risk the danger that young and old might be po-larized. One alternative would be to convince all agegroups that they have a common stake in educating thenext generation. A case that illustrates this point can be found inBrookline, Massachusetts, a community of 55,000 peoplewith a very high proportion of the population-20 per-cent--over age 65.5 At the same time, 25 percent of theschool-age population is composed of minority children,chiefly black and Asian. In Massachusetts, as in Califor-nia, a major property-tax limitation measure was ap-proved. But in Brookline, despite its high proportion ofpredominantly white senior citizens, the communityvoted overwhelming against the property-tax limitationat the same time the measure was winning elsewhere inthe state. One reason for the voting pattern lay in thestrong support for schools by Brookline senior citizens, 4*Nell P. Eurich, Corporate Classrooms: The Learning Business, (Prince-ton, N.J.: Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 1985).5 I am indebted to Dr. Robert Sperber, former Superintendent of Schoolsof Brookline Massachusetts, for background information provided at theCarnegie Project Conference on Education and the Aging Society. support that was cultivated as a result of years of com- munity effort. Three elements were key to the Brookline success: public information, school-based services for older people, and the active recruitment of senior citizens as school volunteers. The public schools were used as sites for serving hot lunches to senior citizens and for other services such as health screening and recreation. Adult education programs were moved to community loca- tions, while unused school buses were made available to senior citizens for shopping during the day and for transportation to cultural events in the schools at night. Older people were recruited as volunteers for tutoring, for teaching English as a second language, and for the sharing of life experiences. When the drive came to limit school expenses, the senior-citizen vote in Brook- line was substantially against the statewide trend. Is it possible to generalize or to replicate the Brook- line experience in other communities in America? There are some signs that this is already happening. In many localities, closed school buildings have been turned into community centers. The National Organiza- tion of School Volunteers showed striking success in re- cruiting the elderly as volunteers in cities across the United States. These are promising efforts, for they in- corporate the elderly as a new constituency and as con- tributors to the learning process. But volunteerism also. has its limits. The predominantly white elderly of Brookline are unlikely to travel to Roxbury ghetto schools, for example. Schemes for voluntary action must' be balanced by changes in public policy. Our current public policies continue to reinforce the century-old \"modernized\" life course, with its linear separation of education, work, and leisure. Social Secu- rity, which depends on younger workers, is part of a federal taxing system, while school and property taxes are assessed by local government. These taxation poli- cies end up pitting age groups against each other, rais- ing the specter of elderly homeowners repeatedly voting down school-bond issues-as happened over a period of years in the Sun City, Arizona, retirement community. We are faced not simply with the task of convincing older people to volunteer in the schools, but with re- minding people of all ages that each generation has taken on an obligation to preserve a free society for the next generation. Younger adults without children, aswell as grandparents with no children currently inschool, need to understand this obligation in far broaderterms than they now perceive it. Like military service,public education has provided a basis of common citi-zenship, of ties to community that reach beyond anysingle generation. In the present political climate, thepolicy dilemma may come down to two quite differentversions of conservative ideology, one that emphasizesself-interest in the marketplace model (that is, human-capital formation), and the other based on some versionof obligation to a common good that transcends anysingle generation. Children and young people will have to be educatedin ways that strengthen, rather than erode, these inter-generational ties. Promoting more positive attitudes to-wards all stage of life, including old age, would be oneway to begin. This is a task that must extend from ele-mentary education right on through the most advancedprofessional schooling-for example, to the education ofphysicians, who often display either a lack of interest oran openly negative attitude toward the chronic diseasesof geriatric practice, despite the fact that in most fieldsof medicine geriatric patients already constitute morethan a third of the patient load, a figure that willsurely increase. It is promising that some positivemodels for gerontological education in the professionsare beginning to emerge. RETRAINING MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WORKERS The Aging Work Force With population aging, the relations between work,retirement, and retraining are likely to change. In thepast few decades, while the average age of retirementhas been falling, recent federal legislation has beenmoving in the opposite direction, raising the Social Se-curity age to sixty-seven and the mandatory retirementage to seventy, for example. By the year 2000, half thework force will consist of people age thirty-five to fifty-five. With fewer young people seeking employment, wemay be unable to forgo the productivity of older work-ers. These trends make it imperative to rethink the roleof worker retraining from the perspective of the entirelife span. The prevailing pattern has been for employers to pro- vide job training, either directly at the work site or by means of tuition reimbursement plans. Yet far fewer employees than might be expected have taken advan- tage of retraining opportunities. Experience suggests that simply offering educational programs or financial- assistance is insufficient; individuals must also be con- vinced that it is both worthwhile and feasible to take' advantage of the available opportunities. In the past,-- many companies believed that it was cheaper to hire and train younger people than to retrain older workers, and a widespread bias has remained in favor of provid- ing training resources to relatively young employees. A Life-Span Approach to Retraining Proposals for retraining middle-aged or older workers must take into account the serious problem of social ex- pectations about what is appropriate in later, life. We have noted that people were generally locked into a \"linear life plan\"-a sequence that consisted of educa- tion, work, and leisure, in that order. An optimal model for the future would integrate life planning over the entire life course. This would create workers who are not only well prepared, but who are highly motivated to participate in training and retraining. The Role of Colleges and Universities. Like industry, institutions of higher education have generally accepted a youth-oriented, age-decremental model of human resource development. While industry remains preoccupied with very specific job skills, col- leges could certainly adopt a more comprehensive model of life-span development, and provide education accord- ingly. Given such a model, it might be possible for people beyond age fifty to become re-educated, to learn a whole new career. Instead of thinking of themselves as on a downward slope toward retirement, they could think about beginning a new phase of life. John McLeish, in The Ulyssean Adult, has document- ed a range of examples of creativity, continued learning, and second careers in later life. In a few cases, educa- tional institutions have responded to this possibility with innovative measures, such as the successful pro- gram at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which offers mid-career retraining that permits engi- neers-average age fifty-to become high-school scienceand math teachers. The key problem with this optimistic picture ofsecond careers in later life is motivation. What promptspeople to take the risk? One answer is that certain lifechanges-divorce, or plant closings in smokestack indus-tries-often impel people to give up old patterns andtake the chances necessary to begin new occupations inmid-life. In 1976, for example, the Vocational Education Actturned federal attention for the first time to the educa-tional needs of middle-aged displaced homemakers.6(\"Displaced homemaker\" refers to a person who,through) divorce, separation, or the death or disability ofa spouso, finds herself needing to move back into the jobmarket at age forty or more.) This national effort at re-training has demonstrated the feasibility of public ini-tiatives(to build on the capacities of age and experience.The 'successful programs have provided practicalskills training in such areas as personal financial man-agement or job-search techniques. They have also beenhelping older women to translate their knowledge fromlife experience in homemaking or volunteer work intopaid employment. Local chapters of the Older Women'sLeague, often in collaboration with community colleges,now offering training programs on financial and retire-ment planning, housing, health needs, and family life,as well as skills acquired in leadership development andadvocacy training. HUMAN-CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN LIFE-SPAN PERSPECTIVE If we are to insure economic productivity and growthin a competitive international economy, technologicalinnovation is a necessity. At the same time, there areserious doubts whether high-technology skills will pro-vide the kind of career flexibility that we have been ad-vocating over a longer life span; in many ways, it mayactually contribute to de-skilling and even trivializingjobs.. New technology can also cause older workers tolose the advantages of age and experience, increasingtheir fears of being replaced by automation. 6 I am indebted to Cindy Marano for background information on the Dis-placed Homemaker Programs. The public policy response to this situation has been inadequate and even misdirected. Under the old Trade Adjustment Act, for example, initiatives have largely failed, and little retraining of older workers has even been attempted. Further, the federal tax code prohibits those engaged in retraining for a new occupation from claiming an educational deduction, while it permits de- ductions for those who improve their skills within their current occupations. Even the recent Job Training Part- nership Act represents a meager response to the struc- tural transformation of the American economy. Federal leadership will achieve little indeed unless it provides serious incentives in the form of training subsidies, tax credits, new adult retraining services, and other such programs. Prevailing policy fails even to address these questions. Financing Retraining for Older Workers Some recent proposals approach the task of financing worker retraining in novel ways. Under one, which calls for so-called Individual Training Accounts financed by joint contributions from workers and companies, a worker could draw upon an account if he found himself displaced from a job. Still more ambitious plans would offer general educational entitlements, based, for exam- ple, on Social Security, to be set aside for use at any period of the life course. Such policies would weaken the grip of the linear life plan, and might promote greater occupational mobility for middle-aged and older workers. One liability of these plans is that they would appeal primarily to upper-income workers; people with more modest incomes, who could not benefit from tax Incen- tives, are less likely to participate. There is also the fact that, for those older workers who have built up significant equity in home ownership but now face high mortgage rates if they try to move, relocation assistance is as vital as retraining. Current policy in effect subsidizes immobility and inflexibility in an aging labor force-a major problem in a post-indus- trial economy, where mobility and flexibility are essen- tial for growth. Public Policy for Life-Span Development Because of the historical geographic mobility of theAmerican labor force, our private firms and local gov-ernments have under-invested in education and trainingcompared with other industrialized countries. Under-in-vestment was traditionally tolerated because companiescould recruit younger workers who had acquired thenecessary skill levels through public education. Here isan instance of the limitation of the human-capital in-vestment perspective as applied to worker retraining: itis unrealistic to expect either private firms or local gov-ernments to make investments if they cannot expect torecoup benefits. In a period of \"hypermobility\" of inter-national capital, it is easier for industries simply toabandon a local area when their human resource costsbecome excessive.7 The effect of our current national policy is to offer in-centives for economic dependency in retirement throughpension and Social Security transfers. In contrast, ourlocal and private policy bears the entire burden of offer-ing incentives for human-capital investment. The resultis that individuals and private firms alike end up sup-porting publicly subsidized dependency while avoidingrisky human-capital investments in retraining olderworkers. The aging society, then, confronts a contradic-tion: increased longevity means an abundance of life inthe later years with a potential for continued social pro-ductivity, yet the political economy channels olderpeople away from productive roles in the workplace. Work, Aging, and Post-Industrial Society Many observers express deep pessimism about futurejob growth in advanced industrialized economies. Onthe one hand, new technology is needed to insurehealthy productivity, while, on the other, an aging workforce is threatened by skill obsolescence or by the van-ishing of jobs altogether. We can anticipate that manyolder people will resist innovation and .be reluctant totake risks, while employers will continue to maintain 7 Michael Harrington, The New American Poverty (New York: Holt,Rinehart, & Winston, 1984). Barry, Bluestone and Bennett Harrison, TheDeindustrialization of America Plant Closings, Community Abandonmentand the Dismantling of Basic Industry (New York: Basic Books, 1983). inelastic salary levels and job rationing by age and se- niority. As we move away from the concept of the linear life plan, we also move away from security and predictabil- ity. One response to an unpredictable world has been a version of protectionism: for example, guarantees of life- time job-security. Western European societies, with their aging populations, have already begun to experi- ence the long-range cost of the protectionist strategy, a defensive response that often results in an inflexible labor force, and the setting of the old against the young. A better response would be to promote skills of adapta- tion and development over the entire life course. In- stead of regarding older workers as unproductive bur- dens, we would invest in their retraining as a way of de- veloping their abilities to contribute in many different settings. LIFELONG LEARNING IN THE AGING SOCIETY Adult Learners and Non-Traditional Education The coming of an aging society is likely to accelerate the trend toward \"non-traditional\" higher education. American higher education has already demonstrated impressive flexibility in its ability to reach out to adult learners. The main thrust of the innovation to date has been to remove the most obvious barriers to adult learn- ers \"-by providing evening programs, weekend col- leges, and initiating outreach efforts to bring education to sites beyond the limited time and place of the tradi- tional campus. But these separate programs never quite achieve parity with the standard educational offerings; they always remain examples of \"learning at the back door.\" 9 The academic mind persists in making status distinctions between regular education and continuing education, between credit and non-credit offerings, dis- tinctions that are reinforced by educational policy and financing patterns. I I am indebted to Russell Edgerton, president of the American Associa- tion for Higher Education, for background information provided at the Conference on Education and the Aging Society. 9 Charles A. Wedemeyer, Learning at the Back Door: Reflections on Non- Traditional Learning in the Lifespan (Madison, WI: University of Wiscon- sin Press, 1981). Other issues may be far more important for olderlearners than simply promoting access. For one, thepedagogical traditions of the university are not alwayscompatible with the active learning interests and theindividual styles of adults. With the process of aging,people become more, not less diverse, a condition thatgives rise to conflict between the expectations of experi-enced adults and the curriculum of most post-secondaryinstitutions. We must take care not to be deceived by the conven-tional assumptions of assessing educational needs. Pa-tricia Cross reminded us that the results of surveys ofperceived educational demands are always related to arespondent's prior experience with education;10 peoplereally have no sense of what their need for educationmight be until they actually experience a concrete alter-native program and are able to measure the difference.The successful experience of the Open University inGreat Britain has demonstrated this point. Educationalinnovation for an aging society will demand not merelyaccess to predetermined programs and materials, but re-design of those offerings to meet the needs of learnerswho bring with them the special strengths of age andexperience. Education for Older Adults There is abundant evidence that people can continueto learn at any age. As successive generations of olderpeople continue to show rising levels in the years ofschooling they complete, we can expect interest in life-long learning to grow in the future. I1 Today, compara-tively few older people are enrolled in formal education,and the degree of their participation is correlated totheir prior educational attainment, a pattern that holdstrue at all ages. But the participation rates of olderadults are rising. The 1974 Harris Survey recorded only2 percent engaged in adult education, while the 1981survey identified 5 percent. Older learners tend not to be interested in credentialsor degrees; tests, grades, and competition hold little at- 10 K. Patricia Cross, Adults as Learners: Increasing Participation andFacilitating Learning (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1984). 11 The best overall treatment of education in later life is David Peterson,Facilitating Education for Older Learners (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass,1983). traction for them. The fields they pursue range widely, from the arts or methods of coping with social change, to programs that teach information about hobbies, phys- ical health needs, and personal growth. They tend to prefer the kind of participation learning that allows them to be involved and active, as opposed to courses presented in the typical lecture format. The most effec- tive programs have been those that respond directly to the special interests of older learners. One example of a successful program is \"Elder- hostel,\" which was founded in 1975 as a summer resi- dential college program for people over sixty. It offers non-credit courses in the liberal arts and sciences. El- derhostel's growth has been extraordinary. It began with two hundred participants, and by 1985 nearly 100,000 were enrolled at eight hundred campuses around the United States. Elderhostel is now both a year-round option and an overseas activity. One of its key features is its residential format, and the fact that it offers opportunity for travel. The residential program provides a degree of intimacy and socialization that is an important part of the program as a whole. Elderhos- tel entails no homework, no papers, and no grades; par- ticipants enroll simply for the joy of learning. Its par- ticipants enjoy a new retirement lifestyle that rein- forces feelings of self-worth and personal growth. In many ways Elderhostel resembles the American Chattauqua Movement, now revived in the era of the aging society. The trend it demonstrates is worldwide in nature, as is evident in the spread of the \"Universities of the Third Age\" in France, Spain, Scandinavia, and, more recently, Japan. The phenomenon suggests fur- ther possibilities for the future of higher education in an aging society. College faculty members are increas- ingly troubled today about declining skills, poor motiva- tion, and an almost single-minded focus on career-orien- tation on the part of their younger students. At many American campuses, professors compete to teach in El- derhostel, because older students, with their rich life ex- perience, have proved themselves ideal audiences for liberal education. While the socioeconomic status .of Eldershostelers tends to be above average, we should not assume that liberal education can appeal only to the upper-middle- classes. Other program models exist as well: 100 The Senior Center Humanities Program, sponsored bythe National Council on Aging, brings humanitieslearning to senior citizens -in local neighborhood set-tings. It is funded by the National Endowment for theHumanities and relies on local discussion groups con-ducted by voluntary leaders at senior centers, nursinghomes, nutrition sites, and other community locations.Groups focus on such subjects as \"The RememberedPast: 1914 to 1945\" and \"Exploring Local History.\"The program continues high-quality texts with a sen-sitivity and awareness about adapting materials to localinterest. Carefully prepared anthologies serve as a basisfor discussions and include selections from literature,philosophy, autobiography, folklore, and arts. Whileusing materials that are nationally produced and dis-tributed, the Humanities Program has demonstrated itsappeal to widely diverse groups of elderly people. Theeducational and socio-economic profile of its 75,000 par-ticipants is virtually identical with a profile of the U.S.population over age sixty-five.One of the greatest challenges America faces in thetransition to an aging society is how to increase theavailability and the quality of services in a period whengovernment funding is tighter than ever. The answermay be found in educational programs that help olderpeople learn skills for self-sufficiency to cope with theproblems of aging. A last example suggests the potentialof late-life education for encouraging productive rolesfor older people outside the marketplace.The Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center ofSanta Monica, California combines older-adult educa-tion with organized self-help groups. Classes and work-shops are focused on blood-pressure control, nutrition,stress management, exercise, and health education.Health screening and referral services, linked to nearbyhospitals, are also available. The Santa Monica Centeris nationally known for recruiting and training peercounselors, elderly people who work with other olderpeople in emotional distress.The Santa Monica program illustrates the potential ofolder people to learn new skills when the motivationand the opportunity are present. Institutions, profes-sionals, volunteers, and self-help groups all collaboratein a comprehensive approach. What the experience sug-gests is that more institutional and professional support could encourage other programs that could build on the capacity for self-help and self-change in later life. Any list of the concerns of the elderly today would have to include health care, nutrition, crime prevention, and long-term care. These are areas where government at all levels has tried to respond, but typically the re- sponse has been only to provide more services for people in immediate need, with never enough money to pro- vide services for all who actually need them. In health care, for example, we spend billions of dollars on treat- ment, but virtually nothing on preventing illness or on teaching older people how to care for themselves. An alternative strategy would be to invest in educat- ing older people to do more for themselves. Education for older people is sometimes viewed as a \"frill,\" a view that -seems short-sighted indeed, especially at a time when the \"self-help ethos,\" as Frank Riessman has called it, is growing rapidly as mutual self-help groups have proliferated;12 by some estimates, they now in- volve over 15 million Americans. Mutual-aid groups are especially appropriate for certain concerns of old age- widowhood, vulnerability to crime, and coping with chronic illnesses such as arthritis, hypertension, and di- abetes, for example. Their experiential learning style offers an approach to education that is tied to concrete motivation for change. Instead of a \"hard path\" of con- stantly expanding services for a dependent population, we would opt for a \"soft path,\" where education through self-help builds coping skills along with self- esteem. The hard path is not only expensive; it also reinforces the \"learned helplessness;\" of old people in the face of bureaucracy and professional interventions. By con- trast, the soft path provides new skills and knowledge to make older people productive in ways that are not measured in the marketplace. Perhaps the most excit- ing potential for self-help lies in its possibilities for en- couraging older people and professionals alike to trans- form their images of what \"dependency\" or \"productivi- 12 Alan Gartner and Frank Riessman, The Self-Help Revolution (New York: Human Sciences Press, 1984). ty\" in old age might mean, a critical step in refashion-ing social policy for an aging society.13 SCENARIOS FOR THE FUTURE Beyond the Linear Life Plan Willard Wirtz, among others, has argued against thelinear life plan, with its rigid separation of learning,work, and leisure.14 Indeed, survey data suggest thatmost Americans would prefer alternative work sched-ules: not merely schedules that make working timemore flexible, but those that radically break up thethree \"boxes\" of life. In one survey, 80 percent of re-spondents favored some version of a \"cyclic\" life plan-that is, one that offered reduced schooling during youth,more flexible retirement, and greater options for educa-tion and leisure throughout the life course.15 Individual preferences aside, there are convincingpolicy-based arguments for favoring a more flexible lifecourse: as a way to reduce the rising cost of student-aiddependency; as a device to avert financial threats toSocial Security; and as an incentive to engage people inproductive work during more years of life. Why, then,has employment been progressively compressed into themiddle period of life? The real answer, it appears, isthat our economy is not structured to create enoughjobs for youth and for those elderly who want to work.It is pressures to achieve higher levels of productivitywhich require the intensive use of skilled human re-sources during the middle period of life. The linear lifeplan, far from being based on the mere \"human conven-tion\" that Wirtz decried, is sustained by the mostdeeply rooted drives of the advanced industrial econo-mies-the impetus towards maximizing profits and pro-moting efficiency. While it is true, therefore, that flexible work sched-ules have come to be adopted at the margin, it is worthnoting that total hours in the work week have not 13 Peter Townsend, \"The Structured Dependency of the Elderly: A Cre-ation of Social Policy in the 20th Century,\" Ageing and Society, March1981, pp. 5-28; Alan Walker, \"The of Ageingand Society, Nov. 1983, pp. 87-95.14 Willard Wirtz, The Boundless Resource (Washington, DC: New Repub-lic Book Co., 1975). 15 Survey by Fred Best, cited by Robert Hamrin in his Managing Growthin the 1980s (New York: Praeger, 1980), p. 282. 103 fallen since World War II, even though the years of completed schooling have risen, and the average age ofretirement has dropped. These long-term trends suggestthat there may be limits to just how far the linear lifeplan can be modified. If this conclusion is true, then it follows that much more attention should be devoted to education for non-monetized forms of productivity for older people. Retraining for paid employment will remain an important option, but clearly it should not become the exclusive criterion for policy. The Information Economy The structure of the century-old \"modernized\" life course is now being reshaped by new economic forces as America becomes a post-industrial information econo- my. In turn, education will be broken down into new categories corresponding to a new economic imperative for the production and distribution of knowledge: -the formal educational system, which is the largestsector of the human services and provides the prin- cipal occupation for most people during the firstquarter of their lives; -a parallel but \"invisible\" instructional system spon- sored by business and industry, now operating on ascale that exceeds the total expenditures for formalhigher education; and -the still more informal and widely dispersed learn- ing systems that we identify with publishing, mass media, culture, entertainment, and the communica- tions industry. Each of these segments of the information economy promotes learning over the life course, but each does soin very different ways and with different policies andpurposes. Roughly speaking, each of these subsectors ofthe knowledfe industry can be correlated with the\"modernized' life -cycle, that is, with the life stages of youth, midlife, and old age. Thus, the formal education system, with the near-monopoly it wields over the uses of time during the first quarter of life, has concentrated on youth. Business and industry have concentrated on the second quarter of life, but have largely ignored middle-aged and older workers. Finally, we have the informal learning system that occupies an increasing part of most people's lives. Older people are linked to the information economy chiefly 104 through the mass media. The elderly watch televisionmore than any other age group, and for many oldpeople TV provides the major leisure activity of theirlives. The advent of an information economy, then, hasnot fundamentally altered the \"modernized\" life cycle,with its segmentation of education, work, and leisure.Apart from the informal learning system, major institu-tions have neglected to provide-or even to conceive ofproviding-learning for people in the third quarter oflife or beyond. Those analysts who have seen the outlines of a\"learning society\" in the new post-industrial economyare surely correct; the role of knowledge workers, theprimacy of human-capital formation, and the spread ofan information economy are all trends likely to favorlifelong learning. But this version of lifelong learningmay not mean that greater resources are available forthe formal education system. On the contrary, it is in-dustrial training and the informal learning system thatmay become the primary educational channels, drawingfunding away from the formal system. This could meana loss in our capacity for long-range thinking abouthuman resources, a loss that would be particularly dam-aging in an aging society. The Need for a Long-Range Perspective The formal educational system-our schools and col-leges-still represents the central vehicle that we havefor developing human resources in our society. For aperiod of nearly two decades, on average, we turn overour children and young people to institutions chargedwith developing those capacities that will sustain them throughout their lives.Here the contrast with corporate education and train-ing is striking. With rare exceptions-such as IBM orXerox-American business enterprises do not approachemployee training with a long-range view to nurturingskills and abilities. Short-range thinking prevails. In anaging society, we will begin to pay the price for this lim-ited view of human development, in the same way thatAmerican business is now recognizing the limits ofshort-range thinking tied only to the current year's bal-ance sheet. * It would be less damaging if this kind of short-sight-ed, present-oriented thinking were characteristic of 105 business and industry alone. Unfortunately, higher edu-cation has been guilty of it too, both in the \"marketing\" orientation of continuing-education offerings, and in thevery narrow career-education programs that have dis- placed liberal education in many colleges and universi-ties. Early specialization to gain an advantage intoday's market leaves students ill-equipped to developdeeper and more widely ranging capacities as they growolder. Yet the extended life span, combined with the obsoles- cence of so much knowledge, means that the time frame will have to be stretched still further. If a fifty-year-old worker still has twenty years of work life and perhaps a full thirty-five years of life expectancy ahead, then short-run thinking no longer makes sense. Life-Span Development or Market Imperatives? There is no longer any question about the ability of older adults to learn or to benefit from education, but there is an astonishing lag between what is now known about development over the life span and what our major social institutions prescribe for the different stages of life. Our traditional images tell us that youth, not age, is the time for learning, and the new boom in non-traditional learning has not really challenged that traditional image. Instead, we have expanded our image of youth into middle adulthood, and the advent of con- tinuing education has introduced market imperatives while driving out human development goals at everyturn. The effect of market imperatives has been to extend the dominance of credentialism over the entire life course. This is not human development so much as it is defensive education in a competitive job market. In a period of rapid social and technological change, this middle-class style of lifelong learning becomes increas- ingly necessary for those who wish to get ahead or to appear well-informed; it is a style of adult educationthat may allow little room for older learners, for it re- gards them as superfluous to the tasks within the eco- nomic system. Unlike education for the young, educa- tion for the older adult is not perceived as a necessity for the maintenance of society. From this credential-ob- sessed perspective, old people .may pursue education, but it is strictly a private pursuit for leisure-time activi- 106 ty, with no larger meaning or purpose. Here we see aview of old age as a phase of life that is separated frompast and future generations, and finally cut off fromany shared future.16 It is the persistence of this viewthat feeds our secret despair about the last stage oflife.17 The most gloomy scenario would perceive the agingsociety as an age-polarized society, with older andyounger generations pitted against one another by op-posing interests. Diminishing numbers of childrenwould mean that support for public education would de-cline, while late-life education would remain a privateaffair among the elite. In this scenario, both higher edu-cation and business move increasingly towards ahuman-capital model of learning under the control ofprivate decision-makers. While an enlarged informationeconomy would provide unending entertainment to dis-tract the very young and the very old, short-term inter-est would be determined solely by marketing consider-ations. An alternative scenario would envision the aging soci-ety as a society where education at last becomes a life-long enterprise, an opportunity for both young and old.The \"three boxes of life\" would give way to an ideal ofcontinuing human development that extends over theentire life course. This ideal implies a vast expansion ofretraining for middle-aged and older workers, just as itcalls for a redesign of educational curricula to take ac-count of the rich experience of older learners.The greatest difference between these two scenarioslies not so much in their differing economic forecasts asin a fundamental question of values. Is the new abun-dance of life now produced by gains in longevity to be regarded as a problem or an opportunity? Are youngerand older generations simply \"interest-groups,' or areall generations bound in obligations toward a commongood? The experimentalism and vitality of Americaneducation at all levels has always been based on ashared public vision of individual opportunity workingtowards the common good. That history gives some 16 See the chapter on \"Old Age\" in Christopher Lasch, The Culture ofNarcissism (New York: W.W. Norton, 1977). 17 On ego-integrity versus despair in old age, cf.

Deaths from stroke and heart disease are declin- ing. 17. Older people on the average take more medica- tions than younger people. 18. Snake oil salesmen are as common today as they were on the frontier. 19. Personality changes with age, just like hair color and skin texture. (109) 20. Sight declines with age. Answers: 1. False. Even among those who live to be 80 or older,only 20-25 percent develop Alzheimer's disease or someother incurable form of brain disease. \"Senility\" is ameaningless term which should be discarded.2. False. The American family is still the number onecaretaker of older Americans. Most older people liveclose to their children and see them often; many livewith their spouses. In all, 8 out of 10 men and 6 out of10 women live in family settings.3. True. Depression, loss of self-esteem, loneliness, andanxiety can become more common as older people faceretirement, the deaths of !relatives and friends, andother such crises-often at the same time. Fortunately,depression is treatable. 4. True. Today, 12 percent of the U.S. population are65 or older. By the year 2030, one in five people will beover 65 years of age. .5. True. Only 5 percent of the older population live innursing homes; the rest are basically healthy and self-sufficient. 6. False. Mental confusion and serious forgetfulnessin old age can be caused by Alzheimer disease or otherconditions which cause incurable damage to the brain,but some 100 other problems can cause the same symp-toms. A minor head injury, a high fever, poor nutrition,adverse drug reactions and depression can all be treatedand the confusion will be cured. 7. False. Intelligence per se does not decline withoutreason. Most people maintain their intellect or improveas they grow older. .8. False. Most older people can lead an active, satisfy-ing sex life. 9. False. Stopping smoking at any age not only reducesthe risk of cancer and heart disease, it also leads tohealthier lungs. 10. False. Many older people enjoy-and benefitfrom--exercises such as walking, swimming, and bicycleriding. Exercise at any age can help strengthen theheart and lungs, and lower blood pressure. See yourphysician before beginning a new exercise program.11. False. Although certain requirements, such asthat for \"sunshine\" vitamin D, may increase slightly 111 with age, older people need the same amounts of most vitamins and minerals as younger people. Older people in particular should eat nutritious food and cut down on sweets, salty snack foods, high-calorie drinks, and alco- hol. 12. False. Older people require fewer calories, but ade- quate intake of calcium for strong bones can become more important as you grow older. This is particularly true for women, whose risk of osteoporosis increases after menopause. Milk and cheese are rich in calcium as are cooked dried beans, collards, and broccoli. Some people need calcium supplements as well. 13. True. The body's thermostat tends to function less efficiently with age and the older person's body may be less able to adapt to heat or cold. 14. True. Falls are the most common cause of injuries among the elderly. Good safety habits, including proper lighting, nonskid carpets, and keeping living areas free of obstacles, can help prevent serious accidents. 15. False. Women tend to outlive men by an average of 8 years. There are 150 women for every 100 men over age 65, and nearly 250 women for every 100 men over 85. 16. True. Fewer men and women are dying of stroke or heart disease. This has been a major factor in the in- crease in life expectancy. 17. True. The elderly consume 25 percent of all medi- cations and, as a result, have many more problems with adverse drug reactions. 18. True. Medical quackery is a $10 billion business in the United States. People of all ages are commonly duped into \"quick cures\" for aging, arthritis, and cancer. 19. False. Personality doesn't change with age. There- fore, all old people can't be described as rigid and can- tankerous. You are what you are for as long as you live. But you can change what you do to help yourself to good health. 20. False. Although changes in vision become more common with age, any change in vision, regardless of age, is related to a specific disease. If you are having problems with your vision, see your doctor. 112 WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

The likelihood of a stroke can be re-duced- 115 a. by quitting smoking, adopting sensible eating habits-low cholesterol and low fat diets-and con- trolling high blood pressure. b. by keeping under control and not allowing a bad temper to explode. c. somewhat. Research shows that the death rate from stroke has fallen only slightly despite preven- tive measures. 20. Many older people complain that they don't sleep as well as they used to. Their sleep may be troubled be- cause- a. they take more medications. b. they are anxious about retirement and other major life changes. c. they have a variety of medical problems,. such as arthritis or cardiovascular disease that are common with age. d. all of the above. Answers: 1. c. Older adults can and do learn new skills relative- ly .easily. In fact, in properly designed programs, older individuals can benefit from training as much as, and sometimes more, than younger people. 2. a. Experience-based intelligence remains stable or improves slightly well into late adulthood. In many jobs, the expertise of older workers allows them to be among the safest and most productive employees. The speed and efficiency of processing information can decline, however, with increasing age. Recent scientific experi- ments show that, with practice,. older adults can reverse some of these effects. 3. a. Picasso painted until his death in his 90's and Grandma Moses kept painting until she died at age 101. In addition, many not-so-famous older adults take on second or third careers, try new hobbies, or begin closer interpersonal relationships after age 65. 4. c. Depression can be treated successfully and should be taken seriously because it is a major risk factor for suicide. It is not a normal part of aging, al- though many older adults suffer from it. Adverse drug reactions, illness, certain life events, and other factors can cause older people to become depressed. 5. b. Psychotherapy (\"talk\" therapy) has proven suc- cessful for older people and its benefits can last for' 116 many years. At age 65, people continue to live an aver-age of 16.8 years. Those over age 85 represent the fast-est growing age group. 6. b. It is true that nerve cell loss begins by about age2 and progresses throughout life. But normal nerve cellloss is not believed to have a significant effect on over-all performance because people continue to learn asthey age. Excessive nerve loss associated with illness cancause problems. 7. c. Studies indicate that a small but important per-centage of Alzheimer's disease patients come from fami-lies in which the disease occurs more often than in thegeneral population. This suggests that genetic factorsplay an important role in those families. Scientists havenot yet been able to establish how much of a role genet-ics plays in the vast majority of families, however, andthey have yet to identify other factors causing the dis-ease. 8. c. Memory loss in older people can have manycauses, and often can be treated. While Alzheimer's dis-ease or other dementing disorders can cause memoryloss, other factors can include depression, reactions tosome drugs, and head injury.9. c. There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease,but much can be done to treat the symptoms of the dis-ease that cause suffering and discomfort.- Several medi-cal or social interventions can be used, including drugtherapy for depression and simplifying, the patient's en-vironment. 10. d. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can only beconfirmed by autopsy after death. In the living patient,the diagnosis is strongly suggested only after all otherpossible causes of dementia are systematically ruledout. 11. c. Neither. Scientists have not proven that\"mental gymnastics\" can keep an aging human brainhealthy that otherwise might have begun to decline, butthey have- found there might be some benefit to \"exer-cising\" the brain. Laboratory research shows that ani-mals in stimulating environments can release chemicalsin their brains related to keeping nerve cells healthyand active. 12. a. When an older person shows significant person-ality or behavior changes, it is usually a signal thatsomething else is wrong. For example, a new, growing hostility in relationships with others can mark serious, hidden depression. 13. b. A dread of death is not typical for healthy older adults. When it occurs in older people, it is usually re- lated to depression or a struggle with terminal illness. In healthy adults, a fear of death is actually more common in middle age. 14. b. The risk of suicide rises with age. Older white males are the group most at risk. 15. a. False. For the vast majority of older adults, worry is not a problem. One recent study of people in their 90's found that over 70 percent report that they are in good spirits, never feel lonely, and are free from worry. 16. b. TOTs are often just temporary mental glitches, although word finding problems may be slightly more frequent among older adults. Scientists are studying TOTs to see how the brain stores and retrieves informa- tion, hoping to explain a range of language and memory problems, such as those that occur after a stroke. In some cases, however, word finding problems can be a sign of Alzheimer's disease. Older adults should be mon- itored closely to see if word finding becomes a serious difficulty. 17. b. Emotional state plays a greater role than normal aging changes in causing sexual problems in older adults. Depression can significantly interfere with sexual interest, motivation, and fantasy life in one's later years. It is one of the most common causes of im- potence in older men and is treatable. 18. a. About 4 million people now have Alzheimer's disease. That humber could exceed 14 million by 2040 without significant scientific progress on the causes of the disease and possible treatments. 19. a. These approaches have been so successful that the death rate from stroke has fallen as much as 50 per- cent since 1970. The decline also has been due to more advanced diagnostic tests and treatments. 20. d. Although the quality of sleep can change as people age, most older people spend the same amount of time sleeping as they did when they were younger. Good sleep habits, including exercising, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, and going to sleep at the same time every night, can help with troubled sleep. 118 (This quiz is the brainchild of Gene D. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., Acting Director of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and is based in large part of the work of NIA scientists and grantees. This research has contrib- uted to understanding that societal stereotypes about aging are based on confusion between what is normal aging and the diseases frequently associated with ad- vancing age.) APPENDIX C A SYNOPSIS OF MAJOR FEDERAL STATUTES PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION (Kevin B. Greely, Legislative Attorney, American Law Division,Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress) The following is a brief summary of the major Feder-al statutes which authorize the provision of Federal as- sistance for adult and continuing education programs.Generally these.statutes authorize Federal assistance tobe provided to an appropriate State agency (e.g., theState Educational Agency) which distributes the fundsto local governmental agencies and other public and pri-vate entities to actually operate the programs. Althoughonly a few of the laws authorize these programs to beprovided specifically to the elderly, elderly individualsare generally eligible to take advantage of the servicesif they meet the requirements for program participa-tion. Adult Education Act (20 US.C. \u00a7 1201) The Adult Education Act provides a means by whichadults, including older adults, may obtain the basic edu-cational skills needed to function in society. The Act au-thorizes a number of programs in which grants areawarded by the Department of Education to State andlocal, public and private institutions to assist in the de-velopment and operation of adult education activitiesincluding: \"basic grants\" to assist the States in theirfunding of adult education programs and services (in-cluding services to be provided to persons at correction-al institutions and other institutionalized persons);grants to public-private partnerships to develop \"work-place literacy training\" programs; grants to States forthe development and operation of services for persons oflimited English proficiency; and grants to assist in theimplementation of various nationally-oriented programs. grams. (119) 59-854 -92 -5 120 Part B of the Act establishes the \"basic grants\" pro-gram under which the Secretary of Education is author- ized to \"make grants to States to assist in funding adulteducation programs, services, and activities\" carried out by local educational agencies (e.g., local boards of educa-tion) and public and private nonprofit agencies, institu-tions and organizations. Each State receives an initialallotment of $250,000 (Guam, American Samoa, theNorthern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and theTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands are given a $100,000 allotment) and an additional allotment basedon the percentage of adults within the State who do nothave high school diplomas (or its equivalent) and whoare not currently required to be enrolled in secondary school relative to the total number of such persons inall States. To receive the allotment, States are requiredto submit a \"State Plan\" for the provision of adult edu-cation services during the period for which the plan isin effect. In addition, the State must designate the Stateeducational agency (e.g., the State Department of Edu-cation) as the agency solely responsible for the adminis-tration and supervision of services funded under theprogram. Upon receipt of the basic grant, funds are ad-ministered to local educational agencies and other public or private nonprofit agencies, organizations, andinstitutions to actually develop and operate the adulteducation programs. At least 10 percent of the allot-ment received by the State education agency must beused to make grants to cover the costs of various educa-tion programs for criminal offenders in correctional in-stitutions and other institutionalized persons. An addi-tional 10 percent must be used to make grants to appli-cants proposing \"special projects\" involving the utiliza-tion of innovative methods, materials, or programs which may have national significance in the delivery ofadult education services.Part C of the Act, authorizes the Workplace Literacyand English Literacy programs. Under the WorkplaceLiteracy program, \"demonstation grants\" are made topartnerships of business or labor organizations andState or local educational agencies, institutions ofhigher education or individual schools to provide serv- ices to teach literacy skills needed in the workplace. Proposed services for which funds may be awardedunder the workplace literacy program include: (1) serv- ices that provide adult literacy and other basic skills; (2)programs providing adult secondary education services and activities leading to the attainment of a high schooldiploma (or its equivalent); (3) services which meet theliteracy needs of adults with limited English proficien- cy; (4) programs designed to upgrade or update the basicskills of workers to keep pace with changes in work- place requirements, technology, products, or processes; (5) programs to improve employee communication andproblem solving skills; and (6) services to provide educa-tion counseling, transportation, and child care servicesto workers participating in the program. Under the English Literacy program, grants are madeto States which have submitted State Plans (in accord- ance with Part B) to assist in the States' funding of pro-grams for individuals with limited English. proficiency. Of the funds awarded to the State, at least 50 percentmust be used to subsidize programs operated by commu- nity-based organizations that demonstrate the capabil-ity to administer English proficiency programs. In addi-tion, the Secretary is required under the Act, subject tothe availability of funds, to carry out a program de-signed to develop innovative approaches and methods of educating persons with limited English proficiencythrough the administration of grants and the execution of contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies,institutions, and organizations; and to designate theCenter for Applied Linguistics of the Office of Educa- tional Research and Improvement as the national clear-inghouse for the collection and dissemination of infor- mation on innovative literacy education techniques.Part D of the Act authorizes grants to be made toState and local eligible recipients to assist in the imple-mentation of nationally oriented adult education pro- grams and services. Under this part, the Secretary ofEducation makes grants to States and local eligible re- cipients to assist in the development of adult education programs for migrant farmworkers and immigrants. In addition, Part D authorizes the \"Adult Literacy Volun- teer Training Program\" in which grants are provided to State and local eligible recipients to support the plan- ning and implementation of programs designed to train adult volunteers, especially the elderly, to participate astutors in local adult education programs. In order to re- ceive Federal funding for these activities, States must 122 include a proposal to provide such services in the StatePlan required to be submitted to receive assistanceunder the \"basic grants\" program. Allan J. Ellander Fellowship Program (20 US.C. \u00a73081) Enacted as part of the Hawkins-Stafford Elementaryand Secondary Education Amendments of 1988, thisprovision authorizes the Secretary of Education to makegrants to the Close Up Foundation-a nonprofit organi-zation located in Washington, D.C.-to provide financialassistance to economically disadvantaged older Ameri- cans and recent immigrants who participate in theFoundation's program of educating individuals aboutthe Federal Government. Bilingual Education Act (20 US.C. \u00a7 3281) This act establishes authority for the Secretary ofEducation to make grants to local educational agencies,institutions of higher education and private nonprofit organizations to develop and operate programs to teachchildren in their native language and to enable children of limited English proficiency (and their families) to become competent in the use of the English language. Under Part A of the Act, grant recipients are author- ized to use the funds granted to establish, and operate\"family English literacy programs\" in which parentsand out-of-school family members of limited Englishproficient students are trained to become literate in theEnglish language.In order, to receive funding under the program, eligi- ble recipients (i.e., local educational agencies, institu- tions of higher education and private nonprofit organi- zations) are required to submit an application contain- ing information regarding: the number of persons who will be served by the program; activities to be undertak- en with the grant and how these activities will promote English literacy; the extent to which persons to be served by the program have been involved in program development; and prior experience of the applicant in providing education services to persons with limited English proficiency. Grants are provided for the devel- opment of a family English literacy program for a period of 3 years. In addition, Part C of the Act authorizes the Secre-tary to make grants to eligible recipients to assist in the 123 funding of programs to train educational personnel par-ticipating in bilingual education programs. Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied TechnologyEducation Act (20 US.C. 2301) Enacted in 1990, the stated purpose of the Carl D.Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology EducationAct, is to \"concentrat[e] resources on improving educa-tional programs leading to academic and occupationalskill competencies needed to work in a technologically. advanced society.\" Title I of the Act sets out the allot-ment of Federal funds which each State is to receive incarrying out various vocational and applied technologyeducation programs authorized under the Act. In addi-tion, Title I authorizes the Secretary of Education tomake grants or enter into contracts with Indian Tribesor schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs andorganizations representing Hawaiian natives to plan,conduct and administer such programs. Title I also re-quires States wishing to receive Federal assistanceunder the act to designate a State Board of VocationalEducation to be the sole agency responsible for the ad-ministration and supervision of State vocational educa-tion programs, and a State Council on Vocational Edu-cation to serve in an advisory capacity to the StateBoard and the Governor. Title II authorizes the Secretary of Education to makegrants to States from funds allotted under Title I tofund State programs to improve the professional devel-opment of vocational education teachers and the devel-opment of vocational education curricula. In addition,this title requires each State to use a portion of its allot-ment to develop programs to provide single parents, dis-placed homemakers, and single pregnant women withmarketable skills; to provide vocational education serv- ices to juvenile and adult criminal offenders in correc-tional institutions within the State; and to distributefunds to local educational agencies, area vocational edu-cation schools, and institutions offering postsecondaryand adult vocational education programs. Programs authorized under Title III include: pro-grams provided by community-based organizations, con-sumer and homemaking education, grants for careerguidance and counseling activities, grants for vocationaleducation-related partnerships between business, labor, 124 and educational organizations and agencies; \"tech-prep\"programs provided by a consortia of local educationalagencies and post-secondary institutions; grants for theacquisition and improvement of facilities and equip-ment; grants for tribally controlled postsecondary voca-tional education institutions. In addition, Title IV au-thorizes the provision of Federal assistance for bilingualvocational education and training programs for individ-uals with limited English proficiency. Displaced Homemakers Self-Sufficiency Assistance Actof 1990 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301) This act generally authorizes the Secretary of Laborto make grants to State agencies and nonprofit organi-zations to support the provision of education, employ-ment training, and supportive services to \"displacedhomemakers.\" Under the Act, funds are provided to theStates in one of two ways depending on the amount ofmoney Congress appropriates to carry out the Act.When the appropriation is less than. $25 million, theSecretary of Labor is required to award grants, on acompetitive basis, to public agencies and nonprofit orga-nizations that have experience in administering pro-grams that serve displaced homemakers. Recipients of acompetitive grant award may use the funds to provideservices including: basic skills, literacy, and bilingualtraining; job development and placement; and life skillsdevelopment. In addition, funds may be used to supportstatewide \"model\" programs that provide special serv-ices for rural and minority displaced homemakers andwomen age 40 and older, and for the provision of \"non-traditional\" or self-employment training. In years in which Congress has appropriated $25 mil-lion or more, the Secretary of Labor is required to allotfunds to each State, the amount of which to be based onthe number of persons aged 22 to 64 in the State rela-tive to the total population of such persons in theUnited States. In order to receive the allotment, theGovernor of each State must designate one State agencyas the \"State administrative entity\" to be responsiblefor the receipt and distribution of the Federal funds.Once the funds are received, the State administrativeentity is required to award grants, on a competitivebasis, to \"eligible service providers,\" which will providethe education, training-related, and supportive services. 125 Entities which may receive a grant ward as an \"eligible service higher education; area vocational education schools; and other institutions designated by the Governor to provide services to displaced homeworkers. Persons eligible to participate in the programs funded under the Act include homemakers: (A) who have been dependent either-(i) on public assistance and whose youngest child is within 2 years of losing eligibility for benefits under the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, or (ii) on the income of an- other family member but no longer supported by that income; and (B) who are unemployed or underemployed and are experiencing difficulty in obtaining or upgrad- ing employment.

Title I of the Act authorizes the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program in which individuals are selected and trained by ACTION (the Federal domestic volunteer agency) to serve, on a full-time basis, as vol- unteers with public and private nonprofit organizations. At least 20 percent of the applicants selected as VISTA volunteers must be persons age 55 or older. Title II of the Act establishes the \"Older American Volunteer Programs\" (comprised of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, the Foster Grandparent Program, and the Senior Companion Program) in which grants are provided to the State or other public or private non- profit organizations to fund programs in which older in- dividuals serve as volunteers in various community service projects. Grant recipients under the Retired Senior Volunteer Program are required as a condition of receiving a grant to provide volunteers with \"such short term training as may be necessary to make the most effective use of the skills and talents of participat- ing volunteers.\" In addition, Part C of Title II-govern- ing Senior Companion programs-authorizes the Direc- tor of ACTION to recruit senior companion volunteer trainers to train program volunteers to monitor initial 126 and continuing in-home service needs of the homeboundelderly recipients of the program. Higher Educational Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001) Originally enacted in 1965, the Higher Education Actestablishes a comprehensive program of financial assist-ance to students to help defray the costs of acquiring apost-secondary education through grants, insured loans,work-study, fellowships, and scholarships. The Act is ad-ministered by the Department of Education.Title I of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Educa-tion to make grants to institutions of higher educationto assist in the development and operation of programstailored to the special needs of \"nontraditional stu-dents\" (i.e., adults). Under Title II, grants are awardedto institutions of higher education for the acquisitionand maintenance of needed library resources, includingthe acquisition of advanced technological equipment.Title III authorizes the awarding of Federal grantswhich may be used by eligible colleges and universitiesto generally improve the academic quality and financialstability of the institution. Title IV of the Act by far comprises the most exten-sive programs authorized under the Higher EducationAct. This title establishes a number of financial assist-ance programs for eligible students at institutions ofpostsecondary education to subsidize the cost of attend-ance at such institutions. Forms of assistance providedfor under the act include: Basic Educational Opportuni-ty (or Pell) Grants, Supplemental Educational Opportu-nity Grants, the Robert C. Byrd Scholarship Program,the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan Program, and theNational Direct Student (or Perkins) Loan Program. Inaddition, Title IV establishes special programs for stu-dents from disadvantaged backgrounds and studentswhose families are engaged in migrant and seasonalfarmwork, as well as grants to States to assist in thefunding of State student assistance programs.Other programs authorized by the act include: pro-grams to enhance the recruitment and improve thetraining of teachers (Title V); grants to institutions ofhigher education to develop and operate programs toenhance international and foreign language study (TitleVI); grants and loans for the construction, reconstruc-tion, and renovation of academic facilities (Title VII); 127 grants for cooperative education programs (Title VIII); institutional grants and student fellowships for gradu- ate programs (Title IX); grants to institutions for pro- grams to generally improve the provision of postsecond- ary education (Title X); and grants to postsecondary in- stitutions to encourage partnerships between such insti- tutions and units of local government, labor, business, industry, and community organizations to develop pro- grams which will promote economic and community de- velopment (Title XI). Indian Education Act of 1988, Subpart 3 (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2631) This Act authorizes the Secretary of .Education, through the Office of Indian Education to make grants to State and local educational agencies and to Indian tribes, institutions and organizations to assist in the de- velopment of basic literacy programs for Indian adults and programs that will provide such adults opportuni- ties to qualify for a high school equivalency certificate. Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400) This act authorizes a number of grants programs to \"assure that all children with disabilities have available to them * * * a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services de- signed to meet their unique needs * * * Under Part D of the Act, the Secretary of Education is authorized to make grants to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations to assist in the training of personnel for careers in special education and related services.

APPENDIX D ELDERLY: STATE SURVEY OF STATUTES OR POLICY CON- CERNING TUITION FEES IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITU- TIONS (M. Ann Wolfe, Paralegal Specialist, American Law Division, Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress) SUMMARY The statutes of the 50 States and the District of Co- lumbia were searched for information which would allow or require a waiver or reduction of tuition fees for elderly persons who attend courses at State-supported institutions of higher education. It was discovered that 29 States 1 have established some sort of guideline within their statutes on this subject. Nine 2 additional States have created a State policy to waive or reduce such fees mostly on a space-available basis. The rest of the States 3 have remained silent both in their statutes and in their written State policies. It is common prac- tice for individual educational institutions within all of the 50 States and the District of Columbia to establish their own tuition reduction policies, either in conform- ance with legislation or State policy or at their own ini- tiative. The statutes cited in this report are often available in the local libraries of the respective States. For more de- tailed information of the law in these States, it is sug- gested that these statutes be consulted. In those States where a State policy has been established, more infor- 1 Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michi- gan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vir- ginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. 2 Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Okla- homa, Oregon, and South Dakota. 3 Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Iowa, Maine, Missis- sippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wy- oming. 142 mation can be attained by calling the telephone numberlisted under such State in this report.

ANN WOLFE, Paralegal Specialist, American Law Division, March 28, 1991. UPDATE OF STATE SURVEY OF STATUTES CONCERNING TUITION FEES IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS A computer search of State statutes concerning the waiver or reduction of tuition fees for the elderly in 152 higher education institutions within the 50 States and the District of Columbia, was undertaken on September 3, 1991. This search revealed that changes should be made in two States, Maryland and Massachusetts. In addition to \u00a7 13-301 as reported on page 5 for theState of Maryland, two sections should be included from the Maryland Education Code, i.e., \u00a7 14-107 and \u00a7 14-206. These sections specifically name Morgan State Uni- versity and St. Mary's College, respectively, as waiving tuition under the same conditions that are specified for the University of Maryland (\u00a7 13-301). Also, since this report was printed, Massachusetts has repealed 69 \u00a7 7G and has enacted Chapter 142, Acts of 1991, \u00a7 19. This law directs the Higher Education Co-ordinating Council to establish guidelines to administer tuition waivers for special categories, including senior citizens. As of September, 1991, the council guidelines have not been finalized. (Information verified via tele- phone conversation 9-91, by Joe Sullivan, Higher Edu- cation Coordinating Council, 617-727-7785.)Information concerning States which have not en- acted legislation has not been updated since March 1991, the date of this report.
