Currently, 387 million people are diagnosed with dia- betes mellitus, 90% with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A deficiency of insulin secretion leads to increased bloodglucose levels and organ damage, which further disruptsthe metabolism of the three major nutrients, namely, lipids,carbohydrates, and proteins [2, 3]. Various complicationsincluding nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, hyper-lipemia are observed in most diabetic patients [4]. Thelongitudinal data predict that patients with T2DM will havea much more aggressive course of disease with greater riskofearlyhypertensionandnephropathycomparedwithtype1(T1DM)patients[5].Diabeticnephropathyisamajorcauseofend-stagerenal d i s e a s ew i t hh i g hm o r t a l i t ya n dm o r b i d i t y[ 6 ] .D u r i n gt h epathogenic process, microalbuminuria follows macroalbu-minuria,leadingtorenaldysfunction.Multipleandcomplexmechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of diabeticnephropathy, which is characterized by persistent albumin-uria, elevated arterial blood pressure, and a decline inthe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [7].

The intensity of the bands was quantified by scanning densitometry using Image J software (National Institutes ofHealth,Bethesda,USA). 2.8. Statistical Analysis. All values were expressed as mean \u00b1SEM. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used comparisons (Dunn's test) using SPSS 16.0 software (IBMCorporation, Armonk, USA). A value of < 0.05 was consideredsignificant.3. Results 3.1. Hypoglycemic Effects on Diabetic Rats. Compared with thenormalcontrolgroup,thediabeticratsclearlyconsumedmore food and water and produced more urine ( <0.01 , Table 1). The four-week CM treatment at 2.0g/kg food intake was strongly reduced ( <0.01 , Table 1).

Discussion TheHFHSD-STZ-induceddiabeticratmodeliscloselyanal-ogous to the clinical situation of type 2 diabetes mellitusin humans [21]. Combined with the reduction in highfasting blood glucose levels, the modulation of OGTT, amore sensitive measure of early abnormality in glucoseregulation [22], the hypoglycemic activity [23]. Pyruvatekinase is a key glycolytic enzyme for promoting glucose metabolism and energy production [24]. All of the datasupport the antidiabetic activity of CM in the diet-STZ-induceddiabeticratmodel. AlthoughthepathogenesisofT2DM-inducedrenaldam- ageismultipleandcomplicated,dyslipidemiaandsubsequentlipotoxicity play important roles in this process and accel-erate kidney injury. Dyslipidemia, defined as abnormal lipidprofiles characterized by increased plasma and tissue levelsofTG,TC,andLDL[21],isamajorcomplicationassociatedwithhighmorbidityandmortalityindiabetics[25].Diabetes-related dyslipidemia is responsible for lipid accumulationin the kidney, which leads to insulin resistance, inflamma-tion, and oxidative stress [26]. Gradually, insulin resistanceresults in the release of protectioninHFHSD-STZ-induceddiabeticrats. Oxidative stress has been singled out as a major cause of diabeticcomplications,especiallynephropathy[29].O2and nitricoxide(NO)levelsareimportantinkidneyandvascularfunction [30]. ROS, which is responsible for oxidative dam-age,degradesmembranepolyunsaturatedfattyacidsthroughsequential processes [31] and elevates MDAlevels, which serve as biomarkers of tissue oxidative stress[32]. Excessive generation of ROS and MDA in the kidneysleads to tubular obstruction, back-leakage of renal tubules,and contraction of the mesangial cells, finally resulting inthe abnormal expression of renal function markers sucha sS c r ,B U N ,a l b u m i n u r i a ,a n dN A G[ 3 3 ] .H o w e v e r ,c e l l sdefend themselves against oxidative stress via the activa- tion of antioxidant enzymes. Antioxidant compounds are a common and effective way to prevent or inhibit pancreaticbeta-cell destruction caused by alloxan [34]. SOD catalyzesthe scavenges the hydroxyl radicals [35].The enhanced activity SOD and GSH-Px in the serumand kidneys of CM-treated diabetic rats helps to maintain abalanceofoxidantsandantioxidantsbycausingtheexcretionof ROS. Therefore, CM improves renal function by scaveng-ing free radicals, especially ROS and MDA. It is well knownthatinhibitionofAKTphosphorylationdownregulatesGSK-3phosphorylation [36]. Gardenamide A is reported to attenuate ROS levels by promoting the phosphorylation ofAKT, an effect that can be completely abrogated by the AKTinhibitor[37].InCM-treateddiet-STZ-reduceddiabeticrats,decreased AKT and GSK-3phosphorylation is responsible forthetranscriptionalexpressionofmultipleantioxidantstopreventdiabetes-relatedoxidativedamage. CD4+ T glomerular damage by recruiting macrophages andneutrophils[39].IL-6,secretedbytheglomerularmembranesystem, is responsible for the proliferation of mesangial cells and the release of inflammatory mediators, including superoxide anions [40]. As reported, TNF- upregulates the podocytes in coculture with glomerularendothelial cells [41]. Previous studies have reported that o x i d a t i v es t r e s si sm e d i a t e di np o d o c y t ea p o p t o s i si nt h e processofdiabeticnephropathy[42]andthattheprogressionof renal interstitial fibrosis can be inhibited by suppressingoxidative stress [43]. Thus, CM exerts renal protection in diabetic rats via the regulation of inflammatory factors that aremodulatedbyoxidativestress. AllofthedatasuggestthatCMtargetsmanymoleculesin the signaling of hyperglycemia, inflammation,and oxidativestress. This \"systemic targeting\" will completely eliminatethe symptoms of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy in amuch natural way, so that less adverse effect is expected.As a folk tonic food in China, CM has been emphasizingits safety with few adverse effects. Our subchronic toxictest provides experimental basis for its safety indicating that CM showed no influences on bodyweights (Table 1S),organ indexes (Table 2S), and kidney structures in mice(Figure 2S). On the other hand, the crude drug nature ofCM suggests multieffective components, which may showsynergistic effect on the disease. It may explain that non- dose-dependent manner was the common way of action of some herbal medicines. Amount of natural productions isreportedtoshowvariouspharmacologicalactivitiesvianon-dose-dependentmanner[44,45]. There is still a limitation in our present study. Although we confirmed the regulatory effects of Met and CM oninflammatoryfactorsinserum,wefailedtodetecttherelatedchanges in kidney tissues. As reported, Met successfullyregulates inflammatory cytokines associated with nephritisbutshowsnoinfluencesonkidneystructure[46].Ourfurtherstudywillfocusontheeffectsofdrugsonbiochemicalindicesandpathologicalchangesofkidney. In summary, we successfully explored the antidiabetic andantinephriticeffectsofCMindiet-STZ-induceddiabeticrats.
