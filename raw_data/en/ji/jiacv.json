Relaxation is a process that uses slow breathing and muscle-loosening exercises to physically and mentally calm the body. Relaxation techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, deep breathing, [massage](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/massage/), [aromatherapy ](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/aromatherapy/)and [yoga](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/individual-therapies/yoga/). Meditation is the practice of focusing awareness and attention on the present moment and on the senses of the body. It is an important part of many religions, including Buddhism and Hinduism, but you don't have to be religious to meditate. There are different types of meditation techniques, including breath work. Why use it Relaxation and meditation may help to release muscle tension, reduce anxiety and depression, and help improve quality of life. They may be used to help calm and relax the body and mind. What to expect Serene music may be played to create a peaceful environment. The therapist will guide you through exercises to teach you the skills of relaxation and meditation, which you can then do yourself at home. Guided imagery uses sound and vision to encourage your imagination to create pleasant thoughts. After a period of relaxation, you will usually be prompted to stay awake to enjoy your relaxed state of mind. Relaxation and meditation can be done sitting or lying down. What is the evidence? Clinical practice guidelines include offering a combination of guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation to people experiencing pain after cancer treatment. Clinical studies have shown that people being treated for cancer who practise relaxation have lower levels of anxiety, stress, pain and depression. Relaxation techniques have been shown to improve sleep. Some hospitals and cancer support groups offer relaxation and meditation groups. There are also many self-help podcasts, online videos and smartphone apps that will guide you through the different techniques. You could also listen to our meditation and relaxation podcast below.
