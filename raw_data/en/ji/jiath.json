The following documents are in PDF format, which requires the free Adobe Acrobat Reader. [Letter to the Reader](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Dear_Reader.aspx) Summary: Introductory letter to the reader. Volume I: Executive Summary through Chapter 4 [Volume I Front Matter](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_VolIFrontMatter.aspx) Summary: Frontmatter for Volume I of the Final Programmatic EIS document, including cover page, table of contents, notation, and units of measure. [Executive Summary](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_ExecutiveSummary.aspx) Summary: A brief overview of the Final Programmatic EIS, including summaries of the proposed action and alternatives, potential impacts and mitigation for alternative energy development, potential impacts and mitigation for alternate use of existing facilities, impacts from nonroutine conditions, and cumulative impacts of the proposed action. [Chapter 1: Introduction](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter1.aspx) Summary: Introduction to the Final Programmatic EIS, including purpose and need for this EIS, the scope of the analysis including what technologies and what portions of the OCS are considered, and the legal framework within which this EIS was produced. [Chapter 2: Proposed Action and Alternatives](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter2.aspx) Summary: Discussion of the proposed action considered in the Final Programmatic EIS, alternatives analyzed, and comparison of the alternatives. Alternatives discussed in detail include: the proposed action (i.e., the establishment of the Alternative Energy and Alternate Use Program on the OCS through rulemaking); a case-by-case alternative (i.e., BOEM would consider individual project proposals for alternative energy or alternate use on a case-by-case basis but would not issue formal regulations); a no action alternative (i.e., BOEM would not approve leases, easements, or rights-of-way for any alternative energy facility on the Federal OCS or alternate use of existing offshore facilities); and a preferred alternative (i.e., a combination of the proposed action and the case-by-case alternative). [Chapter 3: Overview of Potential Alternative Energy Technologies on the OCS](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter3.aspx) Summary: Chapter 3 summarizes potential alternative energy technologies available and screens out unlikely candidates; it also describes the general operating principle for each alternative energy technology considered, current development status, and the necessary site characteristics. [Chapter 4: Affected Environment](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter4.aspx) Summary: A description of the OCS areas that may be suitable for alternative energy development. Descriptions are presented by coastal region (Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific) and include each area's current use, physical characteristics (e.g., geology, oceanography, meteorology), marine biota and habitats, and socioeconomic characteristics. Volume II: Chapter 5 [Volume II Front Matter](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_VolIIFrontMatter.aspx) Summary: Frontmatter for Volume II of the Final Programmatic EIS document, including cover page, table of contents, notation, and units of measure. [Chapter 5: Potential Impacts of Alternative Energy Development on the OCS and Analysis of Potential Mitigation Measures](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter5.aspx) Summary: A description of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts for each alternative energy technology in terms of technology testing, site characterization, construction, operation, and decommissioning. Volume III: Chapter 6 through Chapter 12 [Volume III Front Matter](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_VolIIIFrontMatter.aspx) Summary: Frontmatter for Volume III of the Final Programmatic EIS document, including cover page, table of contents, notation, and units of measure. [Chapter 6: Alternate Uses of Existing Oil and Natural Gas Platforms on The OCS](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter6.aspx) Summary: Chapter 6 summarizes the characteristics of oil and gas platforms on the OCS likely to be retired from their current use; it also discusses potential uses for these retired platforms and presents the environmental and socioeconomic impacts for each alternate use (alternate uses considered are alternative energy projects, aquaculture, and research and monitoring). [Chapter 7: Analysis of The Proposed Action and Its Alternatives](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter7.aspx) Summary: Chapter 7 compares the estimated environmental impacts of alternative energy project activities on the OCS with other options either not employing their use or substituting other energy resources (e.g., coal- or gas-fired generation). [Chapter 8: Consultation and Coordination](http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy-Program/Regulatory-Information/Alt_Energy_FPEIS_Chapter8.aspx) Summary: A list of the activities involved in the preparation of the programmatic EIS, including public scoping, comments on the EIS, coordination among BOEM offices, and interactions with other Federal agencies.
