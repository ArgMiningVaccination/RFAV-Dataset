We declared war on cancer in the early 1970s, but clearly, we haven't beaten it, and we still fear it. We also fear more benign diseases that used to be shrugged off as a normal part of growing up. Many believe we must have vaccines for childhood diseases like chickenpox, measles and mumps. There are new diseases that didn't exist fifty years ago, and they bring more fear. As a people, we are under the thumb of the health care industry more intensively than ever before. Television, magazines and the Internet bombard us with health advice. Spending on health care is skyrocketing. Government is bankrupting the country trying to provide health care to everyone. We are cranking out new vaccines at an increasingly frantic pace. Yet even after all of the health care \"advances\" of the last hundred years, we face just as many or more health challenges, and we are not healthy. Why not? \"The science is settled\" is the common mantra of a closed mind. We are assured in all these different ways that scientific (allopathic) medicine has the answer\u2014or will soon. But does health or immunity come from a needle, knife or pill? The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the answer is \"no,\" and people are starting to notice. In Quest for Real Immunity, a number of thoughtful experts\u2014including Cilla Whatcott, Andrew Wakefield, Dr. Tom Cowan and Jeanne Ohm\u2014explain that the popular (allopathic) paradigm has failed miserably. There are better ideas. We are not made up of just a wide variety of human cells but also of microbes, viruses, fungi and parasites that are necessary for health. Attacking, cutting, poisoning or killing any part of the overall organism is reckless at best and often deadly. This film explains\u2014in one simple sentence\u2014why there is so much fear. Where there is no understanding, there is fear. People fear germs because they do not understand them. People fear cancer because even most experts don't understand it or know how to deal with it. People fear chickenpox because they do not understand the relationship between childhood illness and adult immunity. Interestingly, when I was young in the 1960s, we did not fear chickenpox, measles or mumps. Maybe we understood them better? Maybe we are getting dumber? My thumb is UP. Don't be afraid.
