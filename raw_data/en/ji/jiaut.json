Vol. 18- 9PREFACE The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online m o n t h l y p u b l i c a t i o n o f t h e O f f i c e o f t h e Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rulem aking notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative do cuments affecting rules that ar e statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-rel ated documents an agency may wa nt to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to p rovide public notice of all rul emaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedu res through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in author ized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate w hen a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rul emaking - Proposed Rule\" for ea ch proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislati ve review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be forwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when t he agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar year and issue numbe r. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin p ublished in January 2014 is cited as V olume 14-1. The December 2015 Bulletin is cited as V olume 15-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online compilation of all final and enf orceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full for ce and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislati ve session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are co dified into the Administrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enforceab le, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Admi nistrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions . At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as tempora ry rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the pr ocess begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 18 -91. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested pers ons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct ne gotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. The agency files a \"Notice of Int ent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if i nterested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the for mulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that re gular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. 2. PROPOSED RULEMAKINGA proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the age ncy is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agen cy must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice mus t include very specific information regarding the rulemaking including all relevant state or federal statutory au thority occasioning the rulemaking, a non-technical description of the changes being made, any associated costs, gu idance on how to participate through submission of written comments and requests for public hearings, and the text of the proposed rule in legislative format. 3. TEMPORARY RULEMAKIN G Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds tha t it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or f ederal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of these criteria, and with t he Governor's approval, the agency may adopt and make a temporary rule effective prior to receiving legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately e ffective upon adoption. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a fina l rule, or expires under its o wn terms. 4. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency und er regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforc eable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule, a statement regarding when the rule becomes effective, a description of how it differs from the proposed rule, and ide ntification of any fees being imposed or changed. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pending rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies i n content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending ru le change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that member s of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pen ding rule. 5. FINAL RULEMAKINGA final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 11 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 18 -9HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published i n the Idaho Administrative Bulletin a r e organized by a numbering schematic. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/nume rical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text i s divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as foll ows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrativ e Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. 1. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05 , which is the Department of Admi nistration's Division of Purch asing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket numbe r is a series of separated by a hyphen \"-\", r (the two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The following example is a breakd own of a typical rule docket \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05 ), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being publ ished; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501-1402 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.)

Regulatory Sample Test Result Averages Two (2) Out of Four (4) Violation . Whenever the average performance error of two (2) of the last four (4) regulatory sample results rolling groups of thirteen (13) exceed the tolerance for milkfat, protein, or solids as set for th in Subsection 302.04 of this rule, the dDepartment may suspend the official laboratory's license will issue a written notice to the official laboratory. This no tice shall be in effect as long as two (2) of the last four (4) rolling groups o f thirteen (13) exceed the allowable tolerance for component testing . (3-21-12) ( ) 02. Cumulative Regulatory Sample Results . When the department has accumulated a minimum of one thousand (1,000) regulatory sample results from an official laboratory, and the average of those regulatory sample results exceeds zero (0) by more than plus or minus two hundredths percent (.02%) for milkfat or protein, the department may suspend the official laboratory's license. (3-21-12) 03. Review of Records Prior to License Suspension. If two (2) out of four (4) of an official laboratory's regulatory sample results rolling groups of thirteen (13) average are out of tolerance pursuant to Subsection 302.04 of this rule, the dDepartment may review the records kept by the official laboratory pursuant to Section 350 of this rule. If the official laboratory is able to demonstrate through those records that it has performed all calibration and checks required under these rules, and that the results of those calibrations and checks show that the testing device is operating within the tolerances set forth in Sections 110, 111 and 130, the official laboratory may, at the department's discretion, be placed on probation for a period of two (2) weeks. The department will review the most recent thirteen (13) week average following the next regulatory samples, and if that average remains out of tolerance pursuant to Subsection 302.04 of this rule, the department may suspend the official laboratory's will evaluate the following items prior to suspending the testing license. (3-21-12) ( ) a. Records Review. The Department shall review records kept by the official laboratory pursuant to Section 350 of this rule. ( ) b. Clearance Test. The average performance error of the official l aboratory must be within plus or minus thirty-one thousandths solids on all scheduled sampl e sets, until the official laboratory no longer exceeds the performance tolerance on two (2) out of four (4) rolling gr oups of thirteen (13) average. If an official laboratory does not meet these performance requirements on each component of the clearance test, the testing license shall be suspended. ( ) c. Probation. The Department may place an official laboratory on p robation for two (2) weeks if: ( ) i. The records demonstrate all ca libration and performance checks of all testing devices were performed, as required under these rules, and are operating wit hin the tolerances set forth in Sections 110, 111, and 130 of this rule; and ( ) ii. The average performance error in the clearance test sample set was within plus or minus thirty-one thousandths percent test results from labor atories on probationary status shall be included in the calculation of the rolling gr oup of thirteen (13) average. ( ) 043. License Reinstatement . An official laboratory may seek reinstatement of a suspended license when the official laboratory provides the department written documentation detailing the procedural corrections that DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Docket No. 02-0409-1801 Rules Governing Milk & Cream Procurement & Testing Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 44 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 18 -9have been made to the testing device.

LEGAL AUTHORITY. The Idaho Fish and Game Commission is authorized to adopt rules concerning the administration of the wildlife policy of the state of Idaho in accordance with the Idaho fish and game code under Sections 36-103(b), 36-104(b), and 36-105(1), Idaho Code, and specifically concerning emergenc y feeding of pronghorn antelope, elk, and deer under Section 36-111(1), Idaho Code. (4-3-95) ( ) 001. TITLE AND SCOPE.The title of this chapter is \"Rules Governing Emergency Feeding of Pronghorn Antelope, Elk, and Deer of the Idaho Fish and Game Commission .\" These rules govern winter emergency feeding operations , and establish the criteria for determining a feeding emergency , and prohibit private feeding within a designated CWD Manageme nt Zone . (4-3-95) ( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 100. INTENT. The Idaho Fish and Game Commission recognizes that the importance of maintaining big game populations should be maintained under natural conditions and by naturally available forage. Wi nter forage is the major limiting factor which determines the basic size of the big game populations, an d it must be maintained if the animals are to prosper and propagate. In order t To maintain these winter ranges, big game numbers must be contro lled through adequate harvest. The Commission does not sanction any widespread supplemental winter feeding programs. Additionally, big game animals, especially elk, when concentrated by supplemental feeding are concentrates big game animals, making deer and elk very susceptible to spreading or contracting Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) as well as other infectious disease s which that can be transmitted to livestock. The risk of disease transmission may factor into making a supplemental feeding decision. However, b Big game harvests and weather vary from year to year throughout the state. In most years and areas, snow depths, tem peratures, and animal body condition do not create adverse conditions for wintering animals. Unusual weather condi tions, limited winter forage, or other circumstances may create critical periods of stress for animals or force them into areas involving public safety. The Commission is unable to manage the big game populations for extreme weather. Therefore, emergency feeding of big game is appropriate under certain criteria. (4-3-95) ( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 102. EMERGENCY FEEDING CRITERIA. 01. Declaration of Feeding Emergency . A feeding emergency may be declared if one (1) or more of the following criteria are met: (4-3-95) a. Actual or imminent thr eat of depredation to private property. (4-3-95) b. Threat to public safety, inclu ding traffic hazards.

It is unlawful to purposely or knowingly provide supplemental feed to deer and elk within any CWD Management Zone designated by the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, except supplemental or emergency feeding activities conducted or authorized by the Ida ho Department of Fish and Game. ( ) 02. Incidental Grazing . Incidental grazing by big game animals on private rangeland f orage, standing agricultural crops, or agricultu ral crop residue left on the ground following typical harvest practices is not a violation of this section.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 39-4801 and 39-4802, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be held as fo llows: The hearing site will be accessible to persons with disabilitie s. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: A second dose (booster) of the meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccinat ion is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' s Advisory Committee on Immuniza tion Practices (ACIP) for children aged 16 years and older who received the 1st dose of vaccine as recommended a t 11-12 years of age. Idaho does not currently require the booster dose for school entry. Requiring Idaho stud ents receive a second dose of meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine before entry into the 12th grade, or receive the vaccination before entry into 12th grade for those children who did not receive the recommended first dose, would help to prevent potential cases of meningococcal disease among young people in Idaho. A second vac cination (booster) received before the 12th grade helps to ensure immunity from meningococcal disease in young pe ople as the immunity gained from the first dose of Meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccine has been shown to fade after fi ve years. This rulemaking adds a new school entry immunization requiremen t to require a second dose of meningococcal (MenACWY) vaccination before a student enters the 12th grade in Idaho, starting with school year 2020-2021. If a student received their first dose of meningococcal (MenACWY) va ccine at 16 years of age or older, they will not be required to receive the second dos e before entry into the 12th grade. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to state general funds or any other funds except the costs of the rule promulgation, which includes travel for negotiated rulemaking, printing, and publication.PUBLIC HEARING Monday, September 17, 2018 - 9:30 a.m. (MDT) Meridian Courtyard by Marriott Balboa Meeting Room 1789 S.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Sections 56-202(b) and 56-264, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be held as fo llows: The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking Medicaid staff currently process special rates for participants receiving tracheostomy or ventilator care manually. A Nursing Facility (NF) must submit documentation before or on the date the special rate is to take effect. Most ventilator and tracheostomy rates are similar in supplies and s taffing and an average rate could be used instead. This would reduce administrative burden and reduce NF risk of nonpay ment due to late special rate requests, allowing NF to receive timely and ongoing add-on rates for these participan ts. Rules are needed to si mplify and streamline the current ventilator and tracheostomy special rate process to all ow for less administrative burden, and to allow rates to start on the day of admission and with no semi-annual renewals. The ventilator and tracheostomy rates will be adjusted to allow for a fixed add-on rate, incorporating supplies, nursing and CNA hours. The rates will be updated on a yearly ba sis to reflect the changing costs of supplies and the Weighted Average Hourly Rate (WAHR) for nursing and CNA hours. Ventilator and tracheostomy rates do not vary significantly in requested supplie s and the amount of nursing a nd/or CNA hours. Providing a fixed rate will allow for facilities to submit a request for a ventilator or tracheostomy add-on rate for a participant that can be effective from the date of admission or when the rate is needed. It will enabl e providers to bill for the participant's entire length of stay without the need to submit documentation and renewal reque sts throughout the year. It will reduce the burden and risk for facilities and enhance the efficiency of Medicaid staff time.

During state fiscal year (SFY) 2016, the Department paid $2.4 million in claims (approximately $1.68 million in federal funds and $720,000 in s tate general funds) to provide special ventilator and tracheostomy care. The objective of a special rate for ventilat or and trac heos tomy car e is to co mpile th e co sts o f specialty supplies and additional nursing hours for this type o f care. Historical data indicates that supplies and additional nursing hours have not varied significantly between participants or providers. The Department proposes to imple ment fixed special rates based on the average of specialty supplies and additional nursing hours from the last fiscal year. Costs for s upplies and nursing care have been and will remain subject to annual readjustment based on findings from the Weigh ted Average Hourly Rate (WAHR) survey and inflation adjustments for supplies. Using the average of the histori cal rates is not expected to impact claims expenditures for the Department.

Treatment of the Special Rate Cost for Future Rate Setting P eriods . Special rates are established on a prospective basis similar to the overall facility rate. When the cost report used to set a prospective rate contains special rate costs, an adjustment is made to \"off set,\" or reduce costs by an amount equal to total incremental revenues, or add-on payments received by the provid er during the cost reporting period. The amount received is calculated by multiplying the special rate add-on a mount paid for each qualifying resident by the number of days that were paid. No related adjustment is made to the fa cility's CMIs. (4-4-13) 08. Special Rate for Providers that Change Ownership or Close . When a facility changes ownership or closes, a closing cost report is not required. Spe cial rate payments made in the closing cost reporting period may be reviewed by the Department.

The current structure is an initial $500 ap plication fee for programs seeking approval under the rule and an annual renewal fee of $96 per bed. The proposed rul e will reduce the initial application fee from $500 to $100. It will also change from an annual renewal fee of $96 per bed to a flat $100 renewal fee that is paid every three years. The Division has not had a new application for approval under these rules since 2015. Renewal fees for the last two SFY have been consistent at $3,648 per year. The impact of this rule change is negligible. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted.

DEFINITIONS (RULE 54). For the purposes of these anesthesia rules, the following terms will be used, as defined below: (4-11-06) 01. Methods of Anxiety and Pain Control . (4-11-06) a. Analgesia shall mean the diminution or elimination of pain. (4-7-11) b. Local anesthesia shall mean the elimination of sensation, espec ially pain, in one (1) part of the body by the topical application or regional injection of a drug. (4-7-11) c. Minimal sedation shall mean a min imally depressed level of cons ciousness that retains the patient's ability to independently and continuously maintain an airway an d respond normally to tactile stimulation and verbal command. Although cognitive function and coordination may be modestly impaired, ventilator and cardiovascular functions are unaffected. In accord with this particular defini tion, the drugs and/or techniques used should carry a margin of safety wide enough never to render unintended loss of consciousness. Further, patients whose only response is reflex withdrawal from repeated painful stimuli would not be considered to be in a state of minimal sedation. (4-7-11) d. Moderate sedation shall mean a drug-induced depression of consc iousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accomp anied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous venti lation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. (4-7-11) e. Deep sedation shall mean a drug-induced depression of conscious ness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated o r painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilator function may be impaired. Patients may requ ire assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular funct ion is usually maintained. (4-7-11) f. General anesthesia shall mean a drug-induced loss of consciousn ess during which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independ ently maintain ventilator function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airwa y, and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced de pression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired. (4-7-11) 02. Sedation Terms . (4-11-06) a. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) shall mean an advanced car diac life support course or a pediatric advanced life support c ourse offered by a recognized accredited organization. (4-11-15) b. Monitor or monitoring shall mean the direct clinical observatio n of a patient during the administration of anesthesia by a person trained to observe the physical condition of the patient and capable of assisting with emergency or other procedures. (4-11-06) c. Operator shall mean the supervising dentist or another person w ho is authorized by these rules to induce an d administer the proper level of anesthesia/sedation. (4-11-15) d. Titration shall mean the administration of incremental doses of a drug until a desired effect is reached. Knowledge of each drug's time of onset, peak response and duration of action is essential to avoid over sedation. Although the concept of titration of a drug to effect is critical for patient safet y, when the intent is moderate sedation one must know whether the previous dose has taken full effect before administering an additional drug IDAHO STATE BOARD OF DENTIS TRY Docket No. 19-0101-1803 Rules of the Idaho State Board of Dentistry Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 282 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9increment. (4-7-11) e. Maximum recommended dose (MRD) shall mean maximum FDA-recommend ed dose of a drug, as printed in FDA-approved labeling for unmonitored home use. (3-20 -14) f. Incremental dosing shall mean administration of multiple doses of a drug until a desired effect is reached, but not to exceed the maximum recommended dose (MRD). (4-7-11) g. Supplemental dosing during minimal sedation shall mean a single additional dose of the initial drug that may be necessary for prolonged procedures. The supplemental dose should not exceed one-half of the initial dose and should not be administered until the dentist has determined the clinical half-life of the initial dosing has passed. The total aggregate dose must not exceed one and one-half times (1.5x) MRD on the day of treatment. (4-7-11) 03. Routes of Administration . (4-11-06) a. Enteral. Any technique of administration in which the agent is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or oral mucosa (i.e ., oral, rectal, sublingual). (4-11-06) b. Inhalation. A technique of administration in which a gaseous or volatile agent is introduced into the lungs and whose primary effect is due to absorption through the gas/blood interface. (4-7-11) c. Parenteral. A technique of administration in which the drug byp asses the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [i.e., intramuscular Transdermal. A technique of administration in which the drug is administered by patch or iontophoresis through skin. (4-7-11) e. Transmucosal. A technique of administration in which the drug i s administered across mucosa such as intranasal, sublingual, or rectal. (4-7-11) 055. MINIMAL SEDATION (RULE 55). Persons licensed to practice de ntistry in accordance with the Idaho Dental Practice Act and these rules are not required to obtain a permit to administer minimal sedation to p atients of sixteen (16) years of age or older. When the intent is minimal sedation, the appropriate initial dosing of a single enteral drug is no more than the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of a drug that can be prescribed for unm onitored home use. In cases where the patient weighs less than one hundred (100) pounds, or is under the age of sixteen (16) years, minimal sedation may be administered without a permit by use of nitrous oxide, or with a single enteral dose of a sedative agent administered in the dental office. (3-29-17) ( ) 01. Patient Safety . The administration of minimal sedation is permissible so long as it does not produce an alteration of the state of consciousness in a patien t to the level of moderate sedation, deep sedation or general anesthesia. A dentist must first qualify for and obtain the appropriate permit from the Board of Dentistry to be authorized to sedate patients to the level of moderate sedation , deep sedation or general anesthesia. Nitrous oxide/ oxygen may be used in combination with a single enteral drug in minimal sedation, except as described in Section 055 of these rules. Notwithstanding any other provision in thes e rules, a dentist shall initiate and regulate the administration of nitrous oxide/oxygen when used in combination with minimal sedation. (3-20-14) 02. Personnel . At least one (1) additional person currently certified in Bas ic Life Support for Healthcare Providers must be present in addition to the dentist .( 4-7-11)Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 283 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9IDAPA 19 - IDAHO STATE BOARD OF DENTISTRY 19.01.01 - RULES OF THE IDAHO STATE BOARD OF DENTISTRY DOCKET NO. 19-0101-1804 NOTICE OF RULEMAKING - PROPOSE D RULE AUT HORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5221(1), Idaho Code, notice is h ereby given that this agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures.

The action is authorized pursuant to Title 47 Chapter 15, including Section 47-1505, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be held as fo llows: The hearing site will be accessible to persons with disabilitie s. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Idaho Department of Lands is developing a web-based portal and information management system that will allow for submittal of applications and other documents electro nically. Currently, IDAPA 20.03.02 requires paper copies and, in some instances, certified mail submittals. The p roposed changes remove the requirement for paper submittals, which will allow permittees and operators to submit documents by paper copy or in electronic format. Additional changes include the following: Updates to Section 005-Office Hours - Mailing Address and Stre et Address. Addition of new abbreviations. IDAPA 20.03.02.120.03 states that only surface mining reclamat ion bonds obtained after January 1, 1997, may be addressed at actual costs plus ten percent (10%). As Sec tion 47-1512, Idaho Code, requires bonding for actual costs of reclamation, any bonds calculated prior to 1997 are out of date and do not represent actual costs of reclamation. It is suggested that this section be dele ted. Section 47-1512, Idaho Code, was changed in 2016 to increase t he maximum reclamation bond amount per acre from $2,500 to $15,000 per acre, but IDAPA 20.03.02 still lists the $2,500 maximum amount. This change will update the rules to align with statute. Requiring potential and current operators within the 100-year floodplain to illustrate the floodplain and describe the measures that will be implemented to keep surface waters from entering mining operations. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: No fiscal impact to the state gene ral fund is anticipated as a result of this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was conducted pursuant to Section 67-522 0(1), Idaho Code. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rul emaking was published in the June 6, 2018 Idaho Administrative Bulletin Volume 18-6, Page 82.PUBLIC HEARING Thursday, September 20, 2018 - 4:00 p.m. Idaho State Capitol Room WW55 700 West Jefferson Street Boise, ID 83702IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 298 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: No materials are being incorporated by reference in this rulema king.

Acreage on which reclamation is complete shall be r eported in accordance with Subsection 120.07 and after release of this acreage from the plan by the director, th e bond may be reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect the completed reclamation. (3-30-06) 054. Bond Provided to the Federal Government . Any bond provided to the federal government that also meets the requirements of Section 120 shall be sufficient for the purposes of these rules. (3-30-06) 065. Bond Reduction . (11-1-89) a. Upon finding that any land bonded under a reclamation plan will not be affected by mining, the operator shall notify the director. The amount of the bond shal l be reduced by the amount being held to reclaim those lands. (11-1-89) b. Any request for bond reduction shall be answered by the directo r within thirty (30) days of receiving such request unless weather conditions prevent inspec tion. (11-1-89) 076. Bond Release . Upon completion of the reclamation specified in the plan, the operator shall notify the director of his desire to secure release from bonding. When the director has verified that the requirements of the reclamation plan have been met as stated in the plan, the bond shall be released. (11-1-89) a. Any request for bond release shall be answered by the director within thirty (30) days of receiving such request unless weather conditions prevent inspection. (11-1 -89) b. If the director finds that a specific portion of the reclamatio n has been satisfactorily completed, the bond may be reduced to the amount required to complete the rema ining reclamation. The following schedule will be IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 312 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9used to complete these bond reductions unless the director dete rmines in a specific case that this schedule is not appropriate and specifies a different schedule: (11-1-89) i. Sixty percent (60%) of the bond may be released when the oper ator completes the required backfilling, regrading, topsoil replacement, and drainage control of the bonded area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan; and (11-1-89) ii. After revegetation activities have been performed by the ope rator on the regraded lands, according to the approved reclamation plan, the Department may release an additional twenty-five percent (25%) of the bond. (11-1-89) c. The remaining bond shall not be released: (11-1-89) i. As long as the affected lands are contributing suspended soli ds to surface waters outside the affected area in excess of state water quality standards and in greater quantities than existed prior to the commencement of surface mining operations; (11-1-89) ii. Until final removal of equipment and structures related to t he mining activity or until any remaining equipment and structures are brought under an approve d reclamation plan and bond by a new operator; and (11-1-89) iii. Until all temporary sediment or erosion control structures have been removed and reclaimed or until such structures are brought under an approved reclamation plan and bond by a new operator. (11-1-89) 087. Cooperative Agreements . The director may through private conference, conciliation, an d persuasion reach a cooperative agreement with the operator to c orrect deficiencies in complying with the reclamation plan and thereby postpone action to forfeit the bond and cancel the reclamation plan if all deficiencies are satisfactorily corrected within the time specified by the coope rative agreement. (11-1-89) 098.B o n d i n g R a t e . An operator may petition the director for a change in the ini tial bond rate. The director will review the petition, and if satisfied with the in formation presented, a special bond rate will be set based upon the estimated cost that the director would incur should a forfeiture of bond occur and it became necessary for the director, through contracting with a third party, to complete reclamation to the standards established in the plan. (11-1-89) 109. Liabilities for Unbonded Reclamation Costs . An operator who: (11-1-89) a. Departs from his approved reclamation plan by performing an act or omission and such deviation is not subsequently approved; (11-1-89) b. Does not furnish a bond required by these rules; and (11-1-89) c. Is not required to furnish a bond by these rules, but fails to reclaim; is in violation of these rules and may be subject to civil penalty under Section 47-1513(c), Idaho Code. The amount of civil penalty shall be the estimated cost of reasonable reclamation of affected lands as determined by the director. Reasonable reclamation of the site shall be presumed to be in accordance with the standar ds established in the approved reclamation plan. The amount of the civil penalty shall be in addition to those descr ibed in Subsection 160.06. (11-1-89) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 140. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND RECLAMATION FOR SURFACE MININ G OPERATION AND PERMANENT CLOSURE OF CYANIDATION FACILITIES. Enumeration of a practice or act in Section 140 shall not be co nstrued to require its specific inclusion in a reclamation or permanent closure plan. (3-30-06)IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 313 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-901. Nonpoint Source Control . (3-30-06) a. Appropriate BMPs for nonpoint source controls shall be designed , constructed, and maintained with respect to site-specific surface mining operations or perm anent closure activities. Operators shall utilize BMPs designed to achieve state water quality standards and to protec t existing beneficial uses of adjacent waters of the state, but shall not be required to do more than is necessary to preserve the condition of runoff from the affected land or the cyanidation facility prior to conducting any exploration, surfa ce mining or cyanidation facility operations. These measures shall be among the first to be taken, if necessary, to protect water quality. State water quality standards, including protection of existing beneficial uses, shall be the standard that must be achieved by BMPs unless the operator can show, and the director determines, that a lesser s tandard existed in the area to be affected prior to the commencement of the subject surface mining or exploration opera tions. (3-30-06) b. If the BMPs utilized by the operator do not result in complianc e with Subsection 140.01.a., the director shall require the operator to modify or improve such B MPs to meet the controlling, water quality standards as set forth in current laws, rules, and regulations. (3-30-06) ( ) 02. Sediment Control . In addition to proper mining techniques and reclamation measu res, the operator shall take necessary steps at the close of each operating seaso n to assure that sediment movement associated with surface runoff over the area is minimized in order to achieve w ater quality standards, or to preserve the condition of water runoff from the mined area prior to commencement of the s ubject surface mining or exploration operations, whichever is the lesser standard. Sediment control measures ref er to best management practices carried out within and, if necessary, adjacent to the disturbed area and consist o f utilization of proper mining and reclamation measures, as well as specific necessary sed iment control methods, separat ely or in combination. Specific sediment control methods may include, but are not limited to: (3-30-06) a. Keeping the disturbed area to a minimum at any given time throu gh progressive reclamation; (3-30-06) b. Shaping waste to help reduce the rate and volume of water runof f by increasing infiltration; (3-30-06) c. Retaining sediment within the disturbed area; (3-30-06) d. Diverting surface runoff around the disturbed area; (3-30-06) e. Routing runoff through the disturbed area using protected chann els or pipes so as not to increase sediment load; (3-30-06) f. Use of riprap, straw dikes, check dams, mulches, temporary vege tation, or other measures to reduce overland flow velocities, reduce runoff volume, or retain sediment; and (3-30-06) g. Use of adequate sediment ponds, with or without chemical treatm ent. (3-30-06) 03. Clearing and Grubbing . Clearing and grubbing of land in preparation for mining expos es mineral soil to the erosive effects of moving water. Operators are caut ioned to keep such areas as small as possible (preferably no more than one (1) year's mining activity) as the operator sh all be required to meet the applicable surface water quality standards on all such areas. Where practicable, trees a nd slash should be stockpiled for use in seedbed protection and erosion control. (3-30-06) 04. Overburden/Topsoil . To aid in the revegetation of affected lands where surface mi ning operations result in the removal of substantial amounts of overburden incl uding any topsoil, the operator should remove the available topsoil or other growth medium as a separate operatio n for such area. Unless there are previously affected lands which are graded and immediately available for placement o f t h e n e w l y r e m o v e d t o p s o i l o r o t h e r g r o w t h medium, the topsoil or other growth medium shall be stockpiled and protected from erosion and contamination until such areas become available. (3-30-06) a. Overburden/Topsoil Removal. (11-1-89)IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 314 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9i. Any overburden/topsoil to be removed should be removed prior to any other mining activity to prevent loss or contamination; (11-1-89) ii. Where overburden/topsoil removal exposes land area to potential erosion, the director, under the reclamation plan, may require BMPs necessary to prevent violati on of water quality standards; and (3-30-06) iii. Where the operator can show that an overburden material oth er than topsoil is conducive to plant growth, or where overburden other than topsoil is the only mate rial reasonably available, such overburden may be allowed as a substitute for or a supplement to the available to psoil. (3-30-06) b. Topsoil Storage. Topsoil stockpiles shall be placed to minimize rehandling and exposure to excessive wind and water erosion. Topsoil stockpiles shall be p rotected as necessary from erosion by use of temporary vegetation or by other methods which will control ero sion, including, but not limited to, silt fences, chemical binders, seeding, and mulching. (11-1-89) c. Overburden Storage. Stockpiled ridges of overburden shall be le veled in such a manner as to have a minimum width of ten (10) feet at the top. Peaks of overburden shall be leveled in such a manner as to have a minimum width of fifteen (15) feet at the top. The overburden p iles shall be reasonably prepared to control erosion using best management practices; such activities may include te rracing, silt fences, chemical binders, seeding, mulching or slope reduction. (7-1-98) d. Topsoil Placement. Abandoned affected lands shall be covered wi th topsoil or other type of overburden that is conducive to plant growth, to the extent suc h materials are readily available, in order to achieve a stable uniform thickness. Excessive compaction of overburden an d topsoil is to be avoided. Topsoil redistribution shall be timed so that seeding, or other protective measures, can be readily applied to prevent compaction and erosion. (3-30-06) e. Fill. Backfill and fill materials should be compacted in a mann er to ensure stability. (3-30-06) 05. Roads . (11-1-89) a. Roads shall be constructed to minimize soil erosion, which may require restrictions on the length and grade of the roadbed, surfacing of roads with durable non-t oxic material, stabilization of cut and fill slopes, and other techniques designed to control erosion. (3-30-06) b. All access and haul roads shall be adequately drained. Drainage structures may include, but are not limited to, properly installed ditches, water-bars, cross drain s, culverts, and sediment traps. (11-1-89) c. Culverts that are to be maintain ed for more than one (1) year s hall be designed to pass peak flows from not less than a twenty (20) year, twenty-four (24) hour pr ecipitation event and have a minimum diameter of eighteen (18) inches. (11-1-89) d. Roads and water control structures shall be maintained at perio dic intervals as needed. Water control structures serving to drain roads shall not be blocked or restricted in any manner to impede drainage or significantly alter the intended purpose of the structure. (11-1 -89) e. Roads that will not be recontoured to approximate original cont ours upon abandonment shall be cross- d itched and revegetated, as necessary, to control erosion . (3-30-06) f. Roads that are not abandoned and continue to be used under the jurisdiction of a governmental or private landowner, shall comply with the nonpoint source sedime nt control provisions of Subsection 140.02 until control. (3-30-06) 06. Backfilling and Grading . (11-1-89) a. Every operator who conducts surface mining or cyanidation facil ity operations which disturb less IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 315 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9than two (2) acres shall, where possible, contour the disturbed land to its approximate previous contour. These lands shall be revegetated in accordance with Subsection 140.11. (3-30 -06) b. An operator who conducts surface mining or cyanidation facility operations which disturb two (2) acres or more shall reduce all waste piles and depressions to t he lowest practicable grade. This grade shall not exceed the angle of repose or maximum slope of natural stability for s uch waste or generate erosion in which sediment enters waters of the state. (3-30-06) c. Backfill and fill materials should be compacted in a manner to ensure mass and surface stability. (7-1-98) d. After the disturbed area has been graded, slopes will be measur ed for consistency with the approved reclamation plan or the permanent closure plan. (3-30-0 6) 07. Disposal of Waste in Areas Other Than Mine Excavation . Waste material not used to backfill mined areas shall be transporte d and placed in a manner designe d to stabilize the waste piles and control erosion. (3-30-06) a. The available disposal area shou ld be on a moderately sloped, n aturally stable area. The site should be near the head of a drainage to reduce the area of watershed above the fill. (11-1-89) b. All surface water flows within the disposal area shall be diver ted and drained using accepted engineering practices such as a system of French drains, to kee p water from entering the waste pile. These measures shall be implemented in accordance with standards prescribed by the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act, Title 42, Chapter 38, Idaho Code, and the Idaho Dam Safety Act, Sections 42-1710 through 42-1721, Idaho Code, if applicable. (11-1-89) c. The waste material not used in backfilling mined areas should be compacted, where practical, and should be covered and graded to allow surface drainage and ensu re long-term stability. (11-1-89) d. The operator may, if appropriate, use terraces or slope reducti on to stabilize the face of any fill. Slopes of the fill material should not exceed angle of repose o r generate erosion in which sediment enters waters of the state. (3-30-06) e. Unless adequate drainage is provided through a fill area, all s urface water above the fill shall be diverted away from the fill area into protected channels, and d rainage shall not be directed over the unprotected face of the fill. (11-1-89) f. The operator shall conduct revegetation activities with respect to such waste piles in accordance with Subsection 140.11. (3-30-06) 08. Settling Ponds; Minimum Criteria. (11-1-89) a. Sediment Storage V olume. Settling ponds shall provide adequate sediment storage capacity to achieve compliance with applicable water quality standards and protect existing beneficial uses, and may require periodic cleaning and proper disposal of sediment. (11-1-89) b. Water Detention Time. Settling ponds shall have an adequate the oretical detention time for water inflow and runoff entering the pond, but theoretical detention time may be reduced by improvements in pond design, chemical treatment, or other methods. (11-1-89) c. Emergency Spillway. In addition to the sediment storage volume and water detention time, settling ponds shall be designed to withstand and release storm flows as required by the Idaho Dam Safety Act, Section 42- 1710 through 42-1721, Idaho Code, and Safety of Dams Rules, where applicable. (11-1-89) 09. Tailings Impoundments . All tailings, dams, or other types of tailings impoundments shall be designed, constructed, operated, and decommissioned so that upo n their abandonment, the dam and impoundment IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 316 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9area will not constitute a hazard to human or animal life. (11-1 -89) a. Design criteria, construction t echniques, and decommission tech niques for tailings dams and impoundments shall comply with the Idaho Dam Safety Act, Sectio ns 42-1710 through 42-1721, Idaho Code, and applicable rules and regulations. (11-1-89) b. Topsoil shall be removed from the area to be affected by the im pounding structure and tailings reservoir in accordance with Subsection 140.04. (3-30-06) c. Abandonment Decommissioning of Tailings 06) i. Dewatering. Tailings ponds shall be dewatered to the extent n ecessary to provide an adequate foundation for the approved post-mining use. (3-30-06) ii. Control of surface waters. Surface waters shall either be ch anneled around the reservoir and impoundment structure or through the reservoir and breached str ucture. Permanent civil structures shall be designed and constructed to implement either method of channeling. The s tructure shall provide for erosion-free passage of waters and adequate energy dissipation prior to entry into the natural drainage below the impounding structure. (3-30-06) iii. Detoxification. Hazardous chemical residues within the tail ings pond shall be detoxified or covered with an adequate thickness of non-toxic material, to the extent necessary to achieve water quality standards in adjacent surface waters. (3-30-06) iv. Reclamation. After implementi ng the required dewatering, det oxification, and surface drainage control measures, the reservoir and impounding structure shall be covered with topsoil or other material conducive to plant growth, in accordance with S ubsection 140.04. Where such soils are limited in quantity or not available, and upon approval by the Department, physical or chemical methods f or erosion control may be used. All such areas are to be revegetated in accordance with Subsection 140.11, unless specified otherwise. (3-30-06) d. When the operator requests termination of its reclamation or pe rmanent closure plan, pursuant to Section 150 of these rules, impoundment structures and any rese rvoirs retained as fresh water reservoirs after final reclamation or permanent closure shall be required to conform with the Idaho Dam Safety Act, Sections 42-1710 through 42-1721, Idaho Code, if applicable. (3-30-06) 10. Permanent Cessation and Time Limits for Planting . (11-1-89) a. Seeding and planting of affected lands and/or a permanently closed cyanidation facility should be conducted during the first normal period for favorable planting conditions after final seedbed preparation. (3-30-06) b. Reclamation activities, where possible, are encouraged to be co ncurrent with the mining operation and may be included in the approved reclamation plan. Final rec lamation shall begin within one (1) year after the surface mining operations have pe rmanently ceased on a mine pan el. If the operator permanently ceases disposing of overburden on a waste area or permanently ceases removing minerals from a pit or permanently ceases using a road or other affected land, the recl amation activity on each given area shall start within one (1) year of such cessation, despite the fact that all operations as to the mine panel, which includ ed such pit, road, overburden pile, or other affected land, has not permanently ceased. (11-1-89) c. An operator shall be presumed to have permanently ceased surfac e mining operations on a given portion of affected land when no substantial amount of mineral or overburden material has been removed or overburden placed on an overburden dump, or no significant use has been made of a road during the prior three (3) years. If an operator does not plan to use an affected area for three (3) or more years but intends thereafter to use the affected area for surface mining operations and desires to defe r final reclamation until after its subsequent use, the operator shall submit a notice of intent and request for deferr al of reclamation to the director, in writing. If the director determines that the operator plans to continue the ope ration within a reasonable period of time, the director shall notify the operator and may require actions to be taken t o reduce degradation of surface resources until operations resume. If the director determines that use of the a ffected land for surface mining operations will not be IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 317 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9continued within a reasonable period of time, the director shal l proceed as though the surface mining operation has been abandoned, but the operator shall be notified of such deci sion at least thirty (30) days before taking any formal administrative action. (11-1-89) 11. Revegetation Activities . (11-1-89) a. The operator shall select and establish plant species that can be expected to result in vegetation comparable to that growing on the affected lands or on a closed cyanidation facility prior to surface mining or cyanidation facility operations, respectively. Certified weed f ree seed should be used in revegetation. The operator may use available technical data and results of field tests for selecting seeding practices and soil amendments which will result in viable revegetation. These practices of selectio n may be included in an approved reclamation plan or permanent closure. (3-30-06) b. Unless otherwise specified in th e approved reclamation or perma nent closure plan, the success of revegetation efforts shall be measured against the existing veg etation on site prior to the surface mining or cyanidation facility operation, or against an adjacent referenc e area supporting similar types of vegetation. (3-30-06) i. The ground cover of living plants on the revegetated area sho uld be comparable to the ground cover of living plants on the adjacent reference area for two (2) ful l growing seasons after cessation of soil amendment or irrigation. (11-1-89) ii. For purposes of this rule, ground cover shall be considered comparable if it has, on the area actually planted at least seventy percent (70%) of the premining ground cover for the mined area or adjacent reference area; (11-1-89) iii. For locations with an average annual precipitation of more than twenty-six (26) inches, the director, in approving a reclamation or permanent closure plan, may set a minimum standard for success of revegetation as follows: Vegetative cover of seventy percent (70%) for two (2) full growing seasons in areas planted to herbaceous species only; or fifty percent (50%) vegetative cover for two ( 2) full growing seasons and six hundred (600) woody plants per acre in areas planted to a mixture of herbaceous and woody species. (3-30-06) iv. As used in this section, \"herbaceous species\" means grasses, legumes, and other forbs; woody shrubs, trees, and vines; and \"ground cover \" means the area of the ground surface covered by the combined aerial parts of vegetation and the litter that is produced naturally on-site, expressed as a percentage of the total area measured. Rock surface areas will be excluded fr om this calculation. (11-1-89) v. For previously mined areas that were not reclaimed to the sta ndards required by Section 140, and which are affected by the surface mining or cyanidation facilit y operations, vegetation should be established to the extent necessary to control erosion, but shall not be less than that which existed before redisturbance; and (3-30-06) vi. Vegetative cover shall not be less than that required to con trol erosion. (11-1-89) c. Introduced species may be plante d if they are known to be compa rable to previous vegetation, or if known to be of equal or superior use for the approved post-mini ng use of the affected land, or, if necessary, to achieve a quick, temporary cover for soil stabilization purposes. Speci es classified as poisonous or noxious weed species shall not be u s ed in revegetation. (11-1-89) d. By mutual agreement of the director, the landowner, and the ope rator, a site may be converted to a different, more desirable or more economically suitable habitat . (3-30-06) e. Planting of grasses and forbs should be done in a manner which promotes rapid stabilization of the soil surface. Wherever terrain permits, grasses and forbs shoul d be drilled or compacted into the ground using agricultural grass planting equipment or other seeders specific ally designed for mine rev egetation applications. Broadcast and hydroseeding may be used on areas where other methods are impractical or unavailable. (11-1-89) f. The operator should plant shrubs or shrub seed, as required, where shrub communities existed prior to mining. Shrub seed may be planted as a portion of a grass se ed mix or planted as bare-root transplants after grass IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0302-1801 Exploration/Surface Mining/Closure of Cy anidation Facilities Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 318 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9seeding. Where the landowner desires a specific land use such a s grazing or cropland, shrubs will not be required in the revegetation species mix. Shrub lands undergoing revegetati on with shrubs shall be protected from erosion by vegetation, chemical, or other accep table means during establis hment of the shrubs. (11-1-89) g. Reforestation. Tree stocking of forestlands should meet the fol lowing criteria: (3-30-06) i. Trees that are adapted to the site should be planted on the a rea to be revegetated in a density which can be expected over time to yiel d a timber stand comparable to premining timber stands; (11-1-89) ii. Trees shall be established for two (2) full growing seasons after cessation of any soil amendments and irrigation before they are considered to be established; an d (11-1-89) iii. Forestlands undergoing revegetation with trees should be protected from erosion by vegetation, chemical binders, or other acceptable means during seedling est ablishment. (11-1-89) h. Revegetation is not required on the following areas: (11-1-89) i. Affected lands, or portions thereof, where planting is not pr acticable or reasonable because the soil is composed of excessive amounts of sand, gravel, shale, stone, or other material to such an extent to prohibit plant growth; (11-1-89) ii. Any mined area or overburden stockpiles proposed to be used in the mining operations for haulage roads, so long as those roads are not abandoned; (3-30-06) iii. Any mined area or overburden stockpile, where lakes are for med by rainfall or drainage runoff from adjoining lands; (3-30-06) iv. Any mineral stockpile; (11-1-89) v. Any exploration trench which will become a part of a pit or a n overburden disposal area; and (3-30-06) vi. Any road which is to be used in mining operations, so long a s the road is not abandoned. (11-1-89) i. Mulching. Mulch should be used on severe sites and may be requi red by the reclamation or permanent closure plan where slopes are steeper than three to o ne (3:1) or the mean annual rainfall is less than twelve (12) inches. When used, straw or hay mulch should be obtained f rom certified weed free sources. \"Mulch\" means vegetation residues or other suitable materials to aid in the s tabilization of soil and soil moisture conservation which will provide a micro-climate more suitable for germination and growth on severe sites. Annual grains such as rye, oats, and wheat may be used as a substitute for mulch where the y will provide adequate protection and will be replaced by permanent species with in a reasonable length of tim e. (3-30-06) 12. Petroleum-Based Products and Chemicals . All refuse, chemical and petroleum products and equipment should be stored and maintained in a designated locat ion away from surface water and disposed of in such a manner as to prevent their en try into a waterway. (3-30-06)Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 319 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9IDAPA 20 - IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS 20.03.04 - RULES FOR THE REGULAT ION OF BEDS, WATERS, AND AIRSPA CE OVER NAVIGABLE LAKES IN THE STATE OF IDAHO DOCKET NO. 20-0304-1801 NOTICE OF RULEMAKING - PROPOSED RULE AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5221(1), Idaho Code, notice is h ereby given that this agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures. The action is authori zed pursuant to Sections 58-104(6), 58-105, and 58- 1304, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this rulemaking will be held as fo llows: The hearing site will be accessible to persons with disabilitie s. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.020 requires submission of paper copi es of applications for encroachment permits. The Idaho Department of Lands (Department) is developing a web- based portal and information management system that will allow applications to be submitted electronically. Th e proposed changes would allow applicants to submit applications either on paper or electronically. Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.015.05 allows existing permitted boat garages to be maintained or replaced at their current size. The proposed change would allow existing permitte d boat garages to be maintained or replaced at the existing height and at the same square footage of the existing footprint. Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.015.10 requires float homes to comply with the 2003 Uniform Plumbing Code and the 2008 National Electrical Cod e. These referenced codes are n ot current. The Department is proposing to reference IDAPA 07.02.06 and IDAPA 07.01.06 in this paragraph to match th e proposed change to the incorporation by reference in IDAPA 20.03.04.004. Section 58-1306, Idaho Code, requires that a notice of applicat ion for nonnavigational encroachments be published in the local newspaper. Section 58-1307, Idaho Code, provides that the applicant is responsible for the cost of publication of the notice. Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.020 doe s not indicate the cost of publication is to be paid by the applicant for nonnavigational encroachments for bank stabilization and erosion control. The proposed change would align rule with statute and provide that the publication deposit be submitted with an application to permit riprap, which is the primary form of nonnavigational encroachme nt for bank stabilization and erosion control used in Idaho. Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.080 provides that the Department shal l provide permittees with a notice of noncompliance/proposed permit revocation when it has determined the rules have been violated and/or a cause exists for revocation of an encroachment permit. However, non-permitte es may be in violation of the rules and should receive notification as well. The proposed change would clarify that the Department shall provide notice to anyone who may be in violation of the rules. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: No fiscal impact to the state gene ral fund is anticipated as a result of this rulemaking.PUBLIC HEARING Thursday, September 20, 2018 - 10:00 a.m. Idaho State Capitol Room WW55 700 West Jefferson Street Boise, ID 83702IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0304-1801 Regulation of Beds, Waters, & Airspace Over Navigable Lakes Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 320 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was conducted pursuant to Section 67-522 0(1), Idaho Code. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rul emaking was published in the June 6, 2018 Idaho Administrative Bulletin Volume 18-6, Page 84. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.004.01 incorporates by reference the 2008 National Electric Code (NEC). Since 2008, the NEC has been updated three times (2011, 2014, and 201 7). Furthermore, the I daho Electrical Board has adopted IDAPA 07.01.06, the Rules Governing the Use of National Electrical Code, which prescribe which NEC edition is to be administered by the Idaho Electrical Board and identifies certain amendments to the NEC. In order to align with the Idaho Electric Board, the Idaho Department of La nds is proposing to incorporate by reference IDAPA 07.01.06, as opposed to the NEC. Currently, IDAPA 20.03.04.004.02 incorporates by reference the 2003 Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC). Since 2003, the UPC has been updated five times (2006, 2009, 2012, 20 15, and 2018). Furthermore, the Idaho Plumbing Board has adopted IDAPA 07.02.06, the Rules Concerning Idaho St ate Plumbing Code, which\u2014instead of incorporating by reference the UPC\u2014incorporates the Idaho State Plumbing Code, which is based on the UPC. In order to align with the Idaho Plumbing Board, the Idaho Departm ent of Lands is proposing to incorporate by reference IDAPA 07.02.06, as opposed to the UPC. The United States Aids to Naviga tion System was first incorpora ted by reference in IDAPA 20.03.04 in 2008; however, this incorporated material was not identified with spe cificity and will now include the date when the code, standard or rule was published, approved or became effective as required by Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5229(3). The United States Aids to Navigation System is found in 33 CFR Part 62. Si nce 2008, two sections have been modified, both in 2015: 1. Section 62.21(c) was modified to reflect discontinuation of p rint publication of Light List, United States Coast Pilot, Local Notices to Ma riners, and Notice to Mariners, in favor of electronic-only publication. 2. \u00a7 62.52 Automatic Identification System Aids to Navigation (A IS AtoN) was added, reading: (a) Aids to Navigation (AtoN) may be enhanced by the use of an a utomatic identification system (AIS). AIS is a maritime navigation safety communications proto col standardized by the International Telecommunication Union and adopted by the Intern ational Maritime Organization for the broadcast or exchange of navigation information between vessels, aircraft, and shore stations. AIS AtoN can autonomously and at fixed intervals broa dcast the name, position, dimensions, type, characteristics and status from or concerning an aid to navigation. (b) AIS AtoN can be either real (physically fitted to the AtoN), synthetic (physically fitted somewhere other than to the AtoN) or virtual (physically nonexistent, but capable of being portrayed on AIS- capable displays). (c) AIS AtoN can also be used to broadcast both laterally (e.g., Port Hand Mark) and non-laterally significant marine safety inform ation (e.g., environmental data , tidal information, and navigation warn ings).

Two-family docks are allowed two (2) boat lifts and four (4) jet ski lifts, or four (4) boat lifts, without adding their footprint to the dock square footage. Addi tional lifts will require that fifty percent (50%) of the footprint of the largest lifts be included in the allowable squ are footage of the dock or pier as per Subsection 015.01. (4-2-08) iii. A boat lift or jet ski lift within lines drawn perpendicula r from the shore to the outside dock edges will not require a separate permit if the lift is outside the t en (10) foot adjacent littoral owner setback, the lift does not extend beyond the line of navigability, and the lift does not c ount toward the square footage of the dock as outlined in Subparagraphs 015.13.b.i. and 015.13.b.ii. The permittee shall send a revised permit drawing with the lift location as an application to the department. If the lift meets the above conditions, the application shall be approved as submitted. Future applications shall include the lifts. (3-29-10 ) iv. Community docks are allowed one (1) boat lift or two (2) jet ski lifts per moorage. Boat lifts placed outside of a slip shall be oriented with the long axis parallel to the dock structure. Additional lifts will require that fifty percent (50%) of their footprint be included in the allow able square footage of the dock or pier as per Subsection 015.02. (3-29-10) c. Angle from Shoreline. (4-2-08) i. Where feasible, all docks, piers, or similar structures shall be constructed so as to protrude as nearly as possible at right angles to t he general shoreline, lessening the potential for infringement on adjacent littoral rights. (4-2-08) ii. Where it is not feasible to place docks at right angles to t he general shoreline, the department shall work with the applicant to revie w and approve the applicant's p roposed configuration and location of the dock and the dock's angle from shore. (4-2-08) d. Length of Community Docks and Commercial Navigational Encroachm ents. Docks, piers, or other works may extend to a length that will provide access to a wate r depth that will afford sufficient draft for water craft customarily in use on the particular body of water, except that no structure may extend beyond the normal accepted line of navigability established through use unless additional length is authorized by permit or order of the director. If a normally accepted line of navigability has not been establish ed through use, the director may from time to time as he deems necessary, designate a line of navigability for the pu rpose of effective administration of these rules. (4-2-08) e. Presumed Ad verse Effect. It will be presumed, subject to rebutt a l , t h a t s i n g l e - f a m i l y a n d t w o - family navigational encroachments will have an adverse effect u pon adjacent littoral rights if located closer than ten (10) feet from adjacent littoral right lines, and that commerci al navigational encroachments, community docks or IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF LANDS Docket No. 20-0304-1801 Regulation of Beds, Waters, & Airspace Over Navigable Lakes Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 327 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9nonnavigational encroachments will have a like adverse effect u pon adjacent littoral rights if located closer than twenty-five (25) feet to adjacent littoral right lines. Written consent of the adjacent littoral owner or owners will automatically rebut the presumption. All boat lifts and other s tructures attached to the en croachments shall be subject to the above presumptions of adverse affects. (4-2-08) f. Weather Conditions. Encroachments and their building materials shall be designed and installed to withstand normally anticipated weather conditions in the area. Docks, piers, and similar structures shall be adequately secured to pilings or anchors to prevent displacement due to ic e, wind, and waves. Flotation devices for docks, float homes, etc. shall be reasonably resistant to puncture and other damage. (4-2-08) g. Markers. If the department determines that an encroachment is n ot of sufficient size to be readily seen or which poses a hazard to n avigation, the permit shall sp ecify that aids to navigation be used to clearly identify the potential hazard. (4-2-08) h. Overhead Clearance. (4-2-08) i. Overhead clearance between the natural or ordinary high water mark or the artificial high water mark, if there be one, and the structure or wires must be suffi cient to pass the largest vessel which may reasonably be anticipated to use the subject waters in the vicinity of the en croachment. In no case will the clearance be required to exceed thirty (30) feet unless th e department determines after public hearing that it is in the overall public interest that the clearance be in excess of thirty (30) feet. Irrespective of height above the water, approval of structures or wires presenting a hazard for boating or other water related activiti es may be conditioned upon adequate safety marking to show clearance and otherwise to warn the public of the hazard. The department shall specify in the permit the amount of overhead clearance and markings required. (4-2-08) ii. When the permit provides for overhead clearance or safety ma rkings under Paragraph 015.13.h., the department shall consider the applicable requirements of th e United States Coast Guard, the Idaho Transportation Department, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and any other applicable federal, state, or local regulations. (4-2-08) i. Beaded Foam Flotation. Beaded foam flotation shall be completel y encased in a manner that will maintain the structural integrity of the foam. The encasement s hall be resistant to the entry of rodents. (4-2-08) 14. Floating Toys . (3-29-10) a. Encroachment permits are not required for floating toys, except where noted in Paragraph 015.14.b. Counties and cities may regulate floating toys for public safet y and related concerns. (3-29-10) b. A floating toy becomes a nonnavigational encroachment, and an encroachment permit is required, when one (1) of the following occurs: (3-29-10) i. It is anchored to the bed of the lake with a device that requ ires equipment to remove it from the bed of the lake, or; (3-29-10) ii. It is located waterward of the line of navigability for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours. (3-29-10) 15. Lake Specific Encroachment Permit Terms . (3-29-10) a.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Section 54-1404, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 19, 2018. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Under current rule, students graduating from a nursing educatio n program can't remain employed as a nursing assistant in a non-licensed capacity. This causes financial har dship to the graduates while they wait for confirmation of passing the licensing examination. The rulemaking seeks to a lleviate this hardship by granting recent graduates a reasonable time-frame for receipt of the necessary paperwork be fore they are no longer eligible for nursing assistant status. Another board rule addressing multistate licensing is b eing deleted because it is no longer necessary given the recently passed Enhanced Nurse License Compact and withdrawal o n January 19, 2018 from the previous Nurse Licensure Compact to which the rules apply. Finally, the curren t rule requiring certain information in prescription forms used by advanced practice nurses is unnecessarily complex a n d i n c o n s i s t e n t w i t h s i m i l a r f o r m s u s e d b y physicians and other authorized prescribers in Idaho. The rulem aking seeks to correct this irregularity. BON Rule 76 is being amended to expand the definition of a \"nur se apprentice\" to include persons recently graduated (up to three months) from a nursing educational progr am; BON Rule 77 (multistate licensure) will be removed; and BON Rule 315 will be amended to make the informati on required on prescription forms used by advanced practice nurses uniform with information required on prescription forms used by physicians and other authorized prescribers licensed in Idaho. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because: (1) the proposed change to the nurse apprent ice rule was requested by a nurse educator, is very minor in nature and will have no opposition and will benefit nu rsing programs, nursing students and recent graduates, employers of nurse apprentices and the public; (2) the proposed change to the rule on multistate licensure is required by superseding statute; and (3) the proposed change to the cont ent of prescription forms used by advanced practice nurses will fully comply with all state and federal law, while making the forms uniform with similar forms used by other Idaho prescribers.INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by r eference into this rule: N/A ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMEN TS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, contact Sa ndra Evans, Executive Director, at (208) 577-2482. Anyone may submit written comments regarding this proposed rule making.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Sections 67-5221(1) and 63-105(a), Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 19, 2018. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Rule 312 changes the time when government-owned property transferred to a private owner becomes taxable. The proposed change will conform with Section 63-602Y, Idaho Co de, providing that property changing status from exempt status to taxable status becomes taxable quarterly and t he assessment is prorated accordingly. Rule 408, Subsection 408.02 requires final values of operating properties be sent to count y assessors. Subsection 408.03 currently states that July 15 is the date by which county assessors may file a complaint concerning the valuation or allocation of the value. The operating propert y values are not final values until after the Tax Commission meets in August as the State Board of Equalization. This rule corrects a timing problem by changing Subsection 408.02 final values to preliminary values which are available in early July. Rule 610 will explain that the primary guidance in determining partial ownership relative to the homeowners exemption program is the specific language found in the transfer deed. Rule 613 provides that rents and expenses from whole farms may be used and provides a definition for \"Agricultural Area\" from which rents and expenses are to be ext racted. The rule provides both a narrative description and an example of how to calculate the rent attributable to exe mpt irrigation equipment. Rule 614 states and adds an example of computing the value by using a c ombination of both individual crop cash rent and crop share. The rule clarifies that only crops grown o n a typical farm in an \"Agricultural Area\" should be included in the crop rotation. All examples are up-dated to sho w the rent attributable to exempt irrigation equipment deducted from the total rent prior to capitalization. All examp les are up-dated to show amounts of rents, expenses, yields and prices that are closer to current expectations. Rule 630 : HB591 (2018) made operating property eligible for the New Cap ital Investment exemption. This rule is changed to enable the administration of the exemption for op erating property owners as well as the owners of locally assessed property. The rule require taxpayers to apply to the Tax Commission for the exemption whenever operating property is involved in the exemption. Rule 702 : HB492 (2018) provides a benefit of property tax reduction for veterans with a 100% service connected disability. This rule clarifies that benefit continues for a su rviving spouse but the surviving spouse may not transfer the benefit to a different homestead. The rule further clarifie s that i f an otherwise eligible claimant dies between January 1 and April 14 the spouse may file an application on be half of the deceased veteran and receive the benefit. Rule 802 : HB559 (2018) created a retroac tive provisional exemption whic h may be granted to property that will be used for an exempt purpose. This rule provides for the deduc tion from the new construction listing for any exemption of property that was previously added to the new cons truction listing. In addition, Section 63-301A, Idaho Code, and Subsection 802.06 provides that new construction is n ot counted in a revenue allocation area (RAA) until the RAA dissolves. This rule explains how new construction is counted when a dissolving RAA has expanded into a taxing district or when a taxing district has expanded into an RAA.STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 346 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9Rule 803 : HB559 (2018) created a provisional property tax exemption, HB 392 (2018) clarified the dates when solar farm gross earnings receipts are to be reported and deduc ted from property tax revenue, and HB567(a) revised the levy process to follow when cemetery taxing districts conso lidate. The changes describe the handling of revenue distributed or refunds made pertaining to the new provisional e xemption found in Section 63-602(4), Idaho Code. The dates for reporting certain gross earnings tax are changed to June 30 and the deduction of the solar revenue from the property tax budget is explained. A detailed explanation of how to compute levies for consolidating cemetery taxing districts is provided. Rule 804 will clarify whether or not the \"base assessment roll\" includes the property that existed in the revenue allocation area (RAA) at the time of RAA formation and subseque ntly became taxable. The rule explains a special case for exemption provided in section 63-602NN, Idaho Code. Upon loss of the exemption, any newly taxable value in excess of the taxable value o f the property in the year imme diately preceding the first y ear of the exemption is to be added to the increment value provided the property was within a n RAA when the exemption was granted and remains within the RAA at the time the exemption expires. If the parcel was annexed to an RAA during the period of the exemption, the value that would have been added to the base val ue at the time of annexation had the property not received the exemption would be added to the base at the time t he exemption expires, while any remaining taxable value would be added to the increment. If the exemption has bee n granted in part, the adjustments provided in this subparagraph shall only apply to the portion of the property gr anted the exemption. Rule 962 will adopt the process by which the county assessor may change a forest parcel's productivity class. The process, at a minimum, will set forth requirements for land owner notification, inspector qualifications and retention of documents.

When assessing all non-transient personal property, eac h assessor should be aware of the following quotation from this decision: \"Where the county undertakes to update its initial (personal property) declarations during the course of the tax year, it cannot increase a taxpayer's tax burden to reflect the taxpayer's acquisition of non-exempt property without decreasing that tax burden to reflect the fact that property reported by the taxpayer in an earlier declaration was no longer subject to the county's ad valorem tax.\" (Clarification added.)

PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION -- RESIDENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS -- SPECIAL SITUATIONS (RULE 610). Sections 63-602G and 63-701(2), Idaho Code 01. Scope . This rule addresses issues relating to the homeowner's exempt ion as it applies to certain unusual factual situations. It states general principles applic able to unusual cases and provides some illustrative examples. The rule cannot address every conceivable situation t hat may arise, but the principles established may apply to the resolution of situations not addressed in the rule . (7-1-99) 02. Definitions . The following definitions apply to this rule: (4-7-11) a. Dual Residency Couples. As used i n this rule, \"dual residency c ouple\" means a husband and wife, each of whom has established a different dwelling place as his or her primary dwelling place as defined in Section 63-602G, Idaho Code, and Subsection 609.03 of these rules. (4-2-08) b. Multidwelling or Multipurpose Building. \"Multidwelling or Multi purpose Building\" means a building which is the primary dwelling place of the owner and w hich has a portion used for any purpose other than the primary dwelling place of the owner. (4-7-11) c. Related Land. \"Related Land\" means land, not to exceed one (1) acre, that is reasonably necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home. (4-7-11) 03. Dual Residency Couples -- General Principles . (7-1-99) a. Whether a particular residential improvement is an individual's primary dwelling place is a question of fact for each individual. Each spouse of a dual res idency couple can maintain a separate primary dwelling place for purposes of the homeowner's exemption. The test to be applied is the general test set out in Subsection 609.03 of these rules. (4-2-08) b. If a residential improvement is community property, either the husband or wife may exercise full management or control over it, except that neither the husband nor the wife can sell or encumber the property without the written consent of the other. Thus, either the husband or t he wife can file an application for the homeowner's exemption regarding community property on his or her own author ity. The signature of the other spouse is not required on the application. See Section 32 -912, Idaho Code. (7-1-99) c. Neither spouse is a partial owner of community property. (This principle is an exception to laws generally governing community property interests. It applies on ly for matters relating to the homeowner's exemption or the circuit breaker property tax relief program. See Section 63-701(7) Idaho Code.) Thus, there is no authority to reduce the value of the improvement proportionally to reflect one (1) spouse's ownership in community property before determining the amount of the homeowner's exemption. For p u r p o s e s o f t h e h o m e o w n e r ' s e x e m p t i o n , a community property interest is treated the same as a full ownership interest. (3-15-02) d. An owner may apply only once for the homeowner's exemption. See Section 63 -602G(c), Idaho Code. Thus, an application by one (1) spouse regarding a reside ntial improvement that is community property, precludes the other spouse from making a second application on any other residential improvement whether held by the other spouse as community or separate property except as pr ovided in Subsection 610.07. (3-15-02) 04. Example -- Both Residences are Community Property . (7-1-99)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 349 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9a. Each member of a dual residency couple maintains his or her pri mary dwelling in a different residential improvement, each of which is owned by the couple a s community property. Each applies for the homeowner's exemption for the residence in which he or she resi des. (7-1-99) b. The first application is valid. Any subsequent application, tho ugh filed by the other spouse, is not valid because the couple can not make more than one (1) applica tion. The homeowner's exemption applies to the full value of the first residential improvement to qualify without a ny proportional reduction. The other residential improvement does not qualify. (3-15-02) 05. Example -- One Residence Is Community Prop erty, the Other Is Separate Pro perty . (7-1-99) a. Each member of a dual residency couple maintains his or her pri mary dwelling in a different residential improvement. One (1) is owned by the spouse who res ides in it as his or her separate property, the other is owned by the couple as community property. Each applies for the homeowner's exemption for the residence in which he or she resides. (7-1-99) b. The first application is valid. Any subsequent application, tho ugh filed by the other spouse, is not valid. If the first application relates to the community proper ty, it is an application on behalf of both members of the community. Thus, the other spouse can not file a second applica tion relating to his or her separate property. If the first application relates to the separate property, then the subseque nt application relating to the community property is a second application by the spouse owning the separate property a nd is not valid. The homeowner's exemption applies to the full value of the first residential improvement to quali fy without any proportional reduction. The other residential improvement does not qualify. (3-15-02) 06. Example -- Both Residences are Separate Property . (7-1-99) a. Each member of a dual residency couple maintains his or her pri mary dwelling in a different residential improvement, each of which is owned by the spouse r esiding in it as his or her separate property. Each applies for the homeowner's exemption for the residence in whic h he or she resides. (7-1-99) b. Both residential improvements qualify for the full homeowner's exemption. Neither application is a second application by the same owner. Each spouse is a sole own er of the residential improvement, so the proportional reduction provisions for partial ownership do not apply. (7-1-99) 07. Apportionment of Homeowner's Exemption by Dual Residency Cou ples. Both spouses of a dual residency couple may elect t o equally apportion the homeow ner's exemption between the two (2) residential improvements if each files a written election with the county a ssessor of the county in which each property is located. When the election is made each residential improvement shall be entitled to one-half (1/2) of the exemption applicable to that property alone. The total exempted value of both properties shall not exceed the amount of exemption available to the individual residential improvement w ith the greatest market value if no election were made. (4-5-00 ) 08 . Multiple Ownerships Including Community Interests as Partial Owners . A community property interest in a residential improvement is a partial own ership when combined with the ownership of another individual who is not a member of the marital community. For example, if a deed conveys title to real property to a husband and wife and to an adult child of theirs, the husband a nd wife hold a community property interest in the improvement and the child is a tenant-in-common provided ownership interests are not specified in the deed . The parents collectively hold a one-half (1/2) partial interest and the child holds a one-half (1/2) partial interest in the property. Ownership interests specified in the deed supersede this guidan ce. Qualification of the property for the homeowner's exemption is as follows: (3-28-18) ( ) a. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of the h usband and wife but not the child, the homeowner's exemption applies to one-half (1/2) of the valu e of the improvement. (3-28-18) b. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of the c hild, but not of the husband or wife, the homeowner's exemption applies to one-half (1/2) of the valu e of the improvement. (3-28-18)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 350 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9c. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of the husband, wife and child, the homeowner's exemption applies to the full value of the improvement. (3-15-02) d. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of one ( 1) spouse but of neither the other spouse nor the child, the homeowner's exemption applies to one- half (1/2) of the value of the improvement unless the residential improvement of the other spouse has previously qualified for the homeowner's exemption under the dual residency couple rules set out in Subsections 610.02 through 61 0.07. The one-half (1/2) qualification results from the statutory provision that a community property interest is not c onsidered a partial interest of either spouse. See Paragraph 610.03.c. of this rule. (3-28-18) e. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of one ( 1) spouse and the child, the homeowner's exemption applies to the full value of the improvement unless the residential improvement of the other spouse has previously qualified for the homeowner's exemption u nder the dual residency couple rules set out in Subsections 610.02 through 610.07. (3-15-02) 09. Determining the Qualifying Portion of a Multidwelling or Mul tipurpose Building and the Related Land . The portion of a Multidwelling or Multipurpose Building and R elated Land used for the primary dwelling place of the owner qualifies for the homeowner's exemp tion. When determining the value of the qualifying portion, the assessor shall inclu de the Related Land value. (4-7-11) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 613. PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION -- SPECULATIVE PORTION OF V AL UE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND (RULE 613). Section 63-602K, Idaho Code 01. Definitions . (4-5-00) a. Taxable Value of Agricultural Land.

To determine the reserves required to replace the irrigation system, divide the cost of the irrigation equipment per acre by the est imated number of years in the economic life of the irrigation system. ( ) f. Income attributable to the exempt irrigation system. Multiply the per acre reserves for replacement of the irrigation system by the five year rolling average inter est rate required by Section 63-602K, Idaho Code, plus a component for the local tax rate. ( ) g. The rent attributable to exempt irrigation equipment.

The notification required hereunder may be submitted by the tax payer to the State Tax Commission at any time after the qualifying period begins. However, if the notification is submitted after April 30 in a given year, a taxpayer may receive the benefit of the exemption only for ta x years following the year in which the notification is filed. Submittal of the operator's statement including notifica tion information required hereunder shall constitute STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 360 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9application for the exemption in compliance with Section 63-602 , Idaho Code. Until the taxpayer meets all the requirements for the New Capital Investments Tax exemption, for each year after the first year in which the exemption is granted, the notice must identify the location of the project site, but does not need to provide additional information as required in Paragraph 630.02.a. of this rule. ( ) 03. Notification of New Capital Investment - Taxpayers Applying on Behalf of both Locally and Centrally Assessed Property . A taxpayer may apply for this exemption on behalf of both loc ally and centrally assessed property located in the same county. ( ) a. The taxpayer must comply with notice requirements in Subsection 630.01 of this rule for locally assessed property and for centrally assessed property the April 30 filing deadline found in Paragraph 630.02.b of this rule shall apply. ( ) b. Once the taxpayer notifies the State Tax Commission as provided in Subsection 630.02 of this rule, the State Tax Commission will notify the county commissioners and county assessor by the second Monday in May of the taxpayer's new capital investment project property to be locally assessed and of the taxpayer's filing an application for the exemption. By the later of the fourth Monda y in July or the conclusion of the county board of equalization, as provided in Section 63-501, Idaho Code, the co unty clerk must provide to the State Tax Commission a statement of the equalized asses sed value of the taxpayer's l ocally assessed property. ( ) c. The exemption will be granted by the State Tax Commission, whic h will notify the county commissioners and taxpayer by the first Monday in September of the amount of the exemption and the remaining taxable value of the centrally assessed operating property of t he taxpayer. This remaining value is to be calculated so that the sum of the centrally and locally assessed property of the taxpayer in the county in which the exemption is being granted does not exceed four hundred million dollars ($40 0,000,000). ( ) d. The exemption will apply to the combined total value of the loc ally and centrally assessed property of the taxpayer within the county in which the project site is located. For continuation of the exemption for both locally and centrally assessed property, Subsections 630.07 and 630.08 of this rule shall apply, and, upon satisfaction of the requirements therein, the State Tax Commission shall notify the county of the continuing exemption. ( ) 024. Property of the Taxpayer . Property of a taxpayer includes all real , or p e r s o n a l , or operating property that is owned by or leased to the taxpayer under an agreement that makes the taxpayer responsible for the payment of any property taxes on the property. (3-29-12) ( ) 035. New Construction . Property taxable under Section 63-4502, Idaho Code and that q ualifies for listing on the new construction roll as described by Section 63 -301(A)3, Idaho Code, should be listed on the new construction roll. (3-29-12) 046. Failure to Make the Qualifying New Capital Investment . (4-4-13) a. If the taxpayer fails to make the qualifying new capital invest ment during the qualifying period, the property shall lose the exemption granted by this section at th e conclusion of the qualifying period. (4-4-13) b. In the event that, at any time during the project qualifying p e r i o d , t h e t a x p a y e r receiving the exemption for locally assessed property no longer intends to fulfill the qualified new capital investm ent requirements, the taxpayer must notify the county commissioners who shall not ify the county assessor. Upon receipt of such notification, the property previously granted the exemption shall be come taxable for the remainder of the year in which the notification is provided, pursuant to Section 63-602Y , Idaho Code. Failure of the taxpayer to provide such notice does not prevent the county assessor from discovering th e taxpayer's intent through alternate procedures and then notifying the county commissioners that the requirements f or the exemption are no longer met. In such an instance, the taxpayer must be notified and may appeal loss of the exemption to the county board of equalization as provided in Section 63-501A, Idaho Code. (4-4-13) ( ) c. In the event that, at any time during the qualifying period, th e taxpayer receiving the exemption for operating property no longer intends to fulfill the qualified n ew capital investment requirements, the taxpayer must notify the State Tax Commission. Upon receipt of such notificat ion, the property previously granted the exemption STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 361 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9shall become taxable. If the notification is received before th e State Tax Commission has completed the assessment of the operating property for a given year, the exemption shall no t be granted for that year. If the notification is received after the assessment is completed , the exemption shall be rescinded beginning the following tax year. If the taxpayer owns centrally and locally assessed property, the tax commissio n will also notify the county commissioners and assessor of the rescinding of the exemption. ( ) 057. Continuation of Tax Exemption Following the End of the Project Qualifying Period - Locally Assessed Property . (4-4-13) ( ) a. At any time during the qualifying period, but not later than ni nety (90) days after the conclusion of the qualifying period, the taxpayer must provide notice to the county commissioners with sufficient evidence to prove that the required qualifying new capital investment has been ma de. (4-4-13) b. Once the taxpayer has successfully met all the requirements pur suant to Section 63-4502, Idaho Code, and provided notice to the county commissioners pursuant to Paragraph 630.05 7.a. of this rule, the county commissioners shall notify the county assessor and taxpayer of the taxpayer's continuing qualification for the exemption for all year s thereafter. The county assessor shall r etain this notice. (4-4-13) ( ) c. After the year in which the taxp ayer has been notified of conti nuing qualification as provided in Paragraph 630.0 57.b. of this rule, the taxpayer must continue to notify the county annually to identify the property to be exempted pursuant to Subsection 630.0 57. Failure to make such notification will not invalidate the exe mption; the county assessor must then apply the exemption against the asses sed value of the taxpayer's highest value parcel within the county. (4-4-13) ( ) 08. Continuation of Tax Exemption Following the End of the Qualifyi n g P e r i o d - C e n t r a l l y Assessed Operating Property . ( ) a. At any time during the qualifying period after the requirements for this exemption have been met, but not later than ninety (90) days after the conclusion of the qualifying period, the taxpayer must provide notice to the State Tax Commission with sufficient evidence to prove that the required qualifying new capital investment has been made. ( ) b. Once the taxpayer has successfully met all the requirements pur suant to Section 63-4502, Idaho Code, and provided notice to the State Tax Commission pursuant to Paragraph 630.08.a. of this rule, the State Tax Commission shall notify the taxpayer that the exemption will co ntinue to be granted in perpetuity, and shall notify the taxpayer annually prior to the due date for the operator's stat ement that they must identify the property qualifying for the exemption in these statements. Failure to provide either no tification will not invalidate the exemption; the State Tax Commission must then apply the exemption against the assess ed value of the taxpayer's operating property within the county. Centrally assessed taxable property otherwis e permitted to be included on the new construction roll will be reported to the county assessor for inclusion on the next available new construction roll. ( ) 069. Cross Reference . For an explanation of the treatment of new construction relat ing to Sections 63- 802 and 63-301A, Idaho Code, see Rule 802 of these rules.

This rule addresses issues relating to the property tax reduc tion benefit program as it applies to certain unusual factual situations. It states general princi ples applicable to unusual cases and provides some illustrative examples. The rule cannot address every conceivabl e situation that may arise, but the principles established may apply to the resolution of situations not addre ssed in the rule. The following examples apply to qualified property tax reduction claimants. (3-30-01)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 362 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-902. General Principles . Benefits under the property tax reduction program are only av ailable to owners of property that have first qualified for the homeowner' s exemption under Section 63 -602G, Idaho Code. See Rule 610 of these rules. (3-15-02) 03. Dual Residency Couples . The definition of \"dual residency couple\" in Rule 610.02 of t hese rules applies to this rule. (3-15-02) a. Example -- Both residences are community property. Property tax reduction is available in regard only to the residential improvement qualifying for the homeowne r's exemption. See Rule 610.04 of these rules. (3-15-02) b. Example -- One (1) residence is community property , the other is separate property. Property tax reduction is available in regard only to the residential improv ement qualifying for the homeowner's exemption. See Rule 610.05 of these rules. (3-15-02) c. Example -- Both residences are separate property. Property tax reduction is available in regard to both residential improvements. S ee Rule 610.06 of these rules. (3-15-02) d. Household income. In the three (3) examples in Subsection 709.0 3, the household income upon which qualification is determined is the total of one-half (1/2 ) the community income plus any separate income of the spouse residing in the residence. (3-15-02) 04. Apportionment of Property Tax Reduction Benefits by Dual Res idency Couples . If a dual residency couple makes the election provided in Subsection 610. 07 of these rules and the applicable county assessor provided the State Tax Commissio n with a copy of the election r equired under that rule, each spouse shall be entitled to one-half (1/2) of the amount of any property tax reduction a vailable to that spouse alone. The household income of the spouse shall be one-half (1/2) of the community income plus any separate income of the spouse residing in the residence. The total property tax reduction benefit shall not e xceed the amount of benefit available to the individual spouse with the least household income if no election were made . (3-15-02) 05. Multiple Ownerships Including Community Interests as Partial Owners . Example: A deed conveys title to real property to a husband and wife and to an adult child of theirs. The husband and wife hold a community property interest in th e improvement an d the child is a tenant-in-common provided ownership interests are not specified in the deed . The parents collectively hold a one-half (1/2) partial intere st and the child holds a one- h a l f ( 1 / 2 ) p a r t i a l i n t e r e s t i n t h e p r o p e r t y . Ownership interests specific in the deed supersede this guidanc e. F o r clarification of the calculation of the net taxable value, see Rule 700.05.b. of these rules. Qualification for the property tax reduction is as follows: (3-28-18) ( ) a. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of the h usband and wife but not of the child, the claimant qualifies for full benefits applied on one-half (1 /2) of the value of the property less the homeowner's exemption. Household income is the total of the community and s eparate income of the spouses. (3-28-18) b. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of the q ualifying child, but neither the husband or wife, the claimant qualifies for full benefits appli ed on one-half (1/2) of the value of the property less the homeowner's exemption. Household income is the total of the chi ld's income. (3-28-18) c. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of the h usband, wife and a qualifying child, the claimant qualifies for the full benefits applied on full va lue of the property less the homeowner's exemption. Household income is the total of the community and separate inc ome of the spouses and t he income of the child. (3-15-02) d. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of one ( 1) spouse but of neither the other spouse nor the child, the claimant qualifies for full benefits applied on one-half (1/2) of the value of the property less the homeowner's exemption unless the residential improvement of the other spouse has qualified for the homeowner's exemption. Household income is the total income of both spouses. (3-28-18) e. If the residential improvement is the primary dwelling of one ( 1) spouse and a qualifying child, the STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 363 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9claimant qualifies for the full benefits applied on the full va lue of the property less the homeowner's exemption unless the residential improvement of the other spouse has previously qualified for the homeowner's exemption. Household income is the total income of both spouses plus the income of t he child. (3-15-02) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 802. BUDGET CERTIFICATION RELATING TO NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ANNEX ATION (RULE 802). Sections 63-802, 63-301A, 63-602W, and 63-602NN, Idaho Code 01. a. \"Change of Land Use Classification.\" \"Change of land use classi fication\" shall mean any change in land use resulting in a secondary category change and in a chan ge in taxable land value to be reflected on the current property roll. (4-7-11) b. \"Incremental Value as of Decembe r 31, 2006.\" \"Incremental value as of December 31, 2006\" means the total of the increment values on the property roll, s ubsequent property roll, missed property roll, and operating property roll for the 2006 tax year. (4-7-11) c. \"Non-residential Structure.\" \"Non-residential structure\" shall mean any structure listed by the assessor in any secondary category not described as residential , manufactured homes, or improvements to manufactured homes in Rule 511 of these rules. (4-2-08) 02. New Construction Roll Listing . \"Listing\" shall mean a summary report of the net taxable valu e of property listed on the new construction roll. This listing shal l include the taxable value of qualifying new construction throughout each taxing district or unit, but shall not include otherwise qualifying new construction, the value of which will be included in the increment value of any revenue al location area (RAA) within any urban renewal district encompassed by the taxing district or unit. In addition, new co nstruction related to change of land use classification, but required by section 50-2903(4) to be added to the base asse ssment roll, cannot be added to any new construction roll. This report is to summarize the value reported on the new construction roll by taxing district or unit. Taxing districts and units shall be listed in the same order that is u sed for the certification of value required pursuant to Section 63-510(1), Idaho Code. (3-29-12) a. Qualifying new construction which is valued by the State Tax Co mmission shall be reported to the county assessor for each applicable taxing district by October 1 and shall be listed by the assessor on the immediate next new construction roll. (3-25-16) b. Previously allowable new construction that has never been inclu ded. When a taxing district proves new construction described by Section 63-301A(3), Idaho Code, o ccurred during any one of the immediately preceding five (5) years and has never been included on a new c onstruction roll, the county assessor must list that property on the immediate next new construction roll at the val ue proven by the taxing district. Any such additional new construction must also be separately listed for each taxing district or unit. The taxing district has the burden of proving the new construction was omitted from a new constructio n roll and the value that would have been listed for that p roperty had it been listed on the appropriate new construction roll. No taxing district shall ever be granted any increase in budget authority greater than the amount that would have resulted had the property been listed on the appropriate new construction roll. Regardless of the year that the new construction should have been listed on the appropriate new construction roll, additional budget authority resulting from new construction previously omitted from a new construction roll and listed on the current year's n ew construction roll shall be permitted only if the taxing district is in compliance with the budget hearing notification requirements of Section 63-802A, Idaho Code, for the current year. (3-29-12) c. Reporting the amount of taxable market value to be deducted. Fo r each taxing district or unit, the new construction roll listing shall separately identify the tot al amount of taxable market value to be deducted as STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 364 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9required in Section 63-301A(1)(f), Idaho Code , and Paragraph 802.02.e., of this rule . In addition to other requirements, the amount of value deducted shall never exceed t he amount originally added to a new construction roll. (3-29-12) ( ) d. Determining the amount of taxable market value to be deducted - appeals . The amount of taxable market value to be deducted under Section 63-301A(1)(f)(i), Ida ho Code, shall be determined by the highest authority to which the assessment is ultimately appealed. Accordingly, ad justments should not be made until there has been a final decision on any appeal. In addition, the deduction for lo wer values resulting from appeals shall be made only for property that was placed on a ne w construction roll within the immediately preceding five (5) years. (3-29-12) ( ) e. Determining the amount of taxable market value to be deducted - provisional exemptions. Provided the addition occurred within the immediate preceding f ive (5) years but not earlier than 2016, the amount of taxable market value added to any new construction roll for pro perty subsequently granted a provisional exemption under Section 63-1305C, Idaho Code, shall be deducted from the taxable market value otherwise included on the immediate next new construction roll prepared following the gra nting of the provisional exemption. ( ) 03. Special Provisions for Value Increases and Decreases . Special provisions for value increases and decreases related to change of land use classification as defin ed in Paragraph 802.01.a. of this rule or increases in land value resulting from loss of the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code. (4-4-13) a. Value increases. Certain related land value increases are to be included on the new construction roll. (4-7-11) i. Except as provided in Subparagraph 802.03.a.iii., increases i n land value shall be reported on the new construction roll in the year in which the new category app ears on the current property roll. (4-4-13) ii. Except as provided in Subparagraph 802.03.a.iii., the increa se in taxable land value to be reported shall be computed by subtracting the taxable land value, had th e land remained in its previous use category, from the taxable land value in the current use category. (4-4-13) iii. Subject to the limitations found in Paragraph 802.06.a. of this rule, increases in land value resulting from loss of the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idah o Code, shall be reported on the new construction roll in the year the exemption is lost, provided this occurs no later than June 30 of that year. If the exemption is lost after June 30 of a given year, the resulting increase in land v alue shall be reported on the new construction roll in the immediate following year. (4-4-13) b. Value decreases. Certain related land value decreases are to be included on the new construction roll and subtracted from total new construction value for any t axing district. The amount of decrease in any one year shall never exceed the amount of value originally added to the new construction roll for the same property. (4-4-13) i. Value decreases are to be reported only for land for which ta xable market value was reduced as a result of change of land use classification or granting of the exemption for site improvements provided in Section 63- 602W(4), Idaho Code, during any one (1) of the immediately preceding five (5) years and for which an increase in value due to addition of site improvements or change of land us e classification during the same five-year period had been added to a new construction roll. For the site improvement exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, the five-year period shall commence with the year followi n g t h e y e a r t h e e x e m p t i o n i s f i r s t g r a n t e d . F o r example, if a parcel first received the exemption in 2012, any site improvement related addition to a new construction roll for 2008 or more recently must be subtracted from the 2013 new construction roll, unless the exemption is lost by June 30, 2013, in which case there is no subtraction and no add ition to the new construction roll for the loss of this exemption. (4-4-13) ii. If the current land category is the same as the category pri or to the change that resulted in an addition to the new construction roll, the amount to be subtracted shall equal the amount originally added. For example, a dry grazing land par cel that would have had a value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) became commercial land and was assessed at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The forty thousand dollar ($40,000) difference was reported on the new construction roll in year one (1). In year two (2), the parcel is reclassified as dry grazing land and is to be assessed at fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). The fo rty thousand dollar ($40,000) difference that was added STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 365 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9to the year one (1) new construction roll must be deducted from the value shown on the new construction roll in year two (2). (4-7-11) iii. If the current land category is different than the category prior to the change that resulted in an addition to the new construction roll, the amount to be subtracted shall be the lesser of the amount originally added or the amount that would have been added had the first change in land use been from the current land category. For example, a dry grazing land par cel that would have had a value of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) became commercial land and was assessed at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The forty thousand dollar ($40,000) difference was reported on the new construction roll in year one (1). In year two (2), the parcel is reclassified as irrigated agricultural land and would have had a value in year one (1) of twenty thous and dollars ($20,000). The amount to be subtracted from the value shown on the new construction roll in year two ( 2) is thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). (4-7-11) iv. Provided the criteria in Subparagraph 802.03.b.i. are met, v alue decreases resulting from previously included land value becoming exempt are to be reported and subt racted. (4-4-13) v. Except as provided in Subparagraph 802.03.b.vi., only land va lue decreases that meet the criteria listed in Subparagraphs 802.03.b.i. or 802.03.b.iv. of this rule and include and result from a change in land secondary category can be considered. (4-4-13) vi. Provided the criteria in Subparagraph 802.03.b.i. are met, l and value decreases resulting from the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, are to be subtracted from the new construction roll in the year immediately following the most recent year in which the ex emption has been granted. To comply with the budget adjustments required by Section 63-802, Idaho Code, whic h limits taxing district budgets based on the highest amount of property tax revenue requested during the previous th ree (3) years, such subtraction shall be required for up to three (3) years, provided the property continues to recei ve the exemption. For example, a property for which five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) was added to the 2011 new construction roll for site improvements that were added and taxable at that time receives a five hundred tho usand dollar ($500,000) exemption pursuant to Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, in 2012. The property continues to receive the exemption in the same amount in 2013, but the exempt amount increases to five hundred twenty th ousand dollars ($520,000) in 2014. The property loses the exemption before June 30, 2015. However, the 2015 val ue of the site improvements has been determined to be only four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) because of mar ket value changes. Therefore, only four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) in value is added as a result of the loss of the exemption. T able A shows the effect on each year's new construction roll, while Table B shows the effe ct on a hypothetical taxing district's maximum allowable property tax budget. (4-4-13) vii. Table A - Effect on New Construction Roll: (4-4-13) viii. In Table B, assume that the taxing district has a tax levy rate of zero point zero zero two five (0.0025) in 2010, a total taxable value of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) in 2010 and a property tax budget in 2010 that is two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250 ,000) and was the highest of the preceding three (3) years. The total amount of new construction is the amount due t o the site improvements and no other value change occurs i n the district during th e period shown. There are no pr operty tax replacement monies for this district. Beginning in 2011 the taxing district levies the maximum it is allowed each year.

(4-4-13) ix. Table B - Effect on Hypothetical Taxing District's Maximum A llowable Property Tax Budget: (4-4-13) 04. Manufactured Housing . \"Installation\" of new or used manufactured housing shall mean capturing the net taxable market value of the improvement(s) that did not previously exist within the county. (7-1-97) 05. Partial New Construction Values . Except as provided in Subsection 802.06 of this rule, the net taxable market value attributable directly to new construction shall be reported on the new construction roll in the tax year it is placed on the curren t assessment roll. Except as pro vided in Subsection 802.06 of this rule, any increase in a non-residential parcel's taxable value, due to new construction , shall be computed by subtracting the previous year's or years' partial taxable value(s) from the current taxable val ue. If any of this difference is attributable to inflation, such value, except as provided in Subsection 802.06 of this rul e, shall not be included on the new construction roll. Example: Assume a partially completed, non-residential improvem ent was assessed at ten thousand dollars ($10,000) as of January 1, 2009. The improvement was occupied February 2, 2009. Assume the ten thousand dollar ($10,000) value was on the 2009 new construction roll. Assume t hat in 2010 the improvement is assessed at ninety thousand dollars ($90,000). Assume there has been no inflation. The value that can be reported on the 2010 new construction roll is calculated as follows: (4-7-11)Table B - Effect on Hypothetical Taxing District's Maximum Allo wable Property Tax Budget Year OccurrenceEffect on New Construction Roll (for that year)Maximum Allowable Property Tax Budget Calculations 2011Site improvements added and taxable+ $500,000 $258,750($250,000 X 1.03) + ($500,000 X 0.0025) (tax levy rate = $258,750/$100,500,000 = 0.002574627) 2012 Site improvements exemptNA (no prior year's exemption; no new construction value)$266,512$258,750 X 1.03(tax levy rate = $266,512/$100,000,000 = 0.002665120 2013 Site improvements exempt - $500,000 $273,174($266,512 X 1.03) - ($500,000 X 0.002665120)(tax levy rate = $273,174 / $100,000,000 = 0.002731744) 2014 Site improvements exempt - $500,000 $280,003($273,174 X 1.03) - ($500,000 X 0.002731744) (tax levy rate = $280,003/ $100,000,000 = 0.002800033 2015Loses site improvement exemption before June 30+ $400,000 $289,523($280,003 X 1.03) + ($400,000 X 0.002731744) (tax levy rate = $289,523/$100,400,000 = 0.002883696 2010 Value $90,000 2009 Value Already Reported on New Construction Roll <$10,000> 2010 New Construction Roll Value (this improvement) $80,000STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 367 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-906.

A previously exempt improvement which becomes taxable shall not be included on the new construction roll, unless the loss of the exemption occurs duri ng the year in which the improvement was constructed or unless the improvement has lost the exemption provided in Se ction 63-602W(3) or (4), Section 63-602E(3), or Section 63-602NN, Idaho Code. For any such property, the amount that may be included on the new construction roll shall be the value of the portion of the property subject to th e exemption at the time the exemption was first granted. For otherwise qualifying property that loses the exemption prov ided in Section 63-602NN, Idaho Code, but that has had its value added to the base assessment roll in a revenue al location area as provided in Rule 804 of these rules, the value so added may be added to the new construction roll. Examples of special cases for the exemption provided in Section 63-602W(4), Idaho Code, follow: (4-4-13) ( ) i. If the exemption is lost by June 30 of the year in which the exempt amount was to be subtracted from the new construction roll, then there shall be no subtraction, nor shall the formerly exempt amount be added, to the new construction roll, unless it had been previously subtra cted from a new construction roll. For example, the property first became exempt in 2012, but lost the exemption by June 30, 2013. The 2013 new construction roll was not adjusted downward, so any previous inclusion of the exempt value would not be added in the future. Had the property lost the exemption later in 2013, there would have been a subtraction from the 2013 new construction roll and a subsequent addition to the 2014 new construction roll. (4-4-13) ii. If the exemption was granted to property for which no value had been added to any new construction roll, the value of the property (site improvements ) at the time the exemption was first granted may be added to the new construction roll following loss of the exempt ion. (4-4-13) b. UExcept as provided in Paragraph 802.06.e. of this rule, u pon receipt by the State Tax Commission of a resolution recommending adoption of an ordinance for termi nation of an RAA under Section 50-2903(5), Idaho Code, any not previously included positive difference of the mo st current increment value minus the \"incremental value as of December 31, 2006,\" or the entire current increment value, if there was no such value as of December 31, 2006, shall be added to the appropriate year's new construction roll. Upon the effective date of any de-annexation of a portion of an RAA, the immediate prior year's increment value associated with the parcels in the de-annexed area is to be included in the appropriate year's new construction roll as described in Paragraph 802.06.d. of this rule, provided such value has not been previously included on any new construction roll. When this information is received after the fourth Monday in July, this positive net inc rement value shall be added to the following year's new construction roll. (3-29-17) ( ) c. Taxable value included in the base value in an RAA, but not pre viously on any new construction roll and otherwise eligible to be included on a new constructio n roll due to change of land use classification, shall be included on the next new constru ction roll prepared following d issolution of the RAA or deannexation of any affected parcel from the RAA. The value to be included shall be the valu e that would have been included at the time the change of land use classification occurred had the parcel not b een located in the RAA. ( ) cd. Upon receipt by the State Tax Co mmission of an attestation indi cating that an urban renewal plan has been modified in such a way as to result in resetting the b ase value in an RAA, as provided in Section 50-2903A, Idaho Code, increases in base value due to the addition of previously determined increment value may be added to the new construction roll as described in Section 63-301A(3)(j), Id aho Code, provided such value has not previously been included on any new construction roll. In such a case, at termination of the RAA, only new additional increment value following the reset of the base value shall be included o n the new construction roll. (3-29-17) de.

The following table shows the amount to be added to the curre nt year's new construction roll and the amount to be subtracted from the \"incremental value as of December 31, 2006\" applicable to the adjusted remaining RAA. The table assumes an area is de-annexed from a n original RAA effective December 31, 2016. (3-29-17) vi. If the de-annexation in the example in sub-paragraph v. had taken effect prior to the fourth Monday of July 2016, the 2015 increment value for the affected parcels would have been added to the 2016 new construction roll after subtracting the 2006 increment value. (3-29-17) vii. The value of operating property increment value to be inclu ded on the new constriction roll when a de-annexation occurs is computed as shown in the following exam ple: (3-29-17)Steps (as designated in Paragraph 802.06.d.)Area Value December 31, 2006, increment value of the original RAA $10,000,0 00 Step 1 December 31, 2006, increment value of the de-annexed area $1,000,000 December 31, 2015, increment value of the de-annexed area $3,000 ,000 Steps 2 and 3Amount related to the de-annexed area to be added to the 2017 new construction roll$2,000,000 Step 4Adjustment amount to be deducted from the original RAA's \"incremental value as of December 31, 2006\"<$1,000,000> Adjusted \"incremental value as of December 31, 2006\" for the remaining RAA (base for future new construction roll additions upon dissolution of all or part of remaining RAA)$9,000,000 Sum the previous year's increment values of the locally assesse d parcels in the area to be de-annexed$15,000,000 Divide this sum by the previous year's increment value of all locally assessed parcels in the RAA$15,000,000 \u00f7 $130,000,000=.1154 Multiply by 100 to determine the percentage applicable to the locally assessed parcels located within the area to be de-annex ed.1154 x 100 = 11.54% Determine the difference between the operating property increme nt value in the whole RAA for the year preceding the de-annexation from the 2006 increment value of all operating in the whole RAA$2,000,000 - $500,000 = $1,500,000 Multiply the locally assessed percentage by the increase in the operating property increment value11.54% x $1,500,000 = $173,100 The value of operating property increment to be included on the new construction roll when a de-annexation occurs$173,100STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 369 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9f. For taxing districts formed after December 31, 2006, or annexin g or being annexed into a revenue allocation area after that date, the amount of increment value to be added to the new construction roll will equal any positive difference between the increment value at the time of formation of the taxing district or annexation by or into the revenue allocation area and the increment value at the time of dissolution of the revenue allocation area or the increment value within the area deannexed from the revenue allo cation area. ( ) 07. Limitation on Annexation and New Construction Roll Value . For any taxing district annexing property in a given year, the new construction roll for the fol lowing year shall not include value that has been included in the annexation value.

This difference shall be used as this city's property tax funded budget for the most r ecent year of the three (3) yea rs preceding the current tax year for the purpose of deciding the property tax funded budget that may be increased a s provided by Section 63-802, Idaho Code. (4-6-05) 09. Special Provisions for Calculating Total Levy Rate for Taxin g Districts or Units with Multiple Funds . Whenever the \"Calculated Levy Rate\" column of the L-2 Form in dicates that a levy rate has been calculated for more than one (1) fund for any taxing district or unit, the \"Column Total\" entry must be the sum of the levy rates calculated for each fund. Prior to this summation, the levy rat es to be summed must be rounded or truncated at the ninth decimal place. No additional rounding is permitted for th e column total. (4-6-05) 10. Special Provisions for School Districts' Tort Funds - Hypoth etical New Construction Levy . To calculate the new construction portion of the allowed annual in crease in a school district's tort fund under Section 63- 802(1), Idaho Code, calculate a Hypothetical New Construction L evy. To calculate this hypothetical levy, sum the amount of the school district's tort fund levied for the prior year, the agricultural equipment replacement revenue, and STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 375 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9the personal property replacement revenue, then divide this sum by the school district's taxable value used to determine the tort fund's levy for the prior year. For the current year, the allowed tort fund increase for new construction is this Hypothetical New Construction Levy times t he current year's new construction roll value for the school district. (3-25-16) 11. Special Provisions for In terim Abatement Districts . When an interim abatement district transitions into a formally defined abatement district under Se ction 39-2812, Idaho Code, the formally defined abatement district shall not be considered a new taxing distric t as defined in Paragraph 803.01.g. of this rule for the purposes of Section 63-802, Idaho Code. For the formally define d abatement district, the annual budget subject to the limitations of Section 63-802, Idaho Code, shall be the amount of property tax revenue approved for the interim abatement district. (4-2-08) 12. Special Provisions for Consolidating Cemetery Districts . When two (2) or more cemetery districts consolidate, the first year in which the consolidated cemetery district levies property tax, the maximum budget subject to the limitations of Section 63-802, Idaho Code , shall be computed as follows: ( ) a. Determine the highest levy rate of any of the former cemetery d istricts now consolidating, based on the sum of the immediate prior year's levies subject to the limitations of Section 63-802, Idaho Code. ( ) b. M u l t i p l y t h i s l e v y r a t e b y t h e c u r r e n t t a x a b l e v a l u e o f p r o p e r t y w i t h i n t h e a r e a o f t h e f o r m e r cemetery districts other than the district with the highest rate. ( ) c. Multiply this levy rate by the current taxable value of new con struction, as reported on the new construction roll, within the area of the former cemetery distr ict with the highest levy rate. ( ) d. ) ii. Three percent (3%) of the highest amount of property taxes cert ified by the former cemetery district determined in Paragraph 803.12.a. of this rule, to have had the highest levy rate, for its annual budget, as defined in Section 63-802(1)(a), Idaho Code; and ( ) iii. Any forgone amounts of the former cemetery districts now consolidating. ( ) 123. Cross Reference for School Districts with Tuition Funds. School district tuition fund levies are exempt from the limitations of Section 63-802, Idaho Code. See Section 33-1408, Idaho Code. (4-11-15) 804. TAX LEVY - CERTIFICATION - URBAN RENEWAL DISTRICTS (RULE 80 4). Sections 50-2908, 50-2033, 50-1903, 50-2903A, (4-5-00) a. \"Urban renewal district.\" An urban renewal district, as referred to in Section 63-215, Idaho Code, shall mean an urban renewal area formed pursuant to an urban re newal plan adopted in accordance with Section 50- 2008, Idaho Code. Urban renewal districts are not taxing districts. (4-5-00) b. \"Revenue allocation area (RAA).\" A revenue allocation area (RAA ) as referred to in Section 50- 2908, Idaho Code, shall be the area defined in Section 50-2903, Idaho Code, in which base and increment values are to be determined. A new urban renewal plan is required when an urban renewal agency establishes a new RAA. Revenue allocation areas (RAAs) are not taxing districts. (3-29- 17) c. \"Current base value.\" The current base value of each parcel in a taxing district or unit shall be the value of that parcel on the current base assessment roll as def ined under Section 50-2903, Idaho Code. Current base value does not include value found on the occupancy roll. (4-5-0 0) d. \"Initial base value.\" The initial base value for each parcel is the sum of the taxable value of each STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 376 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9category of property in the parcel for the year the RAA is esta blished. In the case of annexation to an RAA, initial base value of each annexed parcel shall be the value of that pa rcel as of January 1 of the year in which the annexation takes place. (4-11-15) e. \"Increment value.\" The increment value is the difference betwee n the current equalized value of each parcel of taxable property in the RAA and that parcel's cu rrent base value, provided such difference is a positive value. (4-5-00) f. \"Revenue allocation financing provision.\" A revenue allocation area (RAA) shall be considered to be a revenue allocation financing provision. (3-29-17) 02. Establishing and Adjusting Base and Increment Values . (4-5-00) a. Establishing initial base value. If a parcel's legal descriptio n has changed prior to computing initial base year value, the value that best reflects the prior year's taxable value of the parcel's c urrent legal description must be determined and will constitute the initial base year value f or such parcel. The initial base value includes the taxable value, as of the effective date of the ordinance adopting the u rban renewal plan, of all otherwise taxable property, as defined in Section 50-2903, Idaho Code. Initial base value does not include value found on the occupancy roll. (4-5-00) b. Adjustments to base value - general value changes. Adjustments to base values will be calculated on a parcel by parcel basis, each parcel being a unit and the t otal value of the unit being used in the calculation of any adjustment. Base values are to be adjusted downward when the cu rrent taxable value of any parcel in the RAA is less than the most recent base value for such parcel. In the case of parcels containing some categories of property which increase in value and some which decrease, the base value for t he parcel will only decrease provided the sum of the changes in category values results in a decrease in total parcel value. Any adjustments shall be made by category and may result in increases or decreases to base values for given c ategories of property for any parcel. Adjustments to base values for any real, personal, or operating property shall establish new base values from which future adjustments may be made. In the following examples the parcel's initial base value is one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), including Category 21 value of twenty thousand doll ars ($20,000) and Category 42 value of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000). (4-5-00) i. Case 1: Offsetting decreases and increases in value. One (1) year later the parcel has a one thousand dollar ($1,000) decrease in value in Category 21 and a one thou sand dollar ($1,000) increase in Category 42 value. There is no change in the base value for the parcel. (4-5-00) ii. Case 2: Partially offsetting decreases and increases in valu e. One (1) year later the parcel has a three thousand dollars ($3,000) decrease in value in Category 21 and a one thousand dollars ($1,000) increase in Category 42 value. The base value decreases two thousand dollar s ($2,000) to ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000). (4-5-00) iii. Case 3: Future increase in value following decreases. One ( 1) year after the parcel in Case 2 has a base value reduced to ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), the value of the parcel increases by five thousand dolla rs ($5,000) which is the net of category changes. The base value remains at ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000). (4-5-00) c. Adjustments to base value - splits and combinations. Before oth er adjustments can be made, the most recent base value must be adjusted to reflect changes in e ach parcel's legal description. This adjustment shall be calculated as described in the following subsections. (4-5-00) i. When a parcel has been split, the most recent base year value is transferred to the new parcels, making sure that the new total equals the most recent base year value. Proportions used to determine the amount of base value assigned to each of the new parcels shall be based o n the value of the new parcels had they existed in the year preceding the year for which the value of the new parcels is first established. (4-11-15) ii. When a parcel has been combine d with another parcel, the mos t recent base year values are added together. (4-5-00)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 377 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9iii. When a parcel has been split and combined with another parc el in the same year, the value of the split shall be calculated as set forth in Subparagraph 804.02.c .i. and then the value of the combination will be calculated as set forth in Subparagraph 804.02.c.ii. (4-5-00) d. Adjustments to base values when exempt parcels become taxable. Base values shall be adjusted as described in the following subsections. (4-5-00) i. Fully exempt parcels at time of RAA establishment. When a par cel that was exempt at the time the RAA was established becomes taxable, the base value is to be adjusted upwards to reflect the estimated value of the formerly exempt parcel as it existed at the time the RAA was established. (4-5-00) ( ) ii. Partially exempt parcels losing the speculative value exempt ion. When a partially exempt parcel with a speculative value exemption that applies to farmland wit hin the RAA becomes fully t axable, the base value of the RAA shall be adjusted upwards by the difference between the taxable value of the parcel for the year in which the exemption is lost and the taxable value of the parcel included in the base value of the RAA. For example, assume a parcel of farmland within an RAA had a taxable value of five hu ndred dollars ($500) in the year the RAA base value was established. Assume also that this parcel had a speculative value exemption of two thousand dollars ($2,000) at that time. Two (2) years later th e parcel is reclassified as in dustrial land, loses the speculative value exemption, and has a current taxable value of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) . The base value within the RAA would be adjusted upwards by forty-nine thousand five hundred dollars ($49,500), the difference between fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and five hundred ($500). The preceding example applie s only in cases of loss of the speculative value exemption that applies to land actively devoted to agriculture and does not apply to timberland. Site improvements, such as roads and utilities, that become taxable after the loss of the speculative value exemption are not to be added to the base value. For example, if, in addition to the fifty thous and dollars ($50,000) current taxable value of the undeveloped land, site improvements valued at twenty-five thous and dollars ($25,000) are added, the amount reflected in the base value remains fifty thousand dollars ($50 ,000), and the additional twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) is added to the increment value. In addition, this ex ample applies only to land that loses the speculative value exemption as a result of changes occurring in 2010 or lat er and first affecting taxable values in 2011 or later. Parcels that lost speculative value exemptions prior to 2010 ha d base value adjustments as described in Subparagraph 804.02.d.iii. of this rule. (3-29-12) iii. Partially exempt parcels other than those losing the specul ative value exemption. Except as provided in Subparagraph 804.02.d.vi. of this rule, Wwhen a partially exempt parcel, other than one subject to the speculative value exemption that applies to farmland, within th e RAA becomes fully taxable , the base value of the RAA shall be adjusted upwards by the difference between the val ue that would have been assessed had the parcel been fully taxable in the year t he RAA was established and the taxable value of the parcel included in the base value of the RAA. For example, assume a residential parcel within an RAA had a market value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a homeowner's exemption of fifty thousand d ollars ($50,000), and a taxable value of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in the year the RAA base value was e stablished. After five (5) years, this parcel is no longer used for owner-occupied residential purposes and loses i ts partial exemption. At th at time the parcel has a taxable value of one hundred eighty thousand dollars ($180,000) . The base value within the RAA would be adjusted upwards by fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to one hundred thou sand ($100,000) to reflect the loss of the homeowner's exemption, but not any other value increases. (3-29-12) ( ) iv. Partially exempt properties for which the amount of the part ial exemption changes. For partially exempt properties that do not lose an exemption, but for which the amount of the exemption changes, there shall be no adjustment to the base value, unless the current taxable val ue is less than the most recent base value for the property. For example, assume a home has a market value of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) and a homeowner's exemption of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000 ), leaving a taxable value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), all of which is base value. The fo llowing year the homeowner's exemption limit changes to ninety thousand dollars ($90,000), so the property's taxable value increases to one hundred ten thousand dollars ($110,000). The base value remains at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Alternatively, assume the property in the preceding example increases in market value to two hundr ed twenty thousand dollars ($220,000) and the homeowner's exemption drops to ninety thousand dollars ($90,000 ) because of the change in the maximum amount of this exemption. The base value remains at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Finally, assume the property decreases in value to one hundred eighty-eight thousand dollars ($188,000) at the same time the homeowner's STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 378 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9exemption limit changes to ninety thousand dollars ($90,000). T he property now has a taxable value of ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), requiring an adjustment in the base value to match this amount, since it is lower than the original base value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). (3-29-12) v. Change of exempt status. Except as provided in Subparagraph 804.02.d.vi. of this rule, Wwhen a parcel that is taxable and included in the base value at the ti me the RAA is established subsequently becomes exempt, the base value is reduced by the most current value of the parc el included in the base value. If this parcel subsequently becomes taxable, the base value is to be adjusted upward by the same amount that was originally subtracted. For example, assume a land parcel had a base value of twenty thousa nd dollars ($20,000). One (1) year later the parcel has a value of nineteen thousand dollars ($19,000), so the base value is reduced to nineteen thousand dollars ($19,000). Three (3) years later, an improvement valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) was added. The land at this later date had a value of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). Both land and improvements were purchased by an exempt entity. The base would be reduced by nineteen thou sand dollars ($19,000). Five (5) years later, the land and improvement becomes taxable. The base value is to be adjust ed upwards by nineteen thousand dollars ($19,000). (4-11-15) ( ) vi. Special case for exemption provided in Section 63-602NN, Idaho Code. Upon loss of the exemption, any newly taxable value in excess of the taxable val ue of the property in the year immediately preceding the first year of the exemption is to be added to the increment value provided the property was within an RAA when the exemption was granted and remains within the RAA at the tim e the exemption expires. If the parcel was annexed to an RAA during the period of the exemption, the value that wo uld have been added to the base value at the time of annexation had the property not received the exemption would be added to the base at the time the exemption expires, while any remaining taxable value would be added to the increme nt. If the exemption has been granted in part, the adjustments provided in this subparagraph shall only apply to t he portion of the property granted the exemption. ( ) e. Adjustments to base values when property is removed. Base value s are to be adjusted downward for real, personal, and operating property removed from the RAA . Property shall be considered removed only under the conditions described in the following subsections. (4-5-00) i. For real property, all of the improvement is physically remov ed from the RAA, provided that there is no replacement of said improvement during the year the origi nal improvement was removed. If said improvement is replaced during the year of removal, the reduction in base v alue will be calculated by subtracting the value of the new improvement from the current base value of the original imp rovement, provided that such reduction is not less than zero (0). (4-5-00) ii. For personal property, all of the personal property associat e d w i t h o n e ( 1 ) p a r c e l i s p h y s i c a l l y removed from the RAA or any of the personal property associated with a parcel becomes exempt. In the case of exemption applying to personal property, the downward adjustment will first be applied to the increment value and then, if the remaining taxable value of the parcel is less than the most current base value, to the base value. Assume, for example that a parcel consists entirely of personal propert y with a base value of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and an increment value of ninety thousand dollars ($90,000). Th e next year the property receives a one hundred thousand ($100,000) personal property exemption. The increment value is reduced to zero and the base value is reduced to ten thousand dollars ($10,000). (4-11-15) iii. For operating property, any of the property under a given o wnership is removed from the RAA. (4-5-00) f. Adjustments to base value for annexation. When property is anne xed into an RAA, the base value in the RAA shall be adjusted upwards to reflect the value of th e annexed property as of January 1 of the year in which the annexation takes effect. As an example, assume that parcels with current taxable value of one million dollars ($1,000,000) are annexed into an RAA with an existing base valu e of two million dollars ($2,000,000). The base value of the RAA is adjusted upwards to three million dollars ( $3,000,000). (4-11-15) g. Adjustments to increment values. In addition to the adjustment illustrated in Subparagraph 804.02.e.ii. of this rule, decreases in total parcel value belo w the initial base value decrease the base value for the parcel. This leads to greater increment value if the parcel inc reases in value in future years. For example, if a parcel STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 379 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9with a initial base value of one hundred thousand dollars ($100 ,000) decreases in value to ninety-five thousand dollars ($95,000), but later increases to ninety-eight thousand dollars ($98,000), an increment value of three thousand dollars ($3,000) is generated. If the same parcel increases in value to one hundred two thousand dollars ($102,000) after the decrease to ninety-five thousand dollars ($95,000), t he increment value would be seven thousand dollars ($7,000). (4-11-15) h. Apportioning operating property values. For operating property, the original base value shall be apportioned to the RAA on the same basis as is used to apportio n operating property to taxing districts and units. The operating property base value shall be adjusted as required und er Section 50-2903, Idaho Code. (4-5-00) 03. Levy Computation for Taxing Districts Encompassing RAAs With in Urban Renewal Districts . Beginning in 2008, levies shall be computed in one (1) of two (2) ways as follows: (5-8-09) a. For taxing district or taxing unit funds other than those meeti ng the criteria listed in Subsection 804.05 of this rule, the property tax levy shall be computed by dividing the dollar amount certified for the property tax portion of the budget of the fund by the market value for a ssessment purposes of all taxable property within the taxing district or unit, including the value of each parcel on the current base assessment roll (base value), but excluding the increment value. F or example, if the taxable value of property within a taxing district or unit is one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) but fifteen million doll ars ($15,000,000) of that value is increment value, the levy of the taxing district must be computed by dividing the pr operty tax portion of the district's or unit's budget by eighty-five million dollars ($85,000,000). (5-8-09) b. For taxing district or taxing unit funds meeting the criteria l isted in Subsections 804.05 and 804.07 of this rule, the property tax levy shall be computed by dividi ng the dollar amount certified for the property tax portion of the budget of the fund by the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the taxing district or unit, including the increment value. Given the valu es in the example in Paragraph 804.03.a. of this rule, the levy would be computed by dividing the property tax portion of the fund by one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). (3-28-18) 04. Modification of an Urban Renewal Plan . Except when inapplicable as described in Paragraphs 804.04.a, b, or c, of this rule, when an authorized municipalit y passes an ordinance modifying an urban renewal plan containing a revenue allocation financing provision, for the ta x year immediately following the year in which the modification occurs, the base value of property in the RAA shal l be reset by being adjusted to reflect the current taxable value of the property. All modifications to boundaries of RAAs must comply with the provisions of Rule 225 of these rules. (3-29-17) a. Modification by consolidation of RAAs. If such modification inv olves combination or c o n s o l i d a t i o n o f t w o ( 2 ) o r m o r e R A A s , t h e b a s e v a l u e s h a l l b e determined by adding together independently determined current base values for each of the areas to be comb ined or consolidated. The current taxable value of property in an area not previously included in any RAA shall be added to determine the total current base value for the consolidated RAA. (4-5-00) b. Modification by annexation. (5-8-09) i. If an RAA is modified by annexation, the current taxable valu e of property in the area annexed shall be added to the most current base value determined for th e RAA prior to the annexation. (5-8-09) ii. For levies described in Paragraphs 804.05.b., c., or d. of t his rule approved prior to December 31, 2007, and included within the boundaries of a revenue allocatio n area by a change in the boundaries of either the revenue allocation area or the area subject to the levy by the taxing district or unit fund after December 31, 2007, the property tax levy shall be computed by dividing the dollar amou nt certified for the property tax portion of the budget of the fund by the market value for assessment purposes of all taxable property within the taxing district or unit, including the increment value. The example below shows the valu e to be used for setting levies for various funds within an urban renewal district \"A\" that annexes area \"B\" with in a school district. Area (B) was annexed after December 31, 2007. Therefore, the Area (B) increment was added back to the base for all funds shown except the tort fund. The Area (A) increment value was added back to the base f or the bond and override funds which were certified or passed after December 31, 2007.STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0103-1801 Property Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 380 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9(3-29-17) iii.

(3-29-17) c. Other modifications - attestation requirements. Modification re sulting in adjustment of base value to reflect the current taxable v alue of the property within the RAA shall not be deemed to have occurred when the urban renewal agency attests to having made no modifications to a plan or is not required to attest to plan modifications. Certain urban rene wal agencies are required to a ttest annually to having made or not made plan modifications. These include: (3-29-17) i. Urban renewal agencies that establish new RAAs on or after Ju ly 1, 2016, provided however that such agencies are only required to attest to having made or not made modifications with regard to any new RAA. (3-29-17) ii. Urban renewal agencies that enact new plans including an RAA on or after July 1, 2016. (3-29-17) d. Modifications when there is outstanding indebtedness. When any urban renewal agency attests to having had a plan modification that is not an exception identified in Paragraphs 804.04.a. or b. or c. of this rule or fails to provide the required attestation, the base value will be determined without regard to the modification, provided that the agency certifies to the State Tax Commission by June 30 of the tax year that there is outstanding indebtedness as defined in Section 50-2903A(2), Idaho Code. In this case, the allocation of revenue to the urban renewal agency shall be limited to the amount certified as nece ssary to pay the indebtedness. Any additional revenue shall be distributed to each taxing district or unit in the sam e manner as property taxes. Such revenue shall be treated as property tax revenue for the purpose of the limitations in S ection 63-802, Idaho Code. The county clerk will notify the tax commission of the amount so distributed for each year b eginning July 1 of the prior year and ending June 30 of the current tax year. (3-28-18) e. Failure to submit attestation regarding plan modification. For any urban renewal agency subject to the requirements of Section 50-2903A, Idaho Code, attestation o f plan modification or attestation that there has been no plan modification is required to be made to the State Tax Co mmission by the first Monday of June each year. Except as provided in Paragraph 804.04.d. of this rule, if such agency fails to provide the required attestation, the State Tax Commission will proceed to reset the base value or li mit allocation of property tax to the urban renewal agency as otherwise required in Section 50-2903A, Idaho Code.

If such an agency develops a new plan, on or after July 1, 2016, or provides for a new RAA under an existing plan, the agency shall be subject to the attestation requirements and other provisions of Section 50-290 3A, Idaho Code, with respect to any RAAs formed July 1, 2016 or later. (3-28-18) f. Notice of actions related to base reset or revenue allocation l imitations. (3-29-17) i. The State Tax Commission will notify any urban renewal agency within thirty (30) days of the time the State Tax Commission receive s an attestation that an urban renewal plan has been modified, or by July 30 in any year in which an attestation is required but none is received, of the State Tax Commission's intent to initiate the process to reset the base value i n t h e f o l l o w i n g t a x y e a r . S a i d notice will be provided to affected county commissioners and city officials. (3-29-17) ii. In the case of base reset due to failure to attest to a mod ification or to having made no modification in an urban renewal plan, despite being required to provide thi s attestation, the agency and county and city officials will be so notified and will be given an opportunity to provide the necessary attestation. This further notice will provide that, if the State Tax Commission has not received the attestation by December 31 of the tax year, the base will be reset in the immediate following year. (3-29-17) iii.

This rulemaking action is author ized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and 39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political s ubdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 21, 2018. If no such written request is received, a public hearing pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, will not be held. The public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments on the proposed rule during the meeting of the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board) scheduled for November 14 and 15, 2018. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to make certain revisions i dentified as high priority in the 2017 Triennial Review of Idaho Water Quality St andards and to comply with federal requirements for consideration of EPA recommended (aka \u00a7304(a)) criteria (40 CFR 131.20): (1) Adopt aquatic life criteria for acrolein, carbaryl, and diazinon in accordance with EPA's curre nt \u00a7304(a) recommended criteria, and (2) adopt EPA's current \u00a7304(a) recommended criteria for bacteria and clarify t he definition of recreational use. EPA's Recommended \u00a7304(a) Aquatic life Criteria for Acrolein, Carbaryl, and This rulemaking adds and diazi non in Subsection 210.01. Currently, Idaho does not have aquatic life criteria for acrolein, carbaryl, and diazinon , although EPA has issued new recommended aquatic life criteria for these toxics. Acrolein is an aquatic herbicide and is known to be toxic to aquatic life, particularly amphibians and fish. In 2009, EPA added acrolein to the \u00a7304(a) list of aquatic life criteria. Carbaryl and diazinon are pesticides that are toxic to aquatic life, particularly inverte brates. EPA added diazinon to the \u00a7304(a) list of aquatic life criteria in 2005 and added carbaryl in 2012. In order to avoid EPA promulgating federal standards for acrolein, carbaryl, and diazinon for Idaho, DEQ initiated negotiated rulemaking to revise these aquatic life cr iteria in Idaho's water quality standards. By adopting these criteria, DEQ will comply with federal requirements for c onsideration of EPA recommended criteria (40 CFR 131.20) and ensure that its criteria provide sufficient protect ion of aquatic life uses. EPA's \u00a7304(a) Recommended Criteria for Bacteria This rulemaking adopts EPA's 2012 \u00a7304(a) recommended criteria for bacteria. EPA's 2012 \u00a7304(a) criteria includes both E. coli criteria as well as enterococci criteria; either of which woul d be considered protective of contact recreation. States (and dischargers) can use either criterion t o demonstrate compliance wi th water quality standards. This rulemaking also clarifies the definition of recreational use, recognizing that waters designated for primary contact recreation (PCR) also include recreational activities associated with secondary contact recreation (SCR). Consideration of enterococci criteria as included in EPA's 2012 \u00a7304(a) recommendation is necessary to comply with federal requirements for consideration of EPA recommended criteria (40 CFR 131.20). Enterococci criteria are more directly related to incidences of gastrointestinal illness es than E. coli criteria. In addition, rapid analytical techn iques f or enterococci are currently being developed. By adopting enterococci criteria, Idaho will be in a position to easily integrate any advances to improve sampling logistics (for example, extended holding times and field preservation to allow for monitoring and assessment of more rem ote waters, and rapid notification of affected swimming beaches and recreational facilities). DEQ will also consider the adoption of statistical threshold va lues (STV) as criteria. The STV is a concentration that is not to be exceeded more frequently than 10% of valid sa mples collected in a 30-day period. By adopting EPA's 2012 \u00a7304(a) criteria recommendation, DEQ can m e e t a r e c o m m e n d a t i o n o f t h e 2 0 1 7 Triennial Review and meet federal requirements to consider EPA' s 2012 \u00a7304(a) recommendations while providing the same level of protection for Idaho water bodies.

The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addre ssed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board in November 2018 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2019 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. EFFECTIVE FOR CLEAN WATER ACT PURPOSES: Water quality standards adopted and submitted to EPA since May 30, 2000, are not effective for federal Clean Water Act (CWA) purposes until EPA approves them (see 40 CFR 131.21 ). This is known as the Alaska Rule. This rulemaking will be pr omulgated so that the existing rule, which continues to be effective for CWA purposes, remains in the Idah o Administrative Code until EPA approves the rule revisions. Notations explaining the effectiveness of the rule s ections are also included. Upon EPA approval, the revised rule will become effective for CWA purposes and the pre vious rule and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Administrative Code. Information regarding the status of EPA review will be posted at http:// www.deq.idaho.gov/epa-actions-on-proposed-standards .

SURFACE WATER USE DESIGNATIONS. Waterbodies are designated in Idaho to protect water quality fo r existing or designated uses. The designated use of a waterbody does not imply any rights to access or ability to con duct any activity related to the use designation, nor does it imply that an activity is safe. For example, a designat ion of primary or secondary contact recreation may occur i n a r e a s w h e r e i t i s u n s a f e t o e n t e r t h e w a t e r d u e t o w a t e r f l o ws, depth or other hazardous conditions. Another example is that aquatic life uses may be designated in areas th at are closed to fishing or access is not allowed by property owners. Wherever attainable, the designated beneficial uses for which the surface waters of the state are to be protected include: (3-15-02) 01. Aquatic Life . (7-1-93) a. Cold water (COLD): water quality appropriate for the protection and maintenance of a viable aquatic life community for cold water species. (4-5-00) b. Salmonid spawning (SS): waters which provide or could provide a habitat for active self- propagating populations of salmonid fishes. (3-30-07) c. Seasonal cold water (SC): water quality appropriate for the pro tection and maintenance of a viable aquatic life community of cool and cold water species, where co ld water aquatic life may be absent during, or tolerant of, seasonally warm temperatures. (4-5-00) d. Warm water (WARM): water quality appropriate for the protection and maintenance of a viable aquatic life community for warm water species. (4-5-00) e. Modified (MOD): water quality appropriate for an aquatic life c ommunity that is limited due to one (1) or more conditions set forth in 40 CFR 131.10(g) which preclude attainment of reference streams or conditions. (4-5-00) 02. Recreation . (7-1-93) a. Primary contact recreation (PCR): water quality appropriate for prolonged and intimate contact by humans or for recreational activities when the ingestion of sma ll quantities of water is likely to occur. Such activities include, but are not restricted to, those used for swimming, wa ter skiing, or skin diving. (4-5-00) a. Primary contact recreation (PCR): water quality appropriate for prolonged and intimate contact by humans or for recreational activities when the ingestion of sma ll quantities of water is likely to occur. Such activities include, but are not restricted to, those used for swimming, water skiing, or skin diving. PCR includes all activities associated with secondary contact recreation (SCR). (4-5-00) ( ) b. Secondary contact recreation (SCR ): water quality appropriate for recreational uses on or about the water and which are not included in the primary contact categor y. These activities may include fishing, boating, wading, infrequent swimming, and other activities where ingesti on of raw water is not likely to occur.

Water Supply . (7-1-93) a. Domestic (DWS): water quality appropriate for drinking water su pplies. (4-5-00) b. Agricultural: water quality appropriate for the irrigation of c rops or as drinking water for livestock. This use applies to all surface waters of the state. (4-5-00) c. Industrial: water quality appropriate for industrial water supp lies. This use applies to all surface waters of the state. (4-5-00) 04. Wildlife Habitats . Water quality appropriate for wildlife habitats. This use app lies to all surface waters of the state. (4-5-00) 05. Aesthetics . This use applies to all surface waters of the state. (7-1-93) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 210. NUMERIC CRITERIA FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES FOR WATERS DESIGNATED F O R AQUATIC LIFE, RECREATION, OR DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY USE. 01. Criteria for Toxic Substances . The criteria of Section 210 apply to surface waters of the st ate as provided in Tables 1 and 2. (3-28-18) a. Table 1 contains criteria set for protection of aquatic life. C riteria for metals (arsenic through zinc) are expressed as dissolved fraction unless otherwise noted. For purposes of these criteria, dissolved fraction means that which passes through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. (3-28-18)Note: In 2016, Idaho updated human health criteria for 104 toxic sub stances (10 of which are new). Final rule submitted to EPA on December 13, 2016 (docket 58-0102-1201 ). Until EPA approves the revisions in this rule docket, the human health criteria published in 2005 Idaho Administrative Code in Subsection 210.01 continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes. Th ese criteria are listed in Numeric Criteria for Toxic Substances (2005) . The previous human health criteria based on a fish consumption rate of 6.5 g/ day published in 2005 Idaho Administrative Code in Subsection 210.05.b.i. continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes. Until EPA approves the revisions in this rule docket, the additional fish-plus- water criterion for copper; the revisions in Subsections 070.08, 210.03, 210.04, 210.05.b.ii. and 400.06; and the definition of harmonic mean published in 2015 Idaho Administrative Code continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes.

The decision was made to remove the old tissue-based aquatic life criteria and rely on the fish tissue criterion to provide protection for aquatic life as well as human health. Thus, current Idaho water quality standards do not have mercury water column criteria for the pro tection of aquatic life. While EPA approved Idaho's adoption of the fish tissue criterion in September 2005, it had withheld judgment on Idaho's removal of aquatic life criteria. On December 12, 2008, EPA disapproved Idaho's removal of the old aquatic life criteria. The water column criteria for total recoverable mercury published in 2004 Idaho Administrative Code continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes.

Criterion expressed as total recoverable (unfiltered) concentra tions. e. No aquatic life criterion is adopted for inorganic mercury. How ever, the narrative criteria for toxics in Section 200 of these rules applies. The Department believes application of the human health criterion for methylmercury will be protective of aquatic life in most situations. f. Aquatic life criteria for these metals are a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Subsection 210.03.c.iii. and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02. For comparative purpose s only, the example values displayed in this table are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L and a water effect ratio of one (1.0).g.

EPA guidance allows states to choose from a range of 10-4 to 10-6 for the incremental increase in cancer risk used in human health criteria calculation. Idaho has chosen to base this criterion on carcinogenicity of 10-5 risk. g. PCBs are a class of chemicals which include Aroclors, 1242, 125 4, 1221, 11096 825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs.h. This criterion applies to total PCBs, (e.g. the sum of all cong ener, isomer, or Aroclor analyses).Table 2.

Factors for Calculating Hardness Dependent Metals Criteria . Hardness dependent metals criteria are calculated using values from the following table i n the equations: (5-3-03) a. CMC=WER exp{mA[ln(hardness)]+bA} X Acute Conversion Factor. (5-3-03) b. CCC=WER exp{mc[ln(hardness)]+bc} X Chronic Conversion Factor.i. This fish tissue residue criterion (TRC) for methylmercury is b ased on a human health reference dose (RfD) of 0.0001 mg/kg body weight-day; a relative source contribution (R SC) estimated to be 27% of the RfD; a human body weight (BW) of 70 kg (for adults); and a total fish consumption rate of 0.0175 kg/day for the general population, summed from trophic level (TL) breakdown of TL2 = TL4 = 0.0057 kg fish/day. This is a criterion that is protective of the general population. A site-specific criterion or a criterion for a particular subpopulation may be calculated by using local or re gional data, rather than the above default values, in the formula: TRC = [BW x {RfD - (RSCxRfD)}] / TL. In waters inhabit ed by species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or designated as their critica l habitat, the Department will apply the human health fish tissue residue criterion for methylmercury to the highest trophic level available for sampling and analysis. j.

Applicability . The criteria established in Section 210 are subject to the ge neral rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are the other numeric chemical criteria when applied to the same use classifications. Mixing zones may be applied to toxic substance criteria subject to the limitations set forth in Section 060 and set out below. (3-25-16) a. For all waters for which the Department has determined mixing z ones to be applicable, the toxic substance criteria apply at the boundary of the mixing zone(s) and beyond. Absent an authorized mixing zone, the toxic substance criteria apply throughout the waterbody includi ng at the end of any discharge pipe, canal or other discharge point. (3-25-16) b. Low flow design conditions. Water quality-based effluent limits and mixing zones for toxic substances shall be based on the following low flows in perenni al receiving streams. Numeric chemical criteria may be exceeded in perennial streams outside any applicable mixing zone only when flows are less than these values: (3-25-16) i. Where \"1Q10\" is the lowest one-day flow with an average recur rence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; (5-3-03) ii. Where \"1B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedance of once every three (3) years. It may be determined by EPA's computerized method (DFLOW model); (5-3-03) iii. Where \"7Q10\" is the lowest average seven (7) consecutive da y low flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydro logically; (5-3-03) iv. Where \"4B3\" is biologically based and indicates an allowable exceedance for four (4) consecutive days once every three (3) years . It may be determined by EPA's computerized method (DFLOW model); (5-3-03) v. Where the harmonic mean flow is a long term mean flow value c alculated by dividing the number of daily flows analyzed by the su m of the reciprocals of those daily flows. (5-3-03)Note to table: The term \"exp\" represents the base e exponential function. Footnotes to table: a. Conversion factors (CF) are from \"Stephan, C. E. 1995. Derivati on of conversion factors for the calculation of dissolved freshwater aquatic life criteria for metals. U.S. Env ironmental Protection Agency, Environmental Research Laboratory - Duluth.\" The conversion factors for cadmium and lead are hardness-dependent and can be calculated for any hardness (see limitations in Subsection 210.03.b.i.) us ing the following equations. For comparative purposes, the conversion factors for a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L are shown in the table. The conversion factor shall not exceed one (1). Cadmium Acute: CF=1.136672-[(ln hardness)(0.041838)] NOTE: The cadmium acute criterion equation was derived from dissolved metals toxicity data and thus requires no conversion; this conversion factor may be used to back calculate an equivalent total recoverable concentration.

Application of aquatic life metals criteria. (3-25-16) i. For metals other than cadmium, for purposes of calculating ha rdness dependent aquatic life criteria from the equations in Subsection 210.02, the minimum hardness a llowed for use in those equations shall not be less than twenty-five (25) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the a ctual ambient hardness is less than twenty-five (25) mg/ l as calcium carbonate. For cadmi um, the minimum hardness for u se in those equations shall not be less than ten (10) mg/l, as calcium carbonate. The maximum hardness allowed for us e in those equations shall not be greater than four hundred (400) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, except as specified i n Subsections 210.03.c.ii. and 210.03.c.iii., even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than four hundred (400) mg/l as calcium carbonate. (3-29-10) ii. The hardness values used for calculating aquatic life criter ia for metals at design discharge conditions shall be representative of the ambient hardnesses fo r a receiving water that occur at the design discharge conditions given in Subsection 210.03.b. (5-3-03) iii. Except as otherwise noted, the aquatic life criteria for me tals (arsenic through zinc in Table 1 in Subsection 210.01) are expressed as dissolved metal concentrati ons. Unless otherwise specified by the Department, dissolved concentrations are considered to be concentrations re covered from a sample which has passed through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. For the purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnotes c. and f. in Table 1 in Subsection 210.0 1, the water effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity values measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory diluti on water. The water-effect ratio shall be assigned a value of one (1.0), except where the Department assigns a different v alue that protects the designated uses of the water body from the toxic effects of the pollutant, and is derived from su itable tests on sampled water representative of conditions in the affected water body, consistent with the desi gn discharge conditions established in Subsection 210.03.b. For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term acute toxicity value is the toxicity test results, such as the concentration lethal one-half (1/2) of the test organism s (i.e., LC5O) after ninety-six (96) hours of exposure (e.g., fish toxicity tests) or the effect concentration to one-half of the test organisms, (i.e., EC5O) after forty-eight (48) hours of exposure (e.g., daphnia toxicity tests). For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term chronic value is the result from appropriate hypothesis testing or regression analysis of measurements of growth, reproduction, or survival from life cycle, partia l life cycle, or early life sta ge tests. The determination of acute and chronic values shall be according to current standard protocols (e.g., those publish ed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) or other comparable methods. For calculation of criteri a using site-specific values for both the hardness and the water effect ratio, the hardness used in the equations in S ubsection 210.02 shall be as required in Subsection 210.03.c.ii. Water hardness shall be calculated from the measur ed calcium and magnesium i ons present, and the ratio of calcium to magnesium shall be approximately the same in labo ratory toxicity testing water as in the site water, or be similar to average ratios of laboratory waters used to deriv e the criteria. (3-28-18) iv. Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria. (4-6-05) (1) The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Qua lity Criteria\" describes in detail suggest ed methods for discharge related monitoring requirements , calculation of reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) water quality criteria in determining need for mercury e ffluent limits, and use of fish tissue mercury data in calculating mercury load reductions. This guidance, or its upda tes, will provide assistance to the Department and the public when implementing the methylmercury criterion. The \"Impl ementation Guidan ce for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" also provides basic background information on mercury in the environment, the novelty of a fish tissue criterion for water quality, the connection between huma n health and aquatic life protection, and the relation of environmental programs outside of Clean Water Act programs to r educing mercury contamination of the environment. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" is available at the Department of Environmental Quality, 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Ida ho 83706, and on the DEQ website at http:// www.deq.idaho.gov/media/639808-idaho_mercury_wq_guidance.pdf . (4-6-05) (2) The implementation of a fish tissue criterion in NPDES permi t s a n d T M D L s r e q u i r e s a n o n - traditional approach, as the basic criterion is not a concentra tion in water. In applying the methylmercury fish tissue criterion in the context of NPDES effluent limits and TMDL load reductions, the Department will assume change in fish tissue concentrations of methylmercury are proportional to change in water body loading of total mercury. Reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) the fish tissue criterion for existing NPDES sources will be based on DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-1802 Water Quality Standards Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 448 September 5, 2018 - Vol. 1 8-9measured fish tissue concentrati ons potentially affected by the discharge exceeding a specified threshold value, based on uncertainty due to measurement variability. This threshold v alue is also used for TMDL decisions. Because measured fish tissue concentrations do not reflect the effect o f proposed new or increased discharge of mercury, RPTE in these cases will be based upon an estimated fish tissue methylmercury concentration, using projected changes in waterbody loading of total mercury and a proportiona l response in fish tissue mercury. For the above purposes, mercury will be measured in the skinless filets of sp ort fish using techniques capable of detecting tissue concentrations down to point zero five (0.05) mg/kg. Total merc ury analysis may be used, but will be assumed to be all methylmercury for purposes of implementing the criterion. (4-6-05) v. Copper Criteria for Aquatic Life. (3-28-18) (1) Aquatic life criteria for copper shall be derived using: (3-28-18) (a) Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) software that calculates criteria c o n s i s t e n t w i t h t h e \" Aquatic Life Ambient Freshwater Quality Criteria - Copper\": EPA-822-R-07-001 (February 2007) ; or (3-28-18) (b) An estimate derived from BLM outputs that is based on a scie ntifically sound method and protective of the designated aquatic life use. (3-28-18) (2) To calculate copper criteria using the BLM, the following pa rameters from each site shall be used: temperature, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), calcium, magne sium, sodium, potassium, sulfate, chloride, and alkalinity. The BLM inputs for humic acid (HA) as a proportion of DOC and sulfide shall be based on either m e a s u r e d v a l u e s o r t h e f o l l o w i n g d e f a u l t v a l u e s : 1 0 % H A a s a p r oportion of DOC, 1.00 x 10-8 m g / L s u l f i d e . Measured values shall supersede any estimate or default input. (3-28-18) (3) BLM input measurements shall be planned to capture the most bioavailable conditions for copper. (3-28-18) (4) A criterion derived under Subsection 210.03.c.v.(1)(a) shall supersede any criterion derived under Subsection 210.03.c.v.(1)(b). Acceptable BLM software includes the \"US EPA WQC copper in BLM Version 3.1.2.37 (October 2015) . (3-28-18) (5) Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Copper Criteria for Aq uatic Life. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Copper Cri teria for Aquatic Life: Using the Biotic Ligand Model\" describes in detail methods for implementing the aquatic life criteria for copper using the BLM. This guidance, or its updates, will provide assistance to the Department and the public for determining min imum data requirements for BLM inputs and how to estimate criteria when data are incomplete or unavailable. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Copper Criteria for Aquatic Life: Using the Biotic Ligand Model\" is av ailable at the Department of Environmental Quality, 1410 N.

This rulemaking action is author ized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and 39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political s ubdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 21, 2018. If no such written request is received, a public hearing pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, will not be held. The public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments on the proposed rule during the meeting of the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board) scheduled for November 14 and 15, 2018. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to allow de minimus additio ns of heat when waters exceed applicable temperature criteria due to man-made c auses. Currently, Idaho's point source treatment requirements allow point sources of heat to raise receiving wat er temperatures up to 0.3\u00b0C only when the receiving water is naturally warmer than numeric criteria. There is not a n allowance for any increase, however small, when it cannot be shown receiving water t emperatures are naturally warm er than criteria. Idaho has many very small point sources. All add some heat to t he waters to which they discharge. And, in most cases, the water bodies to which they discharge are warmer than Idaho's numeric temperature criteria set to protect aquatic life for a portion of each year. Heat is a non-conserva tive pollutant, and the sources of heat can be relatively small. This rulemaking proposes allowing NPDES/IPDES regulated human sources of heat loading to cause no more than a de minimus 0.3\u00b0C increase in receiving water temperature s. This would allow a 0.3\u00b0C increase to waters that are exceeding the numeric temperature criteria upstream for the designated aquatic life use even in cases where the exceedance of numeric criteria is not due to natural conditions . Idahoans that recreate in, drink from, or fish Idaho's surface waters, and any who discharge pollutants to those same waters, may be interested in commenting on this proposed r ule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addre ssed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board in November 2018 for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2019 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. EFFECTIVE FOR CLEAN WATER ACT PURPOSES: Water quality standards adopted and submitted to EPA since May 30, 2000, are not effective for federal Clean Water Act (CWA) purposes until EPA approves them (see 40 CFR 131.21 ). This is known as the Alaska Rule. This rulemaking will be pr omulgated so that the existing rule, which continues to be effective for CWA purposes, remains in the Idah o Administrative Code until EPA approves the rule revisions. Notations explaining the effectiveness of the rule s ections are also included. Upon EPA approval, the revised rule will become effective for CWA purposes and the pre vious rule and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Adm i nistrative Code. Information regarding the status of EPA review will be posted at http:// www.deq.idaho.gov/epa-actions-on-proposed-standards .

This rulemaking action is author ized by Chapters 1, 36, 44, 72 and 74, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political s ubdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 19, 2018. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: DEQ initiated this rulemaking to update the Standards and Proc edures for Application of Risk Based Corrective Action at Petroleum Releas e Sites, IDAPA 58.01.24, and the associated guidance manual, Idaho Risk Evaluation Manual for Petroleum Rel eases, to reflect the updated toxicity criteria as established by EPA. The rule was first adopted by the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board) in 2008 and approved by the Idaho Legislature in 2009. In 2012, the rule wa s amended to update toxicity criteria and guidance was developed. Since the 2012 adoption of the rule and guidance , many of the petroleum chemicals of concern listed in the tables in the rule have had updated toxicity information which has resulted in the screening levels found in the tables to be out of date with current toxicity criteria. The proposed rule includes the transfer of Table 2, screening l evel values, and Table 3, toxicity values, to the guidance manual. DEQ is proposing these revisions to avoid the rule becoming out of date and to promote current and consistent corrective action decision-making at petroleum relea se sites. The guidance manual has also been updated with the current industry practice for evaluation of the vapor intrusion pathway. The revised Idaho Risk Evaluation Manual for Petroleum Releases is available at www.deq.idaho.gov . Cities, counties, bankers, lenders, realtors, petroleum markete rs, consultants, and citizens of the state of Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The prop osed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency propo ses to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board in November 2018 for adoption of a temporary/pending rule. If adopted by th e Board, the temporary rule would become effective on January 2, 2019, and the pending rule would become final and effective upon adjournment of the 2019 legislative session if approved by the Legislature.

There is no federal law or regulati on that is comparable to the Standards and Procedures for Application of Risk Based Corrective Action at Petroleum Re lease Sites. Therefore, this rule is not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law or regulations. Section 39-107D, Idaho Code, also applies to a rule which \"prop oses to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government.\" This rule d oes not propose to regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government. However, the proposed rule does make revisions to a process cur rently in the rule that is not specifically delineated or required by the federal government. DEQ previously addressed Sections 39-107D(3) and (4), Idaho Code, when this rule chapter was first promulgated in 2009 under Docket No. 58- 0124-0801.
