The CHNA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specific ally, PL 111- 148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code. The NBIMC Needs Assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing health and quality of life throughout the community. This assessment builds upon the CHNA completed in 2016. The 2016 Implementation Plan results are reviewed in Appendix A. The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels, a community health survey, and focus group s with community stakeholders. NBIMC is a member of RWJ Barnabas Health, which convenes a multi -disciplinary, multi- facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership. Also, in sight and expertise from the Newark Beth Israel Medic al Center CHNA Oversight Committee helps to identify health assets, gaps, disparities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. Service Area The service area is determined by considering three factors: patient origin, market reliance on the hospital (market share) , and geographic continuity and proximity. Zip codes representing approximately 50% of the NBIMC patient origin form the initial primary service area (PSA); any zip code in which the Hospital has a high market share presence is also included. Zip codes with low er market share are deleted from the PSA definition and included in the secondary service area (SSA). Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area and completes the service area determination. NBIMC 's PSA is pre dominantly located in the south eastern portion of Essex County and borders on Hillside in Union County . The SSA is comprised of small sections of Hudson and Union Counties. For purposes of this assessment, Essex County, NBIMC's home county, was selected t o best represent the communities it serves in reviewing secondary data sources presented at the county level. NBIMC Primary Service Area ZIP Code ZIP Name 07102 Newark 07103 Newark 07106 07018 Orange 07205 Hillside ES-2 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Essex County encompasses a land mass of 127 square miles comprised of 22 urban and suburban municipalities. The county's municipalities are diverse, encompassing large inner -city communities, such as Newark, Irvington, East Orange and Orange in the southea st, and the suburban communities of Livingston, Essex Fells and Roseland to the west. E conomic wealth is not uniformly distributed across municipalities ; urban areas include a high number of poor and minority populations. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center ( NBIMC ), located in Newark, New Jersey is one of seven acute care hospitals operating in Essex County. Essex County's economic wealth is not uniformly distributed across municipalities, it includes urban areas with large numbers of poor an d minority populations. NBIMC's PSA is primarily composed of urban communities with low socioeconomic status (SES) and disparities in health status and access to services. These disparities are evidenced by higher utilization of hospital and emergency de partment use for problems that could have been minimized or avoided with preventive and primary care. Essex County has a larger proportion of African -American and Hispanic/Latino residents than New Jersey.2 o Essex County's population is 37.8% African -Ameri can, compared to 12.8% statewide. o Essex County's population is 23.5% Hispanic/Latino, compared to 20.7 % statewide . o Essex County's population is 30.3% White, compared to 54.4% statewide. In 201 6, 17.2% of people and 14. 0% of Essex County families were livin g in poverty compared to 10.9% of people and 8.1% of families statewide. o In 201 6, 23.6 % of people and 22.2 % of families were living in poverty in Newark 071 12. o In 2016, 35.6% of families were living in poverty in the Newark 07114 zip code. This was more than five times the State (8.1%).3 In 2016, 8.0% of Essex County residents were unemployed, higher than the State ( 5.2%). o The unemployment rate in East Orange (11.7%) exceeded the county rate (8.0%) and was more than double the State rate (5.2%). o The unemployment rate in Irvington was 12.8%, higher than the State (5.2%), and the Essex County rate of 8.0%. In 2016, the Essex County median household income was $ 54,860 , more than $18,000 below the state average.4 o The 2016 median household income of Newark 071 12 residents ($3 4,625 ) was less than half the statewide figure ($73,702).5 o Between2014 -2016, income levels across the county and the NBIMC Service Area zip codes showed little change . TOP FOUR HEALTH ISSUES The NBIMC Oversight Committee considered primary and secondary data to determine four top health issues based on capacity, resources, competencies, and needs specific to the populations it serves. These 2 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 3 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/product view.xhtml?pid=ACS_14_5YR_DP03&prodType=table 4 United States Census Bureau 2014 5 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 ES-3 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center issues are within the hospital's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner: obesity, maternal/infant mortality, health care disparities, and violence and safety . 1. Obesity Obesity and overweight are abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk. A crude popula tion measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI), a person's weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of his or her height (in meters). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese; a person with a BMI equal to or more than 25 is overweight . Once considered a problem only in high income countries, overweight and obesity are now increasing in low and middle -income countries, particularly in urban settings. Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including: cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions caus e premature death and disability. Onset of increased risk begins when someone is only slightly overweight, and the risk increases as weight rises. Many conditions cause long - term consequences for individuals and families. In addition, the costs of care are high. Prevention and wellness programs are necessary to address the insidious effects of excess weight. Genetics affect the amount of body fat stored, where fat is distributed, and how efficiently the body converts food into energy. Family eating and phy sical activity habits play a role in the development of obesity. Prolonged inactivity results in calorie imbalance, the intake of calories is higher than the burning of calories. Often, inactivity is a result of other medical problems like arthritis or inj uries. An unhealthy diet, high in calories and lacking in fruits and vegetables, is a significant contributor to weight gain. Research has linked social and economic factors to obesity. Socioeconomic factors include: not having safe areas to exercise, cult ural traditions of eating unhealthy and obese family members. Obesity can occur at any age, even among young children. Hormonal changes and physical inactivity in older individuals also increase risk. The amount of body muscle decreases with age, leading to a decrease in metabolism. Quitting smoking is also associated with weight gain, sometimes resulting in obesity. Structured smoking cessation programs can help mitigate the effects of weight gain associated with quitting. Not getting enough sleep or con versely getting too much sleep can cause changes in the hormones that increase appetite and contribute to weight gain. In 2015, Essex County residents ranked 7.5 out of 10 on an index of factors that contribute to access to healthy foods, lower than state wide (9.2). In 201 6, 41.7% of Newark adults reported no physical exercise within the past month, higher than New Jersey ( 29.8%) and CHR national benchmark.6 In 201 6, 38.7% of Essex County residents were obese, more than 2 7.3% statewide and a n increase from 32.0% in 20 12.7 The 201 6 Essex County age -adjusted mortality rate due to diabetes ( 26.3/100,000) was higher than the s tatewide rate ( 17.6 /100,000).8 6 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2012 7 New Jersey State Health Assessment Data 2012 8 New Jersey Death Certificate Database, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry, New Jersey Department of Health; Population Estimates: New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, State Data Center ES-4 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center o In Newark the AAMR was 34.4/100,000. Diabetes is the third most common inpatient Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition in Essex County.9 Community residents identified obesity as the top health -related concerns in the primary service area. NBIMC offers a variety of health screenings and educational programs to community residents and employees (blood pressure, cardiac risk, foot disorders and comprehensive blood screenings). Health education prese ntations are available to community groups, organizations and clubs through a speaker's bureau. Additional programs are available through collaborative efforts with local health departments and community agencies. NBIMC's Bariatric and Metabolic Institut e provides a comprehensive approach to weight loss and bariatric surgery. In addition to doctors and surgeons, the weight loss team includes nutritionists, exercise physiologists, clinical psychologists, bariatric coordinator and support groups designed to help patients through the weight loss journey. NBIMC provides nutritional counseling by registered dietitians who specialize in weight management, diabetes, cardiac disease, hypertension, kidney disorders, liver disorders, GI disorders, and pregnancy. 2. Maternal/Infant Mortality Maternal and Infant Mortality are leading indicators of the overall health of a nation . In 20 17, the infant death rate in United States was 5.8 per 1,000 far above that of other developed nation. The five leading causes of infant deaths include: con genital malformation and chromosomal abnormalities, low birth weight and pre -term birth, maternal complications during pre gnancy, sudden infant death syndrome and accidents. While some of the difference in infant death rates maybe attribut able to reporting (specifically how live births are counted) major differences occur due to higher poverty rates and other social determinants of hea lth in the U.S . Mortality rates across and within the 50 States differ dramatically as do racial characteristics . While not all causes of infant mortality are preventable, the U. S. as a whole, tends to fa re poorly on many measures of public health and social determinants considered risk factors for infant mortality. Infant mortality rates among Blacks have been , and continue s to be , higher than for non-Hispanic Whites . For example, White babies in New Jersey have moral ity rates of 3 deaths per 1,000 live births. Black infants have a mortality rate more than 3 times as high 9.7% per 1,000. As with infant mortality , maternal mortality varies widely by state , with New Jersey among the top 5 states with the worst maternal mortality rates in the nation. A USA Today published report in 2018 cited a lack of attention to safety recommendation and a fa ilure to protect new mothers. It also found that many caregivers were neglecting to perform basic tasks such as tracking blood or giving blood pressure medication with hours of detecting high blood pressure levels to prevent strokes. While maternal mortality is significantly more common among African American, low income women and in rural areas , pregnancy and childbirth complications kill women of every race and ethnicity, education and income level in every part of the US. The reason for the higher maternal mortality rates are many. New mothers are older, with more complex medical histories. Fifty percent of all U. S. pregnancies are unplanned so many women don't address chronic health issues beforehand. A greater prevalence of C- section s leads to more life -threatening complications. A fragmented heath system make s it more difficult for new mother's especially those without good insurance to access the serv ices they need. Confusion 9 Health Care Decision Analyst Internal Data 2014 ES-5 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center about how to recognize women's symptoms and treat obstetric emergences makes caregivers more pro ne to errors. New Jersey heath care providers are working together to focus attention on the high maternal mortality rates and are w orking with parents, families and policy makers to reduce preventable deaths. A campaign to underscore the importance of healthy pregnancies and implications of evidence -based protocol to ensure positive outcomes for mothers and ba bies is currently in effect in the State. From 2014 -2016 the infant mortality rate In Essex County was 6.3/1,000 compared to 4.4/1,000 for the S tate. Newark had the highest infant mortality rate 9.1 per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality rates among B lacks in Essex County for the years 2013 -2015 was 9.6/1,000 compared to 2.7/1,000 for White infants . Both Essex County and Newark had C- section rates (27.5% and 26.5%) that were higher than the rate statewide. Only 55.4% of women in Newark received prenata l care in the fist trimester and 3.8% of Newark women received no prenatal care more than double the statewide rate. The percentage of low birth weight in B lack infants (13.1%) was higher than Whites (6.4%) and Hispanics (7.8%) in 2016. In 2016, Newark (2. 5%) had the highest rate of very low birth weight infants than the S tate o r county and surrounding areas. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center offers comprehensive care for Moms and infants. Over 1,500 obstetrical patients receive care from full- time attend ings and residents. Located within the Women's Center is a Women, Infant and Children (WIC) program. Other programs and services include labor and delivery services, Level III neonatal nursery , care for high -risk maternity patients, education and parenting support services, and support groups. 3. Health Care Disparities Costs, culture and education cause disparities in the provision and access of health care across racial, ethnic and socioeconomic grou ps.10 The Office of Minority Health's \"National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care\" (CLAS), defines full access as care that \" recognizes and responds to health -related beliefs and cultural values, disease incidence and prevalence, and treatment efficacy.\"11 In order to achieve optimal access, effective patient communication is essential. Language differences, diverse culture s, and low health literacy are barriers to high quality care . Linguistic skill, cultural norms an d health literacy strategies are integral to ensure quality patient care plan s. NBIMC is sensitive to these barriers and strives to ensure patient access to quality care by addressing low health literacy, cultural differences, and limited English proficien cy. By 2050, minority population s are predicted to become the majority population in the United States. People of color make up a disproportionate share of the low -income and uninsured. A ddressing health disparities is amplified by the size of this population and its' growth . New Jersey has a higher percentage of foreign -born residents than nationwide . According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and http://kff.org/disparities -policy/issue -brief/disparities -in-health -and-health -care -five-key-questions -and-answers/ 11 Office Minority Health National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropri ate Services in Health Care http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/assets/pdf/checked/finalreport.pdf ES-6 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (AHRQ), low -income individuals and people of color experience more barriers to care and receive poorer quality care.12 Research has found differing patient experiences and levels of satisfaction by race, gender, education levels, and language. This is especially important, given the growth of diverse populations in Essex County. People of col or frequently report higher prevalence of health conditions, such as diabetes and obesity ; diabetes and obesity are identified as needs and opportunities through the strategic planning SWOT analyses. Approximately 24 million people, 8.5% of the population nationally, have Limited English Proficiency (LEP). Adverse events affect LEP patients more frequently and severely than they affect English speaking patients. LEP patients are more likely to experience medical errors due to communication problems than English speaking patients . Six percent of the United States population is at risk for adverse events and or barriers to care associated with language ability. There is also a greater risk of central line infections, surgical infections, falls, and pressure ulcers due to Limited English Proficiency (LEP) patients' longer hospital stays as compared to English -speaking patients with the same clinical condition. Language barriers and belief systems are two of the items identified as needs and opportunities in th e Public Health Officers survey in Essex County. In 2016, 88.4% of Newark 07112 population was African American, the highest in the NBIMC service area, more than seven times higher than New Jersey (12.1%). In 2016, 32.7% of Newark 07112 population was Hispanic/Latino, more than Essex County (23.5%) and higher than New Jersey (20.7%). Essex County (17.2 %) had a higher percentage of people living in poverty than statewide ( 10.9%) in 2016.13 In 2016, throughout the NBIMC service area the following had more than 30% of families living in poverty14: o Newark (07114): 35.6% o Newark Newark (07103): 34.4%% In 2016, 38.9% of people were living in poverty in Newark 07108, more than thre e times the statewide percentage (10.9%). In 2016, 50.7% of children in Newark 07114 were living in poverty, higher than the Essex County percentage (24.2 %) and more than triple the New Jersey percentage (15. 6%). In 2016, 15.3% of Essex County residents d id not complete high school , 4.2 percentage points higher than New Jersey at 11.1% .15 In 2016, 31.5% of Newark 07114 residents did not complete high school. In 2016, Essex County had a higher percentage (14.5%) of households with limited English proficienc y than the State (12.2%). In 2016, 15.7% of households in Irvington had limited English proficiency, highest in the NBIMC service area and higher than Essex County (14.5%) and New Jersey (12.2%). NBIMC is renowned for its many preventive health programs that promote wellness in the local community. Most recently, NBIMC has enhanced its efforts to impact social determinants of health through its Office of Diversity and Inclusion which oversees the development, promotion, and 12 http://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqrdr10/minority.html 13Ibid. 14Ibid. 15 United States Census Bureau American Community Survey 2014 ES-7 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center implementation of initiatives that lead to equitable outcomes, and develop strong community partnerships with the aim of improving population health, and reducing health care disparities. 4. Violence and Safety The World Health Organization (WHO) defines violence as \"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, development, or deprivation.\" The WHO further categorizes violence into: child abuse, elder abuse, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, youth violence, collective viole nce, and self -directed violence. All violence directly affects the health of their victims. Violence is a leading caus e of death for African -American and Latino males aged 15-24. Indirect effects of violence have been linked to chronic disease (heart disease, asthma, stroke, cancer, and more), mental health problems (PTSD, stress, anxiety, depression, and more), lower qua lity of life, and an increased risk of perpetrating violence. Mental trauma from exposure to violence has scientifically demonstrated an increase in a person's risk of adopting violent behavior themselves, and violent behavior transmit s and spreads based o n exposure similar to an epidemic disease. The WHO identified prevailing cultural norms, poverty, social isolation and such factors as alcohol abuse, substance abuse and access to firearms as risk factors for violence. It is not unusual for individuals at risk of violence to experience more than one type. W omen who are at risk for physical violence are also at risk for sexual violence. Violence at societal, community, relationship, or individual levels can exacerbate and perpetuate violent behaviors at oth er levels. In 2016, the violent crime rate in Essex County was 536 /100,000. This rate was more than double the rate statewide and much higher than the County Health Rankings (CHR) national benchmark (62/100,000). In Essex County, there were 2.62/1,000 dome stic violence reports for 2013, compared to 2.17/1,000 statewide.16 In 2016 , the rate of burglaries in Essex County was 3.28 /1,000, higher than the rates in New Jersey (2.77 /1,000) and Middlesex County ( 2.07 /1,000). In 201 6, the total arrest rate in Es sex County was 34.2/1,000, higher than Middlesex County (24.1/1,000) and Union County (29.1/1,000) . According to a survey of service area residents , improvement is needed to reduce violence in the community including interpersonal violence (domestic/bull ying) . NBIMC provides programs for victims of domestic violence that include medical evaluations, comprehensive health evaluations for children, family life education, and mental health services. It maintains a team of physicians, social workers and psyc hologists who are experienced in treating and counseling victims of domestic abuse. The Medical Center's staff work to ensure the family's safety and security are maintain ed, and each situation is handled with discretion and respect. Please see the 2019 - 2022 Implementation Plan for other planned initiatives. 16 New Jersey S tate Police Uniform Crime Reporting Unit Domestic Violence in New Jersey 2013 http://www.njcedv.org/wp - content/uploads/2015/08/THIRTY -FIRST -ANNUAL- DOMESTIC -VIOLENCE- OFFENSE Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center 1.

The Methodology section details th e data collection process and analysis. Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, located in Newark , New Jersey, is one of seven acute care hospitals operating in Essex County. NBIMC 's primary service area comprises largely urban and suburban communities located in southeastern Essex County. Older urban and suburban Essex County municipalities comprise a large part of NBIMC 's secondary service area. The NBIMC Oversight Committee det ermined four issues to be within the hospital's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner: obesity, maternal/infant mortality, health care disparities, and violence and safety. The secondary public health data reviewed comes from various sources including Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Census Bureau, Healthy People 2020, the County Health Rankings, and hospital discharge data, to name a few. Healthy People 2020 is a 10 -year agen da to improve the nation's health that encompasses the entire continuum of prevention and care. For over three decades , Healthy People has established benchmarks and monitored progress over time to measure the impact of prevention activities. Healthy Peo ple 2020 benchmarks are used throughout the report to assess the health status of residents. 2 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center The County Health Rankings, published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, rank the health of nearly all counties in the United States. The rankings look at a variety of measures that affect health such as high school graduation rates, air pollution levels, income, rates of obesity and smoking, etc. These rankings are also used throughout the report to measure the overall health of Essex County residents. County rates are also compared to statewide rates. The NBIMC needs assessment was developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughout the community. To this end, both i nternal and external data were used to understand recent health indicators and opportunities to provide a positive impact on health and wellness. Other significant needs determined by this CHNA include: Mental Health Substance Abuse Diabetes High Blood Pr essure/Hypertension Cancer Finances/Poverty Transportation Insurance Access to Care 3 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center 2. METHODOLOGY/SERVICE AREA A. METHODOLOGY Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBIMC) developed an evidenced -based process to determine the health needs of Essex County residents. CHNA data sources include both primary and secondary data to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the communities. Data from these sources were reviewed by the local Oversight Committee to identify and prioritize the top issues facing residents in the service area (see Top Health Issues section). The flow chart below identifies the CHNA and implementation planning process employed. Prioritization Process Following the Oversight Committee's review of quantitative and qualitative data on November 18, 2018, a list of 1 2 issues were identified by consultants as common themes of the research. These issues became the suggested priority issues and included: Mental Health Diabetes Obesity High Blood Pressure Cancer Prenatal Care Finances/Poverty 4 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Substance Use/Abuse Transportation Insurance Access to Care Violence and Safety A ballot was developed, and a survey sent to the Oversight Committee to rank each issue based on the followin g criteria. Number of people impacted Risk of mortality and morbidity associated with the problem Impact of the problem on vulnerable populations Meaningful progress can be made within a three -year timeframe Community's capability and competency to impact After ballots were tallied , the following four priority issues were selected based upon rankings and discussion with Hospital leadership . Obesity Maternal/Infant Mortality Health Care Disparities Violence and Safety Primary Data Sources Community Health Needs Surveys In order to obtain a service area- specific analysis for the NBIMC service area, on -line survey Interviews were conducted among 466 residents of the Hospital's PSA. Interviews were conducted online and by telephone. A link to the onl ine survey was displayed on hospital web pages and social media sites. Additionally, postcards were handed out at area businesses and libraries, directing residents to the online survey link. A telephone augment was conducted to capture additional interv iews in specific areas and among specific ethnic groups. For the telephone portion, a representative sample of households was generated from a database of residential telephone numbers. Bruno and Ridgway Research Associates, Inc. administered the on -line and telephone surveys from June 1, 2018 - September 27, 2018 . Survey results are incorporated into this CHNA. (See Section 3) Survey of Oversight Committee A survey was undertaken on November 28, 2018 with members of the Oversight Committee to determin e their perceptions of top health needs and barriers to care. The survey was taken prior to the presentation of County and City Health Indicators and results of the Consumer Survey. The top three health needs determined by the Oversight Committee were mental/behavioral health, obesity and diabetes. The top three barriers were finances, transportation and insurance. 5 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Focus Group Discussions At the direction of the CHNA Oversight Committee, two focus groups were undertaken to uncover additional information from key community groups and individuals with respect to health needs, challenges and barriers, and suggestions for improving access to health care services. The first focus group included local area primary and specialty care physicians in a n effort to garner unique perspective on health needs. The second focus group was conducted with a number of men living or working in the community to capture their unique views . (See Section 4) . Both f ocus group meetings were conducted in February 2019 by New Solutions, Inc. Secondary Data Sources Over 100 secondary data sources are compiled in this CHNA, presenting data by indicator by county and state. Major s ources include: The United States Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). See Appendix B for a detailed list of sources. Appendix C contains a detailed report of cancer incidence and mortality by cancer site for Essex County for the years 2010 -2017. In addition, hospital tumor registry data is utilized to understand stage of cancer at time of diagnosis. Health Profile Section 5 provides a comprehensive presentation of health outcomes as well as the social determinants of health and other health factors that contribute to the health and well- being of Essex County residents. Color Indicator Tables Throughout the Health Profile Section of this CHNA, the color indicator tables compare county level data to Healthy People 2020 targets, County Health Rankings benchmarks, and New Jersey State data. Data by race/ethnicity are compared to data for all races in the county, unles s otherwise indicated. Essex County was the midpoint value compared to a range 20% higher than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020, or County Health Rankings Benchmarks, or 20% lower than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020, or County Health Rankings Benchmarks. If the county value was within the range 20% lower or 20% higher than the comparison indicator, or considered within reasonable range, the indicator will be yellow. The table will be red if the Essex County value is more than 20 % worse or lower than the indicator value. If the Essex County value is 20% better or higher than the indicator value, the table will be green. Comparative counties are also presented providing additional context for select health indicators. Assets and G aps Section 6, Assets and Gaps, summarizes the preceding components of the CHNA. Assets highlight county information indicating improvement over time, in comparison to other counties and the State, or in comparison to other races or genders. Gaps focus on disparities in Essex County or the NBIMC Service Area that have a negative trend, in comparison to other counties in the State or to other races or genders. 6 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Resource Inventory A service area- specific resource inventory is included as Appendix D, which details health and social service resources available to residents in Essex County. Providers' names, addresses, and phone numbers and type of services provided are contained in the inventory. B. SERVICE AREA Newark Beth Israel Medical Center is located in Newark , New Jersey. It is one of seven hospitals serving residents in Essex County. The Medical Center's primary service area (PSA) consists of the following zip codes: NBIMC Service Area Map The service area is determined by taking into consideration three factors: patient origin, market reliance upon the hospital (market share) , and geographic continuity/ proximity. Typically, the combined service area represents 75 -80% of the Medical Center's patients. Zips codes representing approxima tely 50% of the NBIMC patient origin form the initial PSA. Added to this list is any zip code in which the Medical Center has a high market share presence, any zip code with lower market share is deleted from the PSA definition and becomes part of the sec ondary service area (SSA). The next range of zip codes comprise the SSA. Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area completes the service area determination. NBIMC's PSA is predominantly located in the southeastern portion of Essex County and borders on Union County municipalities. The SSA is comprised of small sections of Hudson, Bergen and Passaic counties. For purposes of this assessment, Essex County, NBIMC's home county, was selected to best represent communities it serves in reviewin g secondary data sources presented at the county level. Most of the secondary data in this report is based on county level data. City or zip code level data is provided wherever possible to enhance the understanding of the specific needs of service area residents. Data obtained from the qualitative analyses provide further insight into health issues facing the communities served by the Medical Center.

FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION S During February 2019 , two focus groups were held . On e focus group was with community physicians, employed physicians, and medical residents. A second group was held with men living or working in the community. These two groups were chosen based on discussion among Oversight Committee members regarding groups from whom we wa nted additional insights . A summary of findings from reach group is presented below: A. PHYSICIAN FOCUS GROUP Most Pressing Problems When asked about the most pressing health issues, physician spoke about three main issues; the degree of co -morbidity in the patients they treat, patient follow- up, and mental health issues. To a large extent, the issues of co -morbidity reflect the degree to which patients tend to be seen episodically and not on a regular care basis due to poor access to primary care, health literacy and other social determinants of health. Co-Morbidity \"Our patients have multiple co -morbid conditions which impact their treatment how they tolerate treatment, the selection of treatment and their outcomes.\" \"The average degree of disease progress at the time of first visit is much higher in this community than in others.\" Patient Follow -up \"I see a lot of non -compliance with taking medication or even follow -ups, maybe they don't/can't afford it . . . there is a whole lot of stuff, maybe they don't have insurance . . . So, instead they show -up in the ED. Things like that I see over and over.\" \"Non- compliance is non- patient -centered word . . . patients have lots of reasons for not taking their medication - lack of insurance, transportat ion, the medications make them feel bad . . . we need to address issues from the patient's perspective.\" \"Complex patients, with complex diseases, taking complex medication regimens are three things that don't go well together - plus social determinants of health and poor access to primary care . . . I see that as a big problem here.\" \"Patients should have access to primary care in a way that fits their lifestyle and perhaps 9 -5 may not be the way.\" Other issues discussed that impact patient follow -up incl uded the lack of a system to treat urgent care, and the lack of coordination between getting patients from the ED into primary care. Two of the main system issues mentioned included the lack of hand -offs to transition patient from ED to primary care, and the absence of a process to get patients without insurance plugged into the system easily. \"It seems like if a patient calls here on an evening or weekend, they are told to go to the ED rather than having a primary care attending physician answer the phone and say, 'That sounds like an upper respiratory infection, I can see you tomorrow.'\" \"The system is against us . . . it's not geared toward making a hand- off. So there is no process, so there are roadblocks everywhere; so how do you get a patient who do esn't have insurance plugged 50 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center into our system? We don't have a process for that . . . everyone is overwhelmed with the work at hand.\" \"The system is also not geared to making us successful . . . the system we have is going to give us the results we have. \" Mental Health \"We have a lot of patients that come through the ER and we stabilize the patient and see if they are at risk for harming themselves or someone else, then we refer them to someone else, but then we have those who are not in danger - where d o you send them?\" It's the same thing on the inpatient side. People clearly have some mental health issues whether it's depression or personality disorder but if they're not meeting crisis mode, they say follow -up as an outpatient . . . and, when they can't get an appointment, or by the time they get it, they don't show up . . . There are a lot of recurrent admissions.\" Sufficiency of Health Care Resources Asked about the sufficiency of health care resources in the City, everyone agreed that there was a lack of primary care providers. This shortage seems to be particularly true with regard to the number who will treat Medicaid or Medicaid Managed Care patie nts. Physicians explained that the economics of small medical practices is such that it's not affordable to care for these patients. In addition to the lack of providers, participants addressed other issues as well. \"Even if a care provider exists, do they have hours of operation that are useable and is it easy to get there?\" \"I'm concerned that the practices that do accept Medicaid may have floods of people because there is no place else to go and then the time and attention a patient gets may not match what they need.\" \". . . when not enough time is spent with a patient, the communication breaks down.\" \"I would say as a systems person, we have a crisis of episodic care that the design of the system in the State of New Jersey (in my opinion) seems to be hospital -based, hospital -oriented; the utilization of the ED as primary care seems to be very common; and it's hard for patients to access our system.\" Other concerns mentioned included an underdeveloped ambulatory system of care and a lack of multidisciplinary practices. \"Other academic systems that I've worked in - national systems - what I've seen, but not as much here is multidisciplinary practices; so here we have siloed practices that work in these silos and for these complex diseases increasing the number of physicians doesn't help you; you have to increase the nursing, the nutritionist, the social worker, the mental health provider and the case manager. Those are the models that I've seen succeed.\" \"I'm not just talking about health care but for providing care for families. If I am a woman with a family I don't want 4 practices; I want to go to one place where I can get all of our care.\" Participants believe that more needs to be done with technology to leverage patient contact. Suggestions included using smart phone technology to text message appointment reminders to patients and making greater use of telehealth services. \"Instead of buying a van to bring patients to my office, why can't we just invest in telehealth.\" 51 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Services Most Difficult to Access When asked about what services were particularly hard for patients to access, physicians identified the following: Mental Health Maternal/Infant Health Rheumatology Dental Services \"Dental is a big thing, start ing with pediatrics. The adults don't have coverage which is bad and there are studies that show poor dental health impacts other diseases.\" Perception of Health Care Providers Asked whether or not patients trusted their physicians and believed they were gettin g care that was comparable to that in other areas, physicians indicated they believe that patients were comfortable and satisfied with them, but they were not satisfied with long wait times and short visits due to an overwhelmed system. \"Part of the proble m is the wait time is horrible . . . they don't feel well and there is little you can do when you have someone waiting 4 hours to make them feel it was a good experience, even if you save their life.\" \"I feel they think you're a good doctor, but I don't think they think the experience is very good.\" \"And, a big issue in the hospital is the call bell.\" \"Look, when you are sick you want to be healed and medicine is not the only healer; so nurturing is healing. Going into a room that is noisy, or that's not clean, it's not just the disease process that we are trying to comfort.\" Additionally, many felt the issue of trust went beyond the level of individual providers but was more of a systemic issue related to history, culture and racial issues. \"I don't know how to rate the degree of suspicion of patients. I haven't lived here very long, but Newark certainly has a long history of that.\" \"I don't think that patients become distrustful of the system because of not being satisfied with their care or their provider. It's a bigger conversation, outside the individual providers. There's culture, there's history, there's . . .\" \"I'm not sure. So, when they get down to the individual level, I think there is much more trust; than on the system level.\" Physicians also noted that being allowed visitors 24 hours a day went a long way toward improving patient experience in the hospital and gave family members greater insight as to how patients were cared for. I really think that patients are scared, family members are scared, and when their family stays 24 hours and is allowed to be there . . . they feel respected and their fears and concerns are addressed.\" 52 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Adequacy of Primary Care Delivered Physicians generally felt that the system was overwhelmed by the needs of complex patients with co - morbid medical and behavioral health problems. Additionally, there were few specialists to rely upon and therefore, primary care physicians were oftentimes managing mu ltiple conditions, often within an insufficient amount of time to treat patients. \"We definitely don't do enough to screen patients for cancer - for many reasons - capacity, lack of insurance, patient education. . . . We struggle with colonoscopy, especially if they don't have insurance.\" \"Primary care and specialists need to be able to co -manage patients, not practice in silos.\" \"These patients have a million psychosocial Ha! Ha! . . . it doesn't take 15 minutes. So, how do you work that, you know, you either work later or work over or whatever, or you start to cut somewhere else. I guess it would help if you could get more people, APNs . . . But, it's not possible . . .\" \"I think we do a better job here of chr onic disease management and not episodic care on the primary care side, if they are in the system.\" \"What's happened is that the definition of primary care provider is not just prevention, we're secondary prevention and tertiary care. So, now I'm managing all the preventive aspects of somebody by age and managing their complex diabetes. I may be managing their rheumatoid arthritis because there is no rheumatologist. I'm managing their depression, their heart failure and then Lord forbid they come in with a cold. And that's what they want to talk about. Now their chronic disease management visit that I planned to work on diabetes is totally thrown off because I have 15 minutes.\" Awareness of Good Health Habits Participants generally believe that reside nts are aware of good health habits but don't practice them. In large measure , this seems to be due to a lack of healthy choices in the neighborhood and with the need to balance work and maybe pay against going to the doctor and getting follow -up care or balancing the cost of buying fast food against the time, effort and cost of eating healthy foods. \"Yea, I mean you could just look at this community, where are they going to buy their food . . . there isn't a place where you can go to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.\" \"Although the food here (in the hospital) is cheap, what they sell from the greenhouse . . . but it's in the hospital, it's not out. You have to walk into the hospital and it's only 11 -4, so if you are working, you're out of luck. Additiona lly, providers indicated that health literacy was an issue that needs to be addressed for all patients not just those that might be disadvantaged because when people become ill, they don't hear all they are being told. Suggestions for dealing with this in cluded: \"I would love to see processes whereby patients are discharged and someone reviews the plan with you.\" \"We need cultural competency to talk to our patient s; understand what good health means to them.\" 53 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Other Issues Impacting Health Issues i n The Community There was overall agreement that safety and threats of violence were major health and social issues facing the community. \"I think patients are afraid to go out and walk around.\" \"Crime is also an issue. The crime and perception of crime is an issue about why you don't have enough primary care doctors, because they are concerned about their safety and their staff's safety.\" B. MEN'S HEALTH Most Pressing Health Issues Many of the issues mentioned by participants centered around the subject of diabetes and obesity, and the lack of healthy eating habits. For many , growing up in poverty meant you ate whatever was put in front of you. Those who grew up playing athletics often feel they can still eat anything even though their level of exercise is not the same. According to participants, another dynamic influencing healthy eating is lack of healthy food options, especially in inner cities where fast food and bodegas predominate, and where these choices offered less expensive options. \"McDonald' s has a dollar menu - when salad costs $8 and when you have to provide for your family, you got to cut in certain areas. So being able to buy healthy options is difficult at times.\" \"We have Chicken Shacks and Chinese food and McDonald's or Burger King and that's all we have; then what are we going to do? I mean especially if you have a family - you can feed a family of four for $20 at McDonald's, that's not always the best option. And you do that three, four times a week, couple that with not exercising, it's difficult.\" The subject of many men growing up playing athletics and thinking they were Superman was also discussed. \"We thought we can eat anything, do anything. We got stomachs of steel and we would do that as young athletes, you know because we didn't think any of this stuff would happen to us.\" The impact of education or the lack of education was also mentioned. Men felt that culturally and because of growing up in poverty , none of them had an opportunity to learn about op tions until they were adults or had someone in their lives that influenced them through education. Others felt that often who delivered the message about healthy lifestyles was important. For example, young males hearing a message from a coach or trusted mentor would carry more weight than hearing it from a nurse or other health professional. \"I didn't have a father growing up. So, these are things, these are the conversations I had with my doctor . . . So, going forward it should be someone from the di strict here, particularly from the health office. Someone from the City. I know they have a health department so we can start educating young people on healthy eating options and then someone from the City can say we need to bring in healthier options fo r our young people.\" \". . . in elementary school we thought the gym teacher was The Man because; hey, whatever he said you did . . . So more of us need to get involved . . . As coaches and mentors, they will listen to more of us.\" 54 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center \"That's the culture; that's the problem we had as men . . . something literally had to fall off before you would go to the doctor. And, I'm just as guilty. I am an educated man but I didn't go to the doctor regularly until I met Dr. __________.\" \"So, sometimes it's let sleep ing dogs lie.\" The men also discussed their fears and concerns about seeking care. \"Once the health care system gets ahold of you they don't want to let go . . . they give you medicine for this . . . a specialist for that. Most men are not going to spend the time. After one or two visits; they say I got hypertension, I can't spell hypertension . . . Big Mama had hypertension and home remedies.\" \"They probably couldn't afford or didn't want to hear that there is a problem.\" \"As men we don't like to come to the hospital or doctor . . . when we do come its an emergency. It was not a follow -up appointment. I'm not coming because we diagnose ourselves . . . We go on WebMD and say this is what I'm feeling, and this is what it is. And I've diagnosed myself and then I'll find one of Grandma's remedies and work with it. And I think, last but not least, affordability - this medicine, if they don't give you the coupons and the sample, how are you going to afford it. So, not only are men afraid of being diagnos ed now once you are diagnosed, how can I handle going back and forth to the doctor?\" \"A lot of us are under stress . . . whether you're a pastor, a community person, all of us have a lot of stresses in our lives that we don't know how to deal with because as men we are supposed to be the strong one. So, that's why you see a lot of men die at 44, 39, 56. And they say it was so young. But if you don't have the fortitude or access to affordable care, then that's not a priority until it's an emergency.\" Men mentioned concerns over their sexual health as a reason for delaying or not getting care. \"Some of my brothers in church came down with prostate cancer and the first thing they worried about was their sexual health.\" \"A lot of men won't come to the doctor , especially if they have high blood pressure or heart disease. They could have splitting headaches, but if they got a young girl at home they're not going to mess that up (over fear that medication will impact their sex drive or they won't be able to con tinue taking Viagra).\" The issues faced by young people were important to these men as many were teachers, pastors and fathers, and believe that the problems that young people faced growing up in this area were so traumatic that it was hard for young peop le to see health issues as a priority. Therefore, most of the group felt that strategies to promote good health needed to be targeted to specific age groups and delivered in a patient- centric manner. In their view, young people needed education while adu lts need strategies that dealt with fear and access to care. One of the men suggested that one way to influence men toward living healthier lives was to appeal to men's competitive nature through health challenges in which you set a goal and were accountable for achieving that goal. He related his experience with the \"Beth Challenge\". He also believes that being part of a communal challenge helped him achieve his goal. \"Well, younger guys they don't think of that (getting sick); it's not very im portant to them. And so, when we're rippin and running the last thing you're thinking about is trying to go to the doctor.\" \"And if you don't think you'll live past 21, a doctor is not a priority for you. You think you are going to get shot or stabbed or beaten; you're not going to the doctor.\" 55 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center \"And there's the street pharmacy . . . So, if I feel something coming on and want antibiotics, I know where to go without seeing a doctor . . . so we have to teach young people it's OK to go to the doctor and get p roper check -ups. So, it's education and its fear (depending on the age group). The men also indicated that efforts needed to be geared to systemic changes in education, access to better jobs, access to health care in order for things to change. The kind of change that requires the involvement of government, churches, community -based organizations and counselors to create a safety net. Access to Care Most of the discussion around access to care revolved around long wait times in clinics or the ED, trans portation barriers and school- based clinics that forced families to divulge financial information or residency information that became a barrier to undocumented parents. \"They implemented clinics in the schools . . . they weren't free. You had to divulge information about your financial situation and oftentimes . . . when an undocumented parent didn't want to divulge certain information, they were denied services.\" \"I tried to go to Beth Prime, the wait was too long. I could not go there and gotta wait th ree hours to be seen, when I could get into my car and go somewhere else . . . I got transportation. I can't imagine if somebody didn't really have transportation.\" \"For a lot of our people the emergency room is their primary physician.\" \"Well we know that having physicians in the City is a problem because they aren't opening offices here.\" \"The volume of people who need these services is great.\" Mental Health and Substance Use Mental health and substance abuse were both acknowledged as being serious health issues in the City of Newark and ones which were manifestations of living in poverty, of living in a constant traumatic state, gang violence, and in situations with a broken family structure and a lack of safe havens. \"Our kids are living in a traum atic state. It is not normal to be 16 years old and be shot in the head because you went to a vigil for another 18 year old who died in a car crash. . . . I buried 71 kids (in 23 years of teaching), and that is not normal.\" \"Kids come to school and they have issues and doing their homework or that art test isn't on the agenda right now. What am I eating? Where am I sleeping tonight? I can't go home because of what's going on in my house.\" \"We have a major gang problem. They took off the colors but the problem still exists. I have kids that come to school by Uber because they're coming from basketball or New Community. They can't be seen in certain areas.\" \"Cigarettes we know that's bad for you; everything we eat is bad for you; so everything is a choice, so therefore, we know that drugs and alcohol . . . that's a macho thing, we know coming up in Newark that's part of the process, we just have to get through it; whether it's through sports or whatever. Unless you were just a cornball and nobo dy wanted to be that. If you wanted to be part of things in school, you might have to sometimes try it, and sometimes it takes just one time, so we know drugs and alcohol impairs your mind; it's just that now the percentages in Newark are higher, in certain areas like especially the South Ward.\" \"Kids that smoke weed, or go to school on the jungle juice, they have a moment where they can forget about what's going on at home.\" 56 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center \"I keep saying how complicated the issue is . . . Right . . . because what we are experiencing in terms of the fracturing of the family structure . . . Um, as long as there continues to be a fracture in the family structure, right, there is going to be a lot of anxiety, you know? And, there is going to be a lot of mental health issues , you know.

ESSEX COUNTY /SERVICE AREA HEALTH PROFILE The Essex County Health Profile provides a discussion of health outcomes and factors, including social determinants of health, that are used in determining health status. Essex County data are compared to local, State and national measures. A. ESSEX COUNTY OVERVIEW Essex County is located in the center of the northeast section of New Jersey. The county encompasses a land mass of 127 square miles with 22 urban and suburban municipalities. Essex County's mu nicipalities are diverse and include large inner- city communities, such as Newark, Irvington, East Orange and Orange in the southeast, as well as the suburban communities of Livingston, Essex Fells and Roseland in the west. To the north and west lie suburb an towns with shopping malls, industrial and professional office parks, luxury condominiums and townhouses, and private homes. Newark, the county's largest city, is also home to a cultural center, a sports and entertainment complex, a number of colleges an d universities, and headquarter s a number of corporate giants. Newark is a major national transportation hub. Essex County includes: Belleville, Bloomfield, Caldwell, Cedar Grove, East Orange, Essex Fells, Fairfield, Glen Ridge, Irvington, Livingston, M aplewood, Millburn, North Caldwell, Nutley, Orange, Roseland, South Orange, Verona, West Caldwell, and West Orange. In 1865, Essex County was the first U.S. county to create a county -wide park system, the Essex County Parks Commission ac quired 60 acres of land from the City of Newark as the beginning of Branch Brook Park. Today those 60 acres have grown into 5,745 acres of green space that include reservations, developed parks, golf courses, tennis courts, ice and roller skating complexe s, and a zoo. Essex County is the second most densely populated county in New Jersey and has the third highest number of residents . Between 2010 and 201 8, Essex County's population increased 2.0%. The migration of people in and out of the urban areas of Essex County has changed significantly. After consistent population declines over the last half- century, urban areas in the southern and eastern parts of the county have seen population increases in the past five years. The demographic trends in Essex Coun ty are a part of larger changes throughout the S tate and country . The northeastern part of the state shows the highest growth, with younger couples gravitating toward communities that have walkable downtowns and accessible mass transit to cities . Suburb an and rural parts of the sta te to the west and south are losing residen ts as they retire and leave the sta te in search of lower taxes and living costs. 59 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center B. NBIMC SERVICE AREA OVERVIEW Between 2010 and 2018, the population of the NBIMC Service Area grew 2.12% consistent with Essex County (2.0%) and New Jersey (2.0%).

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Social determinants of health include socioeconomic and environmental factors which influence health outcomes, disparities in health, equity in health care, and are important tools to assess health at the local level. Healthy People 2020 provides a framew ork for assessing social determinants of health across five topic areas: economic stability; education; social and community context; health and health care; and, neighborhood and built environment. While a relatively affluent county, there are residents of Essex County and NBIMC Service Area that face many socioeconomic challenges that may have consequences for health and health care in the region.17 17 https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/topic/social- Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center 1. Socioeconomic Status Socioeconomic status is the aggregate of several social, economic, and demographic measures. In this analysis, these measures include: h ousehold Income and p overty, unemployment, education, ethnic and racial makeup, age, and Divinity Health's Health Need Index by service area. According to Healthy People 2020, socioeconomic factors contribute to disparities in disease incidence and mortality among racial, ethnic and underserved groups. Studies indicate that income and socio economic status (SES) is a better predictor of the likelihood of an individual's or group's access to education, health insurance, and safe and healthy living and working conditions than race or ethnicity. SES also impacts the prevalence of behavioral risk factors (tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol use) and rates of preventive screenings (lower SES, fewer screenings). Income, Poverty, and Unemployment Income influences the way people invest in their health and provides options for healthy lifestyle choices . In low income circumstances, preventive care expenses are more often neglected in favor of immediate living expenses. The longer people live in poverty, the more abject their income disadvantage and the more likely they are to suffer from a range of health problems. Circumstances that lead to poverty also may lead to social exclusion, discrimination, racism, stigmatization, and unemployment. Thus, the following measures of income and poverty may be evidence of these problems. Unemployment puts health at risk, starting when people first feel their jobs are threatened, before they become unemployed. Job insecurity increases mental health issues, p articularly anxiety and depression. Populations with higher unemployment rates have collective increased risk of premature death. Those who are unemployed face greater challenges to health and well- being, including lost income and health insurance. Unemployed individuals are 54% more likely to be in poor or fair health as compared to employed individuals. Accord ing to CHR, racial and ethnic minorities and those with less education, often already at -risk for poor health outcomes, are most likely to be unemployed. Labor statistics indicate unemployment rates peaked at the height of the recession in 2010 and began t o show some improvement beginning in 2014. Most areas of the State have shown continued improvement. Essex County Although Essex County has affluent areas, pockets of poverty in Newark, East Orange and Irvington exist. In 201 6, the median household income in Essex County was $ 54,860, more than $18,000 below the State median of $ 73,702 In 201 6, Essex County had a higher percentage of people living below the federal poverty level than statewide, 17.2% and 10.9% respectively. 18 Between 2014 and 2016, unemployment throughout New Jersey declined. In 201 6, the Essex County unemployment rate was 8.0%, a decrease of 1.1% from 2014, but higher than the New Jersey unemployment rate of 5 .2%.19 18 Ibid. 19 United States Bureau of Labor Statistics Newark, NJ -PA, Division Economic Summary 2016 http://www.bls.gov/regions/new -york -new - jersey/summary/blssummary_newark_div.pdf 62 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center NBIMC Service Area The 2016 median household income of Newark 07114 ($22,196) and Newark 07102 ($23,797) residents was less than the statewide figure ($73,702) , and lower than all the other Service Area zip codes. o In the NBIMC Service A rea, Hillside had the highest median household i ncome in 2016 at $61,95 5.

To ascertain the number of households that may be struggling due to the high cost of living in New Jersey , we turned to the United Way's ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed project) .23 The ALICE project looks at the number of households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level but less than the basic cost of living in Essex County. As shown in the chart below, the Alice Threshold (AT) combined the number of hous eholds in poverty and ALICE households equals the population struggling to afford basic needs. In Essex County, this percentage amounts to 33 % (2016). Households by Income, 2010 to 2016 Essex County Sources: 2016 Point -in-Time Data : American Community Survey.

The United Way's analysis shows ALICE households in Essex County may earn above the Federal poverty level for a single adult, $11,670, or $23,850 for a family of four, but less than the household survival budget for Essex County. 23 http://www.unitedwaynj.org/ourwork/aliceatnj.php 67 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Sources: 2016 Point -in-Time Data : American Community Survey.

There appears to be wide differences among munic ipalities in Essex County in terms of the percentage of households living in poverty or at the ALICE threshold. Nearly 60% of residents in the PSA towns of Irvington and East Orange had incomes at the Federal poverty level or at the ALICE threshold, and 6 4% of Newark residents and 67% of Orange residents, had incomes at the Federal poverty level or the ALICE threshold.

Education People with higher levels of educational attainment tend to have lower morbidity rates from acute and chronic diseases, independent of demographic and labor market factors. Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, yet differences have become more pronounced between those with and without a colle ge education. The mechanisms by which education influences health are complex and likely include interrelationships between demographic and family background indicators, effects of poor health in childhood, greater resources associated with higher levels o f education, a learned appreciation for the importance of good health behaviors, and one's social networks.27 The ability to communicate in English is also a key part of educational competence. The lack of English proficiency can negatively impact one's ab ility to understand and follow medical directions. Essex County residents experienced a decrease in the percentage of the population over age 5 with limited English proficiency. Essex County In 2016, 15.3% of Essex County residents did not graduate from high school , 4.2 percentage points higher than New Jersey at 11.1% .28 This represents an improvement from 16.2% of County residents and 11.6% statewide that did not graduate from high school as reported in the previous CHNA.

Health and Health Care Access to affordable quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. It is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.32 32 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach/health 8.47 2013 2014 2015RATE PER 10,000New Jersey Essex County Middlesex County Union County Indicator Healthy People 2020 Target County Health Rankings Benchmark New Jersey Membership Organizations N.A. National Benchmark: 22.1 Essex County 201 5: 8.2 79 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Health I nsurance The expansion of Medicaid coverage and the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) coverage provisions , which began taking effect in 2010, helped decrease the nation's uninsured rate by 7.2 percentage points, from 16 percent in 2016 . That translates into 20.4 million fewer people who lacked health insurance in 2016 compared to 2010. The uninsured rate is estimated to have increased to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2018, meaning another 4 million lost coverage since 2016 due to chang es in health policy and insurance offerings. The uninsured are less likely to have primary care providers than the insured; they also receive less preventive care, dental care, chronic disease management, and behavioral health counseling. Those without in surance are often diagnosed at later, less treatable disease stages than those with insurance and, overall, have worse health outcomes, lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Neighborhoods with low health insurance rates often have fewer prov iders, hospital beds and emergency resources than areas with higher rates. Even the insured have more difficulty getting care in these areas. Cost can be a barrier to care even for those who have insurance. Lack of insurance creates barriers to timely ac cess to care for patients and financial burdens to the providers who care for them. Since 2013, the non -elderly population without health insurance in Essex County has trended downward, decreasing from 18.5% in 2013 to 13.6% in 2015. From 2013 through 2015, Essex County had consistently higher rates of non -elderly population without health insurance than statewide . In 201 5, Essex County ( 13.6 %) was higher than the ambitious Healthy People 2020 target of no person without health coverage .

Health insurance assists individuals and families to obtain primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. Access to care goes beyond just insura nce, it is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.33 Primary Care Physicians Nationally, many areas lack sufficient providers to meet patient needs; as of June 2014, there are about 7,200 primary care, 5,000 mental health and 5,900 dental federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas in the US. Having a usual primary care provider is associated with a higher likelihood of appropriate care and better outcomes. In 2017, 88% of Americans had a usual source of care, but those with low incomes are less likely to than those with higher incomes, and the uninsured are twice as likely as the insured to lack a usual care source.34,35 Between 2013 and 2015, the ratio of population to physician in Essex County decreased from 1,196:1 to 1,217:1. In 201 5, the Essex County rat io for primary care providers was better than the CHR national benchmark (1,320:1) .

Based on a wide array of demographic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP Code in the United States. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP Code with the least need and a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP Code with the most need. The CNI is useful as part of a larger community health needs assessment to pinpoint specific areas with greater need than others. The CNI score is an average of five barrier scores that measure socio -economic indicators of each community using 2017 source data. The five barriers are: 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or older Percentage of families with children under 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 3. Education Barrier Percentage of population over 25 without a high school diploma 36 Truven Health Analytics, 2017; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2017; Claritas, Community 2017.

Insurance Barrier Percentage of population in the labor force, aged 16 or more, without employment Percentage of population without health insurance 5. Housing Barrier Percentage of households renting their home A comparison of CNI scores and hospital utilization reve als a strong correlation between need and use. Communities with low CNI scores can be expected to have high hospital utilization. There is a causal relationship between CNI scores and preventable hospitalizations and ED visits for manageable conditions. Communities with high CNI scores may have more hospitalization and ED visits that could have been avoided with improved healthy community structures and appropriate outpatient and primary care. Community Needs Index Source: 2017 Dignity Health, Truven Health Analytics, 2016; Insurance Coverage Estimates, 2016; Claritas, 2016; and Community Need Index, 2016. Newark 07102, 07114, and 07108 had the highest CNI scores (5.0) indicating highest need in the service area, followed by Newark 07103 (4.8) and Newark 07106 (4.6). Conversely, Hillside's score (3.8) represented the lowest CNI score in the service area. Timeliness of Service A key indicator of the timeliness of service is emergency department (ED) utilization for conditions that could have been treated in a primary care setting. Reasons for accessing the ED instead of a more appropriate, lower acuity level of care include: No regular source of primary care Lack of health insurance Cost Service Area ZIP CodeZIP Code DescriptionCNIScore CNI Score (Highest Need)Newark Beth Israel07102 Newark 5.0 07114 Newark 5.0 07108 Newark 5.0 07103 Newark 4.8 07106 Newark 4.6 07017 East Orange 4.4 07111 Irvington 4.4 07018 East Orange 4.4 07112Newark4.4 CNI Score (Lowest Need)Newark Beth Israel 07205 Hillside 3.8 83 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Transportation Office hours Citizenship status ED Util ization of Ambulatory Care Conditions Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) are potentially preventable medical conditions that are treated in the ER although more appropriate care should have been provided in a non -emergent outpatient primary care setting.

A main source of lead exposure is found in household dust with lead -based paint. Children are highly vulnerable to exposure to lead because of its adverse effects on the developing brain and nervous system.39 In 2016, 42.2% of Essex County housing units were built befo re 1950, 63.5% higher than New Jersey overall at 25.8%.

Young children can be exposed by swallowing lead dust or soil that gets on their hands or objects they put into their mouths such as toys; swallowing leaded paint chips; breathing leaded du st or lead contaminated air and eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with lead. During the summer of 2019, high levels of lead in Newark drinking water were reported, prompting widespread distribution of bottled water to Newark residents. T hough lead has long been an issue in Newark, the situation escalated after a number of tests indicated water filters were failing to adequately remove the lead. In October, Governor Murphy laid out a plan to make the State's water system lead - free within 10 years. The plan could cost $2 billion over the next 10 years. Soon after, a U.S. House subcommittee announced hearings to examine the issue of lead in New Jersey's drinking water. Very high levels of lead can cause seizures, brain damage, developmental or intellectual disabilities, coma and even death. Exposure to lead, even at low levels, has been associated with decrease hearing, lower intelligence, hyperactivity, attention deficit, and developmental problems.40 County level analysis cann ot reveal individual town disparities in blood lead levels particularly in towns with housing stock built before 1950.

Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists developed clinical guidelines for reducing the occurrence of non - medically indicated cesarean delivery and labor induction prior to 39 weeks. Efforts to reduce such birt hs include initiatives to improve perinatal care quality, and changes in hospital policy to disallow elective delivery prior to 39 weeks and education of the public.44 Essex County's 2016 primary C -section rate (27.5%) was higher than the State rate (25.2%).

Health Behaviors Maternal / Fetal Health Prenatal Care The medical care a woman receives during pregnancy monitors her health and the developing fetus. Low - risk pregnancies should visit a prenatal provider every four or six weeks through 28 weeks, then every two or three weeks from weeks 28 -36, and finally every week in the ninth month until delivery. A high -risk pregnancy requires additional visits.45 Pregnant women who do not receive adequate prenatal care risk undetected complications and an increased possibility of adverse outcomes. Early and regular prenatal care is a strategy to improve health outcomes for mothers and infants. Two significant benefits are improved birth weight and decreased preterm delivery. Infants born to mothers who receive no prenatal care have an infant mortality rate five times higher than mothers who receive appropriate prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. Enrollment in care during the first trimester of pregnancy reflects timely initiation of prenatal care.46 In 2016, only 63.5% of Essex County women entered prenatal care in the first trimester compared to 72.1% in New Jersey. As compared to other New Jersey co unties, Essex County ranks in the lowest quartile. Essex County women enrolled in first trimester prenatal care declined from 80.9% in 2010 , to 63.5% in 2016. In 2016, only 55.4% of Newark women enrolled in prenatal care in the first trimester.

The national teen birth rate has trended downward over the past 20 years. In 1991, the U.S. teen birth rate was 61.8 births /1,000 adolescent females . However, the U.S. teen birth rate remains higher than that of many other developed countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom.47 Pregnant teens are less likely than older women to receive recommended prenatal care and are mor e likely to have pre-term or low birth weight babies. Teen mothers are often at increased risk for STIs and repeat pregnancies, are less likely than their peers to complete high school and more likely to live below the poverty level and rely on public assistance. Risky sexual behaviors can have high economic costs f or communities and individuals.48 The 2010 -2016 Essex County (24.5/1,000) birth rate among teens aged 15 -19 was 60.1%, higher than the State rate (15.3 /1,000) and in the lowest performing quarti le statewide.

Smoking leads to disease and disability, and harms nearly every organ in the body, and causes cancer , heart disease, stroke, diabetes , and lung diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airway obstruction . Exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Each year, smoking kills approximately 480,000 Americans, including 4 1,000 from secondhand smoke. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. About 1 5% of U.S. adults smoke. Each day, nearly 3,200 youth smoke their first cigarette, and 2,100 people transition from occasional to daily smokers. Smokeless tobacco also lead s to various cancer s, gum and teeth problems, and nicotine addiction.

As of 201 6, 41 million Americans struggled with hunger in the U.S. A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life. Obesity among food insecure people, as well as low income individuals, occurs in part , because they are often subject to the same challenges as other Americans (more sedentary lifestyles, increased portion size) and becaus e they face unique challenges in adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors, including limited resources and lack of access to affordable healthy food, cycles of food deprivation and overeating, high levels of stress and anxiety, fewer opportunities for ph ysical activity, greater exposure to marketing of obesity promoting products, and limited access to health care.54 The percent of Essex County residents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) >=30 trended upward from 24.8% in 2011, to 26.8% in 2016.

Tumor registry data from 2016 notes tremendo us opportunities are available to identify lung, oral, colon -rectal and cervical cancers , much earlier via screening tests . A high percentage of these cancers are being detected at late stages (3 or 4). Cancer Screening Breast Cancer (mammography) According to the American Cancer Association, women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x -rays of the breast) if they wish to do so. Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year. Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening. Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer. Women should also know how their breasts normally look and feel and report any breast changes to a health care provider right away. Some women - because of their family history, a genetic tendency, or certain other factors - should be screened with MRIs along with mammograms. The number of women who fall into this category is very small. In 2016, 82.7% of Essex County women over age 40 had a mammography within the past two years, up 31 percentage points since 2012.

Women between the ages of 30 and 65 should have a Pap test plus an HPV test (calle d \"co -testing\") done every 5 years. Women over age 65 who have regular cervical cancer testing in the past 10 years with normal results should not be tested for cervical cancer. Women with a history of a serious cervical pre -cancer should continue to be tested for at least 20 years after that diagnosis, even if testing goes past age 65. Some women - because of their health history (HIV infection, organ transplant, DES exposure, etc.) - may need a different screening schedule for cervical cancer. In 2016 , 76.7 % of Essex County women over age 18 ha d a pap smear within the past three years as compared to 74.5% of New Jersey women 18+. Slightly f ewer Essex County women over age 18 ha d a pap test within 3 years than in Middlesex (77.2 %) and Union (77.4%) Count ies, and the City of Newark (77.8%) . Compared to the S tate overall, Essex County performs in the middle quartile. Between 2014 and 2016, Essex County women who ha d a pap test within the past three years increased over 2 percentage points from 74.4% to 76. 7%. Similar to New Jersey and Essex County, there was an increase in the percent of women reporting receiving a pap test in Newark of 4 percentage points. Data from the 2016 Tumor Registry indicates 45.5% of cervix/uteri cancers were identified at stage 3 or 4. This indicates a tremendous opportunity to support and initiate cervical cancer screenings in the region.

Vaccines introduce the antigens that cause diseases. Immunity , the body's means to preventing disease , recognizes germs and produces antibodies to fight them. Even after many years, the immune system continues to produce antibodies to thwart disease from recurring . Through vaccination we can develop immunity without suffering from disease .56 Childhood Immunizations: DPT, polio, MMR & Hib (aged 19 -35 months) Young children are readily susceptible to disease and the consequences can be serious or life - threatening. Childhood immunizations minimize impact of vaccine preventable diseas es. Combined 4 vaccine series (4:3:1:3) refers to 4 or more doses of DTP/DT, 3 or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, 1 or more doses of MCV and 3 or more doses of Hib .57 Conflicting information in the news and on the internet about children's immunizations may cause vaccine hesitancy among select parents. Health care providers have been encouraged to use interventions to overcome vaccine non -compliance, including parental counseling, increasing access to vaccinations, offering combination vaccines, public education, and reminder recall strategies. Childhood immunization is an evidenced -based strategy, which is known to reduce the incidence, prevalence and mortality of many communicable diseases in many Western Countries including the U.S. In 2016, 96.9% of first grade students in Essex County had received all required immunizations compared to 92.7% statewide. 94.1% of all Essex County students received all required immunizations, comparable to the statewide percentage (94.4%).

Diabetes (5) Diabetes Mellitus (or diabetes) is a chronic life -long condition that affects the body's ability to use the energy found in food. There are three types of diabetes - type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabet es, and gestational diabetes. All types of diabetes have one central commonality. In diabetes , the body does not make enough insulin, or it cannot use the insulin it does produce, or a combination of both. Insulin is essential in taking the glucose the body takes in in the form of sugars and carbohydrates and using it for energy. Since cells cannot take in glucose without insulin , it builds up in the blood. High levels of blood glucose can damage blood vessels in the kidneys, heart, eyes or nervous sys tem. That is why diabetes, especially if left untreated, can cause heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness or damage to nerves in the feet. In 2016, the AAMR due to diabetes in Essex County was higher than the statewide rate, and the rate in the comparison counties. Since 2011, the county -wide AAMR for diabetes has fluctuated with a small overall increase. Between 2014 and 2016, the AAMR for diabetes among Newark residents decreased from 41.6 /100,000 to 38.9/100,000. In 2016, Newark had the highest mortality rate for diabetes of the comparative geographies. 36.630.428.730.927.430.425.226.923.720 53.145.94253.84246.944.142.841.749.2 24.624.126.229.225.62926.120.7N/A21.2 0 10 20 30 40 50 602007200820092010201120122013201420152016 Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic 162 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Deaths Due to Diabetes State & County Comparisons, 2014 -2016 Source: CDC Behavioral Health Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Essex County Source: CDC Behavioral Health Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 19.2 17.7 17.625.2 22.5 26.318.2 15.6 16.519.6 16.5 18.241.6 30.6 38.9 2014 2015 2016NJ Essex County Middlesex County Union County Newark 31.929.625.827.228.725.025.125.222.526.3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 352007200820092010201120122013201420152016 163 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center By race, Blacks had the highest AAMR for diabetes (36.7/100,000) compared to Whites (15.6/100,000), and Hispanics (26.6/100,000).

Premature Deaths An alternate method to reviewing crude or age -adjusted death rates as a measure of premature mortality is assessing Y ears of Potential Life Lost (YPLL). YPLL calculate the number of years of potential life lost for each death occurring before a predetermine d end point, in this case, age 75 per 100,000 population. Premature deaths are reviewed to highlight potentially preventable adverse outcomes. The Essex County YPLL rate decreased from 7,211.44/100,000 for the period 2010- 2012, to 7,102.75/100,000 for t he period from 2014 -2016.

Behavioral Health -Related Death s Mental health is a state of well- being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, cope s with normal life stresses, work s productively, and is able to contribut e to his or her community. Mental illness is a diagnosable mental disorder or condition characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Depression , the most common type of mental illness , is asso ciated with higher rates of chronic disease, increased health care utilization, and impaired functioning. However, r ates of mental illness treatment remain low, and often the treatment received is inadequate. Statewide deaths due to suicide decreased from 2014 (8.8/100,000) to 2016 (7.7/100,000), or 12.5%, while Essex County's suicide rate remained constant at 5.9/100,000 for the same period. Essex County's 2016 suicide rate was lower than the rate statewide and for Middlesex County. The 2016 Essex County suicide rate (5.9/100,000) is 72.9% lower than the Healthy People 2020 target (10.2/100,000) .

Infant Mortality Infant mortality, the death of a baby prior to his or her first birthday, is t raditionally used as an indicator of the health and well- being of a nation. Infant mortality is calculated as the number of infant deaths under age 1 per 1,000 live births. Great disparities exist in infant mortality by age, race, and ethnicity. Most frequent causes are s erious birth defect , preterm birth / low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), m aternal complications of pregnancy , and i njury .64 The overall infant mortality rate declined statewide from the period 2008 -2010 (5.1/1,000) to 2014- 2016 (4.4/1,000). The Essex County infant mortality rate decreased from (7.7/1,000) in 2008 -2010 to (6.3/1,000) in 2014- 2016. Essex County ranks in the middle performing quartile among New Jersey counties for overall infant mortality in 2014 -2016, but is among the worst performing quartiles in ter ms of the County Health Ranking benchmark. Essex County's infant mortality rate ranks in the middle quantile, with regard to the Healthy People 2020 target. Newark's infant mortality rate (9.1/1,000) is more than twice that of the State. The Black infant mortality rate decreased between 2007 -2009 from 12.3/1,000 to 9.3/1,000 in 2013- 2015. Despite this decrease, the Essex County Black infant mortality rate is higher than for Blacks in surrounding counties. 64 http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htm 170 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Infant Mortality Rate: Rate of Infant (Under 1 Year) Deaths/1,000 Live Births State & County Comparisons, 200 8-2016 Essex County Source: NJDOH Center for Health Statistics NJ State Health Assessment Data - 2016 is most recent year available.

Low and Very Low Birth Weight Infants Birth weight is th e most important factor affecting neonatal mortality and a significant determinant of post neonatal mortality . Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 grams) are at an increased risk for health problems ranging from neurodevelopmental disabilities to respiratory disorders.65 Racial disparities in low birth weight babies pe rsist; nationally, non -Hispanic Black infants continue to die at nearly twice the rate of non -Hispanic Whites. Low Birth Weight In 2016, Essex County had a higher percentage of low birth weight babies (9.7%) than Middlesex County (8.0%), Union County (7.6%), and the State (8.1%). The 201 6 percent of Essex County low birth weight babies was higher than the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8% . In 2016, Newark had a higher percentage of low birth weight infants than the County and the State (10.8%). The percentage of Essex County low birthweight babies was higher among Blacks (13.1%) than for Whites (6.4%) and Hispanics (7.8%) in 2016. Very low birth weight babies (less than 1,500 grams ) are at greater risk of adverse outcomes than low birth weight babies. Very Low Birth Weight In 2016, 2.0% of Essex County babies were very low birth weight as compared to 1.4% statewide. The 201 6 percent of very low birth weight babies in Essex County was higher than the rates in Middlesex (1.3%) and Union (1.4%) Counties. In 2016, Newark (2.5%) had the highest rate of very low birth weight infants compared to all geographies.

Health Status and Behavioral Health Status Health status and behavioral health status are broad multidimensional concepts including self- report measures of physical and mental health. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the nation's premier system of health -related telephone surv eys, collects data about U.S. residents regarding health -related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services. I n 1984 , the survey began collecting data in 15 states and is currently conducted in all states includ ing Washington D.C., and three United States territories. The most recent data available are for the year 201 6. General Health Status Between 2012 and 201 6, BRFSS data report ed an increase in the percent of Essex County residents who indicate their health as \"poor or fair,\" from 18.5% to 24.6%. In 2016, 17.5% of New Jersey respondents report that their health is \"fair or poor,\" lower than the rate among Essex, Middlesex and Union County residents. Between 2012 an d 2016, the percent of Newark residents reporting their health to be \"fair or poor\" rose by nearly 10 percentage points. In 2016, nearly 40% of Newark residents reported their health to be \"fair or poor\". As compared to all New Jersey counties, Essex Count y residents with \" fair or poor \" health rank in the middle performing quartile.

It is a condition in which there are not enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body and to all vital organs. The sickled red blood cells are fragile and can rupture easily, hence the amount of healthy red blood cells decrease from a rupture. This is known as hemolysis and results in anemia. Sickle cell predominately affects African -Americans. In 2016, East Orange 07018 (15.41/1,000) had the highest use of hospital services for Sickle Cell Anemia.

The three most common t ypes of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Individuals with diabetes may develop serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation and premature death. Type 1 develops when insulin producing cells located in the pancreas are destroyed. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes. In order t o survive, T ype 1 diabet ics must have insulin delivered by injection or pump. Type 2 primarily onsets with insulin resistance disorder in which cells w ithin the muscles, liver, and fat tissue are unable to properly use insulin. Higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for Type 2. Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance diagnose d during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The risk factors for gestational diabetes are similar to those for t ype 2 diabetes.68 Diabetes is increasing among Essex County residents. Between 2014 (11.3%) and 2016 (13.1%), the rate increased by 1. 8 percentage points.
