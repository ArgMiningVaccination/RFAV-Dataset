This paper explores the potential of one CAM modality, shiatsu , in promoting well-being and critical health literacy. Methods: Data are drawn from a longitudinal, 6 mont hs observational, pragmatic study of the effects and experience of shiatsu within three European countries (Austria, Spain and the UK). Client postal questionnaires includ ed: advice received, changes made 6 months later, clients 'hopes' from having shiatsu and features of the client -practitioner relationship. Result: At baseline, three-quarters of clients (n = 63 3) received advice, on exercise, diet, posture, points to work on at home or other ways of se lf-care. At 6 months foll ow-up, about four-fifths reported making change s to their lifestyle 'a s a result of having shiatsu treatment', including taking more rest and relaxation or exer cise, changing their diet, reducing time at work and other changes such as increased body/mind awareness and levels of confidence and reso lve. Building on the findings, an explanatory model of possible ways that a CAM therapy could contribute to health promotion is presented to guide future research, both within and beyond CAM. Conclusion: Supporting individuals to take control of their self-care re quires advice-giving within a supportive treatment context and practitioner re lationship, with clients who are open to change and committed to maintaining their health. CAM moda lities may have an important role to play in this endeavour. Background There are a variety of ways to achieve health promotion's goal of increasing 'people's control over their health and its determinants' [1,2]. Within a population health approach, interventions would target not just strategies to enable healthier living and treatment of presenting symp- toms, but also factors 'upstream', the primary causes of ill- health, within the wider socio-politico-economic envi-ronment in which people live [3,4]. In contrast, within routine health and medical care, interventions target indi- vidual patients, looking towards optimum strategies to promote and support individuals to modify their behav- iour. Examples include use of motivational interviewing [5], applications of the stages of change model [6] and the notion of 'readiness to change' [7].

While (individual) patient empowerment [11] and self-efficacy [12] may be the ulti-mate goal, discussions focus on adherence to prescribedprogrammes and ways to support persons to manage theirown ill-health. Left implicit, and thus outside the clinicalgaze is the need to move beyond the individual, to con- sider the individual within their family and wider social network and socio-economic circumstances. A central concept within health promotion is health liter- acy. Nutbeam's influential framework [13] differentiatesthree levels: functional health literacy (sufficient basic skills in reading and writing to function effectively); com- municative/interactive health literacy (ability to extractinformation and to apply the information); and criticalhealth literacy (ability to critically analyse informationand to use it to exert greater control over life events). Froma behavioural change perspective, critical health literacy isakin to a person heeding and acting on the advice given (after implicit or explicit reflection) and modifying their behaviour. Health literacy becomes an asset [14] and theintervention aims at enhancing individuals' control. Theclinical or health promotion intention would be to movefrom providing information on, for example, healthy eat-ing or healthier lifestyles (with an outcome focus on adherence with expert prescribed behaviour) to develop- ing personal skills within a supportive (individual, family,community) environment (with an outcome focus onself-care in partnership with health care professionals)and onto individuals (and communities) taking controlfor self-care, with the self as the expert and manager [13,14]. Taking this a stage further, public health literacy embraces critical health literacy needed to make publichealth decisions that benefit the community [15] andeffective actions at a political and social level to preventill-health or support health [13,16]. The potential contribution of complementary and alter- native medicine (CAM) modalities to promote and sup-port critical health literacy has not received substantialattention within either health promotion, CAM or thesociology of CAM literatures. Indeed, Hill [17] com-mented that UK health promotion texts rarely include ref-erence to CAM and contain little in-depth discussion over their potential role in collaborative alliances to promote health. This is despite the increasing consumer user ofCAM [18-20]. Core features of the philosophy and practice-based com- mitments of CAM and reasons for its use suggest a prima facie case for consideration of its role. Firstly, CAM modal- ities centre attention on health and healing. As Fulder [21]valuably enumerates, characteristics of alternative medi-cine include: and self-healing energy(to awaken the immune system/response); working with, and not against, symptoms; seeking out the root of the problem [22]; exploring individualised paths for treat-ment; and, adopting a holistic approach to diagnosis andtreatment. Secondly, characteristics of the practitioner-cli-ent encounter include: a more egalitarian relationshipbetween client and practitioner in order to sustain and strengthen the client's commitment to taking (some) responsibility for health, well-being and self-care [23,24];the practitioner listening [25] and providing a safe, 'pro-tected' space [26]; and, seeing the presenting reasons/symptoms within the person's wider life and lifestyle[18,27]. The practitioner may act as teacher and consult- ant, as well as healer. Thirdly, while some access CAM to help to resolve a long standing condition [28,29], otherstalk explicitly about wanting to be proactive in order toprevent further ill health [30], engaging in active healthmaintenance and avoiding health-risk behaviours[29,31,32]. As Sointu [33] concludes from her analysis ofinterviews with practitioners and users of a variety of CAM practices, people may turn to CAM to 'seek a subjective sense of well-being rather than mere health .... The con-cept of well-being encapsulates a demand for being recog-nised as an active, empowered and knowledgeable agent'(pp. 345-346). Such philosophical commitments find representation within the practice of CAM therapies. Energy medicineworks 'more with what is felt than measured' [34]. Touch-ing clients enables diagnosis, the delivery of the treatmentand feedback as to how the treatment is received; it alsocreates a relationship between the practitioner and client. Classical (TCM) acupuncture's attempts to treat the 'root' (the underlying central disharmony) and 'branch' (thespecific presenting symptoms) of the patient [22,35].Some of the 'active ingredients' in homoeopathy, drawnout from case studies of individual packages of care byThompson and Weiss [36] include the role of patient expectations (the expectation of potential benefit/belief in the treatment), openness to the mind-body connection,the expression of empathy within the consultation andthe co-construction of the homoeopathic care, all apartfrom the remedy itself. More generally, in a study of CAMuse, personality and coping strategies, Jacobson andHonda [37] suggest that 'openness to experience' may be a personality trait of persons who use body-mind, energy and other biologically-based CAM therapies. Finally, inthe context of CAM education provision, Rakel et al [38] revisit the notion of salutogenesis, arguing for the neces-sity of health education to include a core understanding ofhealing and prevention. They illustrate their discussion through a review of evidence of CAM therapies for low- back pain. Areas of influence include mind-body, nutri-tion (sustaining food choices), spirituality (helping theBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2009, 9:19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/19 Page 3 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)patient to connect with things that give their life meaning) and the bio-energetic dimension. Against this background, this paper seeks to explore the role of one CAM modality, shiatsu , to enhance critical health literacy and thus wider population health. Shiatsu , a body-based life-energy therapy, is a holistic health care method developed in Japan and influenced by Western knowledge. It is also inherently a safe modality [39]. Shi- atsu uses Oriental energetic diagnosis and body energy techniques to correct imbalances in the body and focuseson the whole person, mind, body and spirit, as an inter-connected whole, together with the environment in which the person lives [40]. All aspects of the client's life-energy system are addressed in understanding the condition,making an energetic diagnosis and giving a treatment. Ahighly developed sensitivity of touch enables the practi-tioner to feel and interpret the quality and flow of ki, the body's life-force. Treatment thus embraces both the appli-cation of gentle pressure to the energy channels on the body surface and commonly includes advice-giving, cen- tred on raising self-awareness, modes of living and life-style to sustain good health. While there are manydifferent styles of shiatsu , variations in theoretical content [40] and cultural dimensions surrounding its delivery[41], shiatsu training in Europe is grounded most com- monly in the fundamentals of Traditional Chinese Medi- cine (TCM) philosophy and theory and by the approachof Shizuto Masunaga (Zen shiatsu ). Methods The study from which the data are drawn comprised a lon- gitudinal, 6 months observational, pragmatic design of client experiences and effects of shiatsu as delivered and received in normal practice [42]. Following a pre-definedstudy protocol, clients were recruited by accredited andexperienced shiatsu practitioners registered with one of the Shiatsu Society UK(UK). To be eligible for the study, practitioners had to beon the register for at least two years prior to the start date(Autumn 2005) and see an average minimum of 20 cli-ents per month. Common characteristics of the training ofthe accredited practitioners included: part-time study over three years, with 500 to 700 teaching contact hours; simi- lar energetic diagnosis and body energy techniques; super-vised clinical practice; and, exploration of two of the threeor four theoretical models of shiatsu . All clients were 18 years or over and receiving shiatsu for whatever reason. Treatment was individualised for the cli- ent, often including advice-giving on lifestyle and otherfactors as well as direct energy-based bodywork. Data werecollected by subse- quent to the shiatsu session; four to six days after the recruiting shiatsu session; and, 3 and 6 months later. The content of the questionnaires was grounded in an inter-view-based, two country (Germany and the UK) study[32], exploring a range of shiatsu- specific and more gen- eral areas (Appendix 1). To provide data on factors associ- ated with advice-giving, questions included: what clients 'hoped to get from having shiatsu ' (at baseline), features of the client-practitioner relationship and advice-giving 'inthe (recruiting) session', and changes made 'in their life asa result of having these shiatsu treatments' (at 3 and 6 months). If they had made any changes, they were asked to indicate in what area(s), choosing from a list of possi- bilities (for example, diet, exercise, rest and relaxation)and to describe 'any other changes' in the space provided. A postal questionnaire was completed towards the end of the study by the practitioners who took part in the studyto provide insight into how they practised shiatsu . This included a question on whether they commonly gave 'other advice and/or recommendations to the client' andto indicate in which areas, ticking from a list (for example,diet, points/meridians to work on at home, exercises, life-style habits and posture/how to use your body). All data were coded and analysed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows. Data analysis was restricted to clients who com-pleted all four study questionnaires in each of the threecountries. As the study was hypothesis-forming, simpledescriptive statistics are reported here. For the client writ-ten comments, a thematic approach was used, involving close reading and re-reading of the comments, identifying categories/themes to cover these, comparing categoriesand, finally, generating more abstract, theoretical labels[43]. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from theUniversity of Leeds Faculty of Medicine and HealthResearch Ethics Committee. Results Participant Characteristics Over an eleven month period (February-December 2006),948 clients were recruited by 85 practitioners; 633 clientscompleted all four questionnaires, from baseline to six-month follow-up, an overall response rate of 67%. This varied from 49% (Spain, n = 93) to 70% (Austria, n = 261) and 72% (the UK, n = 279). A typical client was a woman(80-84%), aged in her 40s, in paid employment, eitherfull- or part-time, who had used shiatsu before (84-88%) and described her overall health status as being 'good' orbetter. She was continuing to use shiatsu at three months (79-96%) and at six months (76-81%), having an aver- age of 2-3 sessions during each three-month period. Shealso paid for her own treatment. There were some countryvariations. The UK sample was typically older on averageBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2009, 9:19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/19 Page 4 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)(a median age of 50 years) and included a larger propor- tion of persons aged 65 and over (21% vs. 7-10% in Spain and Austria) and/or retired people. Seventy-five practitioners completed the practitioner questionnaire, a response rate of 88%. A typical recruitedpractitioner was female and in her mid-40s, with formal education to at least Baccalaureate or A level standard, and was as likely to be working full- as part-time and involvedin teaching shiatsu or not. She had been giving shiatsu for around nine years. Masunaga/Zen shiatsu on its own or in combination with TCM theory and practice was the mostcommon practice style (84-89%). All the practitioners indicated that they commonly gave advice, where appro- priate, relating to exercise, diet, lifestyle habits and/or pos-ture or how to use one's body. There were a number ofcountry differences. For example, Austrian practitionerson average had been in practice for 7 years compared to12-13 years for the UK practitioners. UK practitionerswere also more likely have a part-time shiatsu practice, to be involved in teaching shiatsu and least likely to be trained or qualified in another CAM therapy (althoughtwo-thirds were). Reasons for Accessing Shiatsu and Hopes from Treatment At baseline, the main reason for accessing shiatsu 'today', mentioned by 48% of respondents, was 'to maintain or improve their health.' When asked what they hoped to getfrom having shiatsu treatment, the second most men- tioned was 'to enhance their health', quality of life or per-sonal growth. The ways that these hopes were expressedwere illustrative of a 'desire to change' (Appendix 2), and in many cases an implicit recognition of their own role in achieving change (for example, ' to get to know myself better ' S95; ' ...a positive attitude ' UK237; ' ... to know my body and its weak areas better so I can work on them ' S110; ' ... to gain insights through connection ' A104; and, ' ... with the exercises recommended ' UK200). Advice-Giving At baseline, around three-quarters of clients indicated that their shiatsu practitioner gave them self-care advice or rec- ommendations (Table 1). This picture was replicated bythe practitioners; at least 80% indicated that they com-monly gave such advice. 'Other' areas of advice included: ways to enable self-care, including stress management, self-massage, meditation, visualisation and use of herbalremedies (24%); emotional advice (21%) (' about my atti- tude in facing life ' S56; ' make think about how I feel about myself ' UK98; ' positive attitude about my body ...mind ' A115); and preventive advice (16%) (' pacing [myself] so as not to overtax my [body's] resources ' UK391; ' to pay attention to when my back is hurting ' S95; or, ' to listen to my own body, to look after myself more ' A258). Practitioners talked in similar terms, such as: ' (to) investigate pastimes that may fulfil (the)client's necessities ' (SP62) or ' meditation, growth work, emphasise their strengths and abilities ' (UKP14). The advice or recommendations were overwhelmingly perceived asrelevant by the clients (99%). Advice-Taking and Lifestyl e and Awareness Changes By six months follow-up, around four-fifths of the clients reported making changes to their lifestyle 'as a result of having shiatsu treatment' (Table 1). Substantial propor- tions had increased the amount of 'rest and relaxation'and 'exercise' they took (43-80%). Working less was alsoevident, interpretable from the verbatim comments interms of 'time at work' or 'time devoted to work outside of work hours'. A third or more indicated making 'other' changes; the most mentioned areas were 'body/mindawareness' and changes in 'levels of confidence andresolve' (Appendix 3). Changes in self-perceptions overlevels of confidence, levels of awareness and wider atti-tudes to health were reported; around two-thirds or more(64-87%) agreed or agreed strongly with statements about, for example, 'greater confidence', being 'more in touch with my emotions', changes in 'understanding andexperience of my body' and 'more able to cope withthings.' (Table 2) Features of the Client-Practitioner Interaction Clients were overwhelmingly positive about their rela-tionship with the practitioner. Around 70% or more ofthe clients 'strongly agreed' that their practitioner 'lis-tened' or 'accepted' them (Table 3). While there wasgreater variation about their joint working, 75-93%expressed agreement that they did (30-46% 'strongly agreed'). The practitioner was also perceived by four-fifths of the clients as being 'trustworthy' and 'skilful' and as'warm' by around two-thirds. Discussion Shiatsu and Advice-Taking Examining these findings from a health literacy perspec-tive suggests a valuable role for shiatsu in promoting healthier behaviours. At a basic, functional level, develop-ing awareness and knowledge arose within advice-giving(diet, exercise, how to use your body and self-care) occur-ring in the baseline treatment session. It raised the possi-bility for the client to utilise this information in their everyday life. Such advice-giving occurred in the context of a client-practitioner consultation which was positivelyperceived by clients as involving 'listening' and 'accepting'the client and treatment by a skilful, warm and trustedpractitioner. The fact that, six months later, around four-fifths of clients reported making substantial changes in their lifestyle 'as a result of having the shiatsu treatments' is indicative of their acting on the knowledge (interactivehealth literacy) and onto critical health literacy. Clientsreported changes in exercise and diet, enhanced confi-BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2009, 9:19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/19 Page 5 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)Table 1: Areas of Advice Received and Given and Their Update Austria Spain UK Advice Received by Clients (1) (% yes) Advice or Recommendation given 76 76 74 Advice given in the following areas: - Exercise 65 48 48 - Diet 49 30 42 - Posture or how to use your body 27 51 29 - Points or meridians to work on at home 29 26 26 - Other 34 20 24 Areas of Advice Gi ven by Practitioners(2) (% yes) Exercise 94 100 96 Diet 87 83 96 Lifestyle habits 84 83 96 Posture or how to use your body 81 78 77 Points or meridians to work on at home 74 72 92 Recommend to consult another practitioner 65 89 85 Other 32 17 35 Client Uptake of Advice(3) Made lifestyle changes 'a s a result of having shiatsu treatment' (% yes) 77 80 80 - Rest and relaxation (% take more) 75 80 54 - Exercise (% take more) 64 53 43 - Diet (% changed) 58 45 56 - Work (% reduce) 32 15 19 - Other (% yes) 33 48 40 Key: These data draw on three sources: (1) baseline client questionnaire; (2) practition er questionnaire; an d (3) six month follow -up client questionnaireBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2009, 9:19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/19 Page 6 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)dence about their health, being 'more able to help myself' and having a changed understanding and experience oftheir body. Overall, the lifestyle changes were suggestiveof a tendency to adopt a more relaxed, healthier and morebalanced approach to life. One of the strengths of the study is its pragmatic nature, studying shiatsu as delivered and received in normal prac- tice. While it is notable that the study findings were con-sistent across countries, there remains a possibility ofinter- and intra-country variation, in particular in relationto the practitioners' style of practice. Despite similar train- ing and use of Zen shiatsu on its own or in combination with TCM theory, practitioners will be at different stagesin their own personal development, both within shiatsu and more broadly, leading to possible variations in howthey practise. This is an important area for further research [44]. It is also important to note that the sample group were relatively socially and economically advantaged. Thelatter issue does not however affect the wider argument ofthe potential contribution of shiatsu to critical health liter- acy. It is instructive to reflect on why shiatsu might result in so large a lifestyle change. At the level of theory, all present-ing reasons, symptoms, responses during and after treat-ment would be understood and evaluated in terms of theperson as an ' energetic ' being. Its holistic philosophy is enacted in the holistic nature of shiatsu practice, treating mind body and spirit as an interconnected whole together with the environment in which they find themselves. Thisconcept of holism pervades the shiatsu encounter; ener- to all aspectsof a person's life. Clients' reasons for using shiatsu (health maintenance and health enhancement) and changes inlifestyle resonate with Antonovsky's concepts of a sense of coherence and generalised resistance resources [3,45]. Cli- ents were seeking support in order to enable better healthand living a good life, along with or as a consequence of,greater mind/body awareness. A different explanation could relate to the nature of the client group per se . The typical user had chosen to access shiatsu , paid for by herself, had used shiatsu before and commonly was looking to maintain or improve her ownhealth.

At the same time, this may be only a part of the rea-son. Indeed, in-depth interviews with acupuncturiststaking part in a pragmatic randomised controlled trial ofacupuncture for low back pain drew attention to the inte-gral role of self-help advice within the delivery of tradi- tional acupuncture [46]. Other possible factors include the features of the client-practitioner interaction and thecontext and practice of care-giving. For example, studieswithin homoeopathy [47] and acupuncture [48,49] pointto the importance of an empathic consultation and rela-tional style of the practitioner, its influence on enabling the client, for example, to understand and cope with their illness, and a potential relationship with changes in per-ceptions of well-being. At a methodological level, however, there is the possibility that the findings are an artefact, brought about by socialdesirability. Clients might have wanted to be supportive to the practitioner and thus were over-optimistic in their judgement of changes 'as a result of shiatsu '. It is however unclear why clients would not be honest, as typical userswere continuing with shiatsu , it providing 'ongoing sup- port' as one part of their approach to well-being and livinghealthily. Indeed, for the one or two clients who indicated that they had experienced 'a potentially adverse event or effect', none ceased using shiatsu [39]. Moreover, the study findings were consistent across the three countries [42].Nevertheless, a social desirability effect remains a possi-bility. A future study might consider incorporating a spe-cific measure to address this possibility [50]. A Possible Explanatory Model for Research To provide further insight into possible ways that a CAMcould contribute to critical health literacy, self-care andpromoting healthier behaviours, an explanatory model ispresented in Figure 1. It is based on the logic of realist evaluation [51], in which causal outcomes (O) are seen as following from mechanisms (M) acting in particular con-texts (C). The intention is to set up a number of plausibleand testable hypotheses for further research both withinand beyond CAM, drawing on the study's findings. Three features of context are identified: client reasons for accessing the CAM, their expressed hopes from the treat- ment sessions and the treatment environment. Firstly, forthis CAM, the main reason underlying why clientsaccessed it was 'maintaining or improving their health'.While the typical shiatsu user was in 'good' (or better) C-M-O Configuration for Cr itical Health Literacy Figure 1 C-M-O Configuration for Critical Health Literacy .Context Mechanism Outcome Reasons for Seeking 'Treatment' Expressed Hopes from Having the 'Treatment' Nature and Style of Treatment Sessions Finding Ways to Remain Healthy Openness to Change Readiness to Change Treatment Environment Reasons for Seeking 'Treatment' Relationship Building Critical Health Literacy Working Together Sense of Control Previously Experienced Treatment Benefits Experienced Symptom Changes / Benefits from the 'Treatment' BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2009, 9:19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/19 Page 8 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)health, this is consistent with seeking help both to 'main- tain health' and for pain or other symptoms. It also implies at least an interest in, if not commitment to, find-ing ways to remain healthy. Potentially implicit arenotions of self-responsibility and an openness to change. Secondly, the ways that the clients expressed their hopes for the treatments were highly suggestive of not just an openness to change [37], but also a readiness to change,for example, in terms of ' getting to know myself better ' or 'to know my body .' As Dalton and Gottlieb [7] observe, readi- ness is linked to learning, and learning to empowerment,trying out new approaches and self-efficacy. In addition, many previous shiatsu users often linked their hopes to previously experienced benefits from earlier shiatsu treat- ments. It was also noticeable that the language used bysome clients, including new shiatsu users, suggested a (growing) awareness of the theoretical underpinnings ofan energy-based therapy, for example, talking in terms of'to clear blockages ' or 'to become grounded '. Thirdly, the treatment environment plays an important contextual role, in terms of its ambience and atmosphereas well as features that may support its perception as a safeand caring environment [52,53]. The majority of the shi- atsu clients strongly agreed that they 'liked' the treatment environment. Data from the practitioner questionnaires detailed how practitioners tried to make this environmenta safe physical space (confidential and quiet) and a pro-tected space (a 'no rush' treatment approach, a space forthe client to talk, 'their space'). Possible mechanisms relate to the client-practitioner rela- tionship and experienced benefit from the treatments;readiness to change is also important here retranslated asacting to change. The significance of the nature and qual-ity of the client-practitioner relationship and relationalstyle is widely reported in the CAM field as a therapeutic factor in achieved outcomes [47,48,54-56]. Initial percep- tions of benefit, for example, in terms of symptom changeand meeting prior expectations, is another possible mech-anism, reflecting classic placebo theory [57,58]. Perceivedbenefits may become translated into ongoing self-care tomaintain achieved (better) health and well-being. At thesame time, experiencing positive symptom changes from treatment may not lead to changes in self-behaviour; the opposite effect could occur, as the 'problem' is seen to beresolved. In summary, the model elucidates a set of factors that may account for, or be predictive of, seeking and taking advice. Engagement with the CAM modality, through an open- ness to change, taking responsibility for one's own healthand enhancing potential control, coheres with the activerealisation of critical health literacy by users. Thus, thereare particular features of CAM (its philosophy and mode of practice), the way it is delivered (features of the client- practitioner encounter and environment of care) andcharacteristics of its users (seeking help, choice in access,openness and readiness to change) that interact to facili-tate advice-taking and critical health literacy. While focushas lain on shiatsu , advice-giving is common within other CAM modalities, for example, acupuncture, ayurverdic medicine, herbal medicine, homoeopathy and traditionalChinese medicine. The model suggests a number of areas for further research, in relation to shiatsu and other CAM modalities. Firstly, the C-M-O configuration requires further exploration, using measuring tools appropriate to each of its compo-nents. Secondly, it would be instructive to gain insightinto how advice is actually delivered, who instigates it,effects on the relationship, especially the power dimen-sion, and any possible variation by practice style. Thirdly,examination of the way that shiatsu and other CAM thera- pies might contribute to the client's sense of coherence and coping strategies, and its inter-linkage with criticalhealth literacy, would be valuable in order to provide fur-ther evidence of the potential of CAM for populationhealth. Fourthly, in this as in many other studies, relianceis placed on client reports. How perceived self-efficacy is in fact translated into lifestyle changes and/or whether or not individuals do in fact do what they say they do con-tinue to be important areas to explore. Conclusion This article has examined the role of CAM to enhance crit- ical health literacy and health promotion, through a case study of shiatsu . The explanatory model arising has poten- tial to aid understand of how critical health literacy maybe enhanced both within and beyond CAM. The findingsreinforce other research on the importance of an opennessor readiness to change, advice-giving as part of an integral feature of some CAM practices and the continuing need for other initiatives around 'raising awareness' abouthealthy living, whilst exploring 'upstream' at an individ-ual level, to their root and branch and wider socio-eco-nomic environment. At the least, the findings are stronglysuggestive of a potentially powerful contribution of shi- atsu to population health, particularly when used as part of ongoing support to maintain health, pursued on the initiative of users, albeit those who may be socially or eco-nomically advantaged. Key Points \u0081 The potential contribution that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) can make to promoting good health and developing critical health literacy ispoorly understoodBMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2009, 9:19 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/9/19 Page 9 of 11 (page number not for citation purposes)\u0081 Core philosophical and practice-based commit- ments of CAM modalities and reasons for its use sug- gest a prima facie case for consideration of their role \u0081 Evidence from a large longitudinal, observational and practice study of one CAM, shiatsu , demonstrated both high rates of advice-giving and uptake six months later \u0081 An explanatory model is developed to provide insight into why a CAM therapy could contribute tohealth promotion and enhanced health literacy and toguide future research both within and beyond CAM Competing interests The author declares that they have no competing interests.
