For more information, please contact Madeline Brezin , Policy Analyst, AVMA Division of State Advocacy (mbrezin@avma.org ). Abuse reporting Legislation in Connecticut (CT S.B. 53 and CT H.B. 5851 ) would address animal abuse reporting by veterinarians and provide levels of immunity. Championed by the Iowa Veterinary Medical Association , Iowa IA S.S.B. 1038 would provide administrative, civil, and criminal immunity to a vete rinarian who, in good faith, cooperates with a peace officer to rescue a threatened animal, providing truthful evidence, participates in a dispositional proceeding, or complies with a court order. In addition to reporting suspected or known abuse of compan ion animals, Missouri MO H.B. 300 would require veterinarians, animal control officers, and animal humane investigators to be mandated reporters in cases of abuse and neglect of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable persons. Courtroom advocates The AVMA opposes bills that would allow a court to appoint an advocate to act in the interests of the animal. This standard \u2014in the interests of the animal \u2014is very different than the standard of in the interests of justice . In the interest of justice includes a variety of societal interests regarding the humane treatment of animals, notions of fairness, and the interest of the owner, while in the interest of the animal has often been seen and used as an attempt to require courts to apply the same types of standards as they would for a child. Of concern are bills in New York (NY S. 1659 /NY A. 111 ) which would establish court appointed advocates for animals to act in the interests of the animal . On the other hand, legislation in Illinois (IL H.B. 1169 ) would permit a court to appoi nt a licensed attorney or a law student authorized to provide services as a special advocate to assist the court and represent the interests of justice regarding the health or safety of the cat or dog. Cannabis Nebraska (NE L.B. 22 ) would decriminalize the use and possession of marijuana, including for the administration to an animal. New York (NY A. 2628 ) would provide access to medical marihuana for an animal when a veterinarian determines the animal has any medical condition that may benefit from treatment with medical marihuana. AVMA resources and more information on the use of cannabis in pets can be found here . Education and loan repayment programs Colorado CO S .B. 23-044 would update the veterinary education loan repayment program by increasing the qualified applicants per year from four to six; eliminating the requirement that an applicant must have graduated from an accredited veterinary school in 2017 or later; and increasing the total amount an applicant is eligible for over a four -year period from $70,000 to $90,000. Bills strongly supported by the Missouri Veterinary Medical Association in Missouri (MO S.B. 529 / MO H.B. 403 ) would permit loan repayment for more than twelve veterinarians each year, instead of six; expand the sources of funding for the Large Animal Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program; and, permit recipients to receive up to $30,000 for each academic year, instead of $20,000. New York NY S.425 would establish the Veterinarians Across Rural New York State Student Loan Repayme nt Fund for eligible veterinarians that make a two -year commitment to practice in a tract or county defined by the health resources and 2 | P a g e State Legislative Update - January 2023 services administration as being \"rural\" or eligible for a rural health grant. Legislation in Utah (UT H.B. 184) would establish the Veterinarian Education Loan Repayment Program with a one -time appropriation of $5,000,000. Related to colleges of veterinary medicine, Conne cticut CT H.B. 5744 would require the Board of Regents for Higher Education to establish a school of veterinary medicine. Legislation in Missouri (MO S.B. 473 ) would repeal provisions stating that the University of Missouri could be the state's only public research university and the exclusive grantor of research doctorates and first -professional degrees, including veterinary medicine. Pet insurance Mississippi (MS S.B. 2228 /MS H.B. 1191 ), Nebr aska (NE L.B. 296), New York (NY A. 258) and Washington (WA S.B. 5319 /WA H.B. 1208 ) legislatures are all considering legislation related to establishing a framework to provide pet insurance. The AVMA endorses the conc ept of pet health insurance that provides coverage to help defray the cost of veterinary medical care and encourages veterinary healthcare teams to proactively educate their clients about the existence of such resources. The AVMA also recognizes that viabl e pet health insurance programs may be an important approach for the veterinary profession to continue to provide high quality veterinary services. More information on AVMA's policy on pet insurance can be found on the AVMA website . Pharmaceuticals Connecticut CT H .B. 6380 would require the Board of Veterinary Medicine to adopt regulations to limit, monitor, and track the dispensing and administration of opioid drugs by veterinarians for pets. Opposed by the Oregon Veterinary Medic al Association, legislation in Oregon (OR S.B. 559 ) would require veterinarians to participate in the Prescription Drug Monitoring Progra m and add a practicing veterinarian to the Prescription Monitoring Program Advisory Commission. Supported by the New York State Veterinary Medical Society , New York (NY S. 2314 ) would permit the compounding, dispensing and sale of pharmaceuticals to veterinarians. Related to animal drug compounding, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially planned to begin enforcement of the final guidance on animal drug compounding (GFI # 256) on October 1, 2022, but subsequently announced that they would not begin routine pharmacy inspections until April 2023. The final FDA guidance reflects changes made in response to advocacy effo rts by the AVMA , which included engagement and education with the FDA CVM, members of Congress, and other stakeholders on the importance of veterinarians having access to vital medications in a timely manner. The AVMA su bmitted nominations for bulk drug substances to the FDA on the basis of input from AVMA members and AVMA - allied organizations and continues to gather information and make nominations on an ongoing basis. More information on AVMA's policies and resources ca n be found here . Scope of practice Introduced by the Missouri Veterinary Medical Association , a bill MO S.B. 115 /MO H.B. 801 was reintroduced that would prevent political subdivisions from enacting, maintaining, or enforcing any order, ordinance, rule, regulation, policy, or similar measure that prohibits, restricts, limits, regulates, controls, directs, or inter feres with the practice of veterinary medicine. Texas Veterinary Medical Association is advocating for a similar bill in Texas (TX H.B. 1348 ) which would prohibit a municipality from regulating the practice of veterinary medicine or prohibiting a veterinarian from performing a procedure on an animal. Legislation in Arizona (AZ H.B. 2335 ), Illinois ), and 1382 ) would all prohibit the declawing of cats unless for therapeutic purposes. Arizona's bill 3 | P a g e State Legislative Update - January 2023 would further require a licensed veterinarian to request a hearing with the veterinary board and gain its written approval to perform the declaw of a cat. Provisions in Illinois IL H.B. 1533 would further prohibit a person from otherwise altering a cat's toes, claws, or paws to prevent or impair the normal function of the cat's toes, claws, or paws. There is no exclusion provided for procedures like nail filing, nail trimming, or the placement of temporary nail caps as is included in Massachusetts MA S.D. 2140 . Opposed by the Massachusetts Veterinary Me dical Association , Massachusetts MA H.D. 2871 would establish the licensure of equine dentists and define an \"Equine Dental Practitioner\" as a veterinarian or someone who is certified by the International Association of equine dentistry. Related, Massachusetts MA H.D. 2870 would remove \"floating of teeth or removal of deciduous caps or erupted, non -displaced wolf teeth in horses by a licensed equine dental practitioner\" from t he definition of \"practicing veterinary medicine.\" Legislation in Missouri (MO S.B. 471 /MO H.B. 88 ) opposed by the Missouri Veterinary Medical Association would define an animal chiropractic practitioner as someone who is a licensed veterinarian or licensed by the Board of Chiropractic Examiners and who is certified by a veterinary chiropr actic organization. New Hampshire NH H.B. 258 would establish a certification for animal chiropractors , require an animal chiropractor to receive a referral from a licensed veterinarian in order to treat an animal , and permit the Board of Veterinarians to establish further requirements for certification and continuin g education. Taxes A number of state legislatures are considering veterinary tax -related provisions. Massachusetts MA H.D. 3318 would exempt animal medications prescribed by veterinarians from the sales tax. Bills in New York would provide a tax credit for spay and neuter services (NY S. 107/NY A. 85); would establish a tax credit for the cost of veterinary services of up to $2,000 per year (NY S. 295/NY A. 387); and exempt services provided to board an animal when rendered by a licensed and registered veterinarian or by a commercial horse boarding operation from sales and use taxes (NY S. 1414 /NY A. 1547 ). North Dakota ND H.B. 1455 would exempt materials used in the research and development of bioscience and biotechnology, including veterinary medicine, from the sales and use tax. Legislation in Virginia (VA S.B. 985/VA H.B. 1563 ) would exempt medicines and drugs sold to a veterinarian i f used or consumed directly in the care, medication, and treatment of agricultural production animals or for the resale to a farmer for the direct use in producing an agricultural product for market, and others, from the sales and use tax. Vaccination Arizona (AZ S.B. 1194 ) would permit a licensed veterinarian to appoint a non -veterinarian as a certified rabies vaccinator to participate in county rabies control programs so long as the person is trained by an in-person training offered by the state veterinarian. Opposed by the Virginia Veterinary Medical Association , Virginia VA H. B. 1074 would provide an exemption to rabies vaccination requirements if a licensed veterinarian has examined an animal, certifies in writing that at the time of the examination, vaccination would endanger an animal's he alth because of its age, infirmity, disability, illness, or other medical consideration, and a titer test has indicated sufficient immunity to rabies. Certification that the animal is exempt from vaccination pursuant to this subdivision would be valid for one year and mean that the animal is considered vaccinated for rabies. The AVMA opposes legislation that would allow results from an antibody titer test to be used in lieu of vaccination. 4 | P a g e State Legislative Update - January 2023 Also opposed by the Virginia Veterinary Medical Association , legisl ation (VA H.B. 1468 ) would prevent any licensed veterinarian, licensed veterinary technicians, or other employee under the direction of such veterinarians from sharing a fee or imposing costs for a rabies vaccination to exceed $20.00 or require additional services alongside such vaccination.

North D akota ND S.B. 2384 would prohibit the use of mRNA vaccines in the state for humans or other mammals. South Carolina SC H.B. 3798 would require the labeling of food or food products that contain mRNA. Tennessee legislature is considering multiple bills (TN S.B. 369 /TN H.B. 842 and TN S.B. 0099 ) that would affect labeling of meat if the animal from which the meat was derived received an mRNA vaccine. Veterinarian -client -patient relationship and telemedicine Strongly o pposed by the Arizona Veterinary Medical Association and the AVMA , Arizona AZ S.B. 1053 would permit the establishment of a veterinarian -client -patient relationship via electronic means including via audio -only telephone or a video -based communication. Arkansas AR S.B. 5 would require the Veterinary Medical Examining Board to promulgate rules outlining the use of telehealth and t elemedicine to mirror the Telemedicine Act (\u00a7 17-80-29 401 et seq. ), including the establishment of a VCPR relationship by telemedicine. The Arkansas Veterinary Medical Association, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners and the AVMA testified in opposition to the bill. Tennessee TN S.B. 1149 /TN H.B. 1132 would require a licensed veterinarian who engages in the practice of veterinary medi cine for a livestock producer to conduct an initial physical meeting with the client and patient and allow a VCPR to be maintained by electronic or telephonic means during a twenty -four - month period before an additional physical exam or premise visit is re quired. The bill would also allow a licensed veterinarian to conduct an initial evaluation of a patient through electronic or telephonic means in remote regions of the state where there is no locally available veterinarian if travel for a physical exam or premise visit is impossible, the veterinarian requests an in -person examination at the earliest date, and the veterinarian provides the client with their identity, location, licensure status, and any privacy or security issues involved in accessing veterin ary service through electronic means. Veterinary technicians Arkansas AR H.B. 1182 would create a \"collaborative practice agreement\" between a veterinarian and a veterinary technician spe cialist (VTS). Within this agreement, a VTS would be granted prescriptive authority and the ability to establish a preliminary VCPR on behalf of the veterinarian and order diagnostics, provide a diagnosis or a prognosis, and develop a treatment plan with t he veterinarian. The veterinarian would be required to \"complete\" the VCPR by seeing the patient within 15 days of the VTS establishing the preliminary VCPR.
