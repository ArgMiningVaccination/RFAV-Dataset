A [study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2215201?query=featured_home) using nationwide electronic health record data published today in the New England Journal of Medicine found a two-dose series of the vaccine was 66% effective at preventing medically attended mpox disease among adults, while two smaller studies found two doses were [86%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a3.htm?s_cid=mm7220a3_w) and [88%](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a4.htm?s_cid=mm7220a4_w) effective, respectively. The CDC continues to investigate an mpox outbreak in the Chicago area, where most of the 21 men infected to date had received at least one dose of vaccine. All of the patients had mild symptoms, officials said. For more information and the latest recommendations for clinicians, see "}
