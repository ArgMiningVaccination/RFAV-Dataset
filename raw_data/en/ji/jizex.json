Sun WEidong China's Ambassador to india It's a moment of great pride to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The year 2021 is a very special one for the Chinese people. It marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). On July 1, President Xi Jinping solemnly declared that we have realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We have brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty in China. We are now marching in confident strides toward the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects. The \"Chinese Dream\" aims to make our country prosperous and strong, revitalize the nation and make the people live better lives. The \"Chinese Dream\" is the dream of all the Chinese people, and also a dream of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit for all. We advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity. We promote the building of a new type of international relations and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. China hopes to grow into a better country in the process of realizing the Chinese dream. We believe that the world will be a better place with China's development. President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Development Initiative, called on the international community to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for more robust, greener and more balanced global development. China has actively promoted global solidarity in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, announced that it would provide 2 billion doses of vaccines to the world in the course of this year, and has so far provided over 1.7 billion doses, including donations to more than 110 countries. When India was hit by the second wave of COVID-19, China immediately offered our support and provided large amount of medical supplies to India. China and India are the two largest developing countries and emerging economies in the world. We are highly complementary and can benefit from mutual cooperation. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our economic and trade cooperation has bucked the trend, the bilateral trade exceed $100 billion in the first 10 months this year. Also, cooperation between the two countries in multilateral organizations such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization(SCO) as well as on field of climate change is growing, which will further safeguard common interests of developing countries, help to maintain regional peace and stability, contribute to global economic recovery and sustainable development. We should view the bilateral ties from a historical and strategic perspective, and uphold the strategic consensus that China and India are opportunities of development and cooperation partners to each other instead of being threats or competitive rivals. If we live in harmony and join hands in cooperation, it will be of great significance to Asia and the globe.

Premier Li Keqiang addressed the reception on september 30, while Vice premier han Zheng presided over it.This year marks the centenary of the CPC. Under the leadership of the CPC, China has achieved outstanding development over the past 72 years that has attracted the world's attention, particularly completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all aspects and embarking on the new quest to fully build a modern socialist country, Li said.

To foster a new development paradigm and promote high-quality development, efforts should be made to implement regular epidemic prevention and anchor reasonable expectations, with focuses on scientific and technological innovation, expanding domestic demand and rural vitalization, Li noted. he said reform and opening-up is China's fundamental state policy, which also serves as the key source of momentum for China's future development. He underlined the need to deepen reform across the board and achieve more significant progress on reforms in key areas and sectors. Li stressed the commitment to reforms oriented toward the socialist market economy and higher-level opening-up on an institutional basis, and called for efforts to create a market- oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment. A raft of measures should be taken to create more jobs, promote equal opportunities, encourage entrepreneurship and innovation and increase urban and rural personal incomes, Li said.Li urged efforts to fully and faithfully implement the principles of \"one country, two systems,\" \"the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong,\" \"the people of Macao governing Macao,\" and a high degree of autonomy for both regions. Calling for actions to safeguard sovereignty, security and the development interests of the country, and measures to promote common development and progress of Hong Kong, Macao and the mainland, Li highlighted the need to continuously improve people's wellbeing and ensure long-term stability and prosperity. He stressed adherence to the overall principles and policies on work related to Taiwan and upholding the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, while promoting the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and advancing national reunification for the benefit of people across the Taiwan Strait. Li also urged moves to firmly oppose and deter any \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities and external interference, calling on people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to make joint efforts to achieve national rejuvenation. China will step up exchanges and cooperation with other countries to jointly tackle global challenges and promote the recovery and growth of the world economy, Li vowed. Li closed his speech by calling for rallying more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and unremitting efforts to build China into a great modern socialist country and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.This year marks the centenary of the CPC.

NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 7 Good afternoon and Namaste! It is my great pleasure to meet all of you, albeit virtually, to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. I would like to extend my warm welcome to all guests attending this event, and my sincere greetings and thanks to all the Indian friends from all walks of life who have long cared about China's development and supported the cause of China-India friendship.at an online event on september 29 to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the People's republic of China, Chinese ambassador to india spoke about China's worldview, its growth-oriented plans, and its relationship with india. Speech by Ambassador Sun Weidong to Celebrate 72nd Anniversary of the Founding of People's Republic of China The year 2021 is a very special one for the Chinese people. It marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC). On July 1, President Xi Jinping solemnly declared that we have realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. In addition, we have brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty in China. We are now taking confident strides toward the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country. 8 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 All the struggle, sacrifice, and creation through which the Party has united and led the Chinese people over the past 100 years could be tied together by one ultimate theme: To bring about the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the beginning of modern times. The \"Chinese Dream\" proposed by President Xi spans the past, today and tomorrow of the Chinese nation. The idea in essence is to make the country prosperous and strong, rejuvenate the nation, and see that the people are happy. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my understanding about the Chinese Dream. The Chinese Dream is the dream of both the country and the nation, and we must follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics to achieve it. Since modern times, China was reduced to a semi-colonial and semi- feudal society. The Chinese nation has suffered unprecedented disaster. In order to achieve national independence and liberation, countless Chinese patriots made several attempts, yet they all failed. Only the Communist Party of China, combining the fundamental principles of marxism with China's specific conditions, leading the Chinese people through struggles and battles with unswerving efforts, established a new China where people are their own masters, carried out the socialist revolution and construction, promoted reform, opening up and modernization, and made great achievements in building socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process. The path determines the future. The path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental achievement of our Party and our people made through countless hardships at enormous cost. It is the correct path proved by history and practice. The Party and the Chinese people will keep moving confidently forward in broad strides along the path that we have chosen for ourselves, and we will make sure the destiny of China's development and progress is firmly in our own hands. The determined strides of over 1.4 billion Chinese people will never be stopped by anyone or any force. China always maintains that every country has the right to follow the development path suited to its national conditions. there isn't a fixed model for the path to modernization, and the one that suits you well will serve you well. Cutting one's feet to fit the shoes will lead nowhere. this applies to both China and India. Both of us are ancient oriental civilizations and populous developing countries. China is willing to strengthen exchange and mutual learning with India to jointly enrich the pathways towards modernization. The Chinese dream is also the dream of all the Chinese people, and we must rely closely on NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 9 the people to achieve it. President Xi Jinping has pointed out that the people's aspiration to live a better life is the goal of the CPC. Ultimately, the Chinese dream is the dream of the people, and we will continue to enhance people's sense of gains, happiness and security. The sense of gains means that people can truly enjoy the fruits of reform and development. In the past, the problem China faced was that we didn't have the necessities, now it's how we can provide high-quality goods. for example, the dietary habit of the Chinese has changed from feeding themselves to eating in a green and healthy way. In terms of education, it has changed from getting access to school into receiving high quality education. At present, the middle-income population in China is about 400 million. In 2021, China's total retail sales of consumer goods are expected to reach 44 trillion yuan, amounting to about $6.8 trillion, increasing approximately 12.5% over last year. The sense of happiness means that people have goals to strive for. Under the country's great dream, every Chinese person has his own dream. In the early 1980s, the Chinese people were living in an era of scarcity, and my wish was to own a bicycle. Nowadays, the dreams of many Chinese young people are to have their start-ups. In China today, people enjoy opportunities to live brilliant life and realize their dreams. Every generation can achieve their goals with the development of the country. The sense of security comes from a sound social security system and good public security. We have established the world's largest social security system, providing old age pension, health care, basic allowances and welfare housing. Nearly 1 billion people are covered by basic old age insurance and 1.36 billion people are covered by basic medical insurance. In 2020, 118.6 lakh new jobs were created in urban areas. China has maintained long-term social stability. In the Law and Order Index issued by Gallup in its latest report, China ranks among the best in the world. In China, people can safely walk on the streets at night without fear of being shot or robbed. The rights to subsistence and development are the basic human rights. Without human beings, where do human rights come from? In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we have always put people and life first. through our enormous efforts, China has made a major strategic achievement in fighting the virus. Now the new local cases in China are limited to double-digits every day. In recent months, China has occasionally reported imported cases and sporadic outbreaks. Even in a city with millions of people, when we meet an outbreak of COVID-19 of unknown source, the government will immediately carry out tests for all people in order to find and control the source of infection, and break the transmission chain as soon as possible. As President Xi Jinping said, we are willing to do whatever it takes to protect people's lives. the CpC will continue to practice a people- centered philosophy of development, develop whole-process people's democracy, safeguard social fairness and justice, resolve the imbalances and inadequacies in development and the most pressing difficulties and problems that are of great concern to the people. Based on a moderately prosperous society in all respects, China is making solid efforts to promote common prosperity for everyone. We will make the pie even bigger, and at the same time, share it fairly. By doing so, we will make more substantive progress toward achieving well-rounded human development and common prosperity for all. The Chinese dream is a dream of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit for all, which will not only benefit the Chinese people, but also people around the world. Right now, COVID-19 is still raging in the world, and profound changes are taking place in human society. The world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation. At the same time, the world we live in is full of hope, where peace, development and cooperation form an irresistible trend of the times. China is committed to follow the path of peaceful development. We will never seek hegemony or expansion. We advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity. We promote the building of a new 10 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 type of international relations and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We practice true multilateralism, which is about having international affairs addressed through consultation and the future of the world decided by everyone working together. We firmly uphold the international system with the United Nations as its core, the international order anchored upon international law, the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. China has worked vigorously to promote common development. China has been contributing over 30% to world growth for many years. A few days ago, President Xi Jinping solemnly proposed the Global Development Initiative, called on the international community to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for more robust, greener, and more balanced global development, and foster a global community of development with a shared future. This major Initiative has set out a blueprint for the development of countries and international development cooperation, and pointed the way forward for global development. China has actively promoted global solidarity in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. to date, China has provided 1.2 billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to more than 100 countries and international organizations and provided assistance of anti-epidemic supplies to over 150 countries and 14 international organizations. China will strive to provide 2 billion doses of vaccines to the world by the end of this year. In addition to donating $100 million to COVAX, China will donate another 100 million doses of vaccines to other developing countries in this year. This fully demonstrates that China is a major responsible country. It is worth noting that a few countries are going against the trend of times. Out of selfishness, they hold a zero-sum Cold War mentality, vigorously seek closed and exclusive ideological \"small cliques\" and military alliances targeting a third party, stoke arms race, tension, division and bloc confrontation, turn the Asia-pacific region into an arena of major powers' game, and destabilize the world. these activities will find no support and lead nowhere.Now, there are concerns on whether China would also seek hegemony once it gets more developed. This kind of worry is unnecessary. Although China has made significant development achievements, there is still a long way to go. We will focus our efforts on dealing with our own business. China hopes to grow into a better country in the process of realizing the Chinese dream, instead of replacing other countries. We believe that the world will be a better place with China's development. China will always be a member of big family of the developing countries, and China's vote in the United Nations is always for the well-being of developing countries. At the same time, our firm resolve is to safeguard sovereignty, security and development interests will remain steadfast forever. Any attempt to view China as a threat or even an \"imaginary enemy\", and gang up for containing and suppressing China is unacceptable to the Chinese people. It is bound to fail. China and India are the two largest developing countries and emerging economies in the world. If we live in harmony and join hands in cooperation, it will be good for the future and well-being of two-fifths of the world's population and of great significance to Asia and the globe. At present, the China-India relations are facing difficulties, but it should not change our basic assessment of the relations. We should boost confidence, step up dialogue and cooperation, and bring the bilateral relations back on track. China and India should stick to the right direction of the bilateral relations. Bearing in mind the fundamental interests of our two countries, we should view the bilateral ties from a historical and strategic perspective, and uphold the strategic consensus that China and India are opportunities for development and cooperation partners instead of being threats or competitive rivals. We should adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, respect the core interests and major concerns of each other, uphold strategic autonomy, and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs or engaging in any \"alliance\" or \"quasi alliance\" targeting the other. As two neighboring major countries, China and NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 11 India should take the right path of mutual respect, dialogue, cooperation and mutual benefit. China and India should expand mutually beneficial cooperation. When India was hit by the second wave of Covid-19, China immediately offered a helping hand and provided large amount of medical supplies to India. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our economic and trade cooperation has bucked the trend. In the first eight months this year, bilateral trade reached $78.5 billion with a growth of about 52% year-on- year. We should provide a fair and just business environment for companies from both countries to invest and operate rather than impose discriminatory and restrictive measures on them. The two countries should promote multilateral cooperation through organizations such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). As major Asian countries, China and India should work together with other countries in the region to promote Asian solidarity and cooperation. The two countries should also strengthen communication and coordination in areas such as combating the pandemic, disaster prevention, poverty eradication, energy security and climate change, to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. China and India should properly handle differences. As neighboring countries, it is normal to have differences between the two countries. It is crucially important to manage them and not allow individual issue to disrupt the overall development of bilateral relations. We should place the boundary question in an appropriate position in bilateral relations and seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution through dialogue and consultations. The overall situation in the border area was gradually de-escalated. Going forward, both sides need to meet each other halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control, so as to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquility of the border area. China and India should strengthen the foundation of people-to-people friendship. Historically, the two ancient civilizations of China and India had exchanges, learned from each other, and enriched each other's culture. Just now, in the warm-up video, the Longmen Grottoes showed is a reflection of historical exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries. We should promote dialogues on the two civilizations and strengthen people-to-people bond. Lack of exchanges and mutual understanding between the two peoples is a long-term drawback to the bilateral relations. the Covid-19 pandemic also brings difficulties to personnel exchanges. We need to tap our potentials and create innovative formats to advance communications in areas such as culture, education, think-tanks and media. It is important to form an objective and friendly \"View on China\" and \"View on India\" among the people of the two countries. China will host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games early next year. We welcome Indian athletes to actively participate. All the guests attending the event today are far-sighted people who have always supported and advanced the development of China-India relations. Among them, there are India-China friendship associations, which have been sowing the seeds of friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples for so many decades. There is the relative of Dr. Kotnis who is a great international warrior. There are Xu Fancheng Culture Study Center and Dr. Kotnis Acupuncture Health and Education Center dedicated to promoting Chinese culture and carrying forward the China-India friendship. There are experts and scholars who have been publishing articles and books, making arduous efforts to boost economic, cultural and educational exchanges. There are also social organizations firmly committed to youth exchanges between China and India. All you have done reflects the strength supporting China-India friendship among the Indian people. It is my firm belief that our great cause will gain more and more support. The Chinese side has the sincerity and goodwill to improve the bilateral relations. Meanwhile, it requires joint efforts of both sides. Let us join hands to bring back the China-India relationship on the track of healthy and stable development, to benefit the two countries and the two peoples. 12 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021Red Tourism, Family Outings Fuel Holiday Travel Surge The National Day holiday saw a surge in tourism, as people unleashed a strong demand for traveling that was suppressed over the summer holiday due to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks. Data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed that domestic attractions received about 515 million trips over the seven-day break, from October 1. The total number of trips is roughly 70% of the number during the same period in 2019, before the pandemic hit. the ministry said that revenue of about 389 billion yuan ($60.3 billion) was generated over the holiday, roughly 60% of that in 2019.travel agencies said they have seen an increase in tour package reservations after their businesses had a hard time during the summer. Red tourism (people visit sites with historical significance for Communism in China) and tour products focusing on appreciating autumn scenery and family trips are popular. The travel portal, Fliggy, said in a new report that sales at its platform of tickets for attractions registered a 100% increase in the first three days of the holiday compared with the same period last year. The Universal Beijing Resort took the top slot on holiday travelers' wish list, followed by Shanghai; Chengdu, Sichuan province; and Chongqing, according to Fliggy. According to online travel agency Qunar, the top 50 theme parks, including Shanghai Disney Resort and Chimelong Tourist Resort in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, saw a 20% average increase in ticket sales. Travelers also showed an increasing preference for Red tourism, as the National Day holiday this year marked the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Data provided by Trip.com Group, an online travel services provider, show that family trips to Red tourism attractions experienced a 30% rise at its platform compared with the same period last year. Destinations including Beijing; Yan'an, Shaanxi province; and Changsha, Hunan province were the most popular Red tourism attractions, it said. Yuan Lili, who is from Anhui province, said it was a good time to take her child to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and pay tribute to martyrs who made their great contribution to the nation's founding.\"We went to Shaoshan (in Hunan), which is the birthplace of Chairman mao Zedong, and then traveled to Changsha for two days,\" she said.On October 8, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism released the National Day holiday statistics. Between October 1 and 7, there were a total of 515 million domestic tourists, down 1.5% from the same period last year, but recovering to about 70% of the pre- pandemic level. This is not the best of statistics, but still not bad considering that China was faced with a number of small COVID-19 outbreaks in several cities in August and early September. Add to that the fact that much of the rest of the world is still trapped in the pandemic. Consumption during last year's Golden Week saw a strong rebound as it was the first major holiday that the country celebrated after bringing COVID-19 under control. Looking back at the economic performance so far this year, we had a blockbuster first quarter with a GDP growth rate of 18.3%, followed by National Holiday Statistics Show Economic Recovery Fundamentals Are Still Strong another robust growth rate of 7.9% in the second quarter. But in the third quarter, the Delta variant outbreaks appeared in China. The National Bureau of Statistics of China hasn't released the numbers yet, but they are likely to be not so nice looking as a series of events since August had taken their toll on the economy, including the small outbreaks of COVID-19 and antitrust regulatory actions against Big Tech and several other industries as a result of \"disorderly capital expansions\" in recent years. but let me point out that these are one-off events that are unlikely to change the fundamentals of China's development trajectory coming out of the pandemic. Historically economic growth after a pandemic, for example the 1918 spanish flu, has been quite strong, and we are still in the very early stage of the recovery path. The National Day holiday consumption figures show market resilience. Perhaps more indicative of my thesis is September's service sector Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) number, which was just released by Caixin. This index is particularly important because the outside shocks I just referred to are mostly hitting the service sector, particularly China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism released the National Day holiday statistics. Between October 1 and 7, there were a total of 515 million domestic tourists, down 1.5% from the same period last year, but recovering to about 70% of the pre-pandemic level. 14 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 retail, restaurant, hotel, and travel industries. The service PMI index has been hovering around 54% every month since the beginning of the year, except for a hard drop to 46.7% in August. The just-released september figure stands at 53.4%. Anything above 50 shows an expansion, while below it indicates a contraction. Another index, the logistics-and-purchase index (LPI) illustrates a similar pattern related to manufacturing. It has been above the 50% mark since January. August saw a dip below 50%, but in September it immediately bounced back to 54%. this index for the most part reflects companies' activities of shipping goods out to customers. The World Bank has projected China's whole year GDP growth in 2021 at 8.5%, but due to the recent events in August, the market sentiment has toned down quite a bit and there has been some doubt about whether this forecast is still reachable. But we are still in the pandemic, aren't we? 8.5% growth amid a tethered globe is still a great achievement in my view. I would be very happy if only 8% growth is realized. Judging from the week-long National Day holiday statistics, there is reason to believe that the last quarter will come back to the recovery and growth trajectory again, in which case 2021 will still be a robust year with a growth above 8%. More importantly, the pandemic is showing signs of abating and eventually turning into a more controllable one. Pharmaceutical company Merck has just developed a cure pill for which it is currently seeking approval with the United States Food and Drug Administration. We are indeed starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel after almost two years of misery.The World Bank has projected China's whole year GDP growth in 2021 at 8.5%, but due to the recent events in August, the market sentiment has toned down quite a bit and there has been some doubt about whether this forecast is still reachable.

President Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while addressing a central conference on work related to people's congresses held in Beijing. The people's congress system, made by Chinese people under the CPC leadership, is a great creation in the history of political systems as well as a brand new system of great significance in the political history of both China and the world, President Xi said. The people's congress system has provided an important institutional guarantee for Chinese people, led by the CPC, to create the miracles of fast economic growth and long-term social stability over the past 60 years, particularly over the four decades of reform and opening-up, President Xi said. Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee has continued to innovate the theories and practice of the system of people's congresses, he said. Noting that institutional advantage is vital for a country to seize its strategic initiative, President Xi said both history and reality show that a country will be stable if it has a steady system, and a country will be strong if it has a sound system. He stressed efforts to fully enforce the Constitution and safeguard its authority and President Xi Stresses Enhancing Whole-Process People's Democracy 18 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 sanctity, and to improve the Chinese socialist system of laws so that good laws are in place to promote development and ensure good governance. President Xi also stressed that people's congresses should properly and effectively exercise their power of oversight in accordance with the law, and deputies to the people's congresses should fully exercise their duties. While the people's congresses should enhance self-building, the overall leadership over the people's congresses by the Party should also be enhanced, President Xi added. \"Democracy, a shared value of humanity, is a key tenet unswervingly upheld by the CPC and the Chinese people,\" President Xi stressed. Democracy is not an ornament to be used for decoration; it is to be used to solve the problems that the people want to solve, President said. \"Whether a country is a democracy or not depends on whether its people are really the masters of the country,\" President Xi said. \"If the people are awakened only for voting but enter a dormant period soon after, if they are given a song and dance during campaigning but have no say after the election, or if they are favored during canvassing but are left out in the cold after the election, such a democracy is not a true democracy,\" President Xi said. \"It is in itself undemocratic to use a single yardstick to measure the rich and varied political systems and examine the diverse political civilizations of humanity from a monotonous perspective,\" President Xi said.the whole-process people's democracy in China not only has a complete set of institutions and procedures, but also full participation and practices, President Xi said, noting that it is the broadest, most genuine, and most effective socialist democracy. \"The system of people's congresses is an important institutional vehicle for realizing whole-process people's democracy in China,\" President Xi added. Under the leadership of the Party, the country will continue to expand the people's orderly political participation and strengthen legal protection for human rights to ensure that the people enjoy extensive rights and freedoms as prescribed by law, President Xi said. Li Keqiang, Wang Yang, Wang huning, Zhao Leji and han Zheng -- who are members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CpC Central Committee -- as well as Vice- President Wang Qishan attended the meeting. Li Zhanshu, also a member of the standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, delivered the concluding remarks. In his remarks, Li Zhanshu hailed president Xi's speech as \"a guiding document powered with Marxist truth.\" He called for full implementation of the guiding principles of President Xi's speech and stressed upholding the leadership of the Party to ensure that all the work of people's congresses proceeds under the Party's leadership.

The white paper, titled China's Epic Journey from Poverty to Prosperity, said the realization of moderate prosperity in all respects, as declared in July, marks a critical step towards national rejuvenation for the country. \"Achieving moderate prosperity fulfills a long-cherished dream of the Chinese nation,\" it said.The document hailed the unremitting hard work by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese people and looked into what the country has accomplished in realizing prosperity through all-round development for all. \"To realize moderate prosperity has required great perseverance and represents a notable achievement on the part of the CPC and the people,\" it said. Moderate prosperity in China, according to the document, is evident in the following respects: Sustainable and sound economic development, expanding people's democracy, in achieving a moderately prosperous society, China has helped dramatically reduce the world's poverty-stricken population and gain a new experience of modernization for humanity, the white paper said. 22 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 a flourishing cultural sector, improvement in people's wellbeing and great changes to the eco-environment. It has also ensured prosperity for every individual, integrated urban-rural development and coordinated development across regions, said the white paper. Building a moderately prosperous society in all respects means that all sectors, all people and all regions should benefit from it, Zhao Chenxin, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said, highlighting a balanced, coordinated and sustainable development. While achieving a historic transformation from a low-income country to an upper-middle-income country, China adopted a targeted strategy and has helped its 99 million poor rural people rise out of poverty by the end of 2020. Ning Jizhe, deputy head of the NDRC, said China's Gini coefficient, an index reflecting inequality where zero equals perfect equality, showed a downward trend in recent years. Last year, the country's Gini coefficient declined to 0.468 from 0.491 in 2008. the country's ratio between the per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents has been declining steadily for 13 consecutive years since 2008, Mr Ning said, adding that the ratio stood at 2.56:1 in 2020. Amid economic advancement, the country has made strong headway in preventing and controlling pollution, attaining major achievements in its drive to keep the skies blue, the waters clear, and the land pollution-free, according to the white paper.Regarding realizing moderate prosperity in all respects as a major contribution China has made to the world, the white paper also expounded on how the world will benefit from China's prosperity. As the world's most populous and largest developing country, China has contributed to global peace and development by achieving moderate prosperity in all respects, it said. In achieving a moderately prosperous society, China has helped dramatically reduce the world's poverty-stricken population and gain a new experience of modernization for humanity, while its all-round opening up has promoted win-win cooperation, said the white paper. \"China's experience offers a new option for those countries and peoples who are looking for both rapid growth and independence, and its success provides them with considerable opportunities for development,\" it said. Mr Ning said moderate prosperity in China means huge opportunities for the global economy, citing estimations that in the next five years, the country's imports of goods are expected to exceed $10 trillion, and its outbound direct investment is likely to top $550 billion. \"This will surely provide a strong impetus for the steady recovery and sustained development of the global economy,\" he said. Despite the remarkable achievements, the white paper said China still faces tough challenges such as unbalanced and inadequate development, while the world today is experiencing a level of change unseen in a century, with greater instability and uncertainty. But the country is confident that it has the capabilities and resources to make more impressive progress, it said. China aims to achieve basic socialist modernization by 2035 and become a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful by the middle of the 21st century. The country will propel its unique modernization forward and make substantial progress in well- rounded human development and common prosperity, said the white paper.Moderate prosperity in China, according to the document, is evident in the following respects: Sustainable and sound economic development, expanding people's democracy, a flourishing cultural sector, improvement in people's wellbeing and great changes to the eco-environment.

An aerial photo taken on Aug. 18, 2020, shows the Hengqin Port between Macao and Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province.The Chinese central authorities' plan for building the Guangdong-macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin has been hailed as \"major good news\" for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR). Hengqin is an area located in the southern part of Zhuhai city in Guangdong Province, just adjacent to Macao. Bringing with it new opportunities and new space for Macao, a city rather small in terms of its land area, the plan, issued by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council and made public recently, is expected to create new impetus for Macao's development by facilitating its better integration into overall national development, reported Xinhua.Experts from various sectors of Macao have told Xinhua that the plan will inject fresh vitality into macao's higher education, scientific research and development, the tourism and leisure industry, and finance. General Guidelines, Policies the plan defines the strategic position of the zone as a new platform to boost Macao's appropriate economic diversification, a new space that provides convenience to Macao residents' life and employment, a new model to enrich the practice of \"one country, two systems,\" as well as a new high ground for building the Guangdong-hong Kong-macao Greater bay Area.The plan prioritizes people's livelihood with a set of concrete measures to build Hengqin into a new home for Macao residents to live and work in, such as exemption of income tax margins, lowering and gradually calling off charges for long-distance phone calls and cross-border internet connections between the two places, further facilitating macao-registered vehicles into and out of Hengqin in a more convenient manner, and the joint building of regional medical centers by Guangdong and Macao. Ho Teng Iat, president of the General Women's Association of Macao, told Xinhua that the plan could bring opportunities for Macao to share the land resources, the pool of professionals and large scientific and technological equipment with Guangdong under the mechanism of mutual discussion, joint construction, joint administration and shared benefits between the two sides.\"It will help enhance the sense of gain, happiness and security for residents at the Greater Bay Area, including Macao,\" Mr Ho said. Ian Soi Kun, chairman of the Macao Jiangmen Communal Society, said Macao should step up its efforts to invite outside investments on major projects in the industries of health, high-tech, exhibition, modern finance and culture and sports, in accordance with the strategic positioning and overall planning of the in-depth cooperation zone and on the basis of Macao's practical situations. Lao Chi Ngai, chairman of the Macao Economic Association, said the plan has set guiding policies on various fronts such as management system, industrial development, residential living and cross-border linkage, which gives clear directions coupled with manoeuvrability and flexibility. Opportunities for Different sectors Song Yonghua, rector of the University of Macao, said the plan will help Macao explore appropriate marketization for its higher education sector, which has long been held back by limited space and market. \"According to the plan, the cooperation zone will continuously improve the convenience of customs clearance between Macao and Hengqin, which will help promote cross-border personnel exchange and therefore, effectively stimulate the vitality of teaching, learning and scientific research,\" said Song. Experts from the tourism industry believed the plan will greatly benefit macao's tourism and leisure industry with its simplification of the cross-border flow of goods and personnel, investments and financing. Wong Fai, president of the Macao Leisure Tourism Services Innovation Association, said the cooperation zone will provide bigger development space for Macao's leisure and tourism industry employers and help push for the upgrading and transformation of the industry. \"Measures such as exemption of investment income tax will attract more small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to invest in the zone,\" Mr Wong said. Ip Sio Kai, president of the Macao Association of Banks, said the plan laid out major arrangements for supporting the development of modern finance and cross-border finance, with the new policy of free flow of cross-border capital and convertible capital accounts between Macao and Hengqin being a major innovation in the financial industry. \"This will provide a broad market and powerful policy support for the future development of macao's financial industry,\" said mr Ip. Ip Kuai peng, pro-rector of the City University of Macao, said Macao should take full advantage of the \"one country, two systems\" principle and its status as an international free trade port, as well as Hengqin's advantages in geographical location, resources and space, to make utmost efforts to focus on prioritized sectors and develop new industries, in aligning with the Guangdong provincial government and the Zhuhai municipal government. \"Macao should endeavor to help build a new integrated high-level opening up system between Hengqin and Macao to make the cooperation zone a new demonstration of the practice of 'one country, two systems,\" he said, suggesting efforts to start with hierarchical management and talent introduction. NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 25China has formally announced its first batch of five national parks, covering a total land area of more than 230,000 square kilometers and conserving nearly 30 percent of the country's key terrestrial wildlife species. the five parks are the three-river-source National Park in Qinghai province and the Tibet autonomous region, the Wuyishan National Park in the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, the Giant Panda National Park in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park in Hainan province. At the Leaders' Summit of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity on October 14, President Xi Jinping said by video link that China is moving faster to establish a protected areas system with national parks as the mainstay. Xi said areas with the greatest importance to the natural ecosystem, and with the most unique natural landscapes, the most valuable natural heritage and the greatest biodiversity reserves will be included in the system. In 2013, the central government put forward the creation of a national park system with the aim of establishing a series of facilities and building a unified management system by 2020. Two years later, construction was approved for 10 pilot national parks to further explore unified management of all facilities. In the parks, the strongest protection occurs within \"red line\" zones, a key government strategy that places designated areas under mandatory State protection. In 2019, the state Council, China's Cabinet, unveiled a guideline on nature reserves, with national parks as a major component. The reserves are intended to provide systemic protection of natural ecosystems, cultural relics within each region, scenery and biodiversity, and also safeguard the country's environmental security. \"The primary purpose of establishing nature reserves is to protect fragile ecosystems, which have been under constant attack from human activities,\" said Tang Xiaoping, deputy director of the National parks management Office at the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. Tang said China's national parks will prioritize protection of ecosystems rather than the utilization of natural resources, and human activities in the national parks will be limited to minimize their influence on ecosystems. In 2016, the three-river-source National park became the first of the country's 10 pilot national parks after the central government decided to protect its ecosystem.according to President Xi, China is moving faster to establish a protected areas system, which will include national parks with the greatest importance to the natural ecosystem, and with the most unique natural landscapes, the most valuable natural heritage and the greatest biodiversity reserves.

It is home to hundreds of species of wild animals, many of which are under State protection, such as wild yaks, snow leopards, Tibetan antelopes and Tibetan gazelles. In 2018, the Giant Panda National Park was established. It connects fragmented habitats in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu and protects more than 70 percent of the country's wild panda population. In the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, which covers 14,100 sq km in Jilin and heilongjiang, a high-tech surveillance system was launched to provide real-time protection for flora and fauna.Thanks to the establishment of the national park and those strong protection efforts, at least 12 Siberian tiger cubs and 11 Amur leopard cubs have been born since 2017, according to the park's management office. \"The establishment of national parks is to better protect China's most valuable bio resources and maintain the natural systems' originality. These are our precious natural assets that should be well conserved for the next generations,\" the National Forestry and Grassland Administration said in a statement released.

Former Chinese State Councilor H.E. Mr. Dai Bingguo attended the opening ceremony. Your Excellency Mr. Dai Bingguo, former State Councilor of China, Scholars from China and India, Ladies and Gentlemen, Good afternoon!It is my great honor to attend the 4th high- level track II Dialogue on China-India relations. First of all, I would like to express thanks to H.E. mr. Dai bingguo for his devotion to the China- India relations. his deep insights into China- India relationship have always been a source of inspiration for us, and helping us to see through the \"mist\" and find the right direction for the bilateral relations. Thanks to the Sichuan University and mp-IDsA for their elaborate preparations for this online event. Today's participants are important scholars and specialists from the two countries, many of whom have previously shouldered important responsibilities in diplomatic, military and economic fields. I would like to take this opportunity to have a candid and in-depth exchange of views with you. since last year, the China-India relationship has witnessed difficulties unseen for many years. The relations remain at a low level. At present, the world is entering a period of turbulence and China-india relations have come to a crossroad once again, and we need to make the right choices, says ambassador sunAmbassador Sun Weidong Attends the Opening Ceremony of the 4th High-level Track II Dialogue on China-India Relations 32 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 change, while the Covid-19 pandemic is still spreading, the global economy remains sluggish in recovery, and the sudden changes in Afghanistan brought about significant impact on the regional situation. As the two largest developing countries and emerging economies, China and India should strengthen coordination and cooperation, join hands in fighting the pandemic, seek common development and rejuvenation, uphold Asian solidarity, and promote the world's peace and development. The current status of the bilateral relationship is obviously not in the fundamental interest of either side. many far-sighted people from both countries have advocated that China and India should improve their relations, and bring the China-India relations back on track. I'd like to share my opinions on this. First, as two major oriental countries, China and India should avoid falling into the trap of outdated western thinking. Analyzed from the prism of so called realism in international relations theories of the west, China and India, as two neighboring major countries, would inevitably view each other as threat and adversary, whose main interactive patterns would be competition and confrontation, and the result that one gains while the other loses would be unavoidable. \"sphere of influence\", \"zero-sum game\", and \"seeking hegemony\" would be often repeated. The western mindset of power politics and the law of the jungle run counter to the trend of the 21st century which is peace, development and win-win cooperation. It gains no support from the people. Today, even for the most powerful country in the world, it is doomed to fail to make wanton military intervention in other countries and impose their own values and social systems onto others. Afghanistan is the latest example.As ancient civilizations, China and India have always pursued the visions of \"universal peace\" and \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakum\" (the world being one family), advocated the principles of inclusiveness and harmony, seeking common ground while shelving differences. We should take the path of peaceful development to deliver a better life for our peoples, rather than repeat the mistake in history and choose a wrong path of confrontation and conflict between two major developing countries. China does not subscribe to the notion that a country is bound to seek hegemony when it grows in strength. Our historical wisdom shows that a country will decline if it seeks hegemony. However strong it may grow, China will never seek hegemony or expansion. Some Indian people think that China has become India's \"major threat\" and \"strategic rival\". It is a serious strategic miscalculation. If such judgment is translated into India's foreign policy, it would probably become a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\", which is not what we want to see. Second, we should view the bilateral relations from a comprehensive rather than one-sided perspective. China-India relations are multi- faceted and multi-dimensional. Despite disputes and differences, there are more consensus and cooperation. every field of bilateral relations should promote rather than undercut each other. We should avoid taking a part for the whole, or losing sight of the forest for the trees. For example, peace and tranquility in the border areas is important, but it is not the whole story of the bilateral relations. the Chinese side has always viewed China- India relations from a strategic and long-term perspective and made unremitting efforts to this end. When India was hit by the second wave of Covid-19, China immediately offered a helping hand and overcame difficulties to ensure smooth medical supplies to India. Pragmatic cooperation between China and India conforms to the needs of both sides and is highly complementary. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our economic and trade cooperation has bucked the trend. In the first half of 2021, the bilateral trade reached $57.5 billion, with a year-on-year increase of 62%. the two countries share broad common interests on international and regional issues. Just in this month, leaders of the two countries attended the The Chinese side has always viewed China- India relations from a strategic and long- term perspective and made unremitting efforts to this end.

It takes only one party to impair a relationship, but takes two countries to build good relations. China-India relations should be a two-way street of mutual respect, accommodating each other's concerns while promoting win-win cooperation, not a one-way street that one side raises requests and set conditions while the other is forced to make responses. Third, China and India should uphold strategic autonomy and grasp fate in our own hands. China and India both won independence and liberation in the middle of last century, have realized national development, and gained significant influence in the world. One of key reasons is our adherence to independence. For major countries like China and India with over 1 billion population, we can only rely on ourselves to achieve development. The primary task for both sides is to achieve development and rejuvenation, and focus on running our own affairs well. At present, some countries, with their ideological bias and Cold War mentality, vigorously seek closed and exclusive \"small cliques\" with the aim of containing a third party, stoking bloc confrontation and geopolitical games. In fact, containing others will not benefit a country with better development, nor will ganging up with others make one more secure. Once getting on someone else's ship, one is no longer able to have the steer in control. Twenty years ago, when the US started the Afghan War, many countries boarded its chariot. Twenty years later, what benefits have these countries gained? We should uphold true strategic autonomy, not only in words, but more importantly, in deeds. Friends, This year we have celebrated the centenary of the founding of the CPC. President Xi Jinping solemnly declared that we have realized the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. This means that we have brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty in China, and we are now marching toward the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects. India is also moving towards its own development goals. Both China and India need a sound external environment, especially a harmonious neighborhood. We should bear in mind the fundamental interests Red Cross Society of China provided 100 oxygen concentrators, 40 ventilators, other supplies and the cash assistance to the Indian Red Cross Society through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in May 2021. 34 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 of our two countries, and explore ways for the two neighboring major countries to live in harmony and achieve common development and rejuvenation. First of all, China and India should enhance mutual trust and stick to the right direction of the bilateral relations. We need to build a solid foundation for mutual trust, uphold the strategic consensus of being opportunities of development and cooperation partners to each other instead of being threats or competitive rivals. We need to carefully maintain the mutual trust, avoid doing anything that harms mutual trust, no matter how small it is. We need to do our best to push forward everything that benefits mutual trust, no matter how difficult it is. It is hoped that India will respect China's core interests on issues related to Tibet, Taiwan, South China Sea etc., take a prudent attitude in words and actions, and keep its commitments. Both sides should remove disruptions to mutual trust, refrain from interference in each other's internal affairs or engagement in any \"alliance\" or \"quasi alliance\" targeting the other, and avoid being alienated by third party. In order to foster an atmosphere of mutual trust, officials, think-tanks and media should send out more rational and constructive messages, not the other way around. Secondly, China and India should strengthen dialogue and promote cooperation. This year, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had several meetings and phone conversations with the Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. Jaishankar. A few days ago, they met in Dushanbe. We need to strengthen communication and dialogue at various levels and in all fields, and push for the gradual improvement of the relations between the two countries. There is huge potential in economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. However, the bilateral cooperation has faced some restrictions imposed intentionally by the Indian side since last year. We should build bridges instead of walls, complement each other instead of decoupling. It is hoped that India will provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies to invest and operate in India. If all Chinese companies are driven away or squeezed out of the India market, what would India gain from it? This question is worth thinking twice. Besides, China and India can also strengthen communication and coordination on multilateral issues, respond to global challenges together such as combating the pandemic, disaster prevention, poverty eradication, energy security and climate change, so as to safeguard the common interests of developing countries. Thirdly, China and India should properly handle differences and not allow differences to become disputes. We should place the border issue in an appropriate position in bilateral relations and seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution through dialogue and consultations. China has always been positive to seek a proper solution to the China-India border issue. The current overall situation in the border area was gradually de-escalated. We hope that the Indian side will meet us halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control, so as to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquility of the border area. For differences in other areas, we also need to focus on narrowing them instead of aggravating the situation, and seek solutions acceptable to both sides through frank communication. At present, China-India relations have come to a crossroad once again, and we need to make the right choices. Ultimately, China and India should work together to take the broad road of mutual respect, dialogue, cooperation and mutual benefit, rather than the narrow log bridge of mutual confrontation, suspicion, attrition and zero-sum competition. I hope all participants could candidly exchange views on the China- India relations, and make suggestions responsibly for bringing the China-India relations back to the track of healthy and stable development. Finally, I wish the dialogue a full success.China and India can also strengthen communication and coordination on multilateral issues, respond to global challenges together such as combating the pandemic, disaster prevention, poverty eradication, energy security and climate change, so as to safeguard the common interests of developing countries.

Xi Jinping pointed out that this year marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China. It is also the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the lawful seat of the People's Republic of China in the UN, a historic event which will be solemnly commemorated by China. We will continue our active efforts to take China's cooperation with the UN to a new level and make new and greater contributions to advancing the noble cause of the UN.Xi Jinping stressed that a year ago, global leaders attended the high-level meetings marking the 75th anniversary of the UN and pledged to fight COVID-19 in solidarity, tackle challenges together, uphold multilateralism, strengthen the role of the UN, and work for the common future of present and coming generations. One year on, our world is facing the combined impacts of changes unseen in a century and the COVID-19 pandemic. In all countries, people long for peace and development more than ever before, their call for equity and justice is growing stronger, and they are more determined in pursuing win-win cooperation. Xi Jinping stressed that right now, COVID-19 is still raging in the world, and profound changes are taking place in human society. The Bolstering Confidence and Jointly Overcoming Difficulties To Build a Better World: President Xi at UNGA President Xi Jinping attended the General debate of the 76th session of the United Nations General assembly on september 22, and delivered a speech that underlined the need for international cooperation to combat Covid-19. 36 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 world has entered a period of new turbulence and transformation. It falls on each and every responsible statesman to answer the questions of our times and make a historical choice with confidence, courage and a sense of mission. first, we must beat COVID-19 and win this decisive fight crucial to the future of humanity. Rising to challenges, humanity has always emerged in triumph and achieved greater development and advancement. We should always put people and their lives first, respect science, take a science-based approach, follow the laws of science, both carry out epidemic control and promote economic and social development, and enhance coordinated global COVID-19 response. We need to make vaccines a global public good and ensure vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries. Of pressing priority is to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of vaccines globally. China will strive to provide a total of two billion doses of vaccines to the world by the end of this year. In addition to donating 100 million U.s. dollars to COVAX, China will donate 100 million doses of vaccines to other developing countries in the course of this year. China will continue to support and engage in global science-based origins tracing, and stands firmly opposed to political maneuvering in whatever form. Second, we must revitalize the economy, pursue more robust, greener and more balanced global development, and work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth. Xi Jinping proposed a Global Development Initiative: -staying committed to development as a priority. We need to put development high on the global macro policy agenda, strengthen policy coordination among major economies, and ensure policy continuity, consistency and sustainability. We need to foster global development partnerships that are more equal and balanced, forge greater synergy among multilateral development cooperation processes, and speed up the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. -staying committed to a people-centered approach. We should safeguard and improve people's livelihoods and protect and promote human rights through development, and make sure that development is for the people and by the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people. We should continue our work so that the people will have a greater sense of happiness, benefit and security, and achieve well-rounded development. -staying committed to benefits for all. We should care about the special needs of developing countries. We may employ such means as debt suspension and development aid to help developing countries, particularly vulnerable ones facing exceptional difficulties, with emphasis on addressing unbalanced and inadequate development among and within countries. -staying committed to innovation-driven development. We need to seize the historic opportunities created by the latest round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, redouble efforts to harness technological achievements to boost productivity, and foster an open, fair, equitable and non- discriminatory environment for the development of science and technology. We should foster new growth drivers in the post-COVID era and jointly achieve leapfrog development. -staying committed to harmony between man and nature. We need to improve global environmental governance, actively respond to climate change and create a community of life for man and nature. We need to accelerate transition to a green and low-carbon economy and achieve We must beat COVID-19 and win this decisive fight crucial to the future of humanity. Rising to challenges, humanity has always emerged in triumph and achieved greater development and advancement.

NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 37 green recovery and development. China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This requires tremendous hard work, and we will make every effort to meet these goals. China will step up support for other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy, and will not build new coal-fired power projects abroad. -staying committed to results-oriented actions. We need to increase input in development, and advance on a priority basis cooperation on poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, among other areas, so as to build a global community of development with a shared future. Third, we must strengthen solidarity and promote mutual respect and win-win cooperation in conducting international relations. A world of peace and development should embrace civilizations of various forms, and must accommodate diverse paths to modernization. Democracy is not a special right reserved to an individual country, but a right for the people of all countries to enjoy. Military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm. We need to advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and reject the practice of forming small circles or zero-sum games. One country's success does not have to mean another country's failure, and the world is big enough to accommodate common development and progress of all countries. We need to pursue dialogue and inclusiveness over confrontation and exclusion. We need to build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation, and do the best we can to expand the convergence of our interests and achieve the biggest synergy possible. The Chinese people have always celebrated and striven to pursue the vision of peace, amity and harmony. China has never and will never invade or bully others, or seek hegemony. China is always a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods. China will continue to bring the world new opportunities through its new development. Fourth, we must improve global governance and practice true multilateralism. In the world, there is only one international system, i.e. the international system with the UN at its core. There is only one international order, i.e. the international order underpinned by international law. And there is only one set of rules, i.e. the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The UN should hold high the banner of true multilateralism and serve as the central platform for countries to jointly safeguard universal security, share development achievements and chart the course for the future of the world. The UN should stay committed to ensuring a stable international order, increasing the representation and say of developing countries in international affairs, and taking the lead in advancing democracy and rule of law in international relations. The UN should advance, in a balanced manner, the work in all the three areas of security, development and human rights, and see to it that commitments made by all parties to multilateralism are truly delivered. In conclusion, Xi Jinping stressed that the world is once again at a historical crossroads. I am convinced that the trend of peace, development and advancement for humanity is irresistible. Let's bolster confidence and jointly address global threats and challenges, and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind and a better world for all.We must strengthen solidarity and promote mutual respect and win-win cooperation in conducting international relations. A world of peace and development should embrace civilizations of various forms, and must accommodate diverse paths to modernization.

Beijing in autumn was blessed with refreshing air and light breeze. The Golden Hall of the Great Hall of the People was beautifully lit and decorated with flowers in bloom. the national flag of the people's republic of China contrasted finely with the official flag of the United Nations, accompanied with a magnificent array of national flags of the United Nations member states. With the music of \"peace - A Community with a Shared Future\", Xi Jinping stepped into the hall where he received rounds of applause. President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech. he pointed out that fifty years ago today, the 26th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, with an overwhelming majority, Resolution 2758, and the decision was made to restore all rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations. It was a victory for the Chinese people and a victory for people of the world. He also stressed that the restoration of New China's lawful seat in the United Nations was a momentous event for the world and the United Nations. It came as the result of joint efforts of all peace-loving countries that stood up for justice in the world. It marked the return of the Chinese people, or one-fourth of the world's population, back to the UN stage. The importance was significant and far-reaching for both China and the wider world. he further highlighted that the past five decades since New China restored its lawful seat in the United Nations have witnessed China's peaceful development and its commitment and dedication to the welfare of all humanity. - for these 50 years, the Chinese people have demonstrated an untiring spirit and kept to the right direction of China's development amidst changing circumstances, thus writing an epic chapter in the development of China and humanity. Building on achievements in national construction and development since the founding of New China, the Chinese people have started the new historical era of reform and opening- up, and successfully initiated and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics. We have achieved a historic breakthrough of leaping from a country with relatively low productivity to the second largest economy in the world. Through much hard work, the Chinese people have attained the goal of fully building a moderately prosperous society on the vast land of China, and won the battle against poverty, thus securing a historic success in eradicating absolute poverty. We have now embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country and opened up bright prospects for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 40 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 - for these 50 years, the Chinese people have stood in solidarity and cooperation with people around the world and upheld international equity and justice, contributing significantly to world peace and development. We have unswervingly followed an independent foreign policy of peace, stood firm for fairness and justice, and resolutely opposed hegemony and power politics. The Chinese people are a strong supporter of other developing countries in their just struggle to safeguard sovereignty, security and development interests. The Chinese people are committed to achieving common development. From the Tazara Railway to the Belt and Road Initiative, we have done what we could to help other developing countries, and have offered the world new opportunities through our own development. During the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been active in sharing COVID response experience with the world, and has sent large quantities of supplies, vaccines and medicines to other countries, and deeply engaged in science-based cooperation on COVID-19 origins tracing, all in a sincere and proactive effort to contribute to humanity's final victory over the pandemic. - for these 50 years, the Chinese people have upheld the authority and sanctity of the United Nations and practiced multilateralism, and China's cooperation with the United Nations has deepened steadily. China has faithfully fulfilled its responsibility and mission as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, stayed true to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upheld the central role of the United Nations in international affairs. China has stood actively for political settlement of disputes through peaceful means. China has been among the first of countries to meet the UN millennium Development Goals. It has taken the lead in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China has acted by the spirit of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and earnestly applied the universality of human rights in the Chinese context. It has blazed a path of human rights development that is consistent with the trend of the times and carries distinct Chinese features, thus making major contribution to human rights progress in China and the international human rights cause. He emphasized that the trend of the world, vast and mighty, prospers those who follow it and perishes those who go against it. In the world today, changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and the force for peace, development and progress has continued to grow. It falls upon us to follow the prevailing trend of history, and choose cooperation over confrontation, openness over seclusion, and mutual benefit over zero-sum games. We shall be firm in opposing all forms of hegemony and power politics, as well as all forms of unilateralism and protectionism. - We should vigorously advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are the common values of humanity, and work together to provide the right guiding philosophy for building a better world. NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 41 Peace and development are our common cause, equity and justice our common aspiration, and democracy and freedom our common pursuit. Diversity makes human civilization what it is, and provides a constant source of vitality and driving force for world development. No civilization in the world is superior to others; every civilization is special and unique to its own region. Civilizations can achieve harmony only through communication, and can make progress only through harmonization. Whether a country's path of development works is judged, first and foremost, by whether it fits the country's conditions; whether it follows the development trend of the times; whether it brings about economic growth, social advancement, better livelihoods and social stability; whether it has the people's endorsement and support; and whether it contributes to the progressive cause of humanity. - We should jointly promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, and work together to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity. humanity should overcome difficulties in solidarity and pursue common development in harmony. To build a community with a shared future for mankind is not to replace one system or civilization with another. Instead, it is about countries with different social systems, ideologies, histories, cultures and levels of development coming together for shared interests, shared rights and shared responsibilities in global affairs, and creating the greatest synergy for building a better world.- We should stay committed to mutual benefit and win-win results, and work together to promote economic and social development for the greater benefit of our people. Development is meaningful only when it is for the people's interest, and can sustain only when it is motivated by the people. Countries should put their people front and center, and strive to realize development with a higher level of quality, efficiency, equity, sustainability and security. It is important to resolve the problem of unbalanced and inadequate development, and make development more balanced, coordinated and inclusive. It is also important to strengthen the people's capacity for development, foster a development environment where everyone takes part and has a share, and create a development paradigm where its outcome benefits every person in every country more directly and fairly. Not long ago, at the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, I proposed a Global Development Initiative with the hope that countries will work together to overcome impacts of COVID-19 on global development, accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and build a global community of development with a shared future. - We should step up cooperation, and work together to address the various challenges and global issues facing humanity. Only with more inclusive global governance, more effective multilateral mechanisms and more active regional cooperation, can these issues be addressed effectively. Countries need to take concrete actions to protect Mother Nature. We need to encourage green recovery, green production and green consumption, promote a 42 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 civilized and healthy way of life, foster harmony between man and Nature, and let a sound ecology and environment be the inexhaustible source of sustainable development. - We should resolutely uphold the authority and standing of the United Nations, and work together to practice true multilateralism. Countries should uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core, the international order underpinned by international law and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. International rules can only be made by the 193 UN member states together, and not decided by individual countries or blocs of countries. International rules should be observed by the 193 UN member states, and there is no and should be no exception. Countries should respect the United Nations, take good care of the UN family, refrain from exploiting the Organization, still less abandoning it at one's will, and make sure that the United Nations plays an even more positive role in advancing humanity's noble cause of peace and development. China will be happy to work with all countries under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to explore new ideas and new models of cooperation and keep enriching the practice of multilateralism under new circumstances. Xi Jinping concluded that a review of the past can light the way forward. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development and always be a builder of world peace. China will stay committed to the path of reform and opening-up and always be a contributor to global development. China will stay committed to the path of multilateralism and always be a defender of the international order. As an ancient Chinese poem reads, \"Green hills immerse in the same cloud and rain. The same moon lights up towns however far away.\" Let us join hands, stand on the right side of history and the side of human progress, and work tirelessly for the lasting and peaceful development of the world and for building a community with a shared future for mankind! UN secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres delivered a speech. He said that during the past 50 years since China's restoration of its lawful seat in the United Nations, China has been making increasingly significant contributions to the United Nations. It is a reliable partner of the United Nations, and a major pillar of international cooperation. he thanks China for its significant role in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, eradicating poverty and realizing green and low-carbon energy development. the United Nations will support the implementation of the Global Development Initiative. He called on the international community to support multilateralism, enhance multilateral systems, and address global challenges in solidarity. He stressed that the United Nations will remain as China's staunch partner on the path of jointly building a more just and sustainable future.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that since its establishment 20 years ago, the SCO, following the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development, has endeavored to promote world peace, development and human progress, and to explore new ground, both theoretically and with actual steps, with a view to building a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. We have jointly promoted political mutual trust and created a new model based on partnership and dialogue, rather than alliance or confrontation. We have jointly ensured security and stability, and firmly curb the spread of drug trafficking, cybercrime Staying True to Our Founding Mission and Forging Ahead on a New Journey of SCO Cooperation 44 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 and transnational organized crime. We have jointly pursued prosperity and development, and intensified practical cooperation in our region. We have jointly upheld international justice, spoken out to advocate multilateralism and the common values of humanity, and take a fair stand against hegemony and power politics. President Xi Jinping stressed that the SCO has reached a new historical starting point. We should hold high the banner of the Shanghai Spirit, keep to the right direction in the historical trends of promoting democracy in international relations, and pursue our own development as we pursue common development for humanity. We should build a closer SCO community with a shared future and contribute more to lasting global peace and common prosperity. To this end, president Xi Jinping put forward a five-point proposal. First, we need to follow the journey of enhancing solidarity and cooperation. We should step up policy dialogue, communication and coordination, respect each other's legitimate concerns and promptly resolve problems that may arise in our cooperation, thus keeping the SCO on a steady course of development. We should maintain firm confidence in our systems, reject condescending lecturing, and firmly support countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are suited to their national conditions. We must never allow any external interference in the domestic affairs of countries in our region under whatever pretext. We should keep the future and destiny of our countries' development and progress firmly in our own hands. We should follow the principle of putting people and their lives first and promote the spirit of science. We need to deepen international cooperation against the virus, promote fair and equitable distribution of vaccines and firmly oppose any act of politicizing COVID-19 origins tracing. China has provided close to 1.2 billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations in the course of this year. China will step up efforts to provide a total of two billion doses to other countries in the course of this year. China will deepen anti-COVID cooperation with other developing countries, make good use of China's 100 million U.s. dollars donation to COVAX, and make our due contribution to humanity's ultimate victory over the virus. Second, we need to follow the journey of upholding our common security. We need to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and take tough actions against the \"three forces\" of terrorism, separatism and extremism, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. We need to strengthen cooperation on counter-narcotics, border control and security for major events, and NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 45 speedily improve the SCO's security cooperation mechanism. We need to enhance the capacity of competent authorities of SCO countries to maintain stability and respond to emergencies. We SCO member states need to step up coordination to facilitate a smooth transition in Afghanistan and help Afghanistan truly embark on a path of peace, stability and development. Third, we need to follow the journey of promoting openness and integration. We need to continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation as well as the secure and orderly flow of people, goods, capital and data. We should create growth drivers of cooperation such as digital economy, green energy and modern agriculture. We need to strengthen complementarity between the Belt and Road Initiative and the development strategies of SCO countries and regional cooperation initiatives such as the Eurasian Economic Union. We should keep industrial and supply chains functioning smoothly, promote economic integration and interconnected development of all countries and deliver shared benefits to all. China will continue to share its market opportunities, and strive to reach 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars in its cumulative trade with other SCO countries in the next five years. China will open a China-sCO business and trade Institute and launch the second phase of the special lending facility to promote Belt and Road cooperation, to mainly support projects related to modernization, connectivity, infrastructure, and green, low- carbon and sustainable development. Fourth, we need to follow the journey of boosting interactions and mutual learning. We need to encourage exchanges, dialogue, harmony and co-existence between civilizations. We should launch more projects that will appeal to our people and benefit them directly in areas including science and technology, education, culture, health and poverty alleviation. In the next three years, China will provide 1,000 training opportunities in poverty alleviation for other SCO countries, open 10 Luban Workshops, and launch 30 cooperation projects in such areas as health, poverty relief, culture and education under the framework of the Silk Road Community Building Initiative. China will host an SCO youth technology and innovation forum next year. China proposes to establish an SCO alliance of traditional medicine industries. China welcomes all countries' participation in the 2022 Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games to deliver a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympic Games together. Fifth, we need to follow the journey of upholding equity and justice. As a Chinese saying goes, \"Power may win for the time being, but justice will prevail for the long run.\" Acting from a so-called \"position of strength\" is not the way to handle international affairs, and hegemonic, domineering and bullying acts should be firmly rejected. In addressing international relations, we should observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. We need to practice true multilateralism and oppose actions that use the name of so- called rules to undermine the international order and cause confrontation and division. We need to boost mutually beneficial cooperation and promote inclusive development that delivers benefits to all. President Xi Jinping pointed out that I am confident that the growing sCO family will stride ahead together with all the progressive forces of the world, and be the builders of world peace, contributors to global development and defenders of the international order. 46 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 At last, President Xi Jinping said, let's hold high the banner of the Shanghai Spirit, stay true to the SCO's founding mission, advance in the right direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and embark on a new journey for the development of the SCO!

Noting that this year marks the 15th anniversary of cooperation among the BRICS countries, President Xi Jinping pointed out, over the past 15 years, we the five countries have followed the principles of openness and inclusiveness and treated each other as equals, enhanced strategic communication and political mutual trust, respected each other's social system and development path, and continuously explored a right approach to co-existence among countries; we the five countries have insisted on being pragmatic and innovative and cooperating for win-win outcomes, synergized development policies, leveraged complementary advantages, pushed forward pragmatic cooperation across different fields solidly, and forged ahead on the road to common development; we the five countries have remained committed to equity 48 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 and justice and worked for common progress, supported multilateralism, participated in global governance, and grown into an ignorable crucial force in the international arena. So far this year, we the five countries have, in spite of the COVID-19 disruptions, carried forward the development momentum of BRICS cooperation and scored new progress in many fields. the facts have proven that no matter what kind of difficulties we go through, brICs cooperation will go far ahead on a steady and firm footing as long as we focus our ingenuity and energy on the same goal. President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech entitled \"Advance BRICS Cooperation to Meet Common Challenges Together\". He pointed out, at present, the COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc around the world. The road to global recovery remains bumpy and tortuous. And the international order is going through profound and complex changes. Facing these challenges, we the BRICS countries must step forward to make an active contribution to world peace and development and advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. -We need to promote the practice of true multilateralism, adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and safeguard the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law. -We need to promote global solidarity against COVID-19, join forces to tackle the pandemic, uphold a science-based approach to tracing its origins, and oppose politicization and stigmatization. We need to enhance coordination in COVID prevention and control, and boost the research, production and equitable distribution of vaccines as a global public good. -We need to promote openness and innovation- driven growth to facilitate a steady global recovery. We need to uphold the WtO-centered multilateral trading regime, make sure that the latest outcomes of scientific and technological progress bring benefit to all countries, and push for an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. -We need to promote common development, follow a people-centered philosophy of development and fully implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need to actively respond to climate change based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, promote the transition to green and low-carbon development, and jointly build a clean and beautiful world. President Xi emphasized, under the current circumstances, it is important for BRICS countries to stay resolved, strengthen unity and further enhance the quality of practical cooperation. He made five proposals. First, strengthen public health cooperation in the spirit of solidarity. We need to step up to our political responsibility, support each other's COVID response, and share relevant information and COVID-control experience. We need to pursue practical cooperation on vaccines, including joint research and production and mutual recognition of standards, and facilitate an early launch of the brICs Vaccine r&D Center in virtual format. It is also important to strengthen cooperation on traditional medicine to develop more tools against the virus. Second, strengthen international cooperation on vaccines in the spirit of equitable access for all. China has provided vaccines and necessary technical support for countries in need, and has made active contribution to promoting the We the five countries have insisted on being pragmatic and innovative and cooperating for win-win outcomes, synergized development policies, leveraged complementary advantages, pushed forward pragmatic cooperation across different fields solidly, and forged ahead on the road to common development. NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 49 equitable distribution of vaccines and global cooperation against COVID-19. to date, China has provided more than one billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations, and will strive to provide a total of two billion doses by the end of this year. I would like to take this opportunity to announce that on top of the 100 million U.S. dollars donation to COVAX, China will donate an additional 100 million doses of vaccines to fellow developing countries within this year. Third, strengthen economic cooperation in the spirit of mutual benefit. We need to earnestly implement the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025, and expand cooperation in such areas as trade and investment, technology and innovation, and green and low-carbon development. China proposes to host a BRICS high-level meeting on climate change and a brICs forum on big data for sustainable development. We welcome the substantive progress made in expanding the membership of the New Development Bank (NDB), and look forward to a bigger role of the NDB in supporting the development of its members and in global economic and financial affairs. The BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution innovation center has already been launched in Xiamen, and we look forward to active participation of government departments and business communities of BRICS countries. Fourth, strengthen political and security cooperation in the spirit of fairness and justice. We need to consolidate the BRICS strategic partnership, support each other on issues concerning our respective core interests, and jointly safeguard our sovereignty, security and We the BRICS countries must step forward to make an active contribution to world peace and development and advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. 50 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 development interests. We need to make good use of BRICS mechanisms such as the meeting of foreign ministers and the meeting of high representatives for security, better coordinate our position on major international and regional issues, and send out an even bigger, collective voice of BRICS countries. fifth, strengthen people-to-people exchanges in the spirit of mutual learning. China suggests setting up a BRICS alliance for vocational education to organize vocational skills competitions. China will host the BRICS seminar on governance and the brICs forum on people- to-people and cultural exchanges, and open an online training course for media professionals of our five countries. China will host the beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games early next year. We look forward to welcoming athletes from BRICS countries and around the world to demonstrate their sporting skills and achieve excellent performance. President Xi underlined, as a Chinese saying goes, \"A man of wisdom adapts to changes; a man of knowledge acts by circumstances.\" In advancing BRICS cooperation, we need to embrace changes of our times and keep abreast of the times. I am confident that with our concerted efforts, the BRICS mechanism will brim with renewed vigor and vitality. He noted, China will take over the BRICS chairmanship and host the 14th BRICS Summit next year. China looks forward to working with its BRICS partners to deepen cooperation in all fields, forge a closer and more pragmatic partnership, address common challenges and create a better future.We need to pursue practical cooperation on vaccines, including joint research and production and mutual recognition of standards, and facilitate an early launch of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center in virtual format. It is also important to strengthen cooperation on traditional medicine to develop more tools against the virus. China has provided more than one billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations, and will strive to provide a total of two billion doses by the end of this year. the brICs leaders fully affirm the achievements of BRICS cooperation in the past 15 years and believe that in the face of unprecedented challenges and complex international situation, the five countries have so far this year joined hands to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, promoted fruitful cooperation in various fields, and enhanced the status of emerging economies. They are willing to continuously make common endeavors to deepen the BRICS strategic partnership and work for more pragmatic outcomes in BRICS cooperation. The BRICS leaders said they will continue to promote global solidarity against COVID-19 and oppose the politicization of COVID-19 origin- tracing, and are willing to step up cooperation on public health and vaccines, boost equitable access to vaccines, drive a strong recovery of the world economy, and work to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. the parties reaffirm their support for multilateralism and the basic norms governing international relations and their opposition to unilateralism and hegemonism, and advocate that all countries should show respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and equality.

NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 51 Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the Leaders' summit of the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological diversity held in Kunming via a video link on october 12, 2021. In his speech, President Xi Jinping pointed out that biodiversity makes Earth full of vigor and vitality and lays the foundation for human survival and development. Protecting biodiversity helps protect Earth, our common homeland, and contributes to humanity's sustainable development, he said. This COP15 has great significance. It will identify targets and pathways for global biodiversity protection in the future. In this context, the international community must enhance cooperation, build consensus and pool strength to build a community of all life on Earth. President Xi stressed that man and Nature need to coexist in harmony. We need to respect Nature, follow Nature's laws and protect Nature, so as to build a homeland of harmonious coexistence between man and Nature. Green mountains are gold mountains and silver mountains. A sound ecology and environment is not just a natural asset, but also an economic asset, and it affects the potential and momentum of economic and social development. We need to speed up efforts to foster a green way of development and secure a win-win economic growth and environmental protection, so as to build a homeland of coordinated advancement of economy and the environment. the COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow over global development. Faced with the dual tasks of economic recovery and environmental protection, we need to strengthen solidarity to overcome difficulties and let people across countries benefit more and in a fairer way from development outcomes and a sound environment, so as to build a homeland of common development of all countries. President Xi sressed that we are living in an era, fraught with challenges and full of hopes. For the sake of our common future, we need to join hands and start a new journey of high-quality development for humanity. First, we shall take the development of ecological civilization as our guide to coordinate the relationship between man and Nature. We need to solve the problems brought by industrial civilization, keep human activities within the limits of the ecology and environment, and carry out holistic conservation Build a Community of All life on Earth: President Xi 52 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 and systematic governance of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts. Second, we shall let green transition drive our efforts to facilitate global sustainable development. We need to build a green, low- carbon and circular economic system, translate ecological strengths into development strengths, and bring out the great benefit that green mountains and clear waters can offer. We also need to step up green international cooperation and share the fruits of green development among all countries. Third, we shall concentrate on bettering people's well-being to promote social equity and justice. We need to keep in mind the people's aspiration for a better life, pursue win-win results in environmental protection, economic development, job creation, poverty alleviation and other endeavors, and increase the sense of fulfillment, happiness and security of people in all countries. Fourth, we shall take international law as the basis to uphold a fair and equitable international governance system. We need to practice true multilateralism, and effectively honor and implement international rules. The new environmental protection targets we set need to be ambitious on the one hand and pragmatic and balanced on the other, so as to make the global environmental governance system fairer and more equitable. President Xi pointed out that China has made remarkable progress in building an ecological civilization. China will continue to advance ecological progress, stay committed to implementing the new development philosophy emphasizing innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, and build a beautiful China. President Xi announced China's initiative to establish a Kunming Biodiversity Fund and take the lead by investing 1.5 billion yuan to support biodiversity protection in developing countries. China also calls for and welcomes contributions from other parties to the fund. President Xi pointed out that to strengthen biodiversity protection, China is moving faster to establish a protected areas system with national parks as the mainstay. Over time, areas with the greatest importance to the natural ecosystem, and with the most unique natural landscapes, the most valuable natural heritage and the greatest biodiversity reserve will be included in the national parks system. To achieve its carbon peak and neutrality targets, China will release implementation plans for peaking carbon dioxide emissions in key areas and sectors as well as a series of supporting measures, and will put in place a \"1+N\" policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality. China will continue to readjust its industrial structure and energy mix, vigorously develop renewable energy, and make faster progress in planning and developing large wind power and photovoltaic bases in sandy areas, rocky areas and deserts. In conclusion, President Xi stressed that if we humanity do not fail Nature, Nature will not fail us. Ecological civilization represents the development trend of human civilization. Let us join hands, follow the philosophy of ecological civilization and shoulder our responsibility for future generations. Let us make joint efforts to build a community of all life on Earth, and a clean and beautiful world for us all. the COp15 was held online and offline in Kunming on October 12, with UN secretary- General Antonio Guterres, Russian President Vladimir putin, egyptian president Abdel fattah al-sisi, turkish president recep tayyip erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron, Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, Prime Minister James Marape of Papua New Guinea, Britain's Prince Charles and others attended via video link. NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 53 On the evening of October 14, 2021, President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony of the second United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conference and delivered a keynote speech titled \"Staying Connected with the World and Abreast with the Times, and Making Big Strides on the Path of Sustainable Development\" via video conference. Ding Xuexiang, Liu He, Cai Qi, Wang Yi, He Lifeng and other officials attended the opening ceremony. President Xi announced that China will set up a Global Innovation and Knowledge Center for Sustainable Transport, as a contribution to global transport development.The second United Nations Global Sustainable transport Conference was held online and offline in Beijing from October 14 to 16. Representatives from 171 countries attended the opening ceremony. President Xi pointed out that transport is the artery of the economy and a bond between civilizations. Transport, in the forms of camel caravans and sailing boats on the ancient Silk Road, wave-breaking vessels in the Age of exploration, and the criss-cross transport networks in this modern age, has facilitated economic integration and people-to-people exchanges and turned the world into a close-knit global village. Now, major changes unseen in a century, compounded by a once-in-a-century pandemic, are posing serious challenges to the global efforts of growing the economy and bettering people's lives. We should follow the prevailing trend of world development, advance global transport cooperation, and write a new chapter featuring connectivity of infrastructure, unfettered flows of trade and investment, and interactions between civilizations. First, we need to uphold open interplay and enhance connectivity. We should pursue an open world economy, reject discriminatory or exclusive rules and systems, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. We should strengthen both hard connectivity of infrastructure and soft connectivity of institutions and rules, and develop four-dimensional connectivity of land, sea, air and the Internet.speaking at a UN meet, President Xi Jinping said that China will continue to advance the Belt and road cooperation, strengthen infrastructure connectivity, and develop a green silk road and a digital silk road.Staying Connected with the World and Abreast with the Times, and Making Big Strides on the Path of Sustainable Development President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech via video link at the opening ceremony of the Second UN Global Sustainable Transport Conference, Oct 14, 2021 54 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 Second, we need to uphold common development and promote fairness and inclusiveness. Only when countries develop together can there be true development; only when countries prosper together can there be true prosperity. Uneven development must be addressed before broader prospects for humanity's common development could be brought about. We should leverage the enabling role of transport and increase related input in poor regions, so that local economies and people's lives could improve as a result of better roads. We should enhance North-south and south-south cooperation and scale up support for developing transport infrastructure in the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, so as to achieve common prosperity. third, we need to uphold an innovation- driven approach and create more drivers for development. More should be done to develop smart transport and smart logistics and promote deep integration of new technologies like big data, the Internet, artificial intelligence and blockchain with the transport sector, to ensure easier movement of people and smoother flow of goods. Fourth, we need to uphold ecological conservation as a priority and pursue green and low-carbon development. the only durable way to achieve sustainable development is to establish an economic system for green and low-carbon development and promote green transition in all respects of economic and social development. More efforts are needed to foster a green and low-carbon way of transport, step up green infrastructural development, promote new energy, smart, digital and light-weight transport equipment, and encourage and advocate green travel, to make transport and travel more environment-friendly and low-carbon. Fifth, we need to uphold multilateralism and improve global governance. We should follow the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and mobilize resources from across the globe to meet global challenges and promote global development. We should uphold the authority and status of the United Nations and, in the context of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, advance cooperation in such areas as poverty reduction, health, transport and logistics, and infrastructure development. I hope more will join the Initiative. Xi Jinping pointed out that since the founding of New China, generation after generation of the Chinese people have worked in the spirit of opening roads through mountains and putting bridges over rivers, and turned China into a country with vast transport infrastructure. mega transport projects like the hong Kong- Zhuhai-macao bridge and beijing Daxing International Airport have been completed and put into operation. Transport has become a frontier in China's modernization drive. Convinced that transport should come first, we have built the world's largest high-speed railway network, expressway network and world-class port clusters. We have opened air and sea routes that reach all parts of the world. President Xi stressed that China will continue to hold high the banner of true multilateralism, and stay connected with the world and abreast with the times. This way, we will contribute more to global development while pursuing our own development. China will not change course in its pursuit of a new system of open economy of higher standards, and China will not waver in its resolve to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. China's door of opening-up will only open wider, and will never be closed. China will continue to advance high- quality Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen infrastructure connectivity with other countries, and develop a green Silk Road and a digital Silk Road at a faster pace. President Xi stressed that let us stick together on the promising path of connectivity and mutual benefit, jointly build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.We should pursue an open world economy, reject discriminatory or exclusive rules and systems, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 | 55 From trumping up and calling COVID-19 the so-called \"Wuhan Virus\" to smear China last year, to abruptly withdrawing from the World Health Organization, the US has tried to politicize the pandemic, stigmatize the virus, and use origins-tracing as a tool. It even turns a blind eye to the hard work of scientists by resorting to using the intelligence services to conduct origins-tracing. the Us intelligence community has recently compiled a so-called report on the origins of COVID-19. It is a mendacious report made up for political purposes, and has no scientific basis or credibility. Origins-tracing is a serious scientific issue. relying on the intelligence community for it is not scientific. The US is actually trying to shift responsibility for its botched pandemic response and aims at achieving the political purpose of discrediting and suppressing other countries. We urge the US to stop politicisation and return to the track of science-based origins study in the interest of the lives and health of its own people and that of people around the world. for origins-tracing, we should figure out some basic questions: first, why should we conduct origins-tracing? from the black Death in the middle Ages, the flu pandemic at the beginning of the last century, to AIDS that still plagues mankind, viruses have brought huge disasters to mankind again and again. Origins-tracing are aimed at preventing future pandemics and providing a reference in order to avoid recurrence of tragedies. Second, THE Covid-19 virus has repeatedly mutated while the pandemic keeps rising and falling worldwide. at this critical moment-when all people are fighting the virus-a certain country is wantonly spreading a \"political virus\" in an attempt to politicize and stigmatize the origins-tracing. such virulent and destructive \"political virus\" must be eradicated in time, to stop it from harming the world, says Chinese ambassador sun Weidong Uphold Science-Based Origins-Tracing, Oppose 'Political Virus' 56 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 who should conduct origins-tracing? It is a scientific issue. We should let science be science and let professionals do their job, instead of trusting it with several politicians, intelligence community or \"conspiracy theorists\". The US, on the basis of \"presumption of guilt\", has absurdly ordered its intelligence community to give out investigation conclusions in limited time. It makes no sense. In sharp contrast, nearly 80 countries have recently expressed support for the WhO-China joint study report and opposed politicising origins-tracing by sending letters to WhO director-general, and issuing statements or diplomatic notes. Over 300 political parties, social organisations and think tanks from 100-plus countries and regions in the world submitted a joint statement to the WHO secretariat, calling on the WhO to conduct the study on COVID-19 origins-tracing objectively and fairly, firmly opposing the [politicization] of origins-tracing. third, how should we conduct origins- tracing? More and more reports have pointed to separate outbreaks in multiple places in the world in the latter half of 2019, and these cases show that COVID-19 seems to have multiple origins and emerged in different localities. Accordingly, origins-tracing should be conducted in various places and countries around the world with a global perspective. At least five states in the Us alone had COVID-19 infections before the first officially reported confirmed case. In July 2019, respiratory diseases of unknown cause happened in Virginia, and a large-scale e-cigarette or Vaping Use- Associated Lung Injury (eVALI) broke out in Wisconsin. In October 2019, American military athletes attended the World Military Games in Wuhan, and the data concerning the sick athletes has never been released. The team and lab of epidemiologist Ralph S. Baric has been engaged in coronavirus research for a long time, with extremely mature capability in synthesizing and modifying coronavirus. The US has been refusing to respond to the international community's reasonable doubts on the Fort Detrick biolab and the over 200 overseas bases for biological experiments, trying to cover up the truth and avoid being held responsible. The onus is on the US to give the world an answer. China has always been participating in the international origins-tracing cooperation with an open attitude. China has taken the lead in cooperating with the WhO on origins-tracing. It has twice invited WhO experts for origins-tracing joint studies, and has made tremendous efforts to this end. The experts went to all the places they wanted to go, met all the people they wanted to meet. the WhO-China joint study report made a scientific conclusion that \"a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely\", and made important recommendations such as \"searching for possible early cases on a global scale\". China's position on global origins-tracing is consistent and clear-cut: first, we stick to the fact that origins-tracing is a matter of science, and we oppose the politicisation of this matter and slandering and attacking other countries. Second, the findings and recommendations of the WhO- China joint study report must be respected and implemented by all parties, and serve as the basis to conduct future works. Third, China has all along supported and will continue to take part in science-based origins-tracing efforts. What China opposes is politicizing origins-tracing, or origins-tracing that goes against the World Health Assembly resolution and disregards the joint study report. fourth, origins-tracing should act on the WHA resolution, conduct effective cooperation on the basis that the views of member states are fully respected through comprehensive consultation. COVID-19 virus jeopardizes human lives, \"political virus\" endangers human conscience and international solidarity. to this regard, origins-tracing needs cooperation rather than discrediting, truth rather than lies, and a respect for science rather than political manipulation. China will continue to support and participate in international origins-tracing cooperation in the spirit of openness, transparency, science and cooperation, and contribute its part to humanity's final victory over COVID-19 and the establishment of a global community of health for all. this article was first published on september 2 in The WEEK magazine.

In the past 70 years, under the leadership of the CPC, people from various ethnic groups in Xizang have worked together and strived with one heart to create a strong sense of community among the Chinese nation, bringing earthshaking changes of historic importance to its situation, and creating another miracle of \"a historic leap of thousands of years\" in development. Today's Xizang has become an epitome of the success of China's leapfrog development, a vivid portrayal of the progress in China's democracy and human rights, and an important window for China's opening-up and cooperation with the world. It has realized the goal of a happy and moderately prosperous life for all this year as scheduled.

The extraordinary achievements made in Xizang are a splendid chapter in the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and important evidence of China's specific modernization path.

Zha liyou, Chinese Consul General in Kolkata; Dear friends from all walks of life in India, I am very glad to attend this online exchange meeting themed on \"Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land\". The Chinese people often say: \"One does not know how vast and beautiful China is until one visits Xinjiang.\" The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is China's largest provincial administrative region, where citizens of all 56 ethnic groups in China live in harmony, just like pomegranate seeds that stick together. I have visited Xinjiang many times. Once the name of this wonderful land is mentioned, the old city of Kashgar, the picturesque Kanas Lake, the gritty desert poplar forest, and image of hospitable people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will immediately come to my mind. At one time, terrorism cast a shadow over this region. since the 1990s, the \"three evil forces\", namely terrorism, extremism and separatism, especially the violent and terrorist forces represented by \"the East Turkistan Islamic Movement\" (ETIM), have organized and conducted thousands of violent terrorist attacks, causing deaths of a large number of innocent people as well as immeasurable property damage. To eradicate the threat of terrorism and its breeding ground, and to safeguard people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the Chinese government addresses both the symptoms and root causes, upholding the principle of fighting and preventing terrorism at the same time. We have taken firm stance against violence and terrorism in accordance with laws, meanwhile we promote law-based de-radicalization efforts to address the problem at its source. The measures have yielded remarkable achievements. There has been no violent terrorist cases for nearly 5 consecutive years in Xinjiang, and the region has restored security and social stability. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, Xinjiang sets the general goal of maintaining social stability and long-term peace, fully implements the Party's policies on governing Xinjiang in the new era and the spirit of the third central symposium on work related to Xinjiang, follows the guidance of governing Xinjiang in accordance with the law, maintaining stability in the region through ethnic unity, nourishing the cultures of Xinjiang, promoting prosperity among the local population, and developing Xinjiang from a long-term perspective. Xinjiang has seen rapid and sustained growth, social harmony and on october 26, the Chinese Embassy in india and the Government of Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region jointly held an online Exchange Meeting Themed on \"Xinjiang is a Wonderful Land.\" ambassador sun Weidong delivered a speech. The text is as follows: 62 | NeWs frOm ChINA | ChINA-INDIA reVIeW | september-OCtOber 2021 stability, continued improvement in standard of living and thriving culture. We can see beautiful scenes of peaceful and happy life with robust growth and strong vitality in development all through Xinjiang. however, some anti-China forces in the western countries keep fabricating sensational lies for their political purposes. Under the pretext of human rights and religion, they smear China of oppressing against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. They concoct false accusations like \"establishing concentration camps\", \"monitoring on a large scale\", \"suppressing traditional culture of ethnic minorities\" and try to slap Xinjiang with labels of \"genocide\" and \"forced labor\". Facts are not to be distorted. Achievements of Xinjiang's economic and social development as well as human rights are there for all to see: The Uyghur population has been doubled in the past 40 years, increasing from 5.55 million to 11.62 million ; Life expectancy rises from 30 to 72 years old in the past 60 years; local people are living increasingly rich lives, with an average annual GDP growth of 7.2% in recent years; they enjoy higher education, and the completion rate of nine- year compulsory education is now over 95%. Is it what the western countries call as \"genocide\"? Education and training in Xinjiang has succeeded to an enormous extent in eliminating the soil and conditions to religious extremism. The local people in Xinjiang have mastered vocational skills that help them start business to become rich. In Xinjiang, 70% of all cotton were harvested mechanically instead of manually in 2020. planters can order mechanical cotton- pickers through APPs, which is a true symbol of the Internet+ era in cotton harvest. Is it what the lie-producers call as \"forced labor\"? Look back at those countries who slam and smear others, they have a bad history on race, religion and human rights that recorded the horrific systemic ethnic cleansing and slaughter of native people. They launched military operations against Muslim countries under the pretext of counter-terrorism, and they did many unjust matters in the context of colonialism, racism, exporting unrest and interventionism. What they need to do is self-reflection. Is there any position for them to claim to be \"defender of human rights\" or \"instructors\" to lecture others? I'd like to reiterate that Xinjiang affairs are China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. The Chinese government is determined to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests. the so-called Xinjiang-related issues have nothing to do with human rights, ethnic groups or religions, but everything to do with fighting terrorism, separatism and extremism. The US and some other western countries take no regard of the voice of justice among 25 million Xinjiang residents, slandering \"lies of the century\" in total disregard of facts. Their real purpose is to mess up Xinjiang and impede China's development and progress. Lies are like virus that could only breed and spread in dark corners, which cannot survive under the sunshine of facts and truth. Justice will prevail. Rumors will not write off Xinjiang's comprehensive progress, and those attempts to disrupt Xinjiang's stability and prosperity are doomed to fail. China has successfully blazed the trail of human rights development with Chinese characteristics. We will run our own house well to ensure people's happiness, and we will unswervingly follow the right path leading to a bright future. All those ill-intentions by fabricating lies on Xinjiang will surely be in vain. The door to Xinjiang is always open. In 2019, domestic and foreign travelers made over 200 million trips to Xinjiang. The region has received 1,600-plus diplomats, journalists and representatives of religious groups from more than 100 countries and international organizations in recent years. Today, we are honored to invite mr. Jarulla hisamidin, Vice Governor of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to give a comprehensive introduction on economic and social development there, and Xinjiang representatives from different circles will share with us their views. Let's listen to the real stories. Moreover, China and India are both big developing countries. We have similar positions in combating terrorism. We have the common tasks and aspirations on economic and social development, as well as on improving people's livelihood. Seeing is believing. We welcome our Indian friends to visit Xinjiang after the COVID-19 pandemic, to talk to the local people there, to see for yourselves, and to get to know a truly beautiful picture of Xinjiang.
