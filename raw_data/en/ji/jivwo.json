Each chapter of the Resource Manual corresponds to the respective chapters in the NCERT textbooks. The chapters have been chunked by concept; these concepts have been linked to the NCERT Learning Outcomes; and an attempt has been made to delineate Learning Objectives for each concept. Every chapter has a set of assessment items, where two items have been provided as examples for each Learning Objective. Teachers can use these to assess if the learner has acquired the related concept. Needless to say, the items are illustrative examples to demonstrate how competency-based items can be prepared to measure Learning Objectives and Outcomes. The variety in item forms is suggestive of the ways in which a particular concept can be assessed to identify if the learner has attained different competencies. We trust and hope that teachers would be able to generate many more similar test items for use in practice. Your observations, insights and comments as you use this Resource Manual are welcome. Please encourage your students to voice their suggestions as well. These inputs would be helpful to improve this Manual as these are incorporated in the subsequent editions. All possible efforts have been made to remove technical errors and present the Manual in a form that the teachers would find it easy and comfortable to use. 1 Acknowledgements Patrons: Advisory and Creative Inputs Guidance and Support: Writing Team Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank', Minister of Education, Government of India Shri Sanjay Dhotre, Minister of State for Education, Government of India Ms. Anita Karwal, IAS, Secretary, Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education, Government of India Our gratitude to Ms. Anita Karwal, IAS, for her advisory and creative inputs for this Resource Manual during her tenure as Chairperson, Central Board of Secondary Education.

The TERM has equal number of corresponding chapters as NCERT Textbooks with listing of concepts, Learning Outcomes developed by NCERT and Learning Objectives. Competency based test items for each corresponding Learning Objective and sample activities for enrichment have been provided. Learning Objectives: Each chapter begins has a Learning Objectives table. The table lists the concept covered in the chapter. Learning Objectives are broken down competencies that a learner would have acquired by the end of the chapter. They are a combination of skills and what the learner would use this skill for. For example, the first Learning Objective in the table below relates to the skill of analysis and the students will use this competency to identify ingredients in different food items. Teachers can use these specific Learning Objectives to identify if a student has acquired the associated skills and understands how that skill can be used. Content Area/ Concepts: The important concepts and sub-concepts covered in a particular chapter are listed in the first section. Most often, they follow a logical order and present a sequence in which these are likely to be covered while teaching. In case, your teaching strategy is different and presents them in a different order, you need not worry. Teach the way, you consider the best. You only need to ensure their understanding and the attainment of desired Learning Objectives. 4 Learning Outcomes (NCERT): NCERT Learning Outcomes are in each chapter along with delineated Learning Objectives. As shown below, each Learning Objective is mapped to NCERT Learning Outcomes and helps teachers to easily identify the larger outcome that a child must be able to demonstrate at the end of the class/chapter. As the NCERT LOs are generic, they may relate to many content areas / concepts together. However in the mapped table, they have been reproduced ad verbatim for easy identification. Test items: For each Learning Objective, at least two competency-based test items have been provided. Although, the items in this resource manual are multiple choice questions, which assess developed competencies of a child rather than only knowledge, it must be kept in mind that there can be different kinds of test items that can easily align with competency-based education. Teachers can use these items to assess if a child has achieved a particular learning objective and can take necessary supportive actions. Teachers are also encouraged to form similar questions which assess skills of students. 5 Suggested Teacher Resources At the end of each chapter, certain activities have been suggested which can be carried out by the teachers with learners to explain a concept. These are only samples and teachers can use, adapt, as well as, create activities that align to a given concept. 6 Table of Contents 1.MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS ................................................................................................................................. 7 2.

Hari was harvesting potatoes when the devastating earthquake struck on 25th April 2015. He rushed back to find his house razed to the ground with his parents buried under the debris. His parents were rescued but Hari started displaying symptoms of Post-traumatic stress disorder. \"I kept hearing my son's voice as if he was calling for help,\" recalls Hari. As well as experiencing hallucinations, his behaviour became irrational, convinced he was going to lose his piece of land he would hide his ownership papers. He took to drinking alcohol and roamed aimlessly without sharing any whereabouts to his family living in a temporary shelter. His wife, teenaged son and daughter watched helplessly as he kept living a nightmare. Hari was referred to a CBM-supported emergency mental health project. After a monthly session with a psychiatrist, subsidised medication and regular home visits from a counsellor he began to recover from the trauma and is working on a construction site. This support has also helped Hari realise that he is not alone and has nothing to be ashamed of: \"I now know that there are many other people who are mentally affected due to the impact of the earthquake. I am also able to speak in social gatherings, allowing me to share my feelings.\" The ignorance, fear, misunderstanding and prejudice that surround mental illness deepen the severity of the illness as individuals withdraw further from the world around them. Due to the stigma associated with mental illness, a lack of awareness, and limited access to professional help, only 10-12% of these sufferers will seek help. Activity 2 222 Reflection question 1.

Beyond the classroom Which type of irrigation technique is prevalent in your native place? Why? Material required 3 Pots Procedure 1. First, segregate your household waste into dry and wet in your kitchen. Leftovers of food, fruit peels, and tea bags are wet waste whereas paper, plastic and packaging area dry waste. 2. Secondly, put both these wastes in two different containers in the kitchen. When the wet waste container is full, put its contents into the first compost pot. 3. Then add dry leaves of the same quantity as the waste and semi-composted material, buttermilk or cow dung to start with the decomposition process. 4. Turn the pile around every other day. Keep the pile at the right level of dampness. If it is too wet, add dry leaves and stir and if it is too dry add water and stir. 5. Once it is full, leave the pot open for 30-45 days for the composition to happen. Then move the semi-composted matter into a larger container or bin. 6.
