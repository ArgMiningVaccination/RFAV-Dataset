Much of the initial funding and planning for the University was undertaken by Ira Allen who is honored as UVM's founder. The University of Vermont was the first college or universi\u00ad ty in the country to have it plainly declared in its charter that the \"rules, regulations, and by-laws shall not tend to give preference to any religious sect or denomination what\u00ad soever\" \u2014 a clear assertion of Vermont's commitment to equality and enlightment. Nine more years passed before, in 1800, the University was finally set in motion with a president-professor and a hand\u00ad ful of students. UVM was founded in a day when U.S. colleges and univer\u00ad sities existed primarily to educate men for the professions, expecially for the ministry. Yet, in studying University history, Professor Emeritus Betty Bandel discovered that \"this small institution located in a frontier community of New England became a pioneer in the kind of practical edu\u00ad cation which later became the basis for the establishment of the Land Grant universities \u2014 those institutions which made it possible for the sons and daughters of average citizens to aspire to a college education.\" For example, she noted that the University is believed to be the first non- military institution to have offered engineering courses. The University pioneered in yet another area of society, that of giving women equal status with men in higher edu\u00ad cation. In 1871, the University defied custom and admitted two women as students and four years later was the first in\u00ad stitution in the country to admit women to full membership in the scholarly society, Phi Beta Kappa. Tucked in the northwest corner of the Ira Allen Chapel grounds is a memorial to a late nineteenth century graduate of this University, philosopher John Dewey, whose ideas about practical education are still debated with passionate vigor. The first building was subscribed by citizens of Burlington and when fire destroyed that edifice in 1824, its successor, for which General Lafayette laid the cornerstone, was again made possible by the citizens of Burlington. That building, the Old Mill, was only the first in a long line to be made possible by private philanthropy. The list includes all but one of the buildings on University Row: Ira Allen Chapel, Billings, Williams, Old Mill, and the Royall Tyler Theatre. Morrill Hall, the first UVM building to be provided by State funding, did not come until 1907. Nearly all state universities function as departments of government, and the faculty and staff are state employees. In Vermont, the University is an \"instrumentality\" of the State and its Board of Trustees balances both the public and private sectors. The Board is composed of 25 members: nine self-perpetuating, nine elected by the State Legislature, three appointed by the Governor, and two members of the student body. The President of the University and the Gov\u00ad ernor of the State serve as ex officio members of the Board. From the beginning, the University has relied on both public and private funding. Today, the University's appro\u00ad priation from the State of Vermont is about 16 percent of the total operating budget of $128 million. The largest single share (about 33 percent) is obtained from student tui\u00ad tion. Grants and contracts account for about 20 percent of the budget and the remainder comes from alumni and other private philanthropy, endowment, sales, services, and aux\u00ad iliary enterprises. During 1983-84, 7,724 students were enrolled in the eight undergraduate colleges and schools \u2014 the Colleges of Agri\u00ad culture, Arts and Sciences, Education and Social Services, and Engineering and Mathematics, and the Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Business Administration, Natural Resources, and Nursing \u2014 and 1,054 were enrolled in the Graduate College and 370 in the College of Medicine. The campus of the University of Vermont is located in Bur\u00ad lington, the State's largest city. Within a greater Burlington area of 100,000 people, the city with its population of 38,000 enjoys magnificent views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains to the west and Vermont's Green Mountains to the east. Burlington is located approx\u00ad imately 200 miles northwest of Boston, 300 miles north of New York City, and 100 miles south of Montreal. THE UNIVERSITY MISSION Combining the heritage of a private university with that of a land-grant institution, the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College embraces a broad range of in\u00ad structional and research programs in the liberal disciplines and in the professions, and, as well, focuses a significant portion of its resources on serving the practical concerns of the citizens of the state. The blend of these characteristics is reflected in the student body, drawn from Vermont and throughout the nation. The University is at once a local and a national resource and, because of its moderate size, is ac\u00ad curately characterized as a comprehensive university with the teaching environment of a college. The University of Vermont is dedicated to the advance\u00ad ment, transmission, and application of knowledge through teaching, research and scholarly pursuits, and public ser\u00ad vice. Its faculty and students participate in enhancing the understanding of self and of environment. Exposed to the range of human achievement, stimulated by a spirit of in\u00ad quiry and intellectual rigor, faculty and students are enabled to develop and extend their knowledge. The curricula of the undergraduate, graduate, and profes\u00ad sional programs provide a balance between response to changing societal needs and the preservation and enhance\u00ad ment of the foundations of liberal education. The Universi\u00ad ty offers a rich environment for research, scholarship, and creative work in many realms of human inquiry, sharing the excitement and fruits of investigation and creation with students and society. Through a variety of research, exten\u00ad sion, continuing education, and other programs, the Uni\u00ad versity provides assistance, in its special partnership with the state, in the solution of human, social, technological, 4 | INTRODUCTION environmental, and educational problems of the citizens of Vermont. Supporting the mission of the University are the services and academic programs described in this catalogue and, in addition, the following: THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES In the Bailey/Howe Library, the main unit of the University libraries, are located the services and collections relating to the humanities, social sciences, and many of the sciences. This library holds the largest book and map collection in Vermont, and maintains a representative collection of ma\u00ad jor periodicals, scholarly journals, indexes, and abstracting services. It is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications. The Special Collections Depart\u00ad ment includes the Wilbur Collection of Vermontiana, rare books, literary and historical manuscripts, and the papers of many individuals associated with the state and the federal government. A separate Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Cook Physical Science Building. Collections in medicine and the health sciences are located in the Dana Medical Library. The University Archives in the Waterman Building contain the permanent, offical records of the University. THE GRADUATE COLLEGE The mission of the Graduate College is to serve the needs of college graduates who desire a broader and more thorough knowledge of scholarship and research in their chosen fields. The College offers 55 programs leading to the Master's degree, and 16 programs leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. For detailed information regarding graduate programs, degree requirements, and Graduate College regulations and procedures, refer to the Graduate College Catalogue, available from the Graduate Admis\u00ad sions Office, 332 Waterman Building. Persons applying to and enrolled in graduate programs are expcted to be familiar with the general regulations of the Graduate College and with the specific degree requirements in their chosen fields of study. Questions pertaining to mat\u00ad ters other than admission to graduate programs may be directed to the Graduate College Dean's Office, 335 Waterman. VERMONT ETV Vermont ETV is the public television network owned and operated by the University of Vermont, serving the state. With studios and offices on the Fort Ethan Allen campus, the network provides an instructional service to schools, college courses for_credit, programs for children out-of- school, and a broad spectrum of Eastern Education Net\u00ad work and Public Broadcasting Service programs. Locally produced programs address the concerns and issues of Vermonters. Programs are broadcast over WETK-TV, channel 33, Bur\u00ad lington; Rutland; WVTA, channel 41, Windsor; and on channels 74, 76, 79 at Manchester, Wilmington, and Bennington. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SERVICE Extension Service agents in every Vermont county simplify and quickly spread the knowledge of UVM's resources and research directly to Vermonters so latest findings can be put to work. This \"grassroots\" approach which reaches nearly all Ver\u00ad mont residents has triggered rapid advances in agriculture, community and natural resources, youth development, and home economics. MORGAN HORSE FARM The Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont, has been a shrine for Morgan horse lovers for more than a century. The Morgan breed dates back to 1789 when the first small but powerful stallion was born to a mare owned by school teacher Justin Morgan. The Morgan Farm was established in 1878 by Joseph Battell of Middlebury who compiled the first volume of the Morgan Horse Registry and constructed the farm land\u00ad mark, an ornate Victorian barn with mansard roof. In 1907, Battell deeded the farm to the U.S. Government, which in 1951 turned the farm over to the University of Vermont. The farm has become a laboratory for UVM students and the focal point for Morgan Horse lovers around the world. The farm continues to host thousands of visitors annually. A versatile, highly intelligent horse, the Morgan is Ver\u00ad mont's State Animal. The breeding program at the Morgan Farm has produced numerous blue ribbon winners at the National Morgan Horse Show.

COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS The College Board will administer a series of scholastic ap\u00ad titude and achievement tests during 1984-85. Complete in\u00ad formation may be obtained from the College Board, P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, or College Board, Box 1025, Berkeley, California 94701. Examination results from the American College Testing program may be substituted. The College Board Achievement Tests in mathematics and the sciences are recommended in all cases where these sub\u00ad jects are to be continued in the student's curriculum. The purpose of recommending these Achievement Tests is for placement only as scores are used in advising students regarding their selection of courses. ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS The University welcomes Advanced Placement (AP) Ex\u00ad aminations in all areas under the College Board. Credit is granted for grades of 3, 4, and 5 (a grade of 2 in Mathema\u00ad tics BC). No college grade is assigned when AP credit is granted. In\u00ad stead, credit is recorded on the student's permanent academic record for specific University courses. No fee, beyond that charged by the College Board, is assessed for such college credit. Appropriateness and applicability of the Advanced Placement Examination credit is determined by the dean/director of the college/school in which the stu\u00ad dent is subsequently a candidate for a degree.

NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL STUDENT PROGRAM The University of Vermont is currently an active partici\u00ad pant with the Universities of Connecticut, Maine, Massa\u00ad chusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, and with Lowell University, Southeastern Massachusetts University, and the public four-year and two-year colleges and technical institutes in a program of regional cooperation aimed at increasing educational opportunities for qualified young men and women of the New England states. Under the program, New England residents are given tuition privileges in certain specialized curricula which are not of\u00ad fered by public institutions in their home state. New England students enrolled in regional student programs at the University of Vermont who are not residents of Ver\u00ad mont are charged 125 percent of the University's in-state tuition. A brochure detailing these specialized curricula has been prepared by the New England Board of Higher Educa\u00ad tion and is available through the Board, 45 Temple Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, (617) 357-9620. Under the New England Regional Student Program, the University of Vermont offers the following undergraduate programs for the 1984-85 academic year: REGIONAL PROGRAMS Offered By The University of Vermont To Students From Canadian Area Studies CT, MA, NH, RI Dairy Technology ME, MA, NH, RI Dietetics NH Greek CT, ME, RI Latin RI Russian ME, NH Russian/Eastern European Area Studies ME, NH, RI INTERVIEWS AND VISITS Students are encouraged to visit the campus to form their own first-hand impressions about the University. Prospec\u00ad tive students may schedule an appointment with a current UVM student or a staff member on most weekdays during the academic year in order to gain information about the academic and non-academic aspects of undergraduate life. Plans should be made as early as possible since interview appointments may be filled quickly. An overnight visit with a student can usually be arranged during the academic year. Overnight visits are scheduled Monday through Thursday so that the prospective student may attend class the next day. At least two weeks' notice is normally required so that student hosts may make appro\u00ad priate preparations. On many Saturday mornings while the University is in ses\u00ad sion, group information sessions will be held on campus for interested students and parents. Students should write or call the Admissions Office, (802) 656-3370, for additional information about the group meetings, overnight visits, or individual appointments.

All inter\u00ad national students attending UVM on non-immigrant stu\u00ad dent visas are charged out-of-state tuition rates. If a student is admitted to the University of Vermont, an 1-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for an F-l visa) will be prepared by the Advisor in the Office of International Stu\u00ad dents. Before the 1-20 form is mailed, the student will be re\u00ad quired to show proof of adequate funding in the form of a bank statement or an official letter from a sponsoring insti\u00ad tution or organization. International students interested in graduate studies at the University of Vermont should write directly to the Grad\u00ad uate College Admissions Office, Waterman Building, Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont. FOREIGN STUDENT SERVICES An Advisor to Interna\u00ad tional Students and Overseas Programs is available full- time to provide counseling and assistance to international students and faculty on personal and academic problems, and on matters relating to immigration and social and cul\u00ad tural adjustment. In a special orientation prior to the begin\u00ad ning of the fall semester, the Office of International Students provides new international students with an intro\u00ad duction to the University and Burlington community. An active campus International Club provides an opportunity for international students to contribute to campus life and to make American friends outside the classroom. TRANSFERRING TO THE UNIVERSITY The University of Vermont considers a student a transfer applicant for purposes of admission if, after graduation from high school, one or more courses at the post-secon\u00ad dary level are attempted. Students interested in transferring to the University may apply for admission to the fall or spring semester. Applications and supporting materials for mid-year admission should be filed by December 1. Appli\u00ad cations for fall transfer should be complete by April 1, ex\u00ad cept for those students applying to the Physical Therapy or the four-year Professional Nursing program. These students have a February 1 completion date. Transfer can\u00ad didates should see that official SAT scores and official transcripts of all their high school and college records are sent to the Admissions Office by the appropriate deadline. A transfer applicant may not disregard the record of any previous education received at another institution. Transfer students are expected to have fulfilled the re\u00ad quirements for freshman applicants as mentioned above, as well as additional requirements necessary for the chosen major. A student who transfers to the University from another accredited college or university may be given pro\u00ad visional credit for all courses satisfactorily completed, pro\u00ad vided that s imilar courses are counted toward graduation at the University of Vermont. Transfer credit is not allowed for work passed with grade \"C-\" or less unless a more ad\u00ad vanced course in the same subject has been passed with a grade of \"C\" or higher at the institution from which the stu\u00ad dent transfers. Please note: Grades do not transfer. The quality point average of transfer students is computed on the work taken at the University of Vermont only. More in\u00ad formation about credit transfer may be found in the General Information section of this catalogue. Any credit is provisional, pending satisfactory completion of a semester's work at the University. The provisional transfer credits are fully granted if the student is in good standing at the end of the first semester. The determination of how transferred courses listed on the Evaluation of Transfer Credit form fit a specific degree pro\u00ad gram rests with the academic dean/director of the college/ school in which the transfer student subsequently becomes a candidate for a degree. STUDENT EXCHANGE: NEW ENGLAND STATE UNIVERSITIES The six New England land-grant universities (Universities of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut) participate in an exchange pro\u00ad gram to enable students at the sub-degree level to take ad\u00ad vantage of a course or combination of courses not available at the home institution. In order to participate in the pro\u00ad gram, state university students must: 1. Identify a course or combination of courses which is related to their area of academic interest and which is not available on the hdme campus. 2. Receive permission from the appropriate university exchange authorities at both the sending and receiving institutions. 3. Meet minimum eligibility requirements which include the following: In general, students must be in good standing and have at least a 2.50 grade-point average; must be degree candidates; and must be at least first semester sophomores (application may be made as early as the second semester of the freshman year). There is no upper limit in terms of class standing on participa\u00ad tion. Exchanges may not exceed a total period of two academic semesters, but these need not be taken consecutively. Sum\u00ad mer sessions are not considered part of the exchange pro\u00ad gram. Course work approved by the student's host institu\u00ad tion and completed satisfactorily is fully transferable to the home institution. Transferability of grades and inclusion in grade-point averages are subject to home institutional policy. The student will pay normal tuition and required fees to the home institution and room and board (where applicable) to the host institution. Students on financial aid must contact their home institution's financial aid office to determine eligibility for continued scholarship assistance. Participation in the exchange program will not affect a stu\u00ad dent's residence status either at the home or host institution, nor does participation improve or prejudice possibilities for transfer. ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY | 11 For information, contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 349 Waterman Building, University of Vermont. UNIVERSITY RESIDENCY REGULATIONS The Vermont Legislature has established a lower rate of tui\u00ad tion for students who are Vermont residents. Such a policy has as its objective the attempt to more evenly distribute the cost of operating and supporting the University of Vermont between Vermont residents whose taxes have previously supported the University and non-residents who have not done so. The Legislature has stated that enrollment at an institution for higher learning or presence within the state for purposes of attending an institution of higher learning shall not con\u00ad stitute residence for tuition purposes. IN-STATE STATUS REGULATIONS (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, December 14, 1974; amended June 13,1981) The following requirements must be met by a student prior to being granted resident status for the purpose of admis\u00ad sion, tuition, and other University charges: 1. The applicant shall be domiciled in Vermont, said domicile to be continuous for one year prior to the com\u00ad mencement of the semester next following the date of application. Changes in residency status shall become effective for the semester following the date of applica\u00ad tion. There shall be one date designated each year for the commencement of each semester and the summer term. A semester shall commence on the day classes begin for that semester. The summer term shall com\u00ad mence on the day classes begin for the summer term. 2. Domicile shall mean a person's true, fixed and permanent home, to which he/she intends to return when absent. A residence established for the purpose of attending an educational institution or qualifying for resident status for tuition purposes shall not of itself constitute domicile. Domicile shall not be determined by the applicant's marital status. 3. The applicant must demonstrate such attachment to the community as would be typical of a permanent resident of his/her age and education. 4. Receipt of financial support from the applicant's family will create a rebuttable presumption that the applicant's domicile is with his/her family. A student who is the child of divorced parents, where the non-custodial parent or joint custodial parent has been domiciled in Vermont for 12 consecutive months immediately prior to application and such a parent has contributed in ex\u00ad cess of 50 percent of said child's support during at least that period, may be granted In-State Status. Certified copies of such parents' IRS returns may be required. 5. An applicant becoming a student at an institution of higher learning in Vermont within one year of first moving to the state shall have created a rebuttable presumption of residence in Vermont for the purpose of attending an educational institution. 6. Eligibility to enroll as a resident student in another state shall create a rebuttable presumption against eligibility to be enrolled at the University of Vermont as a \"Ver\u00ad mont Resident.\" 7. A student enrolling at the University of Vermont shall be classified by the Residency Officer (designated by the President), as a resident or a non-resident. The decision by the Residency Officer shall be based upon informa\u00ad tion furnished by the student and other relevant infor\u00ad mation. The Residency Officer is authorized to require such written documents, affidavits, verifications, or other evidence as he/she deems necessary. 8. The burden of proof in all cases rests upon the student claiming to be a Vermont resident and shall be met upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence. 9. The decision of the Residency Officer on the classification of a student as a resident or non-resident, may be appealed in writing to the Residency Appellate Officer, whose decision shall be final. ORIENTATION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS Following acceptance, students must submit by the ap\u00ad propriate deadline dates an acceptance fee and advanced tuition deposit, a statement of medical history, and a physical examination record. New students are also re\u00ad quired to come to the campus for an orientation program; schedules and dates of these meetings are mailed prior to enrollment. The Orientation Program takes place in June and September for the fall semester and in January for the spring term. During the two-day program students register for courses, meet informally with faculty and other students, and learn about available student services. Student Expenses and Financial Aid The student expenses outlined in the following para\u00ad graphs are anticipated charges for the academic year 1984-85. Changing costs may require adjustment of these charges before the beginning of the fall semester. UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FEES APPLICATION FEE A non-refundable application fee of $25 is charged each applicant for admission to a University degree program. ACCEPTANCE FEE AND ADVANCED TUITION PAYMENT All new undergraduate applicants who have been ac\u00ad cepted by the University are required to pay $175 in order to reserve a place in the next enrolling, class. Students admitted for the 1985-86 academic year will be required to pay $225. Regular freshman students accepted for the fall semester must pay the deposit by May 1. Most transfer students admitted for the fall must pay the deposit within two weeks of the offer of admission. Stu\u00ad dents admitted in January for the spring semester may have less than two weeks in which to pay the deposit. Of the total amount, $50 is for initial advising, selection of courses, and personal orientation to the campus, a re\u00ad quirement for all incoming undergraduate degree stu\u00ad dents. The remaining $125 will be applied to the initial semester's tuition bill. If a newly admitted student who has paid the required deposit subsequently chooses not to attend the Universi\u00ad ty, the student will receive a $100 refund if the University is notified in writing prior to the beginning of the semes\u00ad ter for which the student was admitted. If the University is notified after the beginning of the semester, the entire deposit is forfeited.

For residents in the Hamilton Cooperative, the room charge is $216 less than the cost of the room charge indicated above, depending on the type of occupancy. The minimum University meal plan is $1,004 yearly, one half to be paid each semester. The minimum meal plan is not designed to meet all the needs of most students. Rather, the plan allows individual students to purchase whatever additional amount of food service beyond the minimum level they feel is necessary to meet their own nutritional and consumptive needs. The University's food service system includes not only dining halls but also the various campus snack bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. Questions regarding food services should be directed to the SAGA Food Service Office, Robinson Hall, Redstone Campus. A written request is required of any student wishing to cancel a housing agreement. Any student cancelling a hous\u00ad ing agreement after June 15 but before September 7, 1984, will be assessed a $100 penalty. Unless specifically author\u00ad ized by the Office of Residential Life, no room cancellations will be honored after the beginning of the fall semester. INTER-RESIDENCE ASSOCIATION (IRA) FEE A $10 per year ($5 per semester) fee is charged to each resi\u00ad dent to be used for activities within the residence hall system.

HEALTH FEE The health fee of $114 per year is assessed per semester. It is mandatory for students enrolled in 12 or more credit hours and optional for other students. Payment of the health fee entitles the student to most of the services available at the Student Health Center without additional cost. An optional Summer Health Fee is available to students remaining in the area during the s ummer months. Students also have the option of purchasing a Student Acci\u00ad dent and Sickness Insurance Policy through the University. This policy provides coverage for many services not includ\u00ad ed in the health fee as well as hospitalization benefits. To participate in this program, the student must pay a modest annual premium plus the health fee for the two semesters of the academic year. Students not covered by the health in\u00ad surance policy of a parent, guardian, or spouse are strongly encouraged to purchase the Student Accident and Sickness Insurance Policy. STUDENT ACTIVITIES FEE Undergraduate degree students enrolled in four or more credit hours are charged a fee of $37 per year ($18.50 per semester). This fee is allocated by the Student Association toward the support of student organizations and student ac\u00ad tivities.

Students enrolled in art courses should expect to incur a lab or materials cost roughly equivalent to the cost of books in other courses. In certain courses, instructional materials are purchased in bulk by the department and costs are prorated among students at a far lower rate than if they were pur\u00ad chased individually. OPTIONAL FEES Locker-Towel Fee All students enrolled in physical education activity courses and others who wish to have an assigned locker must pay a $4 locker-towel fee each year or any portion thereof. This fee provides a locker and a clean towel after each use of the gymnasium facility.

Fees for Courses in Music Performance Study Private lessons are approximately one-half hour in length with 15 sessions being given each semester. $132 per credit hour will be charged each student for such a course. This is in addition to the tuition charged and will be billed sepa\u00ad rately during the course of the semester. Any student enrolled in excess of 18 credit hours will be charged only the $132 per credit hour for private lessons and not for additional tuition charges for the Music Per\u00ad formance Study course.

The dean/director may recommend to the registrar an exception be made to this refund policy only in extenuating circumstances. In no case will a refund be made after the first day of classes of the following semester. FINANCIAL AID Many worthy and deserving students are unable to meet college expenses and for them the University provides, so far as its resources permit, aid in the form of scholarships, loans, and employment. On the basis of the financial aid application and the financial information accompanying it, applicants will be considered for all aid programs for which they are eligible. Aid is most often awarded in combina\u00ad tions or \"packages\" of the various types of aid. Almost all awards include some loan or work-study for which the stu\u00ad dent states a preference on the admissions application (if the student is a freshman or transfer student) and on the finan\u00ad cial aid application (if the student is a continuing student). ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL AID To be eligible to apply for financial aid, a student must be a U.S. citizen or in the U.S. for other than a temporary pur\u00ad pose with intent to become a permanent resident. A student must also be enrolled at least half-time (six credits) in a degree program. Audited courses cannot be considered as part of the credits in determining financial aid eligibility. Students who believe they are unable to meet college ex\u00ad penses are urged to apply to the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in the form of grants, loans, and employment. . FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCEDURES Incoming freshmen and transfer students who wish to apply for aid may do so by: (1) indicating their intention to apply for financial aid on the University of Vermont Application for Undergraduate Admission form, and (2) submitting the Family Financial Statement (FFS) directly to the American College Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa (preferred), or the Financial Aid Form (FAF) to the College Scholarship Service in Princeton, New Jersey. These forms may be ob\u00ad tained from local high schools or by request to the Office of Financial Aid, 330 Waterman Building, University of Ver\u00ad mont, Burlington, Vermont 05405. Preference is given to those students who have complete applications on file by March 1. Applications received after that date will be pro\u00ad cessed in chronological order according to the date re\u00ad ceived, subject to the availability of funds. Continuing upperclass students who wish to apply for aid may do so by submitting the Family Financial Statement (FFS) directly to the American College Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa. FFS forms are available early in the spring semester from the Office of Financial Aid. Preference is given to those students who have complete applications on file by May 1. Applications received after that date will be processed in chronological order according to the date received, subject to the availability of funds. ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUESTED TO APPLY to the Pell Grant Program (check appropriate section of the FFS or It - V * STUDENT EXPENSES AND FINANCIAL AID [ 17 FAF) and their state agency (for Vermonters: Vermont Stu\u00ad dent Assistance Corporation (VSAC), P.O. Box 2000, Champlain Mill, Winooski, Vermont 05404.) FACTORS FOR DETERMINING FINANCIAL NEED Financial aid funds are limited. Accordingly, all assistance offered by the Office of Financial Aid is based on a calculated determination of financial need which considers the following factors: 1. STUDENT BUDGET, comprised of tuition, required fees, room and board, books, supplies, and moderate personal expenses. 2. EXPECTED PARENTAL SHARE of educational cost as determined by the financial information provided by parents and/or students on the financial aid application form (FFS or FAF). 3. STUDENT SELF-HELP, usually from earnings, private loans, or savings. 4. ASSISTANCE RECEIVED FROM OTHER SOURCES, such as private scholarships/grants, state agency awards, etc. IMPACT OF ENROLLMENT STATUS CHANGE For students receiving financial aid, change in student status or credit hour load may result in revision or loss of that financial aid, depending on the regulations of the par\u00ad ticular aid programs involved; and, except when aid pro\u00ad gram regulations specify otherwise, any such change which reduces the student's University charges will usually result in a reduction of the financial aid award. The reduction is prorated among all aid sources making up the award ac\u00ad cording to the applicable regulations. Such reduction of aid will usually require immediate repayment of the aid so reduced. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS Financial aid recipients must meet the University guidelines in regard to maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Students who do not maintain satisfactory academic pro\u00adgress could lose their eligibility for financial aid. Specific information regarding the above can be obtained from the Office of Financial Aid. 1984-85 IN-STATE AND OUT-OF-STATE EDUCATIONAL COSTS Standard student budgets for the 1984-85 academic year are shown below. Actual costs for subsequent years may be higher if tuition, fees, and/or housing costs increase. SINGLE In-State Out-of-State Tuition $2,550 (Rounded) $14,690 $18,900 *For dependent children, the budget is increased by $1,200 for the first child, $1,000 for the second child, and $800 for each additional child. **Average cost reflects additional allowance for meals above mini\u00ad mum plan and is used for both on-and off-campus students. The University of Vermont awards financial aid without consideration of sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, or physical/mental handicap. & ^-v ;mp:x ft* vl *1 4 / i? if Student Life SERVICES Students go through a period of rapid persona] growth while on the college campus. In addition to developing new academic skills, they are challenged to pursue new ideas, evaluate their values systems, change existing attitudes, and investigate new life styles. They explore future career op\u00ad tions and learn social and interpersonal skills. The broad focus of the Division of Student Affairs at the University of Vermont is to provide support services to students during this time of intense persona] development and intellectual growth, in addition to playing a leadership role in developing experiences, policies, and programs to provide learning and leadership opportunities for students in concert with the formal instructional mission of the in\u00ad stitution. To accomplish this mission, the student life areas are divid\u00ad ed into various functional departments and programs. Each of these provides or coordinates support services and edu\u00ad cational experiences to meet student needs. The offices of the Dean of Students are located in the Nicholson Building at 41 South Prospect Street. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER The Counseling and Testing Center provides information, skills training, and encouragement for more effective living, personal growth, and improving academic capability. Serv\u00ad ices for simple or complex and severe concerns include in\u00ad dividual, personal, social, and career counseling on a voluntary and confidential basis. Groups and workshops are designed to meet student requests in areas such as life planning, career development, stress management, confi\u00ad dence building, improving learning effectiveness, weight control, and other topics related to the growth of the whole person. Counselors and psychologists coordinate closely with Student Health Center staff to assist students in main\u00ad taining emotional and physical well-being. The Center also coordinates various national testing programs and provides the opportunity to take, at cost, career interest tests and personality tests in conjunction with individual counseling. The professional staff of psychologists and counselors offers services on a no-fee basis to UVM students carrying five or more credits and on a limited basis to faculty and staff through the Employee Assistance Program. The Center is accredited by the In\u00ad ternational Association of Counseling Services. Disabled Student Services The Office of Specialized Student Services works closely with students having physical or learning disabilities, securing solutions to problems encountered in their university experience. This includes providing assistance with necessary tasks (e.g. readers, interpreters, mobility aides, notetakers); academic, vocational, and personal counseling to encourage optimal independence and eventual employability; course accommodation; and a support system and structure where students can begin to effect changes on campus, community, and personal issues. Prospective students with disabilities may contact the Coordinator of Specialized Student Services housed in the Counseling and Testing Center for assistance in making decisions and assessing their needs for future schooling. In\u00ad coming students should contact the OSS in planning for housing, classroom, and mobility needs. Please write for brochures describing the services at UVM for students with disabilities. The Counseling and Testing Center is located at 146 South Williams Street; (802) 656-3340; TTY (802) 656-3865 (Tele\u00ad communications for the deaf); TTY (802) 656-2625 (UVM Information Office). PROJECT STAY STAY is a learning skills development center. Since its beginning in the fall of 1976, STAY has assisted hundreds of students in maximizing their academic potential, thus in\u00ad creasing their chances of retention. The staff at STAY pro\u00ad vides developmental instruction in writing, reading, and study skills; supplemental tutoring; and academic, career, and personal counseling. The staff also helps students solve the various administrative problems they might experience such as locating possible sources of financial aid or under\u00ad standing University accounting or course registration procedures. Students are selected to participate in the program because of their financial need, their status as first generation col\u00ad lege students, or because they are physically or learning dis\u00ad abled. A student must meet one of the above criteria in addition to having a personal and/or academic need in order to be eligible for STAY. Because the intention of the program is to provide personal and comprehensive serv\u00ad ices, only a limited number of students are selected each year. Students interested in STAY should contact the office as close to the beginning of the semester as possible. Applica\u00ad tions may be obtained by calling (802) 656-4075 or stopping by 41 South Prospect Street. Campus-Wide Tutoring Program As part of Project STAY, the campus-wide tutoring pro\u00ad gram allows all UVM students to obtain tutoring at reason\u00ad able rates. To receive the names and rates of potential tutors, students need only call or come by the STAY of\u00ad fices. Any student wishing to become a tutor may request an application at the same address. CENTER FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT The Center for Career Development provides all students with comprehensive assistance in exploring and implement\u00ad ing their career objectives. This function consists of two major efforts. The first is to provide direct assistance to students in clarifying career objectives based on their own skills, interests, needs, and abilities. The primary emphasis is through self-awareness, occupational awareness, skill development, and finally entry into the career areas which are complementary to their desired lifestyles. This process 20 | STUDENT LIFE is accomplished through one-to-one counseling and/or small group workshops. Along with providing career coun\u00ad seling, the office has developed an active Cooperative Education Program which enables students to fully inte\u00ad grate their academic and career goals. This program is inte\u00ad grated with the academic units in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration as well as other offices in Student Affairs. Students will also find the information contained in the Career Resource Library helpful in developing their career goals. The center's library contains literature on various fields, occupational outlooks, salary surveys which are up\u00ad dated four times per year, government opportunities at all levels, as well as a variety of literature describing current career opportunities in both large and small corporations in the private sector. The library contains two complete guides to all graduate programs in the country and a variety of graduate school catalogues from other universities. This information is expanding and being updated continuously. After helping students to develop some tentative goals, the office can assist in their attempts to implement these goals. The office has a very active on-campus recruiting program which brings local and national employer representatives to campus for employment interviews. All part-time and sum\u00ad mer employment opportunities are posted and made avail\u00ad able to students attempting to offset a portion of their educational expenses or gain experience in a field of their in\u00ad terest. The staff will provide help in developing an effective resume, conducting employment interviews, developing a credential file, and assist in drafting an overall employment search program.

A comprehensive pro\u00ad gram has been developed to meet the needs of college students and includes medical, gynecological, and orthope\u00ad dic clinics; physical therapy and sports therapy programs; a wellness promotion center; and laboratory and radiology services. Most of these services are covered by the health fee (see page 14). Students entering the University are re\u00ad quired to furnish the Health Center with a complete medical history which includes immunization dates. A physical ex\u00ad am is not required. Because the College of Medicine is located on campus, the Burlington area has a large and sophisticated medical com\u00ad munity of which the Health Center is a part. Students re\u00ad quiring consultations are referred to specialists in the area. When necessary, hospitalization is usually arranged at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont which is a tertiary level teaching hospital located on the edge of the main campus.

To further this end, the Student Activities Office assists students in developing educational and cultural programs and in managing the operations of their organizations. In addition, the Division of Student Affairs offers an increasingly comprehensive leadership program that encourages not only individual growth, but organizational development. Student Association, the primary student governing organization, assumes responsibility for voicing student concerns and interests in the political activities of the University community. It also recognizes and funds ap\u00ad proximately 80 student organizations. They are a varied set, including the student newspaper, The Vermont Cynic; the yearbook, The Ariel; WRUV, the student-operated radio station; UVM Rescue Squad; and the Student Legal Service; in addition to a host of political, religious, service, program, honorary, and recreational groups. A complete listing of student organizations and religious groups can be found in The Cat's Tale: A Student's Guide to the Universi\u00ad ty of Vermont. The Greek system is an integral part of campus life. Fifteen fraternities and six sororities, representing both national and local organizations, maintain active communities at UVM. Extracurricular life focuses on Billings Student Center, which houses a number of student organizations and pro\u00ad vides space for meetings, lectures, films, and other programs. The Student Activities Office, the Student Association Of\u00ad fice, and various other student organizations are located in Billings Center. INTER-RESIDENCE ASSOCIATION (IRA) The Inter-Residence Association is a government which represents the students living in University residence halls. The government, consisting of an executive board, legisla\u00ad tive council, and judicial board, provides leadership for residence hall students, representing their interests to other constituencies within the University community.

HONORARY AND RECOGNITION SOCIETIES Honorary and recognition societies exist on the University of Vermont campus to recognize student contributions to the University community and student leadership in cam\u00ad pus life. Local honorary societies include Boulder Society, which acknowledges outstanding senior men; and T.O.W.E.R.R., which acknowledges outstanding senior women. National honorary societies represented on the University campus follow. The Phi Beta Kappa Society established the Vermont Alpha Chapter at the University in 1848, and initiates are chosen primarily on the basis of high scholastic standing with em\u00ad phasis on a broad distribution of liberal studies. A detailed statement of the criteria used is available from the chapter president. The local chapter was the first in Phi Beta Kappa to initiate women into membership. Mortar Board is a national society for senior women and men. Although membership in Mortar Board comes as a high honor for a University of Vermont student in recogni\u00ad tion of outstanding service, scholarship, and leadership, it is also a challenge for continued sound and honest scholar\u00ad ship, and for unselfish service in the best interests of the col\u00ad lege campus. f Si-rtlJ -u -H < O STUDENT LIFE | 23 The Society of the Sigma Xi, established at the University in 1945, initiates those who have proven their ability to do research in one of the sciences, including students who have a high scholastic standing.

ATHLETICS AND RECREATIONAL SPORTS The University encourages and supports a variety of sports at various participatory levels. All full-time undergraduate students are eligible to try out for varsity sports and en\u00ad couraged to participate in all levels of sports activities. High student interest in athletic activities has placed a great de\u00ad mand on facilities. To help meet this demand, a new dance studio, gymnastics/combative sports, and multipurpose building was completed in early 1982. The athletic policies of the University are developed by the Athletic Council, an advisory board to the President of the University, composed of faculty, students, and alumni. Athletic relations are maintained with NCAA, ECAC, and NEC AC. Opportunities exist in the traditional seasonal sports for all students who are eligible to compete. In the fall, the programs offered to male students include soccer, cross\u00ad country running, golf, and tennis.

Members of the LDU attend debate tournaments throughout the nation, each year engaging in over 250 debates at more than a dozen tournaments. Competition of this caliber teaches the student the skills of efficient research, rigorous thought, and effective communication. The program is designed to develop the abilities of both the experienced debater and the beginner. Outstanding per\u00ad formers receive recognition in the form of annual awards and by election to Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, the national forensic honor society. MUSIC Opportunities for participation and appreciation are pro\u00ad vided for students with strong musical interests. The University Mixed Choir and Choral Union are open by audition to students seeking participation in choral ensembles.

HOUSING Any student may apply to live in University residence halls but priority is given to full-time undergraduate students. All freshman students, except those living at home (in Chit\u00ad tenden County) and commuting, or those living with their spouses, must live in University housing. Housing is guaranteed for all freshmen who meet appropriate dead\u00ad lines. Housing is not guaranteed for upper-class students and is determined by a lottery held in the spring of each year. Upper-class students who are actives or pledges of a fraternity or a sorority may register for University resi\u00ad dence hall housing or chapter housing. STUDENT LIFE | 25 On-campus housing is generally available to transfer stu\u00ad dents entering UVM for the fall or spring semester, though it is not guaranteed. In recent years, many transfer students have been offered housing for both fall and spring semes\u00ad ters. However, transfer students are urged to apply for housing with the Office of Residential Life as soon as they are accepted as a student by returning the wait list card they receive with their acceptance letter. RESIDENCE HALLS A residence hall is more than a place to sleep, store one's belongings, and study. It is a place where students can take advantage of the various opportunities and experiences surrounding them. A diversity of residence halls and pro\u00ad grams are offered. There are freshman halls, upper-class halls, coed halls, single sex halls, an environmental hall, and the Living and Learning Center (additional information on the Living and Learning Center is on page 40). Each residence hall is under the guidance and direction of a Hall Advisor who is assisted by specially selected undergraduate Resident Assistants who encourage the development of in\u00ad tellectual, social, and cultural programs and assist the residents in their growth toward maturity and responsible self-direction. Students in the residence halls are members of their residence hall student government which represents student opinion and provides educational and social pro\u00ad grams for its constituents. Contracts for room and board are binding for the college year unless cancelled for due cause with the approval of the Office of Residential Life. In August, each new student will receive notification of a housing assignment and the date of the opening of the residence halls. Rooms may not be oc\u00ad cupied until the date specified. Students are expected to leave the residence halls not later than 24 hours after their last examination at the close of each semester.

OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING University students eligible to live off campus may utilize the facilities at the Office of Residential Life in locating housing in the greater Burlington area. This office provides a free listing service by which community landlords list apartments, houses, and rooms that are available for students. Students who have a living situation to share may list for a roommate. Persons who need a roommate situation may also list their availability. The listing is available at the Office of Residential Life be\u00ad tween the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. It is impractical to give individual listings information by phone or mail. General Information This section offers a summary of regulations and procedures. In addition to the information presented here, the rights and responsibilities of students and Univer\u00ad sity policy on these and other matters are explained in detail in The Cat's Tale: A Student's Guide to the University of Vermont. Students are responsible for knowledge and ob\u00ad servance of these regulations and procedures. REGISTRATION Students in attendance must preregister for the next semester at the designated time. Unless excused in advance by the dean/director of the college/school concerned, stu\u00ad dents who do not preregister will be considered as dropped and may apply for readmission after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester. Written approval of the student's dean/director is required to preregister for more than 18 credit hours. ACADEMIC ADVISING Effective academic advising involves an established rapport between student and teacher. Accordingly, each new stu\u00ad dent is assigned to a faculty advisor upon admission to the University. The student remains under the guidance of this advisor until a major has been selected, usually during the sophomore year at which time a departmental advisor will be assigned. Students with questions about academic plan\u00ad ning should consult their advisor throughout the year and especially during the preregistration period. To change academic advisors, students should contact the dean/direc\u00ad tor of their college/school. Each academic unit within the University maintains its own system for advising students. ADVISING RESOURCES In addition to an assigned faculty advisor, there are a varie\u00ad ty of other advising resources offices available to University undergraduates. The Academic Advising Center: assists students who are undecided about their academic plans. The Center also helps students with complaints and grievances about course instructions, scheduling, and other academically-related problems. Pre-Health Advisor: assists undergraduate students with the admissions requirements for dental and medical school. A library of resource materials is maintained which in\u00ad cludes literature on alternative health careers, school catalogues, and premedical education journals. Pre-Law Advising: the UVM Pre-Law Committee assists students by providing meetings and panel discussions re\u00ad garding career options in law. Advising also includes specific information on applying to law schools. A current collection of law school catalogues is maintained for in\u00ad terested students.

After the first week of classes, the instructor may refuse to allow the add if certain material may not be made up (e.g. laboratories) and the loss of this work would seriously affect the quality of educa\u00ad tional experience gained by the student in the course. In any case, faculty are not required to give make-up ex\u00ad ams, papers, or quizzes. 2. No drops will be allowed after the third week except in cases where the student is enrolled by administrative er\u00ad ror and has not attended the course. The disposition of such cases is handled entirely by the Registrar's Office. 3. From the end of the third week to the end of the ninth week of classes, students may withdraw from courses. Students who wish to withdraw fill out the course with\u00ad drawal form, consult with their advisor, and submit the form to the instructor. The instructor records an evalua\u00ad tion of the student's work. The evaluation options are shown below: WP: Withdraw passing WF: Withdraw failing The instructor sends one copy to the Registrar to be recorded on the permanent academic record. Students give a copy to their dean/director for information pur\u00ad poses. The instructor also records the withdrawal grade (WP or WF) on the final grade sheet which is sent to the Registrar. 28 | GENERAL INFORMATION 4. Between the end of the ninth week and the last day of classes, students may withdraw from one or more courses only by demonstrating to their college or school studies committee, through a written petitionary pro\u00ad cess, that they are unable to continue in the course(s) due to circumstances beyond their control. Such peti\u00ad tion must contain conclusive evidence, properly docu\u00ad mented, of the illness or other situation which prevents completion of the course(s). Acceptable reasons do not include dissatisfaction with performance or expected grade, with the course or instructor, or desire to change major or program. If the petition is approved, a grade(s) of \"WP\" or \"WF\" will be assigned by the instructor(s) and recorded on the student's permanent record. If the petition is denied, the instructor(s) will assign a final grade (\"A\"\u2014\"F\") in accordance with the same criteria applied to all other students in the course(s). Students wishing to withdraw for medical reasons must contact their dean/director. 5. No withdrawals are permitted after the last day of classes. 6. The grade of WP will not enter into the grade-point average. The grade of WF will enter the GPA as an F. 7. The grade of \"W\" no longer is used so it is deleted from the set of available options. PASS/NO PASS PASS/NO PASS course enrollments were approved by the University Senate for implementation in September 1968 to encourage students to take elective courses they might otherwise avoid for fear of a low grade, to encourage work for internal rather than external goals, and to stimulate in\u00ad tellectual exploration. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program students, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (three courses for two-year students; or as many courses as they have semesters remaining for future transfer students) dur\u00ad ing their undergraduate career on a pass/no pass basis, beginning in the sophomore year (second semester of the first year for two-year students). These courses may not in\u00ad clude any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. Only free electives (without condition) may be taken as pass/no pass. This op\u00ad tion may not be used for electives within the distribution re\u00ad quirements of a college or department. Students who have enrolled in ineligible distribution elective courses on a pass/ no pass basis prior to September 1, 1974, shall not be penalized. Students must complete all work normally re\u00ad quired in these courses and they will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instructor will NOT be informed of the student's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"D\u2014\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASS. Neither \"P\" nor \"NP\" grades will affect the student's grade-point average. The grade submitted by the instructor will not become available to the student nor to any third party. SECOND, that the following addition was approved by the Faculty Senate in January 1974: Physical education (activi\u00ad ty) courses, whether taken to fulfill a requirement or as electives, will be available to students on a pass/no pass basis and shall not be counted as a part of the six standard courses described abo ve. Procedure: 1. A PASS/NO PASS Request Form is obtained from the Registrar's Office and the academic advisor is consulted. 2. The advisor's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate is ob\u00ad tained. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as pass/no pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college/school dean or director. 3. The request to be placed on pass/no pass status is submitted to the Registrar's Office during the first week of the semester. Requests to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Note: Non-degree students may not take courses on pass/no pass basis. AUDITING COURSES With the approval of the dean/director and the instructor concerned, a regularly enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission require\u00ad ments, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor and no grade credit is given for the work. Tuition is charged at the applic\u00ad able rate. Under no circumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow credit for courses audited. The approval of the Director of Continuing Education is necessary for auditing courses in the Evening Division or Summer Session. GUIDELINES FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES 1. Independent study is an educational experience (taken for credit) which occurs outside the traditional \"class\u00ad room/laboratory\" setting. The project is faculty super\u00ad vised and tailored to fit the interests of a specific student. 2. Independent study will be under the direct supervision of a faculty member having expertise in the area of in\u00ad vestigation and consequently the project will be done in the department which is primarily responsible for the field of study in question. 3. Prior to enrollment in independent study, students must obtain the approval of their advisor, faculty sponsor, and the faculty sponsor's department chairperson. 4. Independent study may be taken for variable credit. The amount of credit to be granted should be mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty sponsor at the time of enrollment. 5. When a project is to cover more than one term, the XC (extended course), rather than incomplete, should be used for the first term of work. 6. All departments in which a student may obtain \"service learning\" or \"field experience\" credit should list this op\u00ad tion in their description of courses. If a department of\u00ad fers the opportunity for both \"Readings and Research\" and \"Field Experience (service learning, internships, etc.),\" these offerings should have different course numbers, titles, and catalogue descriptions. In the rare instance where one cannot differentiate between these two offerings, they may be listed under the same name. 7. All academic units offering independent study courses will be responsible for administering such work. Specific guidelines which define the responsibilities of both faculty and student in terms of administering the independent study project are given in Part 8. Alterna\u00ad tive guidelines which incorporate the basic points in Part 8 are acceptable. GENERAL INFORMATION [ 29 8. Procedure: a. The success of an independent study project is often related to the amount of advanced planning expend\u00ad ed on the project. Consequently, planning for the project should, whenever possible, be initiated in the semester before the course is taken. b. By the end of the add/drop period, students will be required to submit to their faculty sponsor a specific plan which must include, but not be limited to, the following: i.The project title. ii.A statement of justification, indicating why independent study is being selected and the reason for undertaking the project, its im\u00ad portance, and how it relates to other work done by the student. iii.A clear and complete statement of project objectives. iv.A concise statement of the plans and methods to be used in order to accomplish each objective. c. During the first full week of classes the student and the faculty sponsor will meet and prepare a docu\u00ad ment which includes the following: i. A schedule of dates when the student and faculty member will meet and discuss progress, in\u00ad cluding a time plan indicating when various parts of the work are projected for completion. ii.A list of those ways in which docu\u00ad mentation of work can be shown. iii.A plan for evaluation, which will include the specific work to be submitted for evaluation on the project, and a statement of criteria to be used for evaluation, will also be included. d. It is the responsibility of the faculty supervisor to ensure that all the provisions in numbers 7 and 8 above have been satisfactorily accomplished. Copies of all documents and schedules mentioned in 8.b and 8.c must be filed with the department chairperson by the end of the add/drop period. Completed projects, along with faculty evaluations, should be retained in the faculty member's files, to be available for review, if necessary, by appropriate school and col\u00ad lege committees. REPEATED COURSES Students who repeat a course lose any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade remains on the permanent academic record and is included in computing cumulative grade-point average. CLASS ATTENDANCE Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself/herself and toward the University. The primary penalty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the respon\u00ad sibility of the student to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. Any student who fails to attend a scheduled course by the third instructional day of a semester or the second sched\u00ad uled class session of a course, whichever comes later, without giving prior notification to the instructor, may be disenrolled. In such cases, the instructor shall notify the Registrar who will remove the student's name from the class list and the course from the student's schedule. Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused absence, may result in a failing grade for that particular work. Tardiness: A student not present at the beginning of an ex\u00ad ercise may be marked absent. Right of Appeal: Students who believe that they have been unfairly treated in regard to absences may appeal to their academic dean/director. FINAL EXAMINATIONS 1. The examination period at the end of each semester is set by the official University calendar. 2. Semester examinations shall be given only during the regular examination period except by permission of the dean/director of the college/school on request of the chairperson of the department. No examination shall be given during the last week (the last five in\u00ad structional days) of the semester except lab exams given in courses with specific lab sections. 3. The time and place of each final examination are determined by the Registrar and a schedule is cir\u00ad culated and posted. Any change in the scheduled time or place may be requested by the chairperson of the department concerned when conditions seem to war\u00ad rant such special arrangement. Decision on such re\u00ad quests rests with the Registrar. 4. In every course in which a final examination is given, every student shall take the examination unless ex\u00ad cused by the instructor. 5. Students having a conflict in their final examination schedule must notify the faculty concerned of such conflict not later than the close of business one week prior to the last day of classes for the semester in which the conflict arises. 6. Students who are absent from a final examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to their instructor within 24 hours. If the absence is due to any situation beyond the reasonable control of the student (e.g. illness or family tragedy), the instructor must provide the stu\u00ad dent with the opportunity to complete the course re\u00ad quirements. At the instructor's discretion, this may be an examination or some other suitable project. The in\u00ad structor may require evidence in support of the stu\u00ad dent's reason for absence. 7. If the absence is not reported as provided above, or is not excused by the instructor, the examination is regarded as failed. 8. No student shall be required to take three or more final examinations in one calendar day. 9. Unless a mutually agreeable alternative time can be reached by the student and the instructor, the sched\u00ad uled make-up will occur the next day after the regular\u00ad ly scheduled examination. These considerations are subject to the following constraints: all exams will be given in the final exam period and all conflicts must be resolved before the start of the final exam period. 10. Students will select which of the three examinations they wish to take at an alternative time. In cases where the instructors in all three sections feel it is impossible to give the examination at an alternative time, and all conflicts are in the same college or academic unit, the appropriate dean's office, in consultation with the faculty involved, will establish which of the three ex-30 | GENERAL INFORMATION animations will be taken as a make-up. If the unre\u00ad solved conflict involves more than one college, the deans of the units in question will resolve the matter. If agreement cannot be reached by the deans involved, then a person from the academic vice president's office will establish which of the three examinations will be taken as a make-up. 11. All final examination materials should be retained for at least one month after the final examination session in case any questions arise concerning grades and to afford students the opportunity to review their graded final examination papers if they wish to do so. GRADES Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. A+ Excellent 4.00 points per semester hour A Excellent 4.00 points per semester hour A- Excellent 3.67 points per semester hour B + Good 3.33 points per semester hour B Good 3.00 points per semester hour B- Good 2.67 points per semester hour C + Fair 2.33 points per semester hour C Fair 2.00 points per semester hour C- Fair 1.67 points per semester hour D + Poor 1.33 points per semester hour D Poor 1.00 points per semester hour D- Poor 0.67 points per semester hour F Failure 0.00 points per semester hour This system will start with grades received for courses initi\u00ad ated in the fall semester 1983. Grades received prior to the fall 1983 semester with \" + \" or \" \u2014\" will receive only those quality points shown on page 42 of the 1982-83 catalogue. Other grades are: AU Audit. Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to course work which is not completed due to circumstances beyond the stu\u00ad dent's control, e.g. illness, as documented by the Stu\u00ad dent Health Center; personal tragedy; academic, such as breakdown of computer or laboratory equipment, or unanticipated delay in receiving information from sources inside or outside the University. Incompletes can be awarded only with the permission of the stu\u00ad dent's college/school dean/director. The incomplete course requirement will be satisfied at the earliest possible date. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. In cases of laboratory assign\u00ad ments, the student must complete all work the first time that the laboratory experience is offered again. It will be the responsibility of each dean/director's office to determine through the Registrar whether any in\u00ad completes have been awarded without prior approval. It is the student's responsibility to learn from the dean/director's office whether the request has been approved, the date of completion, and, from the in\u00ad structor, the nature of all outstanding requirements. Procedure: 1. Medical. Students contact the appropriate dean/director's office to determine type of academic relief needed (i.e. incomplete, with\u00ad drawal). Students complete a Medical Action Re\u00ad quest and submit it to the Student Health Center. Students and faculty will receive confirmation of eligibility for medical action from the dean/ director's office. 2. Personal tragedy. Students contact the appropriate dean/director's office to discuss these matters. Confirmation of eligibility for incompletes will be provided to faculty by the dean/director. 3, Academic. Students contact the course instructor to request an incomplete grade. It is the instruc\u00ad tor's responsibility to confirm to the dean/director eligibility for incompletes on academic grounds. In all cases, the instructor will fill out and forward to the student's academic dean/director an incom\u00ad plete card which will describe the reason for the in\u00ad complete and will note the completion date to which the student and instructor have agreed. XC Extended Course. This grade is awarded at the end of the semester to a student who is enrolled in an identi\u00ad fied course, the nature of which makes it unreasonable or impossible for the student to complete the required work within the regular semester. NP Not Passed, not used in grade-point average computation. P Passed, not used in grade-point average computation. WP Withdrawn, passing, not used in grade-point average computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the computation of the grade-point average. M Missing. Grade not turned in by the instructor. In cases in which a student requests reconsideration of a grade for a course already taken, the grade change, if any, must be made by the instructor and approved by the stu\u00ad dent's dean/director by the end of the first month of the following semester unless an extension is granted by the stu\u00ad dent's dean/director. CLASS STANDING The designation of a student's class shall be determined by the number of credits completed. The divisions are as follows: Bachelor's degree: Credit Hours Freshman 0-29.9 Sophomore 30.0-59.9 90.0 and over Associate degree: Freshman 0-29.9 Senior 30.0 and over HOUR TESTS 1. One or more hour tests are usually given during a semester in each course. These are scheduled by the faculty member within the class periods assigned for the class. 2. In a course which has several sections meeting at different hours, a common test for all sections may be given only by arrangement with the Registrar. A schedule of such tests is made up at the beginning of the semester. Requests should be filed as early as possible. 3. Attendance at hour tests scheduled outside the normal meeting time of the class shall not have precedence over attendance at other scheduled activities or other important commitments of the students concerned. Faculty members must be prepared to give a make-up test for those unable to be present at the time set. 4. University academic responsibilities have priority GENERAL INFORMATION | 31 over other campus events. Attendance at (1) regularly scheduled classes have priority over specially sched\u00ad uled common hour examinations, (2) common hour examinations have priority over attendance at other activities. TRANSCRIPTS An official transcript is the reproduction of a complete, unabridged permanent academic record validated with the University seal, facsimile signature of the Registrar, and date of issue. A Key to Transcript is included which con\u00ad tains a full statement of pertinent definitions. A rank-in- class entry is made upon completion of degree re\u00ad quirements. Currently enrolled as well as former undergraduate and graduate students may obtain an official transcript of their permanent academic record by writing the Office of the Registrar, 363 Waterman Building. The charge is $2 for each transcript or $5 for same-day service. Please allow a minimum of one week for normal processing and three weeks following the end of a semester. Transcripts are not released when there is an indebtedness to the University. ACCESS TO RECORDS Students have the right to review any of their educational records maintained by the University. Students also have the right to have all educational records maintained in a confidential manner. In appropriate situations, students may choose to waive some or all of these protections, but such waivers must be clearly stated in writing. If a student feels an educational record to be misleading, or containing information which is inaccurate, a hearing may be sched\u00ad uled to seek appropriate modification. Requests for review of records should be made to the Registrar. NAME AND ADDRESS EXCLUSION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 grants to all University students the right not to have per\u00ad sonal information contained in the records of the University released to any individual, agency, or organization. UVM feels that the name, address, and telephone number of a stu\u00ad dent is such personal information and therefore will not release such address to persons requesting it if a student re\u00ad quests it not be released. Often parents, friends, or fellow students call the Universi\u00ad ty to find out the address or telephone number of such a student. Such information has in the past been generally available in the Student Directory. However, in the future the University will not release such information if re\u00ad quested. Students who do not wish to have name, address, and telephone number released should fill out a directory exclusion card at the Registrar's Office. UNIVERSITY HONORS The Bachelor's and Associate's degrees may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are dis\u00ad tinguished and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum lauds. Honors are determined in the following manner: Within the graduating class of each college or school, students in the top one percent will receive summa cum laude; the follow\u00ad ing three percent will receive magna cum laude; the next six percent will receive cum laude. The total number of honors awarded will not exceed ten percent of the graduating class of each school or college. Honors will be calculated on all grades received at this University. In order to be eligible for consideration, a stu\u00ad dent must have taken at least 60 hours (30 hours for two- year programs) at this university in which a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F has been awarded. DEAN'S LIST The deans/directors of the undergraduate colleges/schools publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full-time students who stood in the top 20 percent of each class of their college/school during the preceding semester. Full-time enrollment in this case shall be a minimum of 12 credit hours in courses in which grades of A,B,C,D, or F have been given. STUDENT LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY A leave of absence means that a student who is eligible for continued enrollment ceases to be enrolled while in good standing and is guaranteed readmission. This policy benefits both the student and the University in that it enables a student to plan for readmission to the University and allows the University, by having records on the ex\u00ad pected date of return of its students, to refine further the planning of the size of the student body. The following statements further define a leave of absence: 1. Upon application to the academic dean/director a student may be granted a leave of absence by that dean/director when that application merits the com\u00ad mitment of the University to insure the student's read- mission. 2. A leave must be granted for a finite period of time. 3. A leave normally may not exceed four semesters. 4. A leave normally may not be granted for the current semester after the day on which courses can be drop\u00ad ped without penalty. 5. A leave may not be granted to students currently on academic trial or disciplinary probation. 6. A leave is distinct from withdrawing for medical reasons and is not granted for medical reasons. 7. A leave does not guarantee housing upon the student's return. 8. A leave guarantees readmission to the student's college/school in the University if the student con\u00ad firms intent to return by the closing date for a normal readmission application (October 31 and March 31 preceding the appropriate semester). 9. While on a leave, an individual's student status is temporarily terminated. A leave of absence guaran\u00ad tees an individual's readmission only if the ap\u00ad propriate action is taken. 10. Financial aid awarded but not used prior to a leave will not be carried over. Reapplication for aid for the readmission period must be made according to normal Office of Financial Aid policies and procedures ap\u00ad plicable to that period. 11. A leave should be confirmed by the appropriate form signed by both the student and the dean/director of the college/school involved. JU. Ai \u2014 t J* .. -1 ^v-. GENERAL INFORMATION j 33 WITHDRAWAL Students who wish to withdraw from the University must first notify their academic dean/director in person or in writing. READMISSION Any degree students who have left the University for one semester or more must write to their dean's/director's office to request readmission. Students must apply for readmis- sion by October 31 or March 31 preceding the appropriate semester of return. LOW SCHOLARSHIP The information below describes the general University regulations for low scholarship standing. The Studies Com\u00ad mittee of each college/school may determine additional or supplementary requirements. Students with questions re\u00ad garding their academic standing should consult with their college/school dean/director. 1. \"On Trial\": a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. Students remain enrolled ac\u00ad cording to stated academic conditions of their col\u00ad lege/school. b. A student is placed \"on trial\" by the dean/director or the designated committee of the college/school con\u00ad cerned. Special academic conditions may be set in each case. Normally the period of \"trial\" status is one semester. c. The circumstances under which a student is placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1) Students who are readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enter \"on trial.\" (2) Generally students are placed \"on trial\" if in any semester they have failed half or more of the hours of their enrollment but have been permit\u00ad ted to continue in college/school. (3) Students whose records have been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsa\u00ad tisfactory in any semester may be placed \"on trial\" or continued \"on trial\" even though they do not come within the provisions of Section (2). d. Students who have earned fewer than 30 semester hours of credit and are \"on trial\" are barred from participation in all athletic and other student activities. 2. Separation: a. Students are dismissed from the University if they receive grades below passing in one-half or more of the semester hours of their enrollment in any semes\u00ad ter unless they are allowed to continue by action of the designated committee. b. Students who fail to meet the condition of their trial or whose record has been unsatisfactory and consist\u00ad ently below the graduation average may be dis\u00ad missed for low scholarship even though they do not come within the provision above. c. Students dismissed for low scholarship must address their application for readmission to the college/- school taking the action. d. Any students dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons must receive written approval from their previous academic dean/director (or the Dean of Students for disciplinary cases) before enrolling in any University course. INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS A student who is or has been a member of any college/ school of this University may transfer to another college/ school of the University only with the consent of the deans/directors of the two colleges/schools concerned. In the case of veterans receiving educational benefits through the Veterans Administration, the change must be brought to the attention of the advisor to veterans in the Center for Career Development where a Change of Program or Place of Training form #22-1995 must be completed and submit\u00ad ted for approval to the Veterans Administration. UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the col\u00ad leges/ schools and specific requirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective colleges/schools. In addition to the course requirements of the curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average sufficient to meet the minimum re\u00ad quirements for the co llege/school in which the student is of\u00ad ficially enrolled. Beginning with the class of 1984, the minimum grade-point average for graduation is 2.00. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 45 semester hours of credit (15 of the last 30 for two- year students) in residence at the University except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the University are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only upon decision of the dean/director or the appropriate facul\u00ad ty committee of the college or school in which the student is enrolled. To qualify for a second Bachelor's degree, the can\u00ad didate must have fulfilled all the requirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work, usually 30 hours, in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. PHYSICAL EDUCATION One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore year, is required of all under\u00ad graduate students in four-year programs. The two credits earned in activities classes will be included in the total number of hours required for graduation. Students may opt to take activities classes on a pass/no pass basis. (For fur\u00ad ther details, see the pass/no pass heading under General In\u00ad formation.) Medical examinations are required of all new students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of the Student Health Center. The physical education requirement for students pursuing two-year degree programs shall be one credit of course work earned in activities instruction. Students 25 years of age or older are exempt from physical education requirements. 34 | GENERAL INFORMATION All transfer students under the age of 25 will be required to fulfill the physical education requirement. UNIVERSITY RESPONSIBILITY Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equipment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is expected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precaution. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, the Univer\u00ad sity can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is provided by the Student Health Center. USE OF ENGLISH Correct English usage is demanded by all departments of the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatis\u00ad factory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spell\u00ad ing, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, regardless of content. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usage may be referred to the English Department for additional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English at the college level. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE The University expects each student to maintain high stan\u00ad dards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students, as responsible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the support of University regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as the President considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans/direc\u00ad tors and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt of academic credits, graduation, and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel a student's registration at any time on any grounds if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University policy on the above matters is explained in detail in The Cat's Tale: A Student's Guide to the University of Vermont. Each student is held responsible for knowledge and observance of these rules and regulations, including those concerned with academic honesty. UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT FOR GRADUATE CREDIT UVM senior undergraduates may enroll for graduate credit at UVM under the following circumstances: the course must be available for graduate credit; total enrollment including the graduate course must not exceed 12 credit hours in the semester in which the course is taken; the course must not be computed as part of the Bachelor's degree; permission to seek such graduate credit must be requested of the Graduate Dean in writing by the dean or director of the undergrad\u00ad uate college or school prior to enrollment. Such graduate credit is limited to six hours and is not available for transfer to another institution as graduate credit. It can be used only at UVM if the course is judged appropriate by the student's advisor for the particular graduate program. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION A degree student who wishes to do so may, under the following conditions, receive credit for a course by taking a special examination and paying the special examination fee charge of $25 per credit hour. The examination fee must be paid prior to taking the examination. A request for such an examination must be made in writing at least one month before the date of the examination, and it must be approved by the student's advisor, the chairper\u00ad son of the department in which the course is given, and the academic dean/director, in that sequence. The student must neither have audited, previously received a grade or mark, or have attempted a prior special examination in this course at the University of Vermont or at any other institution of higher education. The student may not take a special ex\u00ad amination in a course whose content is presupposed by other courses the student has already taken. In cases of uncertainty, the department chairperson shall decide whether it is appropriate for the student to take a special ex\u00ad amination for credit in a particular course. Upon passing the special examination, as determined by the examiner and the chairperson of the department in which the course is given, the student receives credit, but not a grade, for the course. Credit by examination forms are available in the Office of the Registrar, 360 Waterman Building. COLLEGE-LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) The University grants a maximum of six hours of credit for the following minimal total scores on the General Examina\u00ad tions: English Composition (600), Humanities (500), Mathematics (500), Natural Sciences (500), and Social Sciences-History (500). Each General Examination yields a total score reported on a scale that ranges from a low of 200 to a high of 800. Each General Examination, with the exception of English Composition, has two subscores, reported on a scale rang\u00ad ing from a low of 20 to a high of 80, which describe achieve\u00ad ment on the subdivisions of the test. Three semester hours of credit are granted for a subscore of 50 or higher. The minimum creditable score on CLEP Subject Examina\u00ad tions is the average score of students who earned a grade of \"B\" in a comparable college course. These scores fall be\u00ad tween 50 and 57 on a 20 - 80 range of scores. To learn the score required for credit in a specific examination, contact the Office of the Registrar, 360 Waterman Building. Credit granted for CLEP Examinations may be applied toward distribution requirements and to the total semester hours specified for a particular degree program when ap\u00ad proved by the dean/director of the college/school in which the student is subsequently a candidate for a degree. In\u00ad formation about CLEP and application forms are available at the Counseling and Testing Center, 146 South Williams Street. GENERAL INFORMATION | 35 CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE A veteran who has been accepted into a degree program may, upon presentation of DD Form 214 (Report of Trans\u00ad fer or Discharge), receive military studies credit for this ex\u00ad perience in those divisions of the University in which credit for Reserve Officers' Training Corps courses is allowed. Ex\u00ad emption from the physical education requirement is given for service of more than one year. The University accepts college level credit earned through the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Sup\u00ad port (DANTES) formerly the United States Armed Forces Institute (USAFI). DANTES maintains the educational record of the service men and women who have completed Subject Standardized Tests, CLEP examinations, and GED Tests.

Academic Options In addition to the areas of study detailed in the following sections of the catalogue, a number of curricular options are available which provide unique opportunities for UVM students. The Environmental Program Environmental Studies is a special University-wide undergraduate curricular option offering students several exciting academic programs. Directed by the En\u00ad vironmental Program in cooperation with several colleges and professional schools, this option is one of UVM's most distinctive academic programs \u2014 unique nationally in its breadth and interdisciplinary nature. The Environmental Program involves students and faculty from throughout the campus, as well as community profes\u00ad sionals, recognizing that study of the environment must draw upon all disciplines and professional fields. The ac\u00ad tivities of the Program include undergraduate education, research, and community service programs dedicated to the study of the cultural and natural environments essential to the quality of life on earth. While the Environmental Program attempts to serve a wide range of environmental interests, its primary focus is the in\u00ad dividual student. A Director and interdisciplinary faculty work closely with each student in planning an individual\u00ad ized program of studies which combines a broad, compre\u00ad hensive understanding of the environment together with depth in a specif ic discipline or profession. Program offices are located in The Bittersweet, where students are encouraged to visit with the faculty regarding their academic plans, to gain help with research or action projects, and to seek information about academic pro\u00ad grams, internships, and future careers. DEGREE PROGRAMS The Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Studies is awarded through the College of Agriculture, College of Education and Social Services, and the School of Natural Resources. The Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies is awarded through the College of Arts and Sciences. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Students must complete the distribution and credit-hour re\u00ad quirements of their college or school and one of the follow\u00ad ing major programs. Incoming students will be assigned an advisor in the Environmental Program who will assist in selecting a major program, usually during the sophomore year. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES CURRICULUM The curriculum in Environmental Studies offers students several alternatives leading to an i ndividualized program of studies: The Coordinate Major in Environmental Studies combines study of the environment with a traditional disciplinary major or professional field. The Major in En\u00ad vironmental Studies provides a unique academic program for the student seeking an individually-designed inter\u00ad disciplinary major, with opportunities for Honors Studies. Students entering the University may apply for admission to Environmental Studies through several of the undergrad\u00ad uate colleges and professional schools. Choice of the appro\u00ad priate college or school will depend on the individual's interests and educational objectives or, in the case of the Coordinate Major program, on the major or professional field to be coordinated with Environmental Studies. It is recommended that incoming students consult with the En- vironmenal Program before making application to the University. COORDINATE MAJOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES For the majority of students, this program offers the best combination of career opportunities and environmental in\u00ad terests. In addition to the Environmental Studies Core Pro\u00ad gram, students complete the departmental requirements of a related disciplinary or professional major in their college or school and an individualized program of studies and in\u00ad dependent work which strengthens the environmental aspects of the major.

Basically, students in cooperation with a faculty member initiate, plan, and conduct research and prepare a manuscript (or other appropriate report) on their work which is judged by the Honors Committee. Research projects may result from an undergraduate research elec\u00ad tive, a special topics course, or as a part of an advanced undergraduate course. No specific grade-point average is required and research may be done within or outside the College. Completed research, in a form appropriate to the research area, will be evaluated by the Honors Committee. Those of high quality will be chosen for College Honors. Students are recognized at College Honors Day and awards are add\u00ad ed to the transcript. PREPROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Students striving for admission to professional colleges, such as dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine, can meet the undergraduate requirements for these programs through enrollment in the College of Agriculture. Those in\u00ad terested in human medical sciences should enroll in biological sciences while individuals interested in veterinary medicine may enroll in either animal or biological sciences. Any student indicating a specific professional interest will be assigned a faculty advisor knowledgeable in that area. Competition for admission to professional schools is very keen and a superior academic record throughout an under\u00adgraduate program is necessary to receive consideration for admission. Due to this intense competition, all potential candidates are encouraged to also complete the require\u00ad ments in an area of secondary interest. Students applying to the College of Agriculture, and ex\u00ad pressing an interest in medicine or preveterinary medicine, should present evidence of high performance in high school level science and math courses, plus additional supporting documentation such as high SAT scores, strong letters of recommendation, and a motivational summary statement.

ANIMAL SCIENCES The Department of Animal Sciences offers two academic programs, one in Animal Sciences and the other in Dairy Foods. Each program has specialized options. Experienced faculty advisors work with each student to plan a curricu\u00ad lum that will be appropriate for the individual's career goals. Courses will be selected from a current UVM catalogue. A student must successfully pass a minimum of eight courses in the Department of Animal Sciences, in\u00ad cluding at least four of advanced standing and senior 46 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE In the junior/senior years, students who have maintained a good academic record are encouraged to participate in one of the many special problem/research courses. These pro\u00ad vide an opportunity to work in basic science research labor\u00ad atories of the Vermont Experiment Station or to develop applied skills such as milking at the dairy farm. Students should investigate a summer at the W. H. Miner Agricul\u00ad tural Research Institute or work experience through the Cooperative Education Program in the College of Agricul\u00ad ture. Opportunities abound for the unusual, exciting educa\u00ad tional experience. ANIMAL SCIENCES This program deals with a wide range of options from basic science to farm management. Although programs are highly individualized depending on the students' needs, there are four options offered in this major program: Dairy Production: The major production option relates to the feeding, breeding, and management of dairy cattle. Supporting courses are also offered in the production of livestock, pleasure horses, and poultry. This option in\u00ad cludes practical work experience opportunities in addition to formal classes in science and business. The graduate is prepared to own or manage a modern dairy farm as well as work in allied industry positions. Animal Agribusiness: An option that emphasizes business and prepares graduates for supervisory and management positions in industry related to animal sciences. Exciting educational experiences exist through the Cooperative Edu\u00ad cation Program. Career opportunities exist in the process\u00ad ing and sales of dairy, meat, and poultry products; feed and fertilizer companies; sales of pharmaceuticals; farm equip\u00ad ment and supply agencies; banking, advertising, and public relations. Students will be urged to seek a double major in Agricultural and Resource Economics, since a heavy con\u00ad centration of courses in that program will be required. Preprofessional Science: This is the option for students in\u00ad terested in the basic sciences. Opportunities exist for study in a modern laboratory as part of a research team. Students interested in veterinary or human medicine, graduate school in nutrition and physiology, academic positions, or research and development in industry all start here. Students will be provided with a strong basic science back\u00ad ground necessary for advanced study in addition to applied animal agriculture. General Studies in Animal Sciences: An opportunity to in\u00ad dividualize a program or a place to start for students in\u00ad terested in Animal Sciences but who have no specific career goals at this time. Some students desire double majors in diverse areas (French/Animal Science; Psychology/Animal Science; Business/Animal Science) which limits the time available in both. This flexible option provides the mechanism for such a program. Other students simply need a \"place to start\" and later transfer to one of our other op\u00ad tions. The core courses which all Animal Sciences majors must take are: Agricultural Orientation, Chemistry, Introduc\u00ad tory Animal Science, Fundamentals of Nutrition, Principles of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Statistics, Com\u00ad puter Science, Mathematics, and Senior Seminar. Each stu\u00ad dent must select elective courses to meet college require\u00ad ments in communications, social sciences, fine arts and humanities, and physical education. Additional specific courses for each option will be selected with the help of the student's academic advisor. Course programs are individu\u00ad alized to meet the needs of each student.

DAIRY FOODS Vermont has the only Dairy Foods pro\u00ad gram in New England. The program deals with many aspects involved in the handling, processing or manufactur\u00ad ing, quality management, research, marketing, and promo\u00ad tion of fluid milk and manufactured dairy products. Four options are offered in the Dairy Foods program: (1) dairy processing and quality management, (2) dairy pro\u00ad duction and foods, (3) preprofessional science, and (4) general. Graduates have many job opportunities in what\u00ad ever option they choose (many more jobs exist than qualified applicants) and are in demand by graduate col\u00ad leges throughout the United States. Faculty members in the program help seniors to get job interviews. A required core of 69 credit hours of courses that a student in any one of the four options must successfully pass is: Agricultural Orientation, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, English Composition, Fundamentals of Nutri\u00ad tion, Humanities/Arts, Introductory Animal Sciences, Mathematics, Physical Education, Public Speaking, Senior Seminar, Social Sciences, and all the Dairy Foods courses; i.e. Dairy Industry Managerial Training, Dairy Micro\u00ad biology, Dairy Testing and Quality Control, Fermented Dairy Foods, Introduction to Dairy Foods, Processing Fresh and Frozen Foods, and Sensory Evaluation of Dairy Foods. In consultation with their advisor, students must select at least an additional 53 credit hours of courses in whatever option is chosen. Faculty members in the program assist students to obtain summer employment. Examples of prospective employers in the Northeast are: Agri-Mark, Inc.; of Agriculture; West Lynn Creamery; and Wyeth International LTD.

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE This program is designed for students who want to major in the field of biology. It provides flexibility in developing a background in biological sciences. Students may fulfill their course requirements by selecting basic and applied courses from the several biologically-oriented departments (Ani\u00ad mal Sciences, Botany, Human Nutrition and Foods, Micro\u00ad biology and Biochemistry, Plant and Soil Science, Zoology, and others). Graduates of the program may continue their education in graduate school or professional schools or they may obtain employment in a variety of areas. Possible job opportuni\u00ad ties would include basic and applied research in educational institutions and governmental agencies, technical writing, employment with environmental consultants, and sales and merchandising positions requiring a scientific background. The following courses are required of all students in the Biological Science program following completion of the Biological Sciences Core: genetics (one semester), biochem\u00ad istry (one semester), physics (two-semester sequence), and statistics (one semester). In addition, all students must take five additional courses in basic or applied biology. These courses should be selected to include at least one course from the following areas: botany or applied plant science, zoology or applied animal science, evolution and diversity of life, ecology, and physiology or biochemistry. One or more of these courses should be at the 200 level and the others at the 100 level. These courses are selected in con\u00ad sultation with the advisor from the diverse offerings of the various colleges and departments. BOTANY Students in the Colleges of Agriculture or Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. Each undergraduate plans a program in consultation with a personal department advisor. The emphasis on flexibility permits a choice of electives when -i' I 'feji*?'- '*' * * %v J \u00bb'/*' 'a THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 49 planning for each individual's career. Cross-disciplinary study is encouraged as botany, a fundamental science, is the base upon which education, research, and careers in both applied and basic plant science is built. Many students aim specifically for careers that do not require formal education beyond the Bachelor's degree, e.g. preparation for numerous positions in: agriculture, business, education, administration, government, industry, medicine, research, or their own businesses. Many other students prepare them\u00ad selves for graduate education and professional careers re\u00ad quiring advanced degrees, e.g. careers in botany, biology, medicine, dentistry, agriculture, biochemistry, or environ\u00ad mental sciences. In either case, close attention is given to in\u00ad creasing the student's choices after college. Students are also encouraged in their senior year to enrich their botanical experience through individualized, original research and study with faculty members. Areas of interest include: anatomy, cell botany, cytology, ecology, phycology, physiology, plant development, plant pathology, and taxonomy. Required courses: Math. 22; or Math. 21 and Statistics; or Math. 19, 20 and Statistics, Physics 11,12 or preferably 15, 16; Chemistry 42 or preferably 141, 142; Biology 1, 2; Botany 101 or 132,104,107, 108, and 109 or 160; two addi\u00ad tional semester courses in Botany, at least one at the 200 level. Botany 4 and Zoology 9 may be substitued for Biology 1,2. Six hours of modern foreign language are strongly recom\u00ad mended. Students may petition the department to substi\u00ad tute other courses for certain requirements in the planning of individual programs. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES The College of Agriculture participates in the interdiscipli\u00ad nary University Environmental Program as described on page 37. Students may elect either the Coordinate Major and fulfill the requirements of one of the major programs in the College or the Major in Environmental Studies. GENERAL STUDIES The General Studies Program allows students to build an academic program, incorporating their interests. Rather than specializing in one area, students are encouraged to participate in a broad range of subjects within the College of Agriculture. Once students have identified the areas they want to bring together in this self-design, a program will be planned and developed with a faculty advisor. The General Studies major will be required to complete 40 hours of courses offered by the College of Agriculture in areas such as human nutrition, consumer studies, animal sciences, botany, agricultural economics, or fashion mer\u00ad chandising. Twenty of the 40 hours must be 100-level courses or higher. All additional courses will be selected in consultation with the student's advisor. HUMAN NUTRITION AND FOODS The Department of Human Nutrition and Foods prepares students to enter the rapidly growing field of nutrition and/or foods. Such preparation requires a strong founda\u00ad tion in basic science including chemistry, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry. The Department recog\u00ad nizes the importance of general education and majors are required to complete courses in psychology, sociology, economics, English composition, speech, statistics, and the humanities. The course credits earned in Human Nutrition and Foods provide background in normal, cellular, and therapeutic nutrition as well as nutrient requirements for growth, development, and health at various stages of the life cycle. Other courses focus upon physical, chemical, and nutri\u00ad tional properties of food, and consumer aspects of food as related to socioeconomic status, lifestyle, cultural beliefs, and state of health. Although a series of courses providing information in these areas is required of all majors, each student has some choice of electives. Students may major in Dietetics (Plan IV with a general or clinical emphasis ap\u00ad proved by the American Dietetic Association) or Human Nutrition and Foods with an option in food science or human nutrition. Dietetics: This major is designed to meet the Plan IV Academic Requirements with a general or clinical emphasis which is approved by the American Dietetic Association. For ADA membership or to become a registered dietitian, the academic requirements and a clinical experience must be completed. This course plan provides a solid background in basic science, normal and therapeutic nutrition, foods, and quantity food management. Career opportunities include hospital dietetics as well as community nutrition programs, quantity food management, or graduate school. Human Nutrition and Foods: This major is designed to pro\u00ad vide a strong background in basic science, normal nutri\u00ad tion, and food with the opportunity to develop an option in food science or human nutrition. Graduates may find career opportunities with food companies, food manage\u00ad ment companies, community nutrition programs, govern\u00ad ment agencies and the Agricultural Extension Service, or graduate school. Home Economics Program: This major is designed to pro\u00ad vide students an opportunity to enroll in the Home Economics Interdisciplinary Program. Students may broaden their educational background by combining their area of specialization in Dietetics, Human Nutrition, or Food Science with courses in the Home Economics Pro\u00ad gram. This is particularly appropriate for nutrition profes\u00ad sionals who plan to work with families in community-based settings. MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCE Contemporary biology in\u00ad creasingly demands knowledge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. To this end, the program in Biochemical Science pro\u00ad vides a coordinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Depending on the student's future plans and capability, three areas of concentration are possible: (1) Cellular Biochemistry emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms; (2) Molecular Biology focuses on the chemical and physical structures of subcellular particles; and (3) Nutritional Biochemistry emphasizes the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. Specialization in one of these concentrations normally commences in the junior year after completion of the Biological Sciences Core (page 44). Students are re\u00ad quired to complete a minimum of three hours of physical chemistry (or eight hours for the Molecular Biology op\u00ad tion), 12 hours of biochemistry and three advanced biology courses; two of which would be in their concentration (e.g. nutrition, physiology, genetics, microbiology, biotech\u00ad nology, etc.). 50 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCE The Plant and Soil Science program has several specialized options designed for students interested in horticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, and insect pest management as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber produc\u00ad tion or to recreation and the environment. The program is flexible and allows students to place their primary emphasis in either science or agribusiness which prepares students for many employment opportunities, including agribusiness sales and service, agricultural extension, farming, soil and water management, and land use planning. Suggested op\u00ad tions have been developed by the Department to be used as guides for students interested in careers in general plant and soil science, agronomy, horticulture, soil science, and pest management. Specific courses, in addition to the core courses, are worked out between the student and the advisor. Agronomy: This option is concerned with the production and management of field crops, forage crops, and pastures for food, feed, and fiber as well as turfgrasses for landscap\u00ad ing and reducing soil erosion. Students learn to apply plant and soil principles to the care, improvement, and wise use of soils and land resources. Horticulture: This option with the varied field production, use, and marketing of fruits and vegetables for food pro\u00ad duction, and flowers, shrubs and trees for ornamental use. Plants, the man-made environment, and the natural envi\u00ad ronment are considered in Landscape Design. Soils: This option is directed mainly toward the soils as they relate to growing plants. Soil chemical, biological, and physical conditions and their influences on soil fertility are of major concern. In addition, other important soil-related issues may be pursued, such as water-sediment chemistry, soil conservation, soil mapping, and use of soils for envi\u00ad ronmental purposes. Pest Management: This option considers the protection of crops from insects, diseases, and weed competition. Students learn to integrate and apply biological, cultural, and high technology principles of pest control to farm man\u00ad agement systems. A strong emphasis of electives in biologi\u00ad cal sciences is worked out between the student and advisor. General: This option is designed for students interested in developing a broad background in Plant and Soil Science without a major emphasis in any one crop production or specialty area. It is most useful to the individual concerned with diversification of farm production. All students majoring in Plant and Soil Science must take Principles of Plant Science, Introductory Soil Science, Soil Fertility and Management, one semester of Seminar, two semesters of chemistry (one semester of inorganic and one semester of organic), one semester of mathematics or statis\u00ad tics, plant pathology, and insect pest management. A mini\u00ad mum of six additional courses in Plant and Soil Science at the 100 level or above are required, to be selected in the stu\u00ad dent's area of interest and approved by the student's ad\u00ad visor. Courses in related areas may be substituted for one or two of these six courses with the consent of the student's advisor. Required Core Courses Hours Plant and Soil Science: 11,Principles of Plant Science 3 106, Insect Pest Management 4 161, Introductory Soil Science 4 162, Soil Fertility and Management 3 281, Seminar 1 Botany: 104, Plant Physiology 4 117, Plant Pathology 4 Mathematics or Statistics 3-4 Chemistry 3 4 Chemistry 42 or 4 4 Six additional Plant and Soil Science courses at or above the 100 level 18-20 Two courses in Fine Arts and/or Humanities 6 Two courses in English and/or Communication 6 Two courses in Social Sciences 6 TEXTILES, MERCHANDISING, AND CONSUMER STUDIES The Department prepares students for careers in business and industry, education, extension, and government, or for pursuing graduate study. Practical as well as theoretical ap\u00ad proaches are presented and examined in the three areas of concentration: consumer studies, fashion merchandising, and related art. Although diverse in substance, the areas are joined by their concern and relationship with consumer needs and behaviors. Scientific, artistic, or business ap\u00ad proaches to the product areas of the textiles and clothing fields and consumer orientations to other products and services in general can be pursued in this multi-faceted department. Students may co-enroll in the Home Economics Program (see page 38 for complete description) with any of the three concentrations. This requires completion of professional concentration course requirements as well as home eco\u00ad nomics core requirements, and two seminars focusing on theoretical and practical implications of the home eco\u00ad nomics field. All majors take the following courses: Design, Textiles: Fibers to Fabrics, Career Seminar, Introduction to Con\u00ad sumer Problems, Consumer Management Principles, Con\u00ad sumer Motivation, and Field Experience. This common base and a core of general University courses in the social, physical, and quantitative sciences, humanities, and com\u00ad munication enable students to investigate and evaluate their area of concentration. Career exploration through professional seminars and field experiences enhances the student's awareness of the professions as well as tests the appropriateness of potential careers. Consumer Studies: This concentration addresses the in\u00ad teraction of economic, social, and political conditions as they affect the consumer. An understanding of the relation\u00ad ship of management and motivation to consumer problems, and the impact of public and private sector institutions, forms the basis of a flexible program of study. Majors select their courses to provide a career orientation in business or public service. Fashion Merchandising: This concentration combines a knowledge of textiles and apparel with the business and management skills required in retailing. Accounting, marketing, advertising, statistics, and computer science courses complete the fashion merchandising student's pro\u00ad fessional preparation. Career possibilities include retailing, buying, marketing, and promotion of consumer goods, particularly in the apparel or textiles areas. Related Art: This concentration offers a choice of design emphasis: apparel, textile, or a combination. Students ap\u00ad ply the elements and principles of design in weaving, dye\u00adTHE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 51 ing, and printing fabric and/or creating apparel by draping and flat pattern techniques. Alternative needs and end uses are evaluated during the design process, utilizing support\u00ad ing courses in history and the social and physical sciences. Students are prepared for a variety of positions in the textile and apparel industries including design, sales and educa\u00ad tional representatives, and apparel and textile production. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY The VOTEC department offers two major programs, (1) Occupational and Extension Education and (2) Agricultural Technology. These programs are flexible and provide seven areas of professional concentration. Certain concentrations may be completed either as (1) a major in this department, or (2) a dual major combined with another program at the University, and/or (3) without having to attend the Univer\u00ad sity campus on a full-time basis. Courses of general interest are available to students majoring in other programs in the University. OCCUPATIONAL AND EXTENSION EDUCATION Five areas of concentration prepare students for teaching cer\u00ad tification. One concentration prepares students for adult education responsibilities in governmental agencies, private organizations, business, or industry. Prior to the beginning of their junior year, students desiring teacher certification must apply for admission to teacher education, and stu\u00ad dents desiring to complete the Extension Education concen\u00ad tration must declare their intent. Contact the Department office, 108 Agricultural Engineering Building. Teacher certification concentrations are offered in coopera\u00ad tion with the College of Education and Social Services. Selected programs have been approved under the Vermont State Department of Education's Program Approval Plan and have reciprocity certification in selected states. Selected courses in the College of Education and Social Services will be included in teacher certification concentrations. Agricultural and Natural Resources Education: Preparation to teach grades 7-12 agricultural or renewable natural resource subject areas. Field experiences are provided in secondary school settings.

Congruent with this central purpose, the College seeks to instill in students at all levels the spirit of reasoned inquiry and habits of intel\u00ad lectual discipline which are required for the critical thinking expected of free men and women. The College further seeks to acquaint students with their intellectual, cultural, and aesthetic heritage, and to provide them with the skills necessary to cope with the complex human, societal, and technological problems of modern society. Finally, the Col\u00ad lege seeks to prepare students for direct entry into reward\u00ad ing careers in a variety of fields and for advanced study that may be prerequisite to other opportunities. These objec\u00ad tives of a liberal education are achieved through the courses of instruction which comprise the undergraduate curricula of the College. These curricula, through satisfaction of the major requirement, allow the student to attain baccalaur\u00ad eate level mastery of a specific discipline or an approved interdisciplinary program. As well, through satisfaction of the distribution requirement, students acquaint themselves with the diversity of approaches whereby people have come to understand themselves and their environment. The offices of the Dean of the College are located in Water\u00ad man Building. ORGANIZATION The College consists of 21 departments: Anthropology, Art, Chemistry, Classics, Communication Science and Dis\u00ad orders, Economics, English, Geography, Geology, German and Russian, History, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Religion, Romance Languages, Socio\u00ad logy, Theatre, and Zoology. Four additional majors are available through the College's Area and International Studies Program. DEGREES AWARDED The Bachelor of Arts degree is awarded for the following majors: Anthropology History Area Studies Latin Art History Mathematics \u2014 Arts Art \u2014 Studio and Sciences Biology Music Botany \u2014 Philosophy Arts and Sciences Physics Chemistry Political Science Classical Civilization Psychology Communication Science Religion and Disorders Russian Economics Sociology English Spanish French Theatre Geography Zoology Geology Individually Designed German Major \u2014 Arts Greek and Sciences DEGREE REQUIREMENTS AND ACADEMIC REGULATIONS Those students considering admission for Fall 1985 and thereafter should be aware that significant changes in the requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree have been ap\u00ad proved.

The specific requirements are as follows: BACHELOR OF ARTS: Each student must present nine semester courses by choosing three courses from three of the categories A, B, C, and D above. In any given category, no more than two courses may be chosen from one disci\u00ad pline. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE: Each student must present six semester courses selected from at least two of the categories A, B, and C above. BACHELOR OF MUSIC: same as Bachelor of Arts. MAJOR REQUIREMENTS All students in the College of Arts and Sciences must com\u00ad plete a major program. At least one-half of the major re\u00ad quirements must be taken at the University of Vermont, and only with the approval of the department chairperson will courses taken at another institution be applied toward completion of the major. All students must maintain an average in the major field of 2.0 or better and may not take courses required for the major or related field on a pass/no pass basis. Of the minimum 122 credits, Bachelor of Arts candidates may take no more than 45 credits in the major department, and Bachelor of Science candidates may take no more than 50 in the major department. Students may elect more than one major by consulting the Dean's Office and the departments involved. The student must complete the major requirements of each department, although courses taken to satisfy the related field require\u00ad ment may overlap when deemed appropriate. All require\u00ad ments for each major must be completed by the date of graduation in order to appear on the transcript. INDIVIDUAL DESIGN MAJOR is a non-departmental ma\u00ad jor for those students in the College of Arts and Sciences whose needs and interests are not met by the major pro\u00ad grams currently offered in the College. It is not the inten\u00ad tion of the College that such a special major be a program of narrow professional training. Rather, the IDM must lead to an intensive investigation of some broad area of human knowledge which is not presently defined by a simple de\u00ad partmental discipline. Application must be made and ap\u00ad proved before the beginning of the junior year. Students wishing to pursue this option should contact the Dean's Of\u00ad fice for further information and an application form, and secure approval from the Committee on Honors and Indiv\u00ad idual Studies. For specific major requirements, see the following pages. MINORS Students may elect a minor. Students may complete more than one minor, but may not minor in the field of the ma\u00ad jor. At least one-half of the credits toward the minor must be completed at the University of Vermont. Courses taken at another institution will be applied toward completion of the minor only with approval of the department chairper\u00ad son. All students must maintain an average in the minor field of 2.0 or better and may not take courses in the minor field on a pass/no pass basis. In cases of interdisciplinary minors, the minor must include at least 15 hours from disci\u00ad plines outside the major. In cases of interdisciplinary ma\u00ad jors, the minor must include 15 hours outside the courses constituting the major. The minor must be completed before the date of graduation in order to appear on the transcript. ELECTIVES Students will select elective courses in consideration of the following limitations. Courses offered by other colleges or schools at the University may be taken by Arts and Sciences students, but only 24 hours of such credit may be applied to the minimum 122 required. Courses offered by other col\u00ad leges or schools at the University by departments which of\u00ad fer majors in the College of Arts and Sciences are excepted from the 24-credit limitation. (At present, these include courses in Botany, Mathematics, the Environmental Pro\u00ad gram, and Statistics.) MILITARY STUDIES courses may be taken by students in the College of Arts and Sciences, but only eight such credits may be applied to the minimum 122 required. Military Studies credits will be counted as outside of the College of Arts and Sciences. In general, the College does not grant credit for military service. PHYSICAL EDUCATION courses, beyond the two re\u00ad quired of all students, may be taken as elective degree credit, and will be counted as outside of the College of Arts and Sciences. READINGS AND RESEARCH or independent study credits may be elected in any field including the major discipline. There is no limit on the number of Readings and Research credits which may be earned; but if a student elects nine or more such credits during any given term, the student must secure approval from the Committee on Honors and Individual Studies. Students will be required to adhere to the independent study guidelines, as described on page 28 of the current catalogue. TRANSFER Students wishing to transfer to the College of Arts and Sciences from another college or school at the University must have a cumulative grade-point average of 2.50 or bet\u00ad ter and must have completed two semesters as a degree stu\u00ad dent at the University. Applications may be filed in the Dean's Office and will be acted upon at the end of each term. All students receiving a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences must earn 30 of the last 45 credits in the College; therefore, students wishing to transfer should make application by no later than the end of the junior year. Transfer students from other institutions should note that 30 of the last 45 credits and one-half of the major credits must be earned at the University of Vermont and as a stu\u00ad dent in the College of Arts and Sciences. Transfer credit will be initially evaluated by the Registrar, although judgment as to the applicability of credit toward satisfaction of degree requirements rests with the Dean's Office and the chairper\u00ad son of the major department. Transfer credit from other in\u00ad stitutions is not used in the calculation of the University of Vermont grade-point average. SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING CREDIT Credit will not be given for the following combinations: Biology 1, 2 and Biology 3 Biology 1, 2 and Botany 4 Chemistry 1, 2 and Chemistry 11, 12 Chemistry 1, 2 and Chemistry 3,4 Chemistry 141, 142 and Chemistry 140 Mathematics 2 and Mathematics 10 Mathematics 9 and Mathematics 10 Mathematics 19 and Mathematics 21 Mathematics 20 and Mathematics 21 Music 1 and Music 11 or 12 Music 3 and Music 31 Philosophy 1, 2, and 3 Physics 11,12 and Physics 15,16 Statistics 111 and Statistics 141 Zoology 5, 6 and Zoology 104 Zoology 9 and Zoology 5, 6 or Biology 1, 2 Zoology 104 and Anatomy 9 and/or Physiology 10 ACADEMIC STANDARDS The following criteria for academic trial and dismissal, while making allowances for the student in the freshman year, are designed to encourage academic work of quality equal to or greater than the minimum average required for graduation. Any student experiencing academic difficulty is encouraged to meet with a member of the Dean's Office. DISMISSAL: Students who earn a semester average of 1.00 or less, or who fail (F, WF) half or more of their credit hours (excluding physical education and military studies), are dis\u00ad missed for low scholarship. Students who are dismissed may not enroll in any University courses during the term of dismissal. TRIAL: Students who earn a semester average higher than that which merits dismissal, but below 2.00 (1.67 for first- semester freshmen), are placed on trial. During the follow\u00ad ing term, students on trial must earn a 2.00, enroll in no courses on a pass/no pass basis, and maintain a program of 12 or more credit hours. Failure to satisfy any of the condi\u00ad tions of trial is grounds for dismissal. It is the prerogative of the Committee on Academic Stand\u00ad ing to modify the above regulations in light of extraordi\u00ad nary or extenuating circumstances. COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC STANDING The Committee on Academic Standing reviews all requests for special consideration with regard to College regulations, changes in enrollment, curriculum standards, and gradua\u00ad tion requirements. Students may petition to this Committee through the Dean's Office. PREPROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Students who plan to enter professional colleges requiring previous collegiate preparation will find the variety of courses offered in the College of Arts and Sciences and the freedom of election in that College is such that all the re\u00ad quirements for any professional school may be met. Many students will desire so to direct their four-year undergrad\u00ad uate courses as to provide, in addition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofessional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. Special advising is available in the College for students pre\u00ad paring for careers in education, journalism, law, and medical sciences. BIOLOGY A major in Biology is offered to students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. It has been designed for the student who wishes to concentrate in Bio\u00ad logy while pursuing a liberal arts education. It will also serve as a basis for programs leading to graduate study in biological fields and as an appropriate major for students in premedical and predental programs. Majors may pursue either the B.A. or the B.S. degree. For specific requirements for these degrees, please see page 61. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journalism is generally open to academically-qualified students who hold the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in any disci\u00ad pline. Interested students should take a broad program in THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 57 the liberal arts, including work in the social sciences and in English. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year college with a Bachelor's degree prior to admission. There is no prescribed curriculum for admission to law school, and candidates pursue their undergraduate studies in a wide range of majors. A Pre-Law Advisory Committee aids students in planning their academic pro\u00ad grams and in making application to law schools. Members of the committee include: Professor Holland, Department of Political Science; Professor McGovern, Department History; Professor Stanfield, Hal- tom, Department of Political Science; Professor Ashman, Department of Textiles, Merchandising, and Consumer Studies; Professor Severance, School of Business Adminis\u00ad tration; Larry Simmons, Center for Career Development; Susan Lackey, College of Arts and Sciences Dean's Office. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequisite for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as prepa\u00ad ration for such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantially from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy, religion, psychology, and sociology. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and zoology with a minimum of two years of college work. PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (page 9) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year undergraduate program concentrating in pharmacy, which includes two years of preprofessional work in English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, and fine arts. MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing require\u00ad ments for admission to an accredited medical college in\u00ad clude a minimum of three years of undergraduate work but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that students desiring to enter medical college should during their sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which they expect to apply, and arrange to include in their program courses required by those schools. They should also keep informed of events and deadlines relating to the application process by contacting the Office of Career Development. Each student, in consultation with his/her advisor, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the require\u00ad ments for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum re\u00ad quirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: (a) Math. 21, 22 (recommended for able students) (b) Math. 19, 20 (adequate) (c) Math. 9, 2; 21 or 19, 20 (suggested for students not immediately prepared to enter calculus) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1, 2, or 11, 12, 13, 14 (recommended for potential Chemistry majors) Chemistry 141,142 (required) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory (a) Physics 15, 16 (recommended for students with calculus background) (b) Physics 24, 25 (recommended for students concen\u00ad trating in the physical sciences or engineering) (c) Physics 11, 12 (acceptable for students without calculus background, or taking calculus concurrently) 58 | THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1, 2 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on applica\u00ad tion and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least three years of college work. (The majority of applicants will have completed four years.) In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in planning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. Students should consult catalogues of the dental colleges to which they expect to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. In general, students should avoid taking courses at the undergraduate level in those areas taught at the profes\u00ad sional level: i.e. human anatomy, human physiology, microbiology. Many medical colleges now strongly recom\u00ad mend or require that students enroll in courses in the humanities and social sciences. SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon application to the Dean of Education and Social Services, be accepted into the teacher training program for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, up to 24 credit hours, can count as electives towards the Bachelor of Arts. Students completing this program are eligible for Secondary Tea\u00ad cher's Certification. MAJORS: DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS For the Bachelor of Arts degree, the major field must in\u00ad clude a minimum of 36 semester hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. Concentration require\u00ad ments, including courses and necessary prerequisites may not exceed 60 semester hours. For the Bachelor of Science degree, the major field must include a minimum of 36 hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. No more than 94 semester hours of the total program, in\u00ad cluding distribution requirements and major field, may be in specifically designated courses. ANTHROPOLOGY Thirty hours in Anthropology in\u00ad cluding 21, 24, 26, and 28 (these provide an introduction to the discipline's four major fields); 225 and 228 (recommend\u00ad ed for the junior year) and four additional advanced (100- or 200-level) courses of which only one may be an indepen\u00ad dent study and at least one must be at the 200 level. AREA AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Entering stu\u00ad dents are invited to consider the option of concentrating in Area and International Studies. Courses in several academ\u00ad ic disciplines can be combined so as to focus on a particular area of the world, thus providing an opportunity to test generalizations against the particular reality of a geograph\u00ad ical area and its people. Undergraduates who major in Area Studies usually accum\u00ad ulate sufficient credit to enable them also to fulfill depart\u00ad ment requirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. The four areas presently available for concentration are: CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, RUSSIA/EAST EUROPE, EUROPE (Western, Northern, Mediterranean). Minor pro\u00ad grams are also available in these areas. The approach to undergraduate education combines expo\u00adsure to the traditional disciplines with integrative know\u00ad ledge and appreciation of a foreign culture and thus com\u00ad bines the broad liberal arts education with a more specific area competence. During their freshman and sophomore years, students who plan to major in Area Studies should take the required foreign language courses as well as beginning courses in the humanities and social sciences which are prerequisites for subsequent required courses and also meet the general dis\u00ad tribution requirements. Students interested in concentrating in Area Studies are urged to contact the Director, Area and International Studies, 479 Main Street, 656-4062. Specific requirements of the individual programs (with the exception of ASIAN) follow: Asian Studies Currently available as a major field only for those students who can fulfill the language requirement in their special field. Asian language offerings are limited at the University of Vermont. It is anticipated that a minor in Asian Studies will be available in the near future.

FIFTH-YEAR CERTIFICATE IN EDUCATION A special fifth-year program culminating in a certificate of advanced study is offered for students who wish to work beyond the Bachelor's degree but who need or desire more flexibility than is possible in any of the standard programs for Master's degrees. The certificate program is especially designed to meet the needs of teachers who are developing new teaching fields, for advanced students who are meeting requirements for state certification, and for experienced teachers who desire flexibility in choice of courses at both graduate and under\u00ad graduate levels. Each certificate program is individualized to fit the qualifi\u00ad cations and the professional objectives of the candidate. Undergraduate courses may be approved for the program when such courses appropriately support the candidate's professional objectives. The program for the Fifth-Year Certificate is governed by the following regulations: 1. Candidates must hold a Bachelor's degree. 2. Candidates must make written application on forms obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Education and Social Services. 3. Candidates are admitted to the program by action of a faculty committee. 4. A maximum of 12 credits may be applied to the program at the time of admission. 5. A maximum of nine credits may be transferred from other institutions. 6. Credits for the program may be earned in the regular academic year, the Summer Session, and the Evening Division. 7. The program for each candidate must include a minimum of 30 credits approved by a faculty advisor. 8. A minimum mark of C must be made in any course which is to be included in the program. 9.

The program re\u00ad quires a nine credit on-campus residency unit. Residency may be fulfilled during any academic semester or summer and is part of the total 30-36 program credits. Further infor\u00ad mation may be obtained from the Office for Student and Field Services, Waterman Building. Jk % V i ;v The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Busi\u00ad ness Administration includes the College of Engineer\u00ad ing and Mathematics and the School of Business Adminis\u00ad tration. The Division offers professional undergraduate programs for either professional practice or further study. Because graduates of professional schools are expected to be able to plan and direct in many work situations, as well as to effect and manage change, the primary objective of professional education is to develop skills in problem solving. Professional graduates must have the ability, confidence, and self-discipline to identify and define a problem; break it down into operable components; gather the necessary resources from the natural and social sciences, mathema\u00ad tics, and the humanities; and employ these resources to solve the problem. The Division promotes these qualities in students by emphasizing a balance between concept and skill in all curricula. The Division is also committed to learning as a life-long endeavor and, therefore, provides a base for students to build on as their careers and personal interests broaden. The offices of the Dean of the Division are located in the Votey Building. DEGREE PROGRAMS The Bachelor of Science degree is awarded for the following majors: Business Administration Civil Engineering Computer Science Electrical Engineering Management Engineering Mathematics Mechanical Engineering HONORS PROGRAMS FOR EMBA STUDENTS INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED MAJOR A student matriculating in the Division who, at the time of application, has completed at least three semesters of full- time study with a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or above may propose an individually designed major which builds on an appropriate core program of the Division. The program is designed for the superior student with excep\u00ad tional initiative and must contain a breadth and depth of courses consistent with regular professional programs or options. The program must be sponsored by a faculty mem\u00ad ber who will serve as the student's advisor. The program requires prior approval by the appropriate Studies Com\u00ad mittee. HONORS THESIS PROGRAM The undergraduate thesis program \u2014 designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity \u2014 provides an opportunity to pursue a special program without the restrictions of classroom routine. The student must be matriculated in the Division at the time of application and have a cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.0 for sophomore and junior work. The honors thesis program is a program of reading, research, design, or creation under the direction of the school, department, or program of the student's choice (not necessarily within the Division). For example, a student might do a special honors thesis in Physics. The unit establishes the mechanism for thesis review, and the proposal must be approved by the Division Dean's Office no later than the end of the junior year. The thesis, in the form of a written report, must be approved by the participating unit. The student may also be required to pass an oral or written examination at the discretion of the unit as part of the mechanism for review. At the time of graduation, the student's transcript and the graduation program will appropriately be denoted with \"Honors Thesis\" and the title of the thesis. Some programs within the Division require senior projects as part of the prescribed curriculum. For the superior stu\u00ad dent, these projects may offer opportunities smiliar to the honors thesis program. COOPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM The Division offers a cooperative education (CO-OP) pro\u00ad gram to students with cumulative grade-point averages placing them in the upper half of their class. Before accept\u00ad ance, each candidate must be interviewed and approved by the program coordinator and the prospective employer. The program lets students apply their learning to a full- time, paid position in a business, industrial, or government setting. It is designed to fit into a normal four-year academic program. In each curriculum area, there is a faculty member responsible for CO-OP students, serving also as the students' academic advisor and coordinating on- site visits to work assignments. Participants must submit learning objectives and an end-of-work report at the end of each assignment. Although the Division attempts to place ail qualified students admitted to the program, it cannot guarantee the availability of positions. The CO-OP office is located in the Center for Career Development at 322 South Prospect Street. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS AND ACADEMIC REGULATIONS ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students who receive a cumulative or semester grade-point average of less than 2.0 will be placed on trial. Students 80 | THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION who have failed half their course credits for any semester, or who have had two successive semester averages below 2.0, or three successive semesters in which their cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.0, are eligible for dismissal. To receive a degree in a major, students must have a minimum cumulative average of 2.0. Students must com\u00ad plete 30 of the last 45 hours of credit in residence at the University of Vermont as matriculated students in the Divi\u00ad sion of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Adminis\u00ad tration. Additional degree requirements are specified for each major. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE The Division does not, in general, grant credit for military service. Credit for specific courses or other academic exper\u00ad ience acquired during military service may be available through petition to the appropriate Studies Committee. PHYSICAL EDUCATION In addition to the course requirements listed for each curric\u00ad ulum, all students must satisfactorily complete two credits of physical education activities. RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROJECTS Opportunities for undergraduate research and work on special projects are offered by the School, departments, and programs of the Division. Credit may be arranged, with a maximum of four hours per semester. No more than 12 hours of courses in these categories may be used to satis\u00ad fy the requirements for the B.S. degree. It is understood that credit for such courses is contingent upon submission of a final report or other acceptable evidence of project completion. TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credits from other institutions are not used in the calculation of the University of Vermont grade-point average. Students who wish transfer credit must obtain ap\u00ad proval from their department or School. School of Business Administration The School of Business Administration offers a challenging and rigorous education to prepare its students for promis\u00ad ing careers in industry, government, and non-profit organizations. The graduates from this program will be equipped with the broad knowledge and analytical tools needed to operate effectively as line and staff managers in the rapidly changing management environment. The program is designed to cultivate the student's capacity to recognize, define, and solve problems in the most effi\u00ad cient manner possible. To this end, we require that the stu\u00ad dent be exposed to a wide range of courses in the arts, humanities, and the social and physical sciences. The first two years establish the broad intellectual base upon which the art and science of management are built and are devoted to partial completion of distribution re\u00ad quirements and to acquisition of the technical skills on which upper level management courses rely. The junior year complete the business core. Eight required courses develop the framework for organizing information and structuring analysis in the context of an operating enterprise. Course work is offered in finance, human resource management in a global environment, i nformation systems, marketing, and production, in addition to the ac\u00ad counting courses taken in the sophomore year. We believe that a broad but demanding program is in the best interest of the student's career opportunities. The final year is devoted to senior business electives, the re\u00ad quired business policy course, and free electives. The School of Business Administration also cooperates with the College of Engineering and Mathematics in offer\u00ad ing a B.S. in Manageme nt Engineering. The course offerings are described under the \"EMBA Division Programs\" on page 85. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS A minimum of 122 approved semester hours is required for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administra\u00ad tion including two required hours in physical education and a minimum of 55 hours in areas other than business ad\u00ad ministration and upper-level economics.

RECREATION MANAGEMENT All majors in Recrea\u00ad tion Management are required to successfully complete a series of core courses during the freshman and sophomore years. Upon completion of the sophomore year, the students elect to concentrate in one of two areas: Public Outdoor Recreation or Private Outdoor Recreation and Tourism. These concentrations are designed to prepare students for professional careers in the management of outdoor recrea\u00ad tion resources. The public recreation resources include parks, forests, wilderness, and recreation areas at the local, regional, state, and federal governmental levels. Private re\u00ad sources include ski areas, campgrounds, hunting preserves, resorts, and other specialized recreation facilities. Public Outdoor Recreation The Recreation Management Program's concentration in public land management prepares the student for a professional career in the plan\u00ad ning and management of natural resources for outdoor recreation use. It combines course work from natural resource disciplines with social sciences, communications, and public administration and management. Private Outdoor Recreation and Tourism This concentra\u00ad tion is designed to prepare students for careers in private outdoor recreation and tourism enterprises. Special empha\u00ad sis is given to the management of private ski areas, but the program permits specialization in several types of private recreation businesses. Course work is concentrated in natural resource management and business administration. A minimum of 127 semester hours of required and elective courses is required for the Bachelor of Science degree. Wildlife and Fish.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES - N.R. Two options are available to students interested in an Environmental Studies program with emphasis in natural resources. The Coordi\u00ad nate Major option requires completion of an approved pro\u00ad gram of studies including the requirements of another major program within the School. The major in Environ\u00ad mental Studies is an individually-designed interdisciplinary program available to qualified students upon approval of a petition to the Director of the Environmental Program. The detailed requirements of these two options are described in the Environmental Program section of this catalogue. UNDECIDED \u2014 N.R. High school seniors who do not wish to decide among the various programs of the School may be admitted as \"undecideds\" and may remain in this category for a maximum of two years. These students and their advisor develop a one- or two-year curriculum which enables them to explore several fields of natural resources. With careful planning and gradual refinement of their inter\u00ad ests, undecided students who maintain acceptable academic records can be admitted to one of the School's degree pro\u00ad grams and graduate within the usual time required. \u00bb r^ , .4 Courses of Instruction Aerospace Studies (ASTU) The University reserves the right to change course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alphabetically, and the college/school in which each is located is indicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course may be permitted to enroll by the instructor. Such students must inform the instructor that they lack the prerequisites, and the instructor will make appropriate efforts to ascertain that they are properly qualified. Courses are divided into three levels: introductory, inter\u00ad mediate, and advanced. Where appropriate, a department may limit enrollment in a particular course. Such limita\u00ad tions, other than class size, must be explicitly stated. Courses numbered from 1-99 are introductory courses. In\u00ad troductory courses emphasize basic concepts of the disci\u00ad pline. In general, they presuppose no previous college work in the subject. The only exceptions to this rule are those cases in which there is a two-semester introductory se\u00ad quence. In such cases, the second semester course may have the first semester course as a prerequisite. Courses numbered from 100-199 are intermediate courses. An intermediate course covers more advanced material than that treated in introductory courses. Students will be expected to be familiar with the basic concepts of the sub\u00ad ject and the course will present more difficult ideas. Inter\u00ad mediate courses will generally be more specialized than introductory courses. An intermediate course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study in the discipline or in another specified discipline. Courses numbered from 200-299 are advanced courses. An advanced course presents concepts, results, or arguments which are only accessible to students who have taken courses in the discipline (or, occasionally, in a related discipline) at the introductory and intermediate levels. Prior acquaintance with the basic concepts of the subject and with some special areas of the subject will be assumed. An advanced course will always have a minimum prerequi\u00ad site of three hours prior study at the intermediate level in the discipline, or in a related discipline, or some specified equivalent preparation. Some, but not all, 200-level courses carry graduate credit. Graduate students must refer to the UVM Graduate Catalogue which lists all courses carrying graduate credit. Seniors who wish to take a course for graduate credit must receive permission through the office of their dean/director (see page 34) prior to enrolling in the course. Some departments make further subdivisions of courses at some levels. Where this applies, an explanation can be found at the beginning of the department's list of courses. Two numerals separated by a comma (as in 17, 18) indicate that the separate semester courses may be taken indepen\u00ad dently for credit. Two numerals separated by a hyphen (as in 17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken independently for credit, and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. In cases where two numerals are separated either by a comma or by a hyphen, the odd-numbered course will be taught in the fall and the even-numbered course in the spring. The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course description. For some courses, the course title is followed by a pair of numerals connected by a hyphen and enclosed in parentheses (as in (2-3)); this form indi\u00ad cates the number of class hours respectively of lecture and laboratory.

For placement in advanced language courses (100 or above), first-year students should consult with this department. Students may not take a lan\u00ad guage course lower than the level most recently attained ex\u00ad cept with the permission of the department.

LITERATURE COURSES IN FRENCH AND SPANISH As the language courses offer a continuum for the learning of the four skills, the literature courses provide a sequential study of the development of French and Spanish literatures from the Middle Ages to the present. In addition, they offer both practice and continued training in the four language skills. While the literature courses are divided into centur\u00ad ies, with subcategories of genres, themes, and individual authors, it is not essential to adhere strictly to chronological order. In general, a 100-level literature course or its equiva\u00ad lent is the prerequisite for all other literature courses: excep\u00ad tions are regularly made with the approval of the depart\u00ad ment. Unless otherwise stated, all courses above the inter\u00ad mediate level will be conducted in the foreign language in question. Questions about the precise content of any litera\u00ad ture course should be referred to the instructor listed for the course or to the department chairperson.
