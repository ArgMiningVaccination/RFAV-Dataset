A Traditional ND (Naturopathic Doctor) is a trained specialist in a healing science, which use non-invasive natural medicine. They are not medical doctors (MD's). Traditional ND's are trained in subjects such as anatomy, physiology, gastrointestinal health, dietary evaluations, nutrition, food-based supplements, homeopathy, herbology, acupressure, homeopathy, exercise therapy, hydrotherapy, oxygen therapy and detoxification. Traditional ND's personalize the healing modality to the needs of the individual with methods which are effective for both chronic and acute problems. Traditional ND's cooperate with all branches of medical science, referring individuals to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. In practice, Traditional ND's perform lifestyle analysis, nutritional and dietary assessments, metabolic analysis and other evaluative procedures. They are trained to use a wide variety of natural methods, which involve the individual in the healing process. Naturopathy is based on a belief in the body's natural ability to heal itself when given an appropriate internal and external healing environment. Naturopaths are not involved in the practice of medicine and do not use drugs or pharmaceuticals, nor do they perform abortions or surgery. They have traditionally been referred to as \"drugless doctors.\" In reality, Traditional Naturopaths deal with wellness and relief from conditions, which are the result of stress whether from mental, nutritional, environmental or physical factors. How can Traditional Naturopathy help me? A naturopath (natural health care practitioner) was trained to view the body as a whole working system. If you are experiencing chronic or acute health issues and would like them to be corrected using and effective natural means, this is for you. For example, here is how a naturopath can be useful: If you are experiencing chronic headaches and would no longer wish to use an over the counter product to mask the pain, a naturopath will work with you to find what imbalances or deficiencies in the body are causing the symptom of headache. It could be food allergies/sensitives, environmental allergies, a toxic liver, poor bowel elimination, not enough good nutrition, job stress and so forth. Then together, the contributing issues are identified and corrected using natural products. This is getting to the original cause of why the symptom of a headache is manifesting. "}
