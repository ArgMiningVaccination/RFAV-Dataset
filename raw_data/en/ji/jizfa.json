PRICE, Ph.D., and ELAINE ADAMS THOMPSON, Ph.D. ABSTRACT Objective: This study aimed to test the preliminary psychometric properties of the Scale of Body Connec- tion (SBC), a 20-item self-report measure, designed to assess body awareness and bodily dissociation inmind-body intervention research. Methods: The SBC items were based on common expressions of awareness in body therapy. Content va- lidity was established by a panel of experts. The validity and reliability of the scale was examined with an un-dergraduate sample. To assess the scale's discriminant validity, the respondents were asked to indicate expo-sure to specific traumas. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis, used to examine the scale's construct validity, indicated acceptable goodness-of-fit indices, and revealed uncorrelated subscales, reflecting independent dimensions. Cronbach's al-pha revealed equal internal consistency reliability for each subscale for both men and women. Body awarenessscores did not differ between individuals with and without reported trauma exposure. Bodily dissociation scoresdiffered between individuals with and without past experience with physical trauma, suggesting the applica-bility of this subscale for use with populations with trauma histories. Conclusions: The results provide preliminary evidence of the construct validity and internal consistency re- liability of the SBC. 945INTRODUCTION Many therapeutic interventions in complementary and alternative therapies are designed to enhance the mind-body connection. Measures of body awareness andbodily dissociation are needed to explicate the underlyingmechanisms involved in physical and mental health im-provements, particularly in interventions aimed at popula-tions with somatic problems associated with dissociation orlack of body awareness. This research describes the devel-opment and psychometric evaluation of a self-report scaleto measure body awareness and bodily dissociation in clin-ical research.Background and definitions Mind-body connection is a \"buzzword\" in alternative and complementary therapy and integrative medicine. This termrefers to the intertwined relationship between soma and psy-che 1,2but is not specific to awareness. Typically, the term is used to refer to the underlying process of most self-reg-ulatory therapies that are designed to increase physical andmental well-being in mainstream approaches, such as cog-nitive behavioral therapy and biofeedback, as well as in al-ternative therapies, such as bodywork and somatic therapies,meditation, and yoga. Being cognizant of the relationship orconnection between bodily state (somatophysical) and men- School of Nursing, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. tal state (psychoemotional) is considered fundamental to the success of mind-body therapies and occurs when an indi-vidual becomes conscious of his or her bodily experience asa result of therapy. 3However, measurement of this aware- ness process in mind-body research is often missing. Forthe purpose of this paper the term \"psychophysical aware-ness\" is used to refer to the conscious processes involvingthe mind-body connection. In somatic theory, psychophysical awareness is linked to the conscious internal processes of self-knowledge and reg-ulation that facilitate human growth and well-being. 3-7To successfully engage in psychophysical awareness, it is nec-essary to gain access to inner bodily stimuli and to achievea state of observational awareness of inner body experience.This involves presence in and acceptance of bodily experi-ence (i.e., bodily association) versus the avoidance or dis-sociation from bodily experience. 8-10Thus, the concepts of body awareness and bodily dissociation are involved in theconstruct of psychophysical awareness. Body awareness and bodily dissociation, often not clearly defined, are discrete but experientially linked concepts. 10 Body awareness is multifaceted. It involves sensory aware-ness\u2014the ability to identify and experience inner sensationsof the body (e.g., a tight muscle) and the overall emo-tional/physiologic state of the body (e.g., relaxed, tense).Body awareness also involves attending to bodily informa-tion in daily life, noticing bodily changes/responses to emo-tion and/or environment. The concept of bodily dissociationis characterized by avoidance of internal experience. Bod-ily dissociation has experiential aspects including normaleveryday experiences, such as distraction from bodily ex-perience; this dissociation also includes the experience ofseparation from bodily experience or bodily self, and emo-tional disconnection\u2014difficulty with identifying, express-ing, and attending to emotion. Bodily dissociation is thoughtto be a protective strategy against painful memories,thoughts, or feelings and is a mechanism commonly used tocope with physical pain, 3,11and trauma.12-14The conceptu- alizations used here are drawn from the clinical literature inalternative and complementary therapies, psychology, andpsychiatry; the overall result is a broader definition for bothterms than is typically found in any one field. Theoretically different explanations are used to describe the awareness processes underlying psychophysical aware-ness. Psychologic theories emphasize the reflexive nature ofself-awareness, including cognitive processes such as re-flection or the objectification of thought and feeling. Theo-ries of holistic interventions, designed to promote psy-chophysical awareness, offer mindfulness as anotherperspective for understanding the processes involved. 15 Mindfulness is a meditation process involving the practiceof attention to in-the-moment experience. 16This meditation emphasizes a prereflexive process involving perceptualpresence based in subjective experience. 9,17A primary dis- tinction between the processes of reflection and prereflex-ivity is the frame of reference for understanding conscious process: The former is inherently more analytical and be-havioral, while the latter is more experiential and somatic.In this paper, the conscious processes involving reflectionon andattendance to internal experience are implicit in the definition of psychophysical awareness. Body awareness and bodily dissociation in clinical care and research The importance of body awareness and the detrimental effect of bodily dissociation in health and healing is de-scribed in the clinical care of individuals in recovery frompsychologic and/or physical traumas 13,14,18substance abuse,19,20and eating disorders,21-23as well as in the care of chronic pain.24,25Sexual symptoms and dysfunction, common sequels of sexual abuse,26are also thought to be related to bodily dissociation.27 There are many studies involving mind-body interven- tions. However, few studies are explicitly focused on in-creasing and/or measuring psychophysical awareness. Theexceptions include studies of mindfulness, 28,29body-ori- ented therapy,30,31yoga,32and a psychophysical therapy treatment used in Nordic countries called Body AwarenessTherapy. 8The populations associated with these studies in- clude individuals with chronic pain conditions, heart dis-ease, childhood sexual abuse, depression, disordered eating,anxiety, and cancer. The results provide evidence of the pos-itive health impact of therapeutic methods specifically aimedat body awareness and association (versus dissociation) tothe body. Understanding interventions designed to improvethe mind-body connection requires examining body aware-ness and bodily dissociation in order to explicate the mech-anisms that underlie improvements in physical and mentalhealth, particularly for interventions aimed at populationswith somatic problems associated with dissociation or a lackof body awareness. Bodily dissociation and trauma Individuals with trauma histories make up one popula- tion for which bodily dissociation appears to be linked tohealth. Research on somatoform dissociation and deperson-alization suggests the importance of, and possible link be-tween, bodily dissociation and health status in certain con-ditions. Somatoform dissociation is the activation of somaticsymptoms during a dissociative state or reaction; studies pro-vide evidence that symptoms of somatic dissociation are in-tegral to dissociative pathology 33and are associated with trauma.34,35Depersonalization is an aspect of dissociation involving dissociation from the body as a primary symptom(e.g., feeling \"cut-off\" from the body or having the experi-ence of looking at or sensing one's body from the outside,rather than the experience of being physically \"inside\" one-self). 36Studies indicate that depersonalization is commonPRICE AND THOMPSON 946 among individuals with dissociative disorders and post-trau- matic stress disorders (PTSD) that are associated primarilywith psychologic and physical trauma. 37,38Although deper- sonalization symptoms are frequent among individuals withdissociative disorders, they are also common to dissociativeexperiences among individuals in the general population,particularly among individuals with chronic pain and in sit-uations that involve marked emotional distress. 39,40These findings suggest the importance of examining the relation-ship between bodily dissociation and health outcomesamong individuals with trauma histories, pain, and severeemotional distress. Gender and trauma Exposure to interpersonal violence is associated with equivalent psychologic and physical distress and pathologyamong males and females. 41Gender differences exist. Males have a higher prevalence of lifetime trauma exposure com-pared to women, 42and women have a higher exposure to violent interpersonal trauma associated with more severedistress. 41This might explain why studies consistently find that women compared to men report more symptoms of post-traumatic distress. 42,43In light of the possible link between trauma and bodily dissociation, these findings suggest theimportance of examining gender differences in bodily dis-sociation. Existing measures and their limitations Existing measures of body awareness do not address psy- chophysical awareness. Rather, these instruments measureeither nonemotive physical cues such as feelings involvinghunger, fatigue, and energy level, 44or focus on sensory awareness involving, for example, a dry mouth, a beatingheart, or a change in body temperature. 45Measures of mind- fulness often have one or two items that address psy-chophysical awareness as indicators of presence 46or indi- cators of mindful observation47; however, these scales are not designed as measures of body awareness or bodily dis-sociation. Despite the prevalence of dissociative experiences involv- ing the body, there are no measures of bodily dissociation. Ascale specific to somatic dissociation, the presence of so-matic symptoms that may accompany dissociative disorders. 48 This scale was designed specifically for use with a clinicalpopulation with dissociative disorders\u2014the majority of theitems measure severe symptoms, for example, temporaryparalysis\u2014and it this scale is consequently not applicable tointervention studies for the general population. Thus, althoughexisting scales may contain specific items that address bodyawareness or bodily dissociation, these scales are limited intheir applicability to the measure of body awareness or bod-ily dissociation assessed in intervention research designed toenhance psychophysical awareness.A new measure The purpose of this study was to construct a self-report scale of body connection for use in body therapy interven-tion research. The specific aims were to develop a measureof body awareness and bodily dissociation, to evaluate con-struct validity of the scale, to assess discriminant validity bycomparing scale scores of groups with and without historiesof trauma exposure, to describe the internal consistency ofa pool of items, and to examine gender differences based onscale response. It was anticipated that these two constructswould be correlated and would together provide a compos-ite of body connection. METHODS Sample description The sample consisted of 291 undergraduate students, 162 females (55%), and 119 (41%) males; 10 (4%) of the re-spondents did not identify their genders or respond to ques-tions regarding trauma exposure. The majority of samplewas Caucasian, however racial/ethnic demographics werenot collected. The average age of study participants was 20years with a median of 20 and a mode of 19. While the agerange extended to 46 years, 95% percent of the sample wasless than 25 years old. Measurement Instrument development. Initially, a pool of 26 items was formulated based on expressions of awareness, both posi-tive and negative, common in body therapy. The items weredeveloped to represent two dimensions: body awareness andbodily dissociation. Clinical literature in the fields of body-work, body psychotherapy, and trauma recovery were re-viewed as part of the item generation process. Upon com-pletion of the initial draft, the Scale of Body Connection wasdistributed to 12 Nursing Science doctoral students in an in-strument development course for feedback on item clarityand meaning. Specifically, the volunteers were instructed torate the degree to which each item was clearly stated usinga scale of 1-5 to indicate the number of cues or ideas pre-sent in each item statement, to judge \"yes\" or \"no\" whetherthe meaning of each statement was clear, and to assess re-dundancy among items. Finally, the volunteers were askedto examine the items, which were grouped by theorized di-mension, and to indicate if the subscale differentiationseemed logical. The revised items were subsequently evaluated for con- tent validity by four body therapist clinicians with expertisein trauma recovery, and by two researchers in psychosocialnursing with expertise in scale development. The expertswere asked, via open-ended questions specific to each itemon a scale evaluation form, to judge the meaningfulness ofSCALE OF BODY CONNECTION 947 the questionnaire items: whether the item captured the di- mension of body awareness or bodily dissociation, andwhether the item was placed in the appropriate scale. Spacewas provided for the experts to propose alternative sugges-tions for item wording. This process resulted in the removalof one item, generation of two new items, and the reword-ing of items to enhance specificity. The instrument administered for this study thus consisted of 27 items reflecting two theorized dimensions. The scaleinstructions indicated that the questionnaire asked about fre-quency of experience of, and response to, body awareness.Respondents were instructed to \"check the box that best an-swers the way you generally feel.\" They were also told:\"There are no right answers, please answer as truthfully asyou can.\" Item response options were based on a 5-point,Likert-type scale ranging from 1 meaning \"not at all\" to 5meaning \"all of the time.\" Trauma exposure. Questions assessing prior exposure to trauma were included, prior to filling out the actual instru-ment, to explore the scale's discriminant validity. Com-monly assessed trauma 49were physical abuse; childhood sexual natural disaster, or violence; nonsexual as-sault as an adult; sexual assault as an adult. Response op-tions were \"yes\" or \"no.\" Demographic variables. Demographic questions included measures of participants' age and genders. Data collection Following review and approval of all research procedures by the University's institutional review board, approxi-mately 350 students were recruited from a northwestern uni-versity. This large sample was required to ensure stable pa-rameter estimates for the confirmatory factor analysis(CFA). 50We contacted 16 professors from undergraduate departments and requested permission to administer thescale to students at the end of their classes. Four (4) pro-fessors agreed, and the scale was administered to studentsin 2 history and 2 anthropology courses within a 2-week pe-riod. Data collection included a full information statementconsistent with federal and university regulations and wasfully anonymous. Two hundred and ninety-one (291) students returned completed questionnaires, representing an approximated90% completion rate. The majority of the students returnedquestionnaires and all questionnaires were used in this analy-sis. Typically, there was less than 1.5% missing data on thespecific scale items. There were, however, two items\u2014onespecific to body awareness during sexual activity and onespecific to bodily dissociation during sexual activity\u2014thatwere left blank by 22 respondents (7.6%), who also reportedabsence of sexual activity.Data analysis Scale validity. CFA was used to evaluate the theoretical measurement model reflected in the two dimensions of theSBC instrument using linear structured relations (LIS-REL). 51CFA tests the interrelationships among scale items to determine if a set of items share common characteristicsthat define the construct; for this study, the item fit with thelatent variables of body awareness and bodily dissociationwere tested. Multiple criteria were used to evaluate themodel fit, including the /H9273 2, the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), the normed fit index (NFI),the standardized root mean theroot-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA). The/H9273 2statistic is used to assess the fit between the statistical model and the data; the hypothesized model is considered agood fit if the /H9273 2is small and statistically insignificant. Chi square, however, is sensitive to sample size, and thus spe-cific indices of fit (GFI, CFI) provide estimates of theamount of variance and covariance explained by themodel. 50Generally, values between 0.9 and 1.0 indicate a good fit for GFI and greater than 0.93 for CFI.52A value of less than 0.08 is considered acceptable for SRMS. For theRMSEA, the closer the value is to 0, the better the modelfit; a value of less than or equal to .08 is typically consid-ered adequate and a value of less than or equal to .06 rep-resents a good fit. 53-55 To examine the association with known groups, inde- pendent t-tests were used to compare individuals with and without histories of trauma exposure. Scale reliability. Internal consistency reliability was as- sessed using Cronbach's alpha (SPSS-PC 11.5; SPSS Inc.,Chicago, IL, 1993). Alpha values of 0.70 or greater were in-terpreted as acceptable. We also examined interitem corre-lations and item-total correlations to assess the relevance ofspecific items within each scale. For missing data on twoitems (awareness during sexual activity), the items werescored \"not at all\" when lack of sexual activity was alsomarked on the questionnaires by respondents. Analyses wereconducted with and without these cases, yielding compara-ble results. Other respondents (n /H1100512) who had missing val- ues on one or more scale items were not included in theanalysis. Gender and age associations were explored usingcorrelations and t-tests. RESULTS Scale validity Construct validity. Results from the final confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling are de-tailed in Table 1. Seven items were eliminated due to cross-loadings (for example: \"I am not aware of sensation in cer-tain parts of my body\"), or did not load on either of the twoPRICE AND THOMPSON 948 factors (for example: \"Even when I do not sleep, I am alert during waking hours\"). The final scale* consisted of 20items. No additional models were run. The overall fit sta-tistics indicated an adequate-to-good fit between the dataand the proposed model linking scale items with the con-structs of body awareness and bodily dissociation. The chisquare ( /H9273 2/H11005283.34, 166 re- flecting in part the large sample size; values for specific fitindices suggested a good fit between the model and strong, but the GFI value borderlined on the con-ventional standard for a good fit. These cut-offs, however,are considered arbitrary and are best used to compare re-search models. 50,52,56Contrary to expectation, the dimen- sions of body awareness and bodily dissociation were notcorrelated ( /H110020.08). All factor loadings on each dimensionwere statistically significant. For Body Awareness (Table 1), the strongest loading items (7 and 9) were focused onintegration of physical and emotional experience via atten-dance to and reflection on inner body awareness (e.g., \"lis-ten for information from body about my emotional state\"and \"take cues from body to understand how I feel\"). ForBodily Dissociation (Table 1), the strongest loading items(13, 17, and 20) reflected difficulty with expressing, at-tending to, and identifying emotion. It appears that, in bothdimensions, the items with the strongest factor loadings in-volved emotional awareness. Discriminant validity. As a test of scale validity, body awareness and bodily dissociation scores were examined bygrouping participants based on reported trauma exposure.Eleven percent (11%) of the female participants and 5% ofthe male participants reported childhood sexual abuse; 9%of the female participants and 6% of the male participantsreported childhood physical abuse. Eight percent (8%) ofthe female participants and 5% of the male participants re-ported adult physical assault; 10% of the female participantsSCALE OF BODY CONNECTION 949 *The Scale of Body Connection is available from the primary author.

Three correlated errors were included: between items 4 and 10 on Body Awareness; between 14 and 16, and between 15 and 19on Bodily Dissociation. Analyses reported more based on cases with no missing data. Additional analyses conducted with imputed values for missing data yielded equivalent results. and 1% of the male participants reported adult sexual as- sault. Thirty percent (30%) of the participants reported be-ing witness to a serious accident, natural disaster, or vio-lence (33% of the females, 30% of the males). There were no differences in mean responses in body awareness or in bodily dissociation between individuals whodid or did not indicate overall trauma exposure (sum of anytype of trauma exposure). Examination of specific physicaltraumas (childhood sexual or physical abuse or adult sexualor physical assault but not witness to trauma), however, re-vealed that individuals who reported one or more experi-ences of physical trauma had significantly more bodily dis-sociation compared to individuals with no history of physicaltrauma (i.e., individuals who reported no trauma exposureor individuals who only reported being a witness to severeaccident, natural disaster or violence [ t/H110052.5; p/H110210.01]). There was no difference in body awareness between indi-viduals who reported physical trauma versus those with nohistories of physical trauma. When the data were examined further by gender sub- groups, there were no differences in body awareness bytrauma exposure for females or for males. Nor were theresignificant differences in body awareness by any types oftrauma exposure for males or for females. In contrast, gen-der comparisons of bodily dissociation by trauma exposurerevealed that females who reported one or more trauma ex-posures had significantly more bodily dissociation comparedto females who reported no trauma exposure ( t/H110052.1; p/H11021 0.04). An examination by specific types of trauma exposureindicated that females who experienced childhood sexualabuse had significantly more bodily dissociation comparedto females who did not ( t/H110052.2; p/H110210.025). Females who experienced childhood physical abuse had marginally morebodily dissociation compared to females who did not ( t/H11005 1.8; p/H11005/H11021 0.08). There were no other significant differences in bodily dissociation for females by trauma exposure. Formales, those who reported experiences of physical assaulthad significantly more bodily dissociation compared tomales who did not ( t/H110052.5, p/H110210.02). There were no other significant differences in bodily dissociation for males bytype of trauma exposure. Overall, these findings indicate thatthe scale of body awareness did not discriminate betweenindividuals with or without exposure to trauma. In contrast,the scale of bodily dissociation did discriminate between in-dividuals, both males and females, who reported exposureto physical trauma\u2014specifically childhood sexual and phys-ical abuse among females, and physical assault as an adultamong males. Internal consistency reliability The internal reliability consistency was adequate for both measures (N /H11005279). The body awareness subscale was based on 12 items and had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.83. Cor-rected item-total correlations revealed that most item load-ings were 0.50 or greater. The measure of bodily dissocia- tion included 8 items and had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.78.Item total correlations indicated that the mean interitem cor-relation was 0.32, and corrected item-total correlations were0.36 or greater. There was no evidence that deletion of oneor more items from either scale would improve the internalconsistency. The measures of body awareness and bodilydissociation were uncorrelated ( r/H11005/H11002 0.08, not significant). Gender and age differences Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviations for both scales by gender. For this convenience sample, there wereno gender or age differences in mean responses to the bodyawareness subscale or to bodily dissociation subscale. Therewere, however, significant gender by trauma exposure in-teractions observed for bodily dissociation as describedabove. DISCUSSION This paper describes the development and preliminary validation of the SBC. The final confirmatory factor analy-sis produced two uncorrelated scales reflecting independentdimensions of body awareness and bodily dissociation; theresults indicated adequate goodness-of-fit indices, support-ing the scale's construct validity. The strong factor loadingson items reflecting emotional awareness, in both dimensionsof the SBC, suggests that emotional awareness is integral tobody awareness and bodily dissociation. Emotional aware-ness is a vital component of psychophysical awareness,pointing to the particular usefulness of the SBC in clinicalintervention research involving mind-body therapies. The discriminate ability of the two scales differed. The Bodily Dissociation subscale discriminated between groupswith and without exposure to physical trauma; specificallychildhood sexual and physical abuse among females, andphysical assault as an adult among males. This finding pro-vides evidence of the conceptual link between physicaltrauma and bodily dissociation, and indicates that the scalemay be a useful tool in interventions for individuals inPRICE AND THOMPSON 950 TABLE 2.

In contrast, the Body Awareness subscale failed to discriminate between individuals by trauma expo-sure; it is likely that having more or less body awareness isrelated to a myriad of factors and not closely linked totrauma. This study also demonstrated the internal consistency re- liability of the scales, which were equivalent for men andwomen. A concern related to the scale's reliability is thattwo items addressing awareness or dissociation during sex-ual activity were occasionally left blank. These two sub-scales also proved to be problematic in administration of thescale in a subsequent intervention study. Respondents whowere not engaged in sexual relationships tended to leave theitems blank. These items, however, are particularly impor-tant for individuals with histories of sexual violence becausethis population is often distressed by a lack of comfort withintimacy and sexuality. 57,27A suggestion for future use of the scale is to provide explicit instructions to consider allaspects of sexual activity, including self-stimulation. The de-velopment of additional items aimed at physical discomfortwith intimacy/sexuality might also be useful. The scale name, Scale of Body Connection, was pur- poseful in that it was designed to address the overarchingconstruct of psychophysical awareness. The study findingsdemonstrated the independent features of the subscales, andthe need to score and interpret the findings separately. How-ever, the name of the scale was retained because althoughindependent, both body awareness and bodily dissociationare facets of body connection. The SBC performed well when used in an intervention study conducted subsequent to this analysis of the scale'sreliability and validity. Simple to administer, it is brief andeasy to understand. In a repeated measures analysis, the scaleresponses indicated adequate variability and significantchange across time, providing preliminary evidence of thepositive change in body awareness and reduction in bodilydissociation in response to a body therapy intervention dur-ing psychotherapeutic recovery. 30Increased body connec- with dissociation reductionacross time. 58These findings point to the importance of measuring body connection to examine process, underlyingmechanisms, and the relationship between body connectionand health outcomes. There are study limitations to consider. The demograph- ics of the convenience sample of undergraduate studentsdoes not compare well with the typical age, socioeconomicstatus (SES), or racial/ethnic identity of most populationswho typically undergo clinical interventions. Likewise, thehomogeneity of the study sample does not allow assessmentof how other groups might respond to the SBC items. Fu-ture research ought to include testing the SBC with a moreheterogeneous sample, as well as with populations that aretypically chosen for mind-body interventions. As a follow-up to the preliminary findings that indicated the discriminate ability of the Bodily Dissociation subscale,it will be important to examine the scale's validity among individuals exposed to physical violence. Further constructvalidity is needed comparing the SBC to other scales of bodyawareness and dissociation, as well as use of a validated in-strument to assess trauma exposure. Comparisons based onother physical traumas such as car accidents that are alsoknown to be associated with traumatic response or PTSDwere also missing from this study; this too will be an inter-esting and important area for future evaluation to help es-tablish the breadth of the scale's clinical utility. An exami-nation of the relationship between bodily dissociation andhealth outcomes in traumatized versus nontraumatized pop-ulations is another important research question given thelinks between trauma, dissociation and poor physical/men-tal health. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the results provide strong evidence of the SBC's construct validity, partial evidence for discriminantvalidity and internal consistency reliability. The scale wasdeveloped for use in somatic therapy research; however, itis theoretically and practically applicable to many other ther-apeutic approaches. The development of the SBC addressesa methodological research gap with its emphasis on psy-chophysical awareness and relevance to body-mind inter-vention research.
