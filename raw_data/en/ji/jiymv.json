Why do kids have a higher susceptibility? Their immune systems aren't as developed and have not yet come into contact with as many pathogens as an adult's immune system. So, what is your immune system anyway? Why are some people's seemingly stronger than others? Your immune system is your body's network of organs, cells and tissues that fight viruses, bacteria and fungi to keep your body healthy and functioning optimally.

A majority of your immune system lies in your digestive system, which is why gut health is so important to maintain wellness. Needless to say, dietary and lifestyle choices as well as environmental factors can all build up or tear down your immune system. Your immune system can be compromised when your sleep, diet or emotions are imbalanced, which leads to disease, fatigue and poor recovery from outside stressors.
