UW MEDICINE | PATIEN T EDUCATION _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 5 Weight Loss Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 This section of the Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery explain s the types of weight loss surgery that are done at UWMC. It also includes the benefits and risks of each type. What is bariatric surgery? UWMC offers 3 types of weight loss surgery. are: Divided proximal roux roux -y gastric bypass (RYGB), also called gastric bypass surgery, divides the stomach into 2 sections: The small section, called the \"pouch,\" is connected to your small intestine. The pouch becomes your new smaller stomach. It limits the amount of food you can eat easily. The large section of your stomach, called the \"re mnant stomach,\" will stay in place, but your body will not use it. Compared to other bariatric procedures , RYGB results in: Quicker i mprovement in blood sugar control (for people with diabetes) Quicker d ecrease in symptoms of gastric reflux Greater averag e weight loss RYGB surgery bypasses about 90% of the stomach, so only 10% holds food. A 3 -foot to 5 -foot length of intestine is connected from the small stomach pouch to the rest of the intestines. Another 9 to 15 feet of intestines is still used to digest and absorb food from the small stomach pouch. Weight Loss Surgery Divided proximal roux -y-gastric gastric banding, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . | | | | Your weight loss surgery will be done in the Surgical Specialties Center. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 6 Weight Loss Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 981 95 | 206- 598- 2274 Because the smaller stomach holds less food, this surgery helps you feel full more quickly - but you must still eat less to lose weight. Divided proximal roux -y gastric bypass Surgery Most bariatric surgeries are done using a device called a lapar oscop e. A laparoscope consists of a camera that guide s small instruments that go into the abdomen through several narrow tubes or ports. The surgeon's hands do not go inside the abdomen. In this surgery, 4 to 5 small incisions are made, instead of 1 l arge incision. Compared to open some of t he benefits of laparoscopic surgery ar e: Fewer wound problem s, such as infection and hernias Less pain after the first week Shorter hospital stay and quicker recovery Quick return of bowel function Fewer heart and lung problem s Your surgeon will determine whe ther a laparos copic operation is best for you. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 7 Weight Loss Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 981 95 | 206- 598- 2274 Open Surgery If your surgeon believes that laparoscopic surgery is not possib le, an open operation will be done. In this surgery, an 8 -inch to 12 -inch incision is made down the middle of the abdomen (near the breastbone) to the belly button. Sleeve Gastrectomy Sleeve gastrectomy (also called vertical sleeve gastrectomy) is another type of weight loss surgery. In this surgery, 85% to 90% of the stomach is permanently removed by stapling and dividing it vertically. The stomach that is left is in the shape of a slim banana or a sleeve ( see drawing below ). Removing a large part of the stomach reduces the amount of food you can eat. It may also affect the hormone called ghrelin that controls appetite. Sleeve gastrectomy Weight loss with a sleeve gastrectomy is quicker than with a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB ) but s lower than with RYGB. As with the other surgeries, you must eat less to lose weight. Expected weight loss with a sleeve gastrectomy may be less than a gastric bypass and more than a gastric banding surgery . _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 8 Weight Loss Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 981 95 | 206- 598- 2274 Laparoscopic (LAGB ), also called \"lap band ,\" an adjustable band is placed around the top part of your stomach. This band is connected to a small port and tubing ( see drawing below ). These are placed under the skin of your abdom en. A syringe and needle are used to fill th e port with water or saline, or to empty it to adjust the size of the band , as needed . Adjusting the band creates a feeling of restriction and fullness. This helps you control your hunger and how much you can eat . After LAGB surgery, y ou will need to be closely monitored by the Center for Bariatric Surgery team for the rest of your life. At your clinic visits, the port may be filled or emptied to adjust the band to the right size. The band will help with weight loss, but you must also eat less and exercise to lose weight . People who have the most success with the lap band are those who are able to exercise and have had success in the past with dieting. Comparing Lap Band, Gastric Bypass, and Gastric Sleeve Surger ies Weight loss with a lap band is slower than with gastric bypass and gastric sleeve surgery. Lap b and patients lose about 30% to 50% less weight than bypass patients. Lap b and placement is a shorter surgery and has fewer risks than a gastric bypass. The lap band system and port are placed during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, also called \"lap-band\" surgery . _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 9 Weight Loss Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 981 95 | 206- 598- 2274 What are the risks? All surgeries have risks. Your risks with weight loss surgery will depend on your age and other health problems. Risks for the Open or Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Death: 0.5% to 3% (1 to 6 patients out of 200) Leak where the stomach and/or bowel are connected: 1% to 5% (1 to 5 patients out of 100) Bleeding: 1% to 5% (1 to 5 patients out of 100) Blood clot in the lungs: 0.5% to 1% (1 or fewer patients out of 100) Bowel blockage or obstruction: 5% to 10% (5 to 10 patients out of 100) Need for re- operation: 10% (10 patients out of 100) Laparoscopic bypass: - Wound infection: less than 2% (fewer than 2 patients out of 100) - Incisional hernia: less than 2% (fewer than 2 patients out of 100) Open bypass: - Wound infection: 10% to 20% (10 to 20 patients out of 100) - Incisional hernia: 10% to 23% (10 to 23 patients out of 100) Risks for the Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy Death: 0.1% (1 or fewer patient s out of 10 0) Leak from stomach: 1% to 3% (1 to 3 patients out of 100) Bleeding: 1% to 2% (1 to 2 patients out of 100) Infection: 1 % to 2% (1 to 2 patients out of 100) Blood clot in the lungs: 0.5% to 1% (1 or fewer patients out of 100) Need for re -operation: 1 % to 5% (1- 5 patients out of 100) Increased acid reflux: 10% (10 patients out of 100) Trouble swallowing or stricture (narrowing of the remaining stomach : 5% (5 patients out of 100) Increased acid reflux (heartburn) _____________________________________________________________________________________________ \u00a9 University of Washington Medical Clinician Review: 0 7/2013 Reprints on Health Online: https://healthonline.washington.edu Page 10 Weight Loss Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

What You Need to Know Gastric bypass surgery and vertical sleeve gastrectomy surge ry cannot be reversed. Total weight loss for each surgery varies. Of the 3 options, expect the least amount of weight loss with lap band surgery. After any weight loss surgery: - You will need to take vitamin and nutritional supplements for the rest of your life. - You may be more sensitive to alcohol. - If you are a woman, you have a greater chance for unplanned pregnancy and for problems with pregnancy in the first year after surgery.

Learning About Your Surgery This manual provides basic information about weight loss surgery. You will learn more during your first clinic visit . First Clinic Visit During your first clinic visit, you and your surgeon will talk about your weight loss history: How much weight you lost What you did to try to lose the weight How you lost the most weight Your surgeon will also: Describe your weight loss surgery options in detail. Talk with you about the lifestyle cha nges you will have to make for the surgery to have long -term success. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 15 Getting Started | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacifi c St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Tell you what tests and consultations you must complete before you can schedule your second clinic visit. We will give you a copy of the \"Bariatric Worksheet,\" which list s all the tests and consultations often done before weight loss surgery. Your surgeon will check only the tests and consultations you need. At the end of this first clinic visit, we will schedule you for the tests you need. Talk with you about the risks of the surgery, h ow much weight loss to expect, and how long it may take you to lose the weight. Review the Bariatric Team's responsibilities to you, as well as your responsibilities during this entire process. YOU are an important member of your Bariatric Team! Why do I n eed to have so many tests? For your safety, we need a clear picture of your health before we schedule your surgery. The tests listed in the \" Bariatric Worksheet \" can show if you have liver problems, breathing problems, excess fluid in your tissues, too much or not enough salts and minerals in your body fluids, or abnormal blood fat levels. For instance : It is important to test your thyroid function , since hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone production) can lead to sudden death after surgery. If you have diabetes , you must take special steps to control your blood sugar. We will also test your heart to see if it will be able to handle the stress caused by surgery. Some health conditions, such as serious heart or lung problems, can increase the risk of any surgery. But, these conditions may also increase the need for weight loss surgery. Your surgeon will carefully review your test results and will make a recommendation based on that assessment. Routine Tests and Evaluations All candidate s for weight loss su rgery will have these tests : Blood Tests Complete Blood Count (CBC with platelet count) This test gives information about the kinds and numbers of cells in your blood. From these results, doctors can evaluate and diagnose conditions such as anemia (a low r ed blood cell count). _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 16 Getting Started | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacifi c St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Chemistry Screen (Complete Metabolic Panel) This test gives your doctor information about your general health and shows any thing that is not normal . There are different versions of this test. The most complete one measures 20 substanc es in the blood and can include glucose (blood sugar), cholesterol (a type of steroid found in the blood), and triglycerides (a form of fat). Blood Glucose Test (Included in Chemistry Screen and HbA1c) This test measures the amount of sugar in your blood. There are 3 ways this test can be done: The fasting blood sugar test is done 12 to 14 hours after your last meal. The postprandial blood sugar test is done 2 hours after a meal. A random blood sugar test is done any time . The HbA1c test tells us your ave rage blood sugar level over the last 3 months. Thyroid Test (TSH) Thyroid hormones control activity in your cells and affect your body temperature, appetite, sleep, and mental health. This test will show if your thyroid hormones are normal or too high or too low. Dietary Evaluation At your visit, your dietitian will talk with you about the diet changes you can expect after surgery and how to maintain a healthy, successful weight-loss program. The dietitian will plan a 1,000 -calorie daily diet for you to start 3 weeks before your surgery. Psychosocial Assessment Your first meeting during this time will be with a social worker for a psychosocial assessment . The purpose of this meeting is for the social worker to learn about different aspects of your life to h elp you prepare for the surgery. This visit takes about 60 to 90 minutes. The social worker will talk with you about your: Social situation : This includes your family history, current family structure, education level, financial status, and employment history. Support system : Good support from your family, friends, and community is a key factor for success with this surgery. Your support network can help provide emotional support during the surgery process, help with your physical needs after surgery, and h elp you make lifestyle changes that will help you get the most benefit from your surgery. You will talk with your social worker about your support system and will help you develop additional support, if needed.

The arterial blood gas portion of the test shows the amount of oxygen in your blood. Swallowing Test This test measures how well your swallowing muscles and esophagus work. Upper GI X -ray Study or Endoscopy Patients who have symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, heartburn, or belching sour fluid may have a hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux (also called acid reflux, o r GERD), peptic ulcer, or other health issues. Up to 15% of patients (15 out of 100) who have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux show early changes in the lining of their esophagus. These changes could be an early sign of esophageal cancer. It is important to find these changes if they are there so that a treatment program can be planned, if needed. Upper Endoscopy Patients with symptoms or signs of reflux disease or swallowing problem s may need an endoscopy . To do this, your doctor uses a lighted flexible scope or tube to look for any problems in the lining of your esophagus and stomach. It can also check for a hernia (hole) in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the large muscle between the chest and abdomen. Gallbladder Ultrasound If you still have your gal lbladder, this test shows whether or not you have gallstones or any blockages in your bile duct system. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 18 Getting Started | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacifi c St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Sleep Study (Sleep Apnea Testing) The sleep study checks for abnormal stopping of breathing, called apnea . During apnea, the airway is blocked when your throat relaxes during sleep. This condition is linked to a high death rate. After your bariatric surgery, you will be given pain medicines that affect your normal breathing and reflexes. An airway blockage such as apnea is more dangerous at this time. I t is important that we know before your surgery what to expect so that we are prepared to handle it. Medicine Consult Your surgeon may order an evaluation by UWMC medicine specialists. These specialists will assess your medical risk for surgery and will he lp the bariatric surgeon manage other medical condition s, such as diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease, while you are in the hospital after surgery. Cardi ac Evaluation A basic cardiac evaluation shows whether your heart function is normal or abnormal, whether there is any damage in your heart , and other information about your heart muscle. Other cardiac tests show how your heart muscle contracts, how your heart valves are working, and how your heart responds when it works harder, such as when you exerci se. Electrocardiogram (EKG) The EKG gives information about your heart function. It is the main test used for diagnosing heart disease. Echocardiogram This ultrasound picture shows the heart while it is working . It helps your surgeon assess the condition of your heart muscle and valves. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy You will have a basic assessment of your physical abilities before surgery. We require 90 minutes of exercise a week for people who will have weight loss surgery. You received an exercise log at the Bariatric Seminar. Please tell our team if you need another log. Test Results and Your Second Clinic Visit When the Bariatric Team coordinator has received the results of all of the tests and consultations you have had, you will be sched uled for a second clinic visit to see your surgeon or nurse practitioner. Allow 3 hours for this visit. At this visit, your surgeon or nurse practitioner will review all of the results with you and let you know if you are a candidate for weight loss surge ry at UWMC. Or, they may tell you that you must meet more requirements before you are ready for surgery. You may have many different types of tests to make sure your body can handle the stress of weight loss surgery. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 19 Getting Started | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacifi c St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 If you are a candidate for weight loss surgery, these things will occur next : We will ask you to read and sign consent forms for your surgery. You will have a physical exam. Your bariatric nurse will review the self -care instructions you will need to follow before and after your surgery . You will need to start a 1,000 -calorie -a-day diet. Your bariatric dietitian will teach you about this diet. After thi s second visit, the Patient Care Coordinator ( PCC) will get authorization from your health insurance company to cover your bariatric surgery. Once the surgery is authorized, the P CC will call you to schedule a surgery date. Most times, surgeries are schedu led 4 to 8 weeks after your second clinic visit. Weight Loss Surgery Research A research coordinator may contact you about having blood tests done after your surgery. These tests are done at specific times after surgery to assess how the surgery has affected your health. Please see page 24 in the section \"Preparing for Surgery \" in this manual for more information about meeting with a research coordinator.

You may need to make changes in your diabetes medicine while you are on the VLCD. You will need to check your blood sugars often. Your doctor will tell you when and how often to test your blood sugars. Do not use low-carbohydrate supplement d rinks or low -carbohydrate frozen meals. Your body needs carbohydrates while you are on the VLCD. If you get low blood sugar while on the VLCD, treat your symptoms with \u00bd cup fruit juice followed by \u00bd sandwich or crackers with cheese or peanut butter. What You Will Learn at Your Clinic Visit At your clinic visit before surgery, your nurse will give you some educational handouts and review what you must do and not do before and after surgery. Your nurse will also talk with you about possible complications or problems that could occur after surgery, and when you should call for help. You will receive contact phone numbers for the Center for Bariatric Surgery Clinic and the after -hours line. Keep these numbers by your phone. Also keep them in your wallet or in your cell phone so they are handy if you are away from home and need to call for advice. The nurse will talk with you and your family or support person about equipment and supplies that you might need to buy after surgery. These may include a hospital bed, a commode (portable toilet), and a shower chair. The nurse will also make sure you and your family are able to prepare your meals after you get home from the hospital. It is best to have a family member or support person who can stay with you for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery to help prepare meals and provide care as needed. If You Have Diabetes If you have diabetes, your nurse will remind you to schedule an appointment after surgery with your doctor who manages your diabetes. This visit should take place 1 week after you go home from the hospital or care facility. At this visit, your doctor should check your blood sugar levels and adjust your diabetes medicines, if needed. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 23 Preparing for Surgery | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

The group is made up of pre - and post- surgery patients. It is a great way to learn firsthand from the experiences of others. It is also gives you the chance to network with and get support from others facing similar challenges. Meeting with a Research Coordinator University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) participates in many research projects that study how different procedu res contribute to the prevention and treatment of diseases linked to obesity. Participating in research at UWMC is voluntary. Your choice about taking part in a study will not affect your surgery or clinical care in any way. Once you have started your clinic work -up for surgery, a research coordinator may contact you with more information about possible weight loss research studies. These studies are related to obesity, weight loss, and surgery. Most times, research studies are done when you come in for you r clinical care, and do not require a lot of extra time. If you would like to speak with a research coordinator, please e -mail sorce@u.washington.edu , or ask your surgeon about research projects related to your health condition.

Pacific St., Seattle, WA 9819 5 | 206- 598- 2274 This section of the Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery explains what to expect on the day of your surgery. Arriving at the Hospital On the day of your weight loss surgery, come to the Surgery Center reception desk on the 2nd floor of the Surgery Pavilion to be admitted. At this time, you will: Fill out forms. Change into a hospital go wn. Have your vital signs checked. Be weighed to make sure your pre-surgery diet was successful. Have an intravenous (IV) line placed in your arm or in another site. This IV will be used to give you fluid and medicine during and after surgery. Preparation Next, you will see your anesthesiologist and other members of the health care team that will be caring for you over the next several hours. Your health care team will ask questions about your health, any other experiences you have had with surgery and anes thesia, and how you respond to pain medicines. You may be asked some questions more than once, but each of your providers must learn about your medical history so that they can provide the best and safest care for you. This is also a good time for you to ask any questions you have. This part of preparation takes about 2 hours. You may have a family member or friend with you for support during much of this time. When you move to the room next to the operating room, where preparations are completed, we will a sk your support person to go to the waiting room off the 2nd floor skybridge that connects the Surgery Pavilion with the main hospital.

Center for Bariatric Surgery : 206 -598-2274 After Surgery Gastric bypass and s leeve gastrectomy surgery takes about 3 to 4 hours. Gastric band surgery takes 1 to 2 hours. When your surgery is over, your surgeon will meet briefly with your family or friends in the waiting room. You will be in the recovery room for 1 to 3 hours right after surgery. You will be watched closely during this time. In the recovery room: Your vital signs will be checked often to make sure you are recovering as expected. You may feel confused as you are waking up. You will still have your IV in place, and you will be receiving oxygen. You will have wraps on your lower legs that gently infl ate with air and squeeze to help with blood flow to prevent blood clots. These are called sequential compression devices (SCDs). You may have a tube in your throat to help with breathing. Also, if you had gastric bypass surgery: You will have a catheter (tube) to drain urine from your bladder. You may have tubes for draining fluids from your abdomen. Your Hospital Stay When you leave the recovery room, you may be moved directly to your private room, where you will be for the rest of your hospital stay. If you need to be watched more closely when you leave the recovery room, you will be moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) for the next 24 to 48 hours. Gastric bypass patients will most likely be in the hospital for 2 to 3 days. Gastric banding and s leeve gastrectomy patients should expect to be in the hospital overnight and be discharged the next morning. UW MEDICINE | PATIEN T EDUCATION _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 27 Your Hospital Stay | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206- 598- 2274 This section of the Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery describes what to expect during your stay in the hospital . It includes separate instructions for gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy patients, and laparoscopic gastric band patients. Pain No medicine can completely get rid of pain. The goal is to lessen your pain so that you can move around, take deep breaths, and cough. Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Patients Laparoscopic Gastric Band Patients You will have pain after your surgery. Once you are in your hospital room, you may have a patient -controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. This computerized machine allows you to give yourself pain medicine by pressing a button on a hand -held control. Only you may use the PCA. Do not let anyone else press the button. The PCA unit will not allow you to give yourself too much medi cine. It can give you a set amount of pain medicine only at certain time intervals. A nurse will set the PCA computer at the dose and time interval that your doctor prescribes. Your pain will be well -managed using this method of pain control. If you do n ot have a PCA, you will receive your pain medicine through your IV or by intramuscular injection (a shot into a muscle). You will have pain after your surgery, even though your incisions are small. You will receive pain medicine that is similar to what you will take once you are discharged from the hospital. Your Hospital Stay For weight loss surgery patients | | | | Be sure to ask your nurse if you have any questions about your care. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 28 Your Hospital Stay | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center fo r Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Tubes and Drains Gastric Bypass Patients When you are in the operating room, you will have a catheter placed in your bladder. It will drain your urine into a drainage bag. The catheter will be remov ed in the first few days after surgery. Your doctor may also order other types of tubes, such as a gastrostomy tube (a tube placed in your bypassed stomach). Breathing Exercises The anesthetic used in surgery causes mucus to form in your lungs. Coughing and deep breathing help clear this mucus. Your nurse will show you how to do deep -breathing exercises using a hand -held device called an incentive spirometer. You must cough and deep -breathe several times each hour after surgery until you go home. After leaving the hospital, you should: Take 8 to 10 deep breaths with your incentive spirometer each hour during the day. Cough often to bring up any mucus or phlegm. You may have some discomfort when you do your deep -breathing exercises, but it is very important to do them. These exercises will help keep you from getting pneumonia or an upper respiratory infection. Activity After Surgery You can help prevent complications by being active after your surgery . This lowers your chance of getting pneumonia or upper r espiratory infections, blood clots in your legs or lungs, and constipation. After your surgery, you will have sequential compression devices (SCDs) on your legs. These inflate with air and gently squeez e your legs , and then slowly deflate as they releas e the air. SCDs help with blood flow and help prevent blood clots in your legs. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 29 Your Hospital Stay | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center fo r Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

You will at least sit on the edge of your bed and dangle your feet over the side. For all your meals, you will either sit in a chair or sit up in bed. The morning after surgery, your nurse will help y ou walk from your bed to the doorway and, if you are able, in the hallway. Each day, you will get out of bed and walk 2 to 3 times a day in the hallway. Your nurse will help you until you are strong enough to walk on your own. Walking helps expand your lungs and increases your circulation, which keeps blood clots from forming. Your nurse will remove your SCDs before you take your daily walks. A dietitian will meet with you to help you get started with your new diet. Your first meals will be clear liquids su ch as broth and sugar -free Jell- O. Soon you will be able to add other liquids, such as milk and protein supplements. Your nurse s, occupational therapists, and physical therapists will help you and assess your progress. They will make sure that you can safely take care of yourself when you leave the hospital. After surgery, you will go to the recovery room for 1 to 3 hours. You will be watched closely during this time. Your total time in the hospital is expected to be overnight, with discharge home the mor ning after surgery. Being active soon after surgery will help prevent complications. Complications that may occur after surgery include pneumonia, blood clots in your legs, constipation, and others. You will need to get out of bed and begin walking as soon as possible. Your nurse or a physical therapist can assist you if you need help. The SCDs on your legs will be removed before you begin walking. Medicines Before you leave the hospital, a pharmacist will review your discharge medicines with you. Medicine s in pill form will need to be crushed or split. You should have a pill splitter at home to split large pills. You can buy a pill splitter at any drugstore.

Not all medicines can be crushed or split. If yo u have not yet talked with your pharmacist or primary care doctor about how to take all your medicines, talk with the hospital pharmacist before you leave the hospital. Your primary care doctor may need to prescribe substitute medicines for any that cannot be crushed or split. Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Patients Right after surgery, you will receive a medicine to prevent blood clots or a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from forming in your legs or lungs. DVTs are more common after surgery because you are less active. At first, your nurse may give you injections of this medicine. Before you leave the hospital, a pharmacist will teach you how to give yourself the injections. You will give yourself the injection 2 times a day as soon as you are able, fo r a total of 28 days after surgery. A family member or friend can be taught to give you these injections if you are unable to do so. The syringes you will use are pre -loaded with the medicine, and the needles are short and thin. You will receive written i nstructions and a video to take home. Bowel Care You will begin taking stool softeners while you are in the hospital to help prevent constipation. Keep taking these as long as you are on pain medicines, unless you are told otherwise. Leaving the Hospita l When you leave the hospital, it is best to have a support person who can be with you for 1 to 2 weeks. If you live more than a 2 -hour drive away, you will be advised to stay in the Seattle area for at least 7 days after your discharge from the hospital . You may wish to stay in the area until your 1st follow -up visit. This visit will be 2 weeks after your surgery.

Together, you will adjust your diet to make sure you stay well -nourished while you are losing weight. Going H ome After weight loss surgery | | | | Call your nurse or the surgery resident on call right away if you have any of the symptoms listed on this page. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 32 Going Home | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Here are basic guidelines for eating when you go home: Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Patients Laparoscopic Gastric Band Patients At home, you will follow a blended diet until your first clinic visit. Pay attention to the foods you eat: what you are eating, the consistency of the food (how thick or thin it is), how often you eat, how much you eat, and how quickly you eat. If you eat too much too quickly , or if you advance your diet too soon, you may have nausea and vomiting. At your first clinic visit after surgery, you will meet with the dietitian to talk about advancing your diet to soft, easy - to-chew foods. It is important to eat and drink during this time, even if you do not feel hungry. Right after surgery, your first meals will be clear liquids such as Jell -O and broth. As your diet advances, you can include full liquids like milk and protein sup plements. Once you go home, you will follow the Full Liquid Diet until your first clinic visit. At this visit, you will meet with the dietitian to talk about advancing your diet to a Pureed Blended Diet. It is important to eat and drink during this time, even if you do not feel hungry. See Section 10, \"Lifestyle and Diet Changes,\" for more information. If you cannot solve your eating issue on your own , please call your dietitian. Pain You should expect to have pain after surgery, and it may last for several weeks. You will go home with liquid pain medicine to help keep you comfortable. Pain can be caused by your incisions, swelling, or stress on your muscles. Pain may also come from eating too fast or too much at a time. Remember to eat slowly, chew your f ood well, and follow portion recommendations. Incision Pain You may have pain around your incisions. Place a small ice pack over your incisions for short periods to help reduce this pain. Be sure to wrap the ice pack in a clean towel or cloth to protect yo ur skin. If your incisions become swollen, red, or more tender, call your nurse. Your pain medicine should help with incision pain. You may also be able to take liquid acetaminophen (Tylenol) for more relief. Check with your doctor or nurse before taking a ny medicines other than the medicines that were prescribed for you. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 33 Going Home | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Constipation Constipation can cause stomach pain. Be sure to take your stool softener, drink plenty of fluids, and walk every day. You may also take laxatives as advised by your doctor. Call your nurse right away if you have: Severe constipation with pain that is getting worse, Stomach distention (bloating), and Vomiting These symptoms can be signs of a more serious problem, such as a bowel obstruction. Gas Pains You may also have gas p ains. To help ease these pains: Try an over -the-counter medicine that contains simethicone. Avoid carbonated drinks and vegetables in the cabbage family, since they can cause intestinal gas. You may also have cramping, diarrhea, and dumping syndrome (wea kness, dizziness, nausea, and fast heart beat right after eating). Talk with your dietitian and change your diet as needed to stop or prevent these types of pain. Muscle Pain The type s of pain you have will change over time. Your surgical pain will slowly lessen. Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Patients Laparoscopic Gastric Band Patients Most patients who have had gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy surgery do not need regular doses of prescription pain medicines after the first 2 to 3 weeks after surgery. Most patients who have had gastric band surgery do not need regular doses of prescription pain medicines after the first 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. As you become more active and begin using muscles that haven't worked hard for a long time, you may have more pain or soreness in other areas. This pain may occur only when you are in certain positions or move a certain way, and it will not be constant. Use warm packs or ice packs and take acetaminophen (Tylenol), as needed. You may also get relief fr om a warm shower or relaxing bath. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 34 Going Home | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598- 2274 Fatigue You should expect to feel fatigued (very tired) and have low energy after major surgery. Prescription pain medicine can also make you feel sleepy. You may need to take nap s from time to time. But, you should also resist the urge to stay in bed. Walking and other exercise will help increase your energy and stamina. Start out slowly and increase your activity every day. What to Expect During Your First Weeks at Home Recovery from major surgery takes about 4 to 6 wee ks. Healing after surgery goes on for as long as a year. Your recovery will depend on many factors, such as the type of surgery you had, your medical condition before surgery, and any complications after surgery. Your first several days at home after surge ry will likely be overwhelming. You may feel tired or weak. You may feel anxious or unsure, and even a little depressed. We require you to have a support person at home with you for at least part of each day for the first 1 to 2 weeks. Your support person can help with meals, shopping, chores, personal care, driving, and even child or pet care.

At your follow -up visits with your surgeon , we will assess your progress and talk about other activi ties for you to begin. Some of the activities that we encourage you to try are: Using an exercise bicycle (stationary bike) Water aerobics Daily walks Walk -a-thons Doing these activities will burn calories. Exercising and following the eating plan your dietitian and surgeon have recommended will help you lose weight. Some patients may need to work with a physical therapist or an occupational therap ist to help them do some activities. Walk as much as you can without getting overly tired. Each week, as you are recovering from your surgery, try to increase the distance you are walking and your activity level in general. This will help you get your strength back faster. You will need to follow a good exercise and eating plan for the rest of your life. Your surgery is a tool to help you lose weight. Exercise and the proper diet will help you lose the weight and keep it off. See Section 10, \"Lifestyle and Diet Changes,\" to learn more .

Wound Care If you had open surgery, you will have 1 incision that goes straight down the middle of your belly. This incision will be held together with deep stitches, and your skin will be closed with surgical staples. The staples will be removed at your first clinic visit after surgery. The stitches will dissolve over time. If you had laparoscopic surgery , you will have 4 to 5 small incisions. These will be c losed with stitches and Steri -Strips (thin strips of tape) . You may take a shower while y our staples or Steri -Strips are in place. Make sure that you: Simply let the soap and water wash over the incision(s). Do not scrub the incision(s). Pat the incision(s) dry with a clean towel. Do not put any creams or ointments on the incision(s). Some ooz ing of pink fluid is common.

You may have to crush the medicine or take it in a liquid form for the first 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. After that, most patients can handle a pill the size of an aspirin or smaller, one pill at a time. If you have a ny questions about your medicines, ask your pharmacist. Or, check with any member of your Bariatric Surgery Team. Emotional Changes After surgery, you may feel more emotional than usual. This is normal and usually goes away after a week or so. If you are upset, or just need someone to talk to, please call your primary care provider, or any member of your Bariatric Surgery Team. They will help you get in touch with the best person to help you. Vomiting Vomiting may be caused by eating too fast or too much, or from drinking fluids with meals. If you vomit, think about what may have caused it. If you cannot find a reason, call any member of your Bariatric Surgery Team. Keep a food diary to help us find the reason for your vomiting. Bowel Care Constipation is common after weight loss surgery, especially while you are taking opioid pain medicine. It is important not to become constipated. You may need to take a stool softener for 1 month after surgery. These tips may help you have a bowel movement: Eat applesauce , oatmeal, or pureed prunes daily. Drink plenty of water. Exercise often. If you still do not have a bowel movement, try a suppository such as Dulcolax, a Fleets enema, or milk of magnesia. If these options do not work after 2 tries, call your health care provider. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 43 Follow-up | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206- 598- 2274 Prevent Pregnancy Many women who have been obese and unable to become pregnant find that they can get pregnant during the weight -loss phase. We strongly advise that you NOT get pregnant for at least 18 months after your surgery. It is very import ant that you use an effective birth control method during this time. These are 2 main reasons to avoid getting pregnant during this time: This is when you will lose the most weight, and your body will need to adjust to the changes. Many women do not have e nough folic acid, vitamin B12, and iron in their bodies after surgery. These deficiencies (shortages) can cause permanent or fatal birth defects in a developing fetus. Medical Alert Jewelry You may want to wear medical alert jewelry after you have had weight loss surgery. This is very important if you cannot digest pills, tablets, or capsules, or if you have any of these conditions: Asthma Food allergies Hypertension Autism Heart disease Latex allergies Diabetes Hemophilia Parkinson's disease Epilepsy One company that sells medical alert jewelry is Medic Alert.

E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 This section of the Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery describes self - care, coping with lifestyle changes, and diet instructions before and after surgery. You will need to make major changes in your lifestyle and in your relationship with your body for your weight loss s urgery to succeed. The changes you go through during and after this surgery can have a strong effect on your emotions. You may find that you struggle with body image issues as your physical condition changes. If you had trauma or abuse in the past, old feelings these events caused may come up as you lose weight. If you are already dealing with emotional issues, going through the surgery can make some of those feelings and concerns even stronger. It is very important for you to ask for help if any of the c hanges you go through after surgery begin to cause you distress. Weight loss surgery support groups are a good way to connect with others who have had the surgery and may have the same kinds of feelings. Mental health counselors can also help you sort thro ugh your emotions and adjust to the big changes caused by weight loss surgery. Not addressing the emotional issues you have after surgery can affect how well you will be able to stick to lifestyle changes, and this can affect your success after surgery. Coping with the Changes Your social worker can talk with you about the lifestyle changes, reactions, and stresses that occur during and after gastric bypass surgery. If needed, your social worker can also provide brief supportive counseling and can refer you to agencies, community resources, or mental health professionals to help you cope with these changes. Lifestyle and Diet Changes Self-care f or weight loss surgery patients | | | | Changes in your l ifestyle and diet are vital to the success of your weight loss surgery. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 46 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Your social worker will be available to talk with you both before and after your surgery. Good Nutrition Is Vital! Weight loss surgery by itself does not make you lose weight. Changes in diet and exercise help you lose weight. The weeks and months after weight loss surgery are a good time for you not only to lose weight, but also to make changes in your diet that can improve your overall health. There are many nutrients, including water, that are needed for good health. No single food or food group can supply all the nutrients your body needs, so it is important to choose from a variety of foods. The 4 basic nutrients your body needs are: Carbohydrates Proteins Fats Water At first, you will need to mak e sure you get enough protein, but carbohydrates , fats, and water are just as important. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates, also called \"carbs,\" are the main source of energy for your body. Your brain and muscl es need carbs for fuel. Complex carbs such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and cereals provide the most vitamins and minerals. They also provide fiber, which helps your intestines work well. Other carbs, such as refined grains (white bread and oth ers) and sugary foods or drinks, do not supply as many nutrients. Eat these less often than whole grains . Protein You need p rotein to build and maintain your muscles, help your body heal, and keep your blood strong. Protein also supplies energy. After surg ery, you will need about 60 grams of protein every day. Since you will be able to eat only small amounts of food at first, it will be important for most of your calories to come from protein. Lean protein sources include chicken, turkey, fish, extra lean ground beef, yogurt, and beans. See the table on the next page for a more complete list of protein foods and serving sizes. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 47 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Sources of Protein Protein Goal: 60 grams per day Servings per day: At least 8 One \"serving\" of protein provides about 7 grams of protein. This table gives the serving sizes of some common protein -rich foods. Protein Source Serving Size Cheese, low -fat 1 ounce Grated cheese, low -fat \u00bc cup Grated parmesan 2 \u00bc cup Puddi ng, sugar -free, nonfat milk \u00be cup Milk, nonfat 1 cup Dry powdered milk \u00bc cup Yogurt, nonfat \u00be cup Egg 1 whole Egg substitute \u00bc cup Chicken, pork, beef, or fish 1 ounce Tuna fish, packed in water 2 tablespoons Peanut butter, creamy 2 tablespoons Dried beans (cooked) \u00bd cup Tofu, firm \u00bc cup Nuts (all varieties) 1 ounce (25 pieces) Shellfish, crab, lobster, shrimp 2 ounces Protein drinks and protein powders (see \"Recipes and Diet Suggestions\") 14 to 25 grams of protein (2 to 3 protein servings) Meat Servings This table will help you estimate the amount of protein in meat servings: Meat Serving Protein Servings Average hamburger patty 3 3-inch by 4 -inch steak 4 1 pork chop 3 \u00bd chicken breast 3 1 chicken thigh 2 1 chicken wing 1 3-inch by 3 -inch fish fillet 3 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 48 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Protein Drinks and Protein Powders Protein drinks and protein powder are other good sources of protein. Each serving has 14 to 25 grams of protein, which equals 2 to 3 protein servings. A few stores that carry protein drinks and powders are Fred Meyer, GNC, Target, Trader Joe's, Costco , and Walmart. See \"Recipes and Diet Suggestions\" for a list of protein drinks you may want to try. Fat Fat is also a source of energy for your body. It adds flavor to food, helps you feel full longer by tak ing more time to digest, and helps your body absorb some vitamins and minerals. But, fat has twice as many calories per gram as either protein or carbohydrates, so it should be used in small amounts. A teaspoon of butter , margarine, salad dressing , sour c ream, and oil ha ve about 50 calories. When you want a little fat for flavor or texture, choose small amounts of heart -friendly fats like nuts, avocado, olive oil, or flaxseed oil. Water Water is the most important of all nutrients. It makes up about 60% o f your body weight. Your body needs water for all of its functions. To keep from getting dehydrated, drink at least 8 cups of water every day. You will need even more during hot weather and when you exercise. Drinking water may decrease your appetite by helping you feel full longer. Reading Nutrition Labels Reading \"Nutrition Facts\" labels when you shop takes a little more time, but seeing what is in foods can help you make better choices. The tips o n the next page will help you use the information on nutri tion labels. If you have any special concerns about nutrition , ask your dietitian for help reading and using labels to help you make the best possible food choices. Drink at least 8 cups of water every day . _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 49 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Serving Size Check the amount of food shown as 1 serving on the Nutrition Facts label. Thi s label says that 1 cup equals 1 serving. This may not be the amount you eat, but it is the amount that contains the nutrients listed. Sometimes what we think is 1 portion may actually be 2 or more. Calories The calorie section of the label shows how man y calories are in 1 serving of the food . You do not need to count calories every day, but it is important to know which foods are high or low in calories. Multiply the calorie content by the number of servings to find out how many calories are in the whole package. For example, this package contains a total of 520 calories (260 calories times 2 servings). Nutrient Information The Nutrition Facts label also shows how much carbohydrate, protein, fat, sodium, cholesterol, and some vitamins and minerals are in a serving of the food. This information is especially helpful if you are on a diet to help manage diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Meeting Your Nutritional Needs After weight loss surgery, the amount of food you can eat at one time is limited. Eating less food and changing your eating habits will help you lose weight. Since the amount of food that you can eat is limited, it is very important to choose your foods carefully to make sure you get all the nutrients you need. Follow these step s to stay in good health after weight loss surgery: 1. Eat a variety of foods from each food group every day. 2. Eat high- protein foods at each meal. The goal is to eat at least 60 grams of protein every day. You may need to use protein drinks the first few mo nths to meet this goal. Always eat protein foods first. (See \"Sources of Protein\" and \"Protein Drinks and Protein Powders\" on page 48 of this section.) 3. Choose good quality foods that are low in calories and contain a variety of nutrients - especially prote in, vitamins, and minerals. Good examples are low -fat meats, poultry, nonfat milk and yogurt, fruits, vegetables, brown rice, and whole grains. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 50 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 4. Avoid foods that are high in calories and low in vitamins and minerals. Sugars (such as soda pop and desserts) a nd fats (such as potato chips, fried foods, and salad dressings) add a lot of calories and very few or no nutrients, and they may cause dumping syndrome (see page 51 of this section). 5. Drink plenty of calorie -free fluids - about 64 ounces every day, includi ng at least 4 cups of water. Drink between meals, not with meals. 6. Take a multivitamin with iron every day. Iron helps your body develop healthy red blood cells. Try chewable multivitamins for adults (1 a day), chewables for children such as Flintstones (2 a day), or liquid vitamins with iron, such as Theragram. 7. Take calcium with vitamin D 3 every day. Calcium and vitamin D are needed for healthy strong bones. The recommended daily amount is 1,500 milligrams (mg) calcium and 2,000 international units (IU) vitamin D. Your multivitamin will contain some vitamin D. Calcium is absorbed best when divided into 2 or 3 doses. Try chewable calcium tablets such as Caltrate, calcium chews such as Viactiv or Citracal, or TUMS Extra Strength (4 tablets per day). Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Patients Start taking vitamin B12 6 weeks after surgery . Vitamin B12 keeps red blood cells healthy and helps your nervous system work properly. You will need to take a vitamin B12 pill ( 500 mcg) every day or have a B12 ( 1,000 mcg) s hot every month for the rest of your life. How to Avoid Problems with Eating Stop eating as soon as you feel full. At first, you may feel full after drinking only 1 to 2 ounces of liquid. In time, you will be able to take in \u00bd to 1 cup of solid food . Never eat more than 1\u00bd cups at a meal. Become aware of how you feel when you are getting full. You may feel pressure just below your ribs, pain in or near your stomach, or you may feel sick to your stomach. When you begin solids, try only one new food pe r meal. Take only 1 or 2 bites and see if you can handle the new food. If you cannot handle it well at first, wait 1 or 2 weeks and try it again. Eat slowly and chew your food well. It is easy to overeat and swallow chunks of food when you eat quickly. Che w well. Count the number of chews per mouthful, and aim for 25 chews. Give yourself at least 30 to 40 minutes to eat each meal. Take small bites and put your fork down between each bite. Try not to skip meals. Missing a meal can lead to hunger and eating too quickly later. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 51 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Drink slowly, and drink only calorie -free beverages. Liquids pass right through your stomach, so many liquid calories can cause weight gain. Avoid juice, alcohol, and regular soft drinks. Limit your coffee intake to 1 cup a day. Do not dr ink liquids 30 minutes before or after meals. Drinking liquids with solid foods may cause dumping syndrome (see the last section on this page) , discomfort, or make you feel too full. Keep foods moist. Try using low -fat gravies and sauces. It may be hard to tolerate : - Tough meats (unless they are ground or chopped) - Soft rice (like instant, processed, or Japanese sticky rice) , pasta, and untoasted or soft bread - Skins of fresh fruits and vegetables - Fibrous or chewy vegetables (such as celery and corn) - Spicy foo ds - Seeds, nuts, and popcorn - Greasy or fried foods If you have a day when you cannot tolerate any foods or liquids, stop eating for up to 6 hours. Try to find out what caused the problem. Ask yourself: - Did I eat too much? - Did I eat too fast? - Did I chew well enough? - Did I eat high -sugar or fatty foods? - Did I drink too much liquid with my meal? - Am I drinking enough liquid between meals ? Start again with clear liquids (broth, Jell -O, clear juices, tea) and advance your diet slowly after your symptoms go away . Dumping Syndrome After weight loss surgery, foods and liquids enter your small intestine more quickly. This may cause dumping syndrome to occur after eating. This syndrome may cause bloating, nausea, diarrhea, weakness, and sweating. It usually less ens over time. To help avoid dumping syndrome: Eat 3 to 5 small meals a day. Drink fluids with meals only if needed. Eat and drink slowly and chew foods well . Do not eat or drink foods that are high in sugar or fat. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 52 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 About Calories Patients often ask, \"How many calories do I need?\" After weight loss surgery, we do not ask you to eat only a certain number of calories. But, we do ask you to pay attention to how your stomach feels, and to stop eating when you feel full. Your dietitian will review your diet at e ach visit to find out if the amount you are eating is helping you lose the right amount of weight. Remember that even small bites of some foods can contain a lot of calories without giving you much nutrition. If you have questions, ask your dietitian.

Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Think Before You Drink After surgery, it is important to drink enough calorie -free fluids (about 64 ounces) every day to keep you well -hydrated. Keep in mind that most beverages have a lot of calories. Fruit juice , fruit drinks, soda, milk, and lattes all have about 100 calories in an 8 -ounce cup. Just a few servings of these drinks each day can easily add 300 calories to your daily diet. This table shows how the calories in drinks can add up: Beverage Calories 1 cup orange juice 120 1 cup cranberry juice drink 140 1 grande nonfat latte 160 1 margarita, daiquiri, or pi\u00f1a colada 325 12 ounces regular cola 150 1 beer 150 6 ounces red or white wine 150 1 cup nonfat milk 90 1 cup lemonade 120 Alcoholic Beverages After weight loss surgery, alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream more qu ickly and in higher concentrations than before . Drinking even a small amount can affect you, especially on an empty stomach. Limit your alcohol intake to only a few sips, or skip it completely. Alcoholic beverages also have a lot of calories and can throw you off your weight loss plan. We recommend that you do NOT drink alcoholic beverages on a regular basis. Some patients have problems with drinking too much alcohol after surgery. Tell your doctor if you find yourself drinking more than usual after surger y. See \"Alcohol Use Disorder\" on pages 69 and 70 for more information. How much is a serving? Unless you always use your kitchen scale and measuring cups, it can be hard to figure out the right portion sizes. Here are some quick ways to figure out about ho w much you are eating. A thumb tip = 1 teaspoon A thumb = 1 ounce of meat or cheese Deck of cards = 3 ounces of cooked meat, poultry, or fish _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 54 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Tennis ball = \u00be cup Golf ball = \u00bc cup Ice cream scoop = \u00bd cup Pair of dice = 1 ounce Small fist = 1 cup Dining Out Going to restaurants or parties can be challenging with your new diet. Be sure to stick to the foods allowed on your current diet stage. Do not try foods you have not tried before. If you are having a hard time handling foods, it may be best to eat at home for several weeks. Restaurants Here are some tips to make eating out easier: Start with a broth -based soup and crackers instead of bread and salad. Order an appetizer -sized meal as your main course. Try to choose protein items such as shrimp cocktail or grilled chicken skewers. Ask for a children's or seniors' menu so you can order smaller portions. Ask a member of your health care team how to get a bariatric dining card. The card lets the restaurant know that your doctor recommends that you eat small portions. Remove breading from deep -fried meats such as chicken tenders or fish. Avoid french fries and potato chips. Avoid all -you-can- eat restaurants such as buffets. It is tempting to overeat to \"get your money's worth.\" Avoid sweet drinks and desserts. They may cause dumping syndrome, and they are often high in calories. Remember to chew well and eat slowly. Don't let the conversation distract you into eating too fast or overeating. Remember to stop as soon as you start to feel full. Ask f or a \"to -go\" box right away so you are not tempted to clean your plate. Parties These tips can help you stay with your diet plan when you go out to parties and gatherings where food will be served: Call ahead and ask the host or hostess what types of food to expect. Check out the whole table first to see what your best options are. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 55 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Limit alcohol and other sweet drinks. Choose water or other calorie -free beverages instead. Limit desserts. Bring a dish to share that you know you can eat . Shrimp platters, devi led eggs, or chicken dishes are good, high -protein crowd -pleasers. See \"Recipes and Diet Suggestions\" for recipes for Chicken and Peanut Wraps, Perfect Deviled Eggs, and Shrimp Dippers. Mindful Eating Patients often tell us that they struggle with food cho ices after surgery. \"Impulse eating\" means being tempted to eat, often when you are not even hungry. It may bring pleasure for a moment, but it often causes feelings of guilt and regret later. Impulse eating can be triggered by getting too hungry, being ar ound food at a party or in the grocery store, or seeing food ads on TV. You may also eat for emotional reasons, such as being bored, angry, stressed, frustrated, sad, or lonely. You can avoid impulse eating with a mindful approach. Try some of these ideas: Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time to make it easier to make smart food choices when it is time to eat. Time your meals and snacks so that you do not get too hungry. \"Urgent\" hunger may make you overeat or choose higher calorie foods. Shop often so that you always have fresh, healthy foods and snacks on hand. When you feel the urge to eat , try eating some fruit or vegetables first, or drink a calorie -free beverage. Eat in a calm envi ronment , eat slowly, and enjoy the flavors. Do not try to satisfy yo ur hunger by drinking alcohol, smoking, or going shopping. Make a list of things you like to do. When you are thinking about food and you know you are not hungry, pick one activity to distract yourself. Some ideas you might try include: - Listen or dance to your favorite music. - Take a bubble bath. - Try aromatherapy. Scents like vanilla and lavender have a soothing effect. Try candles, potpourri, or room sprays in your favorite scent. - Go for a nature walk to collect leaves, rocks, or shells, or gaze at stars. - Curl up with a blanket and read funny or inspiring books. - Call a friend. - Keep a journal about your feelings. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 56 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

Gastric Bypass Diet Stage 1: Blended/Pureed Foods Stage 1 is the first 2 weeks after surgery. During this stage, eat only foods that are the consistency of a smooth paste or thin liquid. Do not eat any chunks of solid food, even small pieces. You may only be able to eat or drink 1 to 2 ounces ( to \u00bc cup) at a time. You will need to eat often during this phase to meet your nutritional needs. Remember to eat and drink slowly. On the blended -food diet, you will be eating only \u00bc cup (2 ounces ) or less of food at a time. Introduce one new food at a time. Making Blended and Pureed Foods It is easy to make blended or pureed foods. Put solid foods in a blender or food processor, add liquid, and process to a smooth consistency. Be sure to strain out any chunks. M ake a large batch of a blended food and freeze it in ice cube trays to have small portions ready to defrost and use. Foods You Can and Cannot Eat on a Blended/Pureed Diet Food Allowed Not Allowed Beverages Water, skim milk, tea, protein drinks, nonfat/sugar -free lattes, blended drinks (see \"Recipes and Diet Suggestions\" ), and calorie -free drinks Fruit juice, fruit drinks, carbonated drinks, alcohol, whole milk, coffee drinks such as lattes or mochas with sugar and/or whole milk Soups Broth, low -fat cream so ups, blended soups, high protein soups (see \"Recipes and Diet Suggestions\" ) Regular cream soups, soups with chunks Meat and Other Protein Foods Blended meats such as lean beef, ham, fish, chicken, or turkey; baby food meats, blended low -fat cottage cheese, mashed or pureed tofu Peanut butter, cheese, fried or high -fat meats, spicy meats, all other meats and meat substitutes Grains and Breads Cooked low -fiber cereal such as Cream of Wheat, blended mashed potatoes thinned with milk Pasta, bread, rice, and all other starches _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 57 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

Continue to follow the eating guidelines in this manual. Do not eat more than \u00bd to 1 cup of solid foods at each meal. 2. Eat meals at regular meal times. Be sure to make balanced choices and include protein along with small amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Shop often so that you have a variety of fresh, healthy foods on hand. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 61 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 3. Eat only when you are hungry and stop as soon as you start to feel full. Do not feel that you need to finish th at last bite or two on your plate, or to taste something just because it is there. You can have that bite or two later, when you are hungry. 4. Limit snacks between meals. Those 100- calorie snack packs have become very popular - but remember that even an extra 250 calories a day can mean losing \u00bd pound less weight that week. 5. Drink enough fluids. Drinking at least 64 ounces of calorie -free fluids every day will help you stay well- hydrated and reduce your hunger. It is easy to think we are hungry when we are rea lly just thirsty. If you are not sure, try drinking some water before reaching for food. 6. Keep a food journal. If you are losing weight too quickly, not quickly enough, or not getting enough nutrients, keeping a journal is the best way to find out what eating changes you need to make. 7. Track your hunger level. If you find you are snacking or eating too much, you may be asked to keep a \"hunger journal.\" This journal will help you find out whether you are eating because you are hungry or for other reasons. 8. Exer cise, exercise, exercise! Exercise plays a key role in helping you reach and maintain your new lower weight - it is vital! We recommend exercising 30 minutes every day, or as your primary care provider or physical therapist advises . 9. Call your dietitian if you think your weight loss is slowing down, or any time you have questions. This is especially important when you begin to visit the clinic less often. You may want to arrange a nutrition consultation with your dietitian between your scheduled visits. You r Diet After Laparoscopic Gastric Band Surgery Adjustable gastric banding by itself doesn't make you lose weight. You will also need to change your diet and add exercise to your routine to lose weight. The weeks and months after adjustable gastric banding surgery are a good chance for you not only to lose weight, but also to make changes in your diet that can improve your overall health. The adjustable gastric banding procedure places a band around your stomach, and this makes you feel full after eating on ly a small amount of food. This banding , along with changing your eating habits and exercising more, will help you keep losing weight over time. After surgery, your diet will go through phases. Phase 1 is a clear liquid diet. You will be on clear liquids while you are in the hospital. Phase 2 is a full liquid diet. You will be on a liquid diet for 2 weeks. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 62 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

Drink only 1 or 2 ounces at a time. Stop when you feel full. Continue to drink this amount every 15 minutes, for a total of 64 ounces a day. You may have some flavored liquid foods while you are on the clear liquid diet. Foods allowed during this diet include: Jell-O Broth Pops icles Fruit juices without pulp (such as apple, cranberry, and grape) Fruit drinks Water Laparoscopic Gastric Band Diet Phase 2: Full Liquid Diet You will need to follow the full liquid diet for 2 weeks . Eat servings of 3 to 4 ounces up to 5 or 6 times pe r day. Be sure to include a protein source at each meal. If you do not tolerate milk products, you may use rice or soy milk products instead of cow's milk. For added protein, make soups and cereals with nonfat milk or plain soy milk instead of water . Or, stir nonfat dry milk or protein powder into your foods. Full Liquid Diet Choose These AVOID These Fruits and Juices Flavored water, fruit juices without pulp such as apple juice, grape juice, cranberry juice, and nectars Canned, fresh, or frozen fruits; all raw fruit, dried fruit (dates, raisins), coconut , sweetened beverages Soups Broth, bouillon, fat -free consomm\u00e9, strained cream soups, tomato soup made with milk or water Bean, gumbo, split pea, onion, and chunky soups and chowders; s oups with vegetables, noodles, rice, meat, or other chunks of food in them (strain these items from the soup and blend them or just have the broth ) _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 63 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

Once you have advanced to this diet, you will be able to eat all foods on the liquid diets plus any food that is the consistency of applesauc e. You will need to use a blender or food processor to puree regular foods to the right texture. How to Puree Foods 1. Cut the food into small pieces, the size of the tip of your thumb. 2. Place food pieces in the blender or food processor, with enou gh liquid (broth, fat -free gravy, water, or nonfat milk) to cover the blades. 3. Blend until smooth like applesauce. 4. Strain out any seeds or lumps. 5. Season with herbs or mild spices to taste. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 64 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Daily Nutrition Checklist Once you are able to eat solid foods without problems, you will need to watch your diet closely. Liq uids will pass through your stomach quickly and will not make you feel full. Because of this, you should limit drinking beverages that contain calories. Drink water, broth, tea, coffee, or other sugar -free beverages. Too much food or big chunks of food can block your stomach pouch outlet. Avoid this problem by taking only small bites at a time and chewing food well. Include 5 small meals per day that include a variety of healthy foods such as meat, vegetables, fruit, grains, and dairy products. Eat 5 small meals a day. After surgery, your small stomach pouch can hold only about \u00bd cup (4 ounces) of food. Eating more than this at one time may cause nausea or vomiting. Vomiting may cause complications such as slippage of the gastric band. Eating too much too often may also cause your stomach pouch to stretch, which will hinder your weight loss. Eat slowly and chew thoroughly. Food needs to be chewed into very small pieces for it to pass through your stomach opening. Remember to eat meals slowly and chew foods v ery well. Stop eating as soon as you feel full. Pay attention to your body. Once your stomach is full, stop eating. Eating slowly will help you learn your body's signals of fullness. This will help you not eat more than you need. Do not drink while you are eating. If you drink with a meal, the food you eat can pass through your stomach very easily, and this will reduce the effect of your lap band. Do not drink anything for 1 hour after meals. Eat only high -quality foods. Since you will only be able to eat s mall portions, every bite you take needs to be nutritio us. Eat a variety of healthy foods such as meat or other protein sources, vegetables, fruits, grains, and dairy products. These foods provide the most vitamins and minerals without extra calories. Avoi d eating foods that are high in fat and sugar. Avoid fibrous foods. Stringy foods such as asparagus, celery, orange or grapefruit membranes, and tough meats can block the stoma (the stomach outlet created by the band between the 2 parts of the stomach). It is hard to chew these foods well enough to break them into small pieces, and saliva does not break down the fiber strands in these foods. Drink enough fluids between meals. You will need to drink at least 64 ounces of fluid every day to stay well-hydrated . Avoid carbonated beverages. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 69 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surgery Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E. Pacific St., Seattle, WA 98195 | 206 -598-2274 Drink mostly calorie free -beverages. Liquids pass right through your stomach, so too many liquid calories can easily cause weight gain. For best weight loss results, drink only calorie -free beverages. Avoid fruit juice, alcoho l, and regular soft drinks. Exercise at least 45 minutes every day. You must exercise to continue to lose weight. Not only does exercise help you burn fat and calories, it also helps increase your strength, muscle mass, and endurance. Exercise has other health benefits too, such as improving blood sugar, blood cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. Take these nutritional supplements every day: - Multivitamin with iron to help you meet your nutrient needs while on a low -calorie diet. You need i ron to keep you r blood cells healthy. Here are some options: Adult chewables - 1 a day Children's chewables (such as Flintstones) - 2 a day Liquid vitamins with iron (such as Theragram) - Calcium and vitamin D 3 to help keep your bones strong. The recommended dose is 1,500 mg of calcium with 1,000 to 1,200 International Units (IU) vitamin D (including what is in your multivitamin). Calcium is best absorbed when divided into 2 to 3 doses throughout the day. Here are some options: Chewable calcium tablets (such as Caltrate) Calcium chews (such as Viactiv or Citracal) TUMS Extra Strength - 4 tablets a day Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) What is AUD? Gastric bypass surgery can be a very effective treatment for serious obesity problems . But sometimes patients increase their alcohol use after bariatric surgery. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a medical condition that may be diagnosed when a person is dependent on alcohol (alcoholic) or abuses alcohol, and their drinking causes harm or distress. We know that adults who have had bariatric s urgery have a much higher risk of alcohol use disorders 2 years after surgery . How is drinking alcohol different after surgery ? Faster effects: After surgery, your stomach pouch is much smaller than a normal stomach , so you will feel the effects of even a small amount of alcohol much more quickly than before surgery . The best advice is to limit your alcohol intake to only a few sips, or to skip it entirely. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ \u00a9 University of Washington Medical Center Published PFES: 09/2010, Online: https://healtho nline.washington.edu Page 70 Lifestyle and Diet Changes | Guide to Your Weight Loss Surge ry Center for Bariatric Surgery | Box 356165 | 1959 N.E.

UWMC clinic staff are also available to help. Surgical Specialties : 206-598-4549 Slower weight loss: Alcohol quickly changes into blood sugar , and this can slow down your weight los s. Higher risk of d umping syndrome: Alcohol can also cause dumping syndrome, which is when food goes from the stomach into the small intestine too soon . This can cause vomiting or diarrhea (see page 51) . \"Wasted\" calories : Alcoholic drinks also have very few nutrien ts, and they often are high in \"empty\" calories (calories that have no food value) . Risks for AUD Some r isks for developing AUD are: Regular alcohol use before surgery (at least 2 drinks a week) Limited social support Use of re creational drug s or smoking before surgery Men and young adults are at a slightly higher risk for hav ing issues with alcohol after bariatric surgery. Help for AUD If you are drinking more after your gastric bypass, an evaluation by a certified chemical dependency counselor may help d etermine if you have an alcohol use disorder. Your bariatric surgery social worker can provide support and refer you to a chemical dependency counselor.
