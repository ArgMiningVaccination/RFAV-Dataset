Learn more about the benefits and uses of ginger here.", "sitename": "EverydayHealth.com", "date": "2022-10-16", "cleaned_text": "Ginger not only adds delicious flavor to food \u2014 it's also full of nutrients. People have been using the root for cooking and healing for thousands of years. Ancient writings from Rome, Greece, China, and Arab countries all describe ginger's uses as a medicine. It was especially popular in Asian medicine as a treatment for stomach issues, including nausea and diarrhea. Other traditional medical uses for ginger include treating muscle and joint pain, [cold and flu](//www.everydayhealth.com/flu/guide/) symptoms, stomach pain, [menstrual cramps](/menstrual-cramps/guide/), and skin burns. ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/), [2](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/ginger)) Today, people still consider ginger a natural way to soothe an [upset stomach](/digestive-health/diet/foods-that-help-relieve-nausea/), and there's research to back up its health benefits. Ginger is also used in tons of modern recipes. Defining Ginger and Understanding What It's Good for Ginger is a tropical flowering plant that originally grew in Southeast Asia but is now widely available from growers around the world. It's classified as a member of the Zingiberaceae family, making it a close relative of [turmeric](/drugs/turmeric). ( [3](https://www.britannica.com/plant/Zingiberaceae)) The scientific name for ginger is Zingiber officinale, which is thought to come from the Sanskrit name for the spice (singabera). The leafy plant grows to about three feet tall and produces clusters of greenish-purple flowers. Ginger's root or rhizome is the part used as a spice or healing aid. Depending on the variety, the inside of the root can be yellow, red, or white. It's harvested by pulling the entire plant out of the soil, removing the leaves and cleaning the root. Ginger can be eaten fresh, dried and stored as a spice, or made into tablets, capsules, and liquid extracts. There's about 2 percent of essential oil in the root, which is used in the cosmetic industry as a fragrance in soaps and beauty products. (2) Diabetes Meal Plan: Salmon Cakes What's in Ginger Exactly? A Closer Look at Its Nutrition Facts There are lots of different vitamins and minerals in ginger. ( [4](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169231/nutrients)) 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger has: - 5 calories - 1 gram (g) of [carbohydrate](/carbohydrates/guide/) - 0.1 g of dietary fiber - 0.1 g of protein - 0 g fat - 0.1 g of sugar Vitamins and minerals present in fresh ginger in trace amounts: - Vitamin B3 and [B6](/diet-nutrition/benefits-of-vitamin-b6.aspx) - Iron [Potassium](/pictures/foods-high-in-potassium/) Zinc - Folate [Riboflavin](/drugs/riboflavin) [Niacin](/drugs/niacin) Ginger is generally considered safe when eaten as part of a healthy diet. (2) Concentrated supplements deliver the root's chemical compounds in higher doses and run the risk of causing possible side effects, like heartburn, gas, or diarrhea. What Are the Science-Backed Health Benefits of Ginger? Ginger contains more than 400 chemical compounds, but researchers believe the gingerol compounds are the ones responsible for the root's health benefits. ( [5](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/grp/2015/142979/)) They're also responsible for its smell and flavor. Gingerol has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help the body in a variety of different ways. 1. Soothes an Upset Stomach The chemical compounds in ginger are believed to ease stomach pain and aid digestion. Modern research has found evidence that it can be helpful. Ginger has long been proposed as a remedy to ease morning sickness during pregnancy \u2014 studies have shown it's a safe and possibly effective way to help reduce nausea. (1) But its ability to help with stomach issues goes beyond [pregnancy](/pregnancy/all-articles/). Ginger may also help relieve nausea and vomiting after surgery and in people going through [chemotherapy](//www.everydayhealth.com/news/chemotherapy/). ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4818021/)) Eating ginger may improve indigestion symptoms by helping the stomach empty faster. One small study found that taking 1.2 g of ginger capsules before a meal sped up the digestion process in people with indigestion. ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016669/)) 2. Reduces Inflammation Ginger is sometimes taken as a [supplement for rheumatoid arthritis](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/home-remedies/) and [osteoarthritis](/osteoarthritis/guide/) (two painful conditions causing joint damage). Since ginger is an anti-inflammatory, it may also be able to ease joint pain due to inflammation from arthritis. An older study found that people with knee osteoarthritis who took ginger extract had less pain and used less pain medication. But they did experience some mild stomach upset because of the higher concentration of ginger extract. ( [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11710709/)) More recent research has focused on applying ginger extract to the skin of the painful joint. ( [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26591397/)) Topical ginger treatments may be effective in reducing arthritis pain without causing the side effects. ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4230973/)) 3. Lowers Blood Sugar Adding ginger to your diet could help improve blood sugar levels and lower your risk of developing [type 2 diabetes.](//www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/guide/) In one study on people with type 2 diabetes, researchers found that those who took 1,600 milligrams (mg) of ginger powder for 12 weeks had improved insulin sensitivity, lower [triglycerides](/high-cholesterol/guide/triglycerides/), and lower total cholesterol when compared with the control group. ( [11](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09637486.2014.880671?src=recsys&journalCode=iijf20)) Another study found that 2 g of powdered ginger supplement per day significantly lowered fasting blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277626/)) 4. Reduces Cancer Risk The root might be a powerful weapon in the fight against cancer. Researchers have found evidence that gingerol (an active compound in ginger) has cancer-fighting abilities. Namely, it may help in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. (5, [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665023/)) Its high antioxidant content is likely responsible for fighting off cancer cell growth. In fact, the antioxidants in ginger may even help to slow the aging process. ( [14](https://www.academicjournals.org/journal/JPP/article-abstract/56E54E164970)) 5. Relieves Menstrual Cramps When it comes to period pain, ginger might actually be right up there with pain medications, like [ibuprofen (Advil)](//www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ibuprofen). Once study found that women who took 250 mg ginger capsules four times a day had the same pain relief as those who took 250 mg of [mefenamic acid](/drugs/mefenamic-acid) or 400 mg ibuprofen capsules four times per day. ( [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26177393/), [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216660/)) 6. Mitigates Respiratory Viruses In addition to its many other benefits, gingerol might help prevent infections. One study found fresh ginger may be effective against the [respiratory syncytial virus](/infectious-diseases/what-is-rsv-respiratory-syncytial-virus/) (HRSV), a common cause of cold-like symptoms and respiratory infections. ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23123794)) The ginger compounds gingerol and shogaol may help fight off a cold because they can lower a fever, reduce pain, and suppress a [cough](/cough/guide/). ( [19](https://www.itmedicalteam.pl/articles/cold-and-flu-conventional-vs-botanical-nutritional-therapy-101168.html)) All the Different Ways You Can Include Ginger in Your Diet There are so many different ways to enjoy ginger \u2014 from sipping tea to incorporating it into your main dish. Indeed, you can use it to flavor both sweet and savory foods. When buying ginger for a recipe, it's healthier to opt for the fresh root rather than the dried, powdered form. You'll get more of the gingerol that way. The root should be smooth and firm with no shriveling or mold on it. Peel away the brown layer of skin with a vegetable peeler or paring knife, and then slice or chop it any way you'd like. Use ginger for extra flavor in: - Marinades for meat and fish - Asian-inspired stir fry - Homemade salad dressing - Soups - Smoothies - Sweet potato and carrot dishes - Tea - boil it in hot water alone or add lemon and a bit of sugar - Cocktails - Baked desserts Pickled ginger is often paired with sushi or found in ramen dishes. It also goes well in salads or soups. You can buy it in a jar or make it yourself at home. If you're unable to get fresh ginger, the powdered spice will work as a substitute. In this case, the taste and smell will be different, and you'll want to use less. About \u00bc teaspoon of powdered ginger is equal to 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger. ( [20](https://www.mccormick.com/spices-and-flavors/herbs-and-spices/spices/ginger-ground)) Powdered ginger is more commonly used when baking. How Can You Grow Ginger in Your Home Garden? Because ginger is a tropical plant, it won't live year-round in colder climates. But that doesn't mean you can't grow it at home. Plant it during the beginning of spring (whenever you're sure there won't be frost), or keep it potted indoors when temperatures are below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Growing ginger is pretty simple. Like potatoes, you can start a new ginger plant from a healthy root you buy at the produce market. Look for one that's about 3 to 5 inches and has some buds growing on it. ( [21](https://balconygardenweb.com/how-to-grow-ginger-in-pot-growing-ginger-indoors/)) Soak the root in water for a few hours before planting to encourage growth. Follow these steps, too: - Select a pot that's deep enough for the root (a medium-size pot around 15 inches wide). - Fill the pot with healthy soil, something full of compost that lets water in and out. - Plant the root (buds facing up) 1 inch under the soil. - Place the pot somewhere to get sun for most of the day. - Water regularly to keep the soil slightly moist. - Harvest the root once the plant is fully grown and the leaves start to yellow. (21) A Look at Some Ginger FAQs and the Answers How popular is ginger? People have been eating ginger for over 3,000 years. The root started as an ancient medicine and a common ingredient in Asian cuisine, but now you can find it almost anywhere. Even ginger beer has become a thing! Can you eat too much ginger? Ginger is safe as a part of a balanced diet. If you're adding it to food, you're likely not eating large amounts. Concentrated ginger that's found in extracts or capsules can cause stomach issues, like [heartburn](/gerd/guide/), gas, or diarrhea, for some people. Does ginger interact with any medications? In general, you should talk to your doctor about any dietary supplements you're taking, and you should do so before upping your ginger intake. Researchers don't know a lot about how ginger may interact with prescription medications. It's typically thought of as safe, but it's always best to check with your doctor. Which has more health benefits: fresh or dried ginger? Fresh ginger has all the natural chemical compounds intact. You lose some of the gingerol when the root is dried and ground into a powder. Fresh ginger seems to work better for fighting infections. (18) What foods does ginger taste best with? Ginger works with lots of things, but you can't go wrong making it into a marinade or dressing. Mix it with soy sauce, [garlic](/drugs/garlic), and olive oil, and toss it into any stir fry or salad. The root also pairs very well with carrots and sweet potatoes in soup. Is ginger safe to eat during pregnancy? Most research says ginger can safely be used to relieve nausea during pregnancy. But it's a good idea to check with your doctor if you're considering using ginger capsules or extract rather than adding fresh ginger to food or drinking it in tea. Are there any reasons someone should avoid ginger? There is conflicting research on whether people with [gallstones](/gallbladder/guide/) should avoid ginger. Some experts believe it could be unsafe because it may cause the liver to produce more bile, which flows to the gallbladder. Check with your doctor before trying ginger if you have gallstones or any [gallbladder issues](/gallbladder/guide/symptoms/). Is candied ginger good for you? Candied ginger still has ginger, so it will have the root's health benefits. But because of its high sugar content, you should limit how much you eat to avoid weight gain. Should people with type 2 diabetes eat ginger? Ginger is not only safe to eat if you have type 2 diabetes, but it may also help to reduce [insulin resistance](https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/insulin-resistance-causes-symptoms-diagnosis-consequences/), which is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes. (11) How long does fresh ginger stay good? Fresh ginger can last in the refrigerator for up to three weeks as long as you don't peel it. If you notice wrinkling or mold, it's time to toss the root. It also freezes very well if you don't plan to use it right away. Editorial Sources and Fact-Checking - Bode AM, Dong Z. The Amazing and Mighty Ginger (Chapter 7).
