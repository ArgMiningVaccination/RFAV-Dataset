Over the next six weeks, you will have the opportunity to work on a surgical team where you will learn new knowledge and skills that will serve you well in your future medical careers. Although our primary goal is for you to gain competency in the learning objectives outlined in this document, I hope that the positive learning experiences and relationships you develop throughout this rotation will stimulate your interest in becoming a surgeon yourself one day. Surgical clerkship will challenge you...at least it should challenge you. There is a tremendous amount of information to learn in a very short period of time. Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 1 of 139 You will also be asked to demonstrate newly-acquired psychomotor skills. The acuity and volume of surgical patients, the demands of long working hours and the stress associated with being in a novel learning environment will likely take you out of your comfort zone at times. This feeling is completely normal and is part of transformative learning, as you transform from being a medical student to becoming a practicing physician. That being said, maladaptive stress and anxiety are not conducive to learning and if you ever feel excessively overwhelmed please ask for assistance and never be afraid to ask for help. Every student has the opportunity to succeed in this rotation, but like most things in life the more effort you put in, the more you will get out. To be successful in your surgical clerkship, you have to be self-motivated, be a respectful team-player, be well-prepare for clinical encounters, and work hard everyday by doing your best. I challenge you to go into this rotation with an open mind and a positive attitude and you will be remarkably surprised how your attitude will determine your altitude in this rotation! As the Director of Undergraduate Surgical Education, my goal is to have a surgical education program that enables trainees to reach their highest potential. Physicians not only heal the sick and mend the wounded, they also advocate for their patients and public health issues, conduct important health-related research, lead important initiatives and organizations, and are role models in their communities. Excellently trained physicians add great value to society. As medical educators, we have to remember that we are not only training the next generation of physicians, we are also mentoring the next generation of leaders in medicine and society in general. Surgery and surgical education will continue to evolve over time. Sir William Osler eloquently stated that \"the philosophies of one age have become the absurdities of the next, and the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow.\" As practicing physicians, it is very important for us to evolve over time and as educators I believe we have succeeded when our students question the status quo and lead transformative changes over their careers. I hope that you enjoy your experience during your surgical clerkship and if you have any suggestions, comments or concerns regarding your rotation or undergraduate surgical education in general, please don't hesitate to let me know.

It is mandatory that you attend both of these orientation sessions. The goal of the surgical clerkship is to assist the student i n developing their competency in those tasks within the range of problems addressed by the field of surgery. The level of competency to be achieved is that which is needed for the student to carry on in postgraduate training in any discipline, including family medicine and other specialty training programs. This goal will be realized through 8 weeks of clerkship in surgery split into 2 separate components: Surg I: General Surgery (6 weeks) You will be assigned to one of 4 sites: Site Coordinator Phone no. Regina General Hospital Dr. S. Pooler 766-6911 Pasqua Hospital Dr. S. Pooler 766-6911 Royal University Hospital St. Paul's Hospital Surg II: Surgery Selective (2 weeks) You may select a rotation from one of the following subspecialties (depending on availability): Subspeci Care Unit 844-1009 Vascular Surgery 653-3366 Cardiac Surgery Dr. P. Spafford Dr. A. Dzus Dr. M. Kelly Dr. T. Domes Dr. G. Chandran Dr. G. Miller Dr. J. Reid Dr. B. Ulmer Dr. G. Dalshaug 844-1382 Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 35 of 139Other surgery selectives may be arranged but must meet the following criteria: \u00d8 A traditional sur gery specialty or subspecialty (this does not include: anesthesia, gynecology, ophthalmology, etc.) approved by the University of Saskatchewan Department of Surgery \u00d8 Supervised by a surgeon with a University of Saskatchewan faculty appointment \u00d8 Written objec tives approved by the University of Saskatchewan Department of Surgery \u00d8 The supervising surgeon must be willing to complete a Departmental approved student performance evaluation form During the clerkship, students are expected to achieve a basic degree o f competence in diagnosis and management of surgical problems. As the clerkship experience progresses , the students ' diagnostic skills will be further enhanced and their competence in management deepened, and the range of problems and illnesses dealt with broadened. This will be achieved through a combination of In -patient Ward and Outpatient Clinic/Office practical patient care experience and teaching. At all times, remember that you are involved in the treating of diseases, but in the care of the patie nt. The patients in your care represent a unique opportunity to learn not only about their surgical disorders but to get to know them as fellow human beings with their own hopes, fears, uncertainties and unique stories. This is the essence of the doctor -patient relationship and constitutes one of the most rewarding aspects of the practice of medicine. JURSI DUTIES/EXPECTATIONS The In- Patient Ward Experience The student will be a full member of a surgical team involved in the care of patients. The team will include an attending surgeon and, in some cases , one or more residents at varying levels of postgraduate training and other students. At the start of the rotation the supervising faculty and residents will orient the student to the team and the ward. The elements of being a full team member include the following tasks: \u00d8 Performing an admission history and physical examination on an appropriate number of patients. \u00d8 Developing a differential and provisional diagnosis and a plan for the presenting problems . \u00d8 Documenting the history, physical examination, impression and plan in the medical record. \u00d8 Presenting (orally) the findings to the resident &/or attending surgeon. \u00d8 Following patients first encountered in the emergency room, after admission \u00d8 Assessing the p atient's clinical progress daily and when problems occur. \u00d8 Documenting patient events with regular progress notes in the medical record. \u00d8 Communicating with others involved in the care of the team's patients: Attending physicians and residents Consultants Family doctors Family members Nurses Other allied health care professionals \u00d8 Gathering and reviewing relevant data, including laboratory and radiological data. \u00d8 Facilitating patient discharges, including writing prescriptions and Dear Dr. or discharge letters (co-signed by qualified MD) \u00d8 Informing the team and the clerkship coordinator at least one month prior to starting the rotation of any expected absences Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 36 of 139Number Of Assigned In -Patients Students need to see a certain minimum number of patients but they must not become so busy in looking after patients that they have no time to reflect on what they are doing. A reasonable maximum number of in -hospital patients assigned to the student are 10. The assigned patients should represent a good variety of presenting problems and diagnoses. It is expected that the student will know these patients and their conditions better then anyone on the team. Call Responsibilities Being on- call is an essential component of learning in surgery. This is when acutely ill patients are often first encountered. Also, this is often when inpatients develop problems that require prompt attention. Being the first one to assess these patients is a valuable learning experience. This is often a time when you get specific and timely feed back from supervising residents and surgeons. \u00d8 Student's call is limited to a maximum of every fourth night \u00d8 Students should contact the resident or attending on call to discuss expectations \u00d8 Students should see patients in the ER before or in conjunction wit h residents or attending surgeons. \u00d8 Students should attend all seminars, even if you are post -call \u00d8 Students should be excused from duty by noon the day following call once they've had a chance to ensure follow -up care for their assigned patients. (The student may, however, stay on after 12 noon at his/her discretion ) \u00d8 Students will not be on call the night before an examination \u00d8 Students will receive specific and timely feedback from residents and attending surgeons about their assessment of patients, their formulation of the patient's problems and the management plan The Outpatient Clinic/Office Experience You will be expected to attend the outpatient surgical clinic on a regular basis. In all surgical disciplines the outpatient clinic/office experience is a very valuable component of the learning experience. Students must become familiar with assessing surgical patients in the ambulatory setting and then developing management plans for them. This is important because: \u00d8 Many surgical patients are dealt with in the ambulatory setting (both pre -op and post -op) \u00d8 The ambulatory setting requires a different approach to patient assessment and management than the in - patient setting \u00d8 Many surgical diagnoses and presenting problems are likely to be encountered by stude nts only in the ambulatory context. \u00d8 Attending surgeons often have more time available to teach students and residents in an outpatient setting. Objectives of the Outpatient Clinic/Office Experience During the rotation the student will: 1.Gain familiarity wi th the conduct of surgical practice in an ambulatory setting 2.Be exposed to a broad range of commonly seen patient problems in surgery and its subspecialties 3.Develop an understanding for the appropriate pace and techniques for the assessment, evaluation, an d management of surgical problems in the ambulatory setting 4.Refine and furthe r develop information gathering skills, generation of different diagnoses and problems lists, appropriate use and interpretation of diagnostic tests, and development and institution of management plans 5.Develop effective communication skills with patients and office staff in ambulatory settings 6.Demonstrate the ability to effectively communicate with referring physicians and other allied health professionals, and participate in the p rocess by writing referral and consultation letters 7.Develop and practice appropriate standards of interpersonal and professional conduct and interaction in anambulatory based surgical office or clinic Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 37 of 1398.Gain familiarity with some of the basic principles of office structure, management, personnel and resources in an ambulatory surgical practice Structure of the Outpatient Clinic/Office Experience \u00d8 Site and rotation coordinators will encourage supervising surgeons to ensure that the student will attend at least 1, preferably 2, half day clinics or offices per week. Some variation will exist depending on the specialty \u00d8 At each individual clinic or office the supervising clinician will provide an initial orientation \u00d8 The clinician will provide the student an opport unity to delineate his/her objectives and expectations for the experience \u00d8 The supervising clinician will delineate his/her expectations of the student \u00d8 The supervising clinician will ensure a clinical atmosphere that includes the clinical clerk as an integ ral member of the patient care team \u00d8 A schedule for the clinic/office experience will be provided at the beginning of the student's rotation by the site or selective coordinator Student's Role in the Outpatient Clinic/Office \u00d8 Students may be assigned new pa tients referred for consultation or patients returning for reassessment or follow -up. They will perform appropriate history and physical examinations. This may be comprehensive or focused on a specific system or problem. Students will formulate a differ ential diagnosis, problem list, investigation and management plan where appropriate. \u00d8 Students will present the history, physical findings and assessment to the supervising clinician. Constructive content and process feedback about the case presentation an d assessment will be offered by the supervising clinician and teaching points made relevant to the case. This may occur with each encounter or in designated time at the end of the clinic. \u00d8 An attempt will be made to maximize the opportunity for the student to play an active role in patient care \u00d8 The student will demonstrate courteous, professional behavior and appearance, and will be punctual. If the student must be late or absent or leave early from a clinic, he/she must inform the supervisor and or clinic staff well in advance. Performing Patient Procedures The clerkship phase of your education is all about hands -on experience with providing patient care and acquiring new skills. At times this will mean pushing your boundaries of competence in procedural skills. It is a fine line between pushing those boundaries and functioning beyond your level of competence. This is a matter of judgment on your part and you obviously must take into consideration patient safety issues. However, you must also be considerate of the concerns of other health care workers involved in the patient's care. From time to time during your clerkship year of medical school you will be called upon to perform a patient procedure (e.g., arterial puncture, phlebotomy, Foley catheter insertion, drain removal, tracheostomy tube change, etc.) for which you may nor may not have had experience. Regardless, you should never feel pressured to perform a procedure that you do not feel you have had adequate experience or competence to perform without supervision. It is a sign of maturity and good professional judgment when you are able to recognize your limitations and know when to ask for help. Clerks come into their Surgery rotations with wide variation in skills and so it is important to inform the attending surgeon or resident that you would prefer to do this supervised. You may encounter a situation where you do feel you have the competence to independently perform a procedur e but an alli ed healt h car e worker (e.g. nurse) disagrees. You will be farther ahead by respecting that individual's concern than engaging in conflict. Discuss this with the resident or staff surgeon before proceeding. If conflict arises that cannot be resolved at a local level please notify in Saskatoon, Dr. Trustin Domes, Director o f Undergraduate Education for Surgery (966-5678) or Dr. Steven Pooler, Undergraduate Education Coordinator for Regina (766-691 1). Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 38 of 139Vacation/Leave Policy Allocation of vacation time during surgery rotations follows the guidelines of the College of Medicine. You may take a maximum of 5 vacation days during your 6 weeks of General Surgery and none during your 2 weeks of surgery selective. Saskatoon: All vacation requests must be approved by application to Marilyn Baniak in the Surgery Teaching Office a minimum of one month in advance of starting your surgery rotation. Regina : All vacation requests must be submitted to Jennifer Chobot in the College of Medicine office a minimum of one month in advance of starting your surgery rotation. Prince Albert: All vacation requests must be approved by Dr. Olsen and then forwarded to Nicole Toutant a minimum of one month in advance of starting your surgery rotatio n. Absences Please refer to the Syllabus for Phase D section: Instruction and E valuation General Guidelines Unexplained absences will be treated very seriously and considered unprofessional conduct. These absences may be reflected in the final grade and may constitute grounds for failure of the rotation, even if the composite grade for other aspects of the evaluation exceeds 50%. The department will have identified the appropriate person to contact. The Dean's office should be notified of any prolonged or unexpected absences. Professionalism As a student doctor, it is expected th at you hold yourself to standards of conduct expected of all members of our profession. It is well to remember that you are \"not learning a trade, but entering a profession\". As you rotate through surgery disciplines, in addition to assessing your knowle dge and skills, we will also be judging your professionalism. In essence, the basics of professionalism are quite easy to articulate. In return for professional autonomy, self-regulation and a recognition of their unique place in society, the public de mands of physicians, accountability, ethical standards and an altruistic (altruism = putting the interests of the patient ahead of one's own) manner of delivering care. The Canadian Association of General Surgeons position statement of professionalism can be found here: https://www.cags -accg.ca/docs/Profess ionalism_CJS.pdf . Specific Suggestions \u00d8 Be on time \u00d8 Your appearance should be clean, neat and professional \u00d8 Clean white lab coat, business or business casual dress when seeing patients in clinics or offic es \u00d8 When wearing scrubs out of the OR, a clean white lab coat MUST be worn \u00d8 Be prepared \u00d8 Respect patient confidentiality \u00d8 Polite, respectful behavior at all times \u00d8 Appropriate language \u00d8 Attend lectures, seminars, rounds, etc. Please refer to the professionalism section of the Phase D Syllabus for more specific details regarding this important topic. What To Do If There Is A Problem Students must have the opportunity to resolve any perceived problems. Problems should be first addressed at the most local level ( e.g., a problem with ward duties should be taken up first with the resident ). If it cannot be Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 39 of 139resolved , then the student should take it up with the senior resident, attending physician , and if necessary, the site or selective coordinator. Please contact the Department of Surgery Director of Undergraduate Education (966-5678 in Saskatoon or 766- 6911 in Regina) if problems are un-re solvable or too sensitive to deal with at the local level. TEACHING SESSIONS The Student as a Student A major aspect of the clerkship is for clerks to act as junior physicians. However it is equally important that the student be able to do what is necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of the curriculum. Students must be free to attend scheduled teaching sessions (semi nars, bedside teaching, etc.) without any perception on the part of attending surgeons or residents that the student is somehow shirking their duties. Students are responsible for informing their team members ahead of time when they will be away at teachi ng sessions. Students must be able to sign out to another team member so that they will not be disturbed during their teaching sessions. Scheduled Teaching Activities These will be dependent on the site and/or rotation. Schedules will be provided at the beginning of your rotation. The type of teaching session will vary and may include: \u00d8 Ward teaching rounds with an attending surgeon \u00d8 Outpatient teaching \u00d8 Seminars \u00d8 Divisional educational rounds \u00d8 Informal bedside and operating room teaching Teaching Rounds A schedule of formal teaching rounds will be provided for you at the beginning of your surgery rotation. All JURSIs are expected to attend all formal rounds, regardless of what rotation you are on. You should arrange for the Resident on call to cover for you while you are at formal teaching rounds. Exceptions should only be made for immediately life -threatening situations. Where You Will Learn The Most Surveys of clerks completing surgery rotations have stated that they learned the most by (ranked by mos t to least useful): \u00d8 evaluating acutely ill patients in the emergency dept. \u00d8 seeing patients in the ambulatory clinic with attending surgeons \u00d8 caring for patients and doing rounds with the residents on in -hospital patients \u00d8 assisting in the operating room You are expected to attend ambulatory clinics with the surgeons on your assigned service. \u00d8 You should try to evaluate patients in the emergency department at every opportunity. \u00d8 In the operating room your experience will be strongest if you come prepared (know the patient, their disease, and the principles of the surgical treatment) and ask questions. It may occur that your help is needed in the OR even if you had planned on being in the clinic/office. RESOURCES Please note the following 3 RECOMMENDED TEXTB OOKS: 1.

New York, NY, Lange Medical Books, 2006 STUDENT ASSESSMENT Feedback In order for education to be meaningful, student must receive timely, specific feedback from their attending physicians, resident supervisors, and site/selective coordinator. Attending physicians will provide structured feedback at both the halfway point and at the end of the rotation, based on information from both the attending physicians and residents. Students will be given specific comments on areas of strength and areas where they require improvement regularly throughout their rotation, and this should come from both their resident and attending physicians. They should receive feedback after virtually every new case presentation, and about once per week for patients already admitted. Feedback should be given with respect to how the students are progressing in terms of the objectives for the rotation. Evaluation of Student Performance Evaluation of Performance Assessment \u00d8 Supervising residents and attending physicia ns will assess your core clinical skills, problem solving/clinical reasoning, knowledge base, personal/professional conduct, and communication/interpersonal skills (see attached form) \u00d8The evaluations are scored and comprise 40% of your final surgery grade \u00d8Oral Presentation skills will be assessed by a rubic for the Problem -based Surgery Seminars. Your performance will contribute 10% to your final grade. Evaluation of knowledge base will be d etermined by the NBME exam, which will contribute 25% to your final grade. For more information on this exam including sample questions please refer to: http://www.nbme.org/Schools/Subject -Exams/Subjects/clinicalsci_surg.html Clinical reasoning will be a ssessed by an oral examination where you wi ll be presented standardized case scenarios of surgery related problems. Your performance will contribute 25% to your final grade. Surgery Clerkship Encounter Log You are required to document your patient encounters during your surgery I rotation. This f orm is to be completed accurately in o ne45. How Can I Do Well On My Surgery Rotation?

Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 41 of 139\u00d8 It is the student's responsibility to obtain at least three preceptors before the end of the rotation. One evaluation may be from a senior (PGY3 or above) resident. Please have the preceptors that you have worked with the most complete your evaluation and give ample notice to your preceptor that you would like an evaluation completed for your rotation and try to schedule some time with your preceptor to go through the evaluation and bring the completed evaluation to the exit interview. \u00d8 A summary of these evaluations will be provided at the completion of your clerkship PATIENT CHARTS The patient charts of the Attending Surgeons require the following informatio n to be fully completed at all times: When writing up an In-Patient Consult or Emergency sheet on a patient, you MUST include the date AND time of the consult on the consult sheet. If it is not included, we will be paging you for the information. All In-Patient Consult sheets must have an addressograph or \"sticky\" label of the patients' information in the upper right hand corner. A hand-written name is not sufficient. We also require the telephone number to be written on the consult sheet as well. There is usually urgent follow up booked for many of these patients and if we have no phone number and no way to obtain one, we cannot book any follow up urgently. When you see patients both in Emergency and as In-Patient consultations, we require the Emerg/In-Pt consult sheet. We would appreciate it if you would make a point of dropping them off in either the tray provided in the Resident Room by the ER or into our mail trays in Room 161, Ellis Hall on a daily basis. Thank you for your attention to these matters. Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 42 of 139SURGERY CLERKSHIP: Performing Patient Procedures The clerkship phase of your education is all about hands-on experience with providing patient care and acquiring new skills. At times this will mean pushing your boundaries of competence in procedural skills. It is a fine line between pushing those boundaries and functioning beyond your level of competence. This is a matter of judgment on your part and you obviously must take into consideration patient safety issues. However, you must also be considerate of the concerns of other health care workers involved in the patient's care. From time to time during your clerkship year of medical school you will be called upon to perform a patient procedure (e.g. Arterial puncture, phlebotomy, Foley catheter insertion, drain removal, tracheostomy tube change, etc.) for which you may or may not have had experience. Irregardless, you should never feel pressured to perform a procedure that you do not feel you have had adequate experience or competence to perform without supervision. It is a sign of maturity and good professional judgment when you are able to recognize your limitations and know when to ask for help. Clerks come into their Surgery rotations with a wide variation in skills and so it is important to inform the attending surgeon or resident that you would prefer to do this supervised. In the unlikely event that conflict arises please notify: Marilyn Baniak, Undergraduate Education Coordinator (Clerkship) Tel: 306.966-5678 Email: surgery.education@usask.ca You may encounter a situation where you do feel you have the competence to independently perform a procedure but an allied health care worker (eg. nurse) disagrees. You will be farther ahead by respecting that individual's concerns than engaging in conflict. Discuss this with the resident or staff surgeon before proceeding. Whenever issues of conflict occur, please bring them to my attention. Dr. T. Domes, Program Director Undergraduate Education, Department of Surgery University of Saskatchewan Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 43 of 139BASIC ORDERS FOR SUR GERY PATIENTS One of the most critical documents in the health record. It is intended to convey to others very explicit instructions regarding the patients care. Therefore it is imperative that others are able to read and interpret your intentions. Order must be written with sufficient details to avoid misunderstanding. There is no excuse for illegible, unclear, or inaccurate orders. AVOID CONTRIBUTING TO ERRORS! The following are general guidelines for writing orders: Physician/team responsible Diagnosis/condition Immediate plans (some people like to use the DAVID M. mnemonic as an aid) Diet Activity Vital signs/notification parameters Investigations/Ins & Outs/Intravenous fluids Drugs (include dose, route, frequency) Miscellaneous -special nursing care instructions (i.e., positioning, wound care, tubes/drains care) EXAMPLE: Admit to CTUA Diagnosis: suspected appendicitis Plan: for investigations and possible OR npo per os \"nothing by mouth\") Activity: bedrest Vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, 4 hours) Investigations: CBC, urinarlysis, serum electrolytes, abdominal q2h prn (5 mg intravenously every 2 hours as needed) Gravol 25 mg iv q2h prn Cefoxitin 1 gm iv q6h Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 44 of 139SAMPLE OPERATIVE NOTE Procedure: -list title of procedure(s) -you may use an illustration to highlight or clarify what was done Surgeons: -list attending first; senior resident; junior resident; -name type &/or procedure Complications: -list any intra-operative problems that those involved in postop care need to be aware of Tubes/drains: -what type of tube/drain and where was it placed EBL (estimated blood loss): -check with anaesthesia for their opinion (they estimate high and surgeons estimate low) Disposition: -where did the patient go for recovery (i.e., PACU or ICU) SAMPLE OPERATIVE NOTE Procedure: laparoscopic cholangiogram fossa EBL: 100 ml Disposition: to PACU postop Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 45 of 139PROGRESS NOTE Progress notes record the patient's clinical course throughout their hospital stay. Noting the hospital day number, the postoperative day, or the days since injury is very helpful. One format you may consider using is the SOAP note: Subjective (the patients complaint); Objective (the findings of physical exam and investigations); Assessment (your assessment of what you think is going on); Plan (what plan do you have for this patient particularly related to any new problem) All notes & orders should be dated, timed, and signed.

During the session there will be a general overview given of the subject matter, which should be more of a review for the students, but there may be the introduction of some new material. The objectives are outlined in the handbook and are to form the core of the presentation. The attached cases have been carefully selected to then allow the integration and application of the now refocused and updated clinical knowledge. This series of educational seminar is student lead - where one student is charged with responsibility of both topic presentation as well as leading the clinical discussion surrounding the cases. This is an excellent opportunity for students to teach each other and to develop group-working skills. The faculty member is there to assist with the process. Role of the Faculty Preceptor There is a tendency for faculty to view themselves as the primary teacher in most settings. Within this small group setting, the students are charged with this function, the physician role then becomes that of a facilitator, closely monitoring the activity but rarely intervening unless required. The faculty assigned should endeavor to complete the following: - Review in advance the subject matter and clinical cases that are the assigned material - Meet with the student prior to the presentation to discuss the students approach to the topic (easily done by phone) - Carefully monitor the session - assisting the presenter with issues of time management and possible problems with disruptive behavior - Ensure that the objectives of the group session are met - Provide feedback to both the small group as well as the student presenter Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 49 of 139Role of the student presenter Prior to the day of the seminar oPlanning for the session includes pre-reading all of the clinical cases and then doing some further research on the topic - subsequentlydeveloping a 10 - 15 minute seminar on the area to be discussed. oMeet with or discuss the seminar with the faculty involved o Day of the Seminar oGeneral introduction to the audience is very important - this is where you cover the following: \u00a7 Who you are? Your name, year in medical school and what rotation you are one oWelcome guests - this is where you introduce the faculty member -who may not be known by all of the students with just a little bit ofbackground. Such as, I would like to welcome Dr. Smith who is ageneral surgeon at the SPH site, and is kindly going to be ourfacilitator for this session. Thank you for coming today Dr. Smith. Atthis point, I would like each of us to introduce ourselves to Dr. Smith.Additionally, if there are visiting students or other people attending,you may introduce them at this point as wel l. Such as, this is Susan Short, a 4 th year medical student from the U of C doing an elective in surgery here at the University Hospital under Dr. Hall. Give an Overview of the Seminar - which includes the title, what you areto cover, and how you expect the audience to participate with the case development. For example, the JURSI seminar today is on Complex Wounds- There is a lot of material to go through and I would like the session to endon time at 1400 - - it is now 1300. I will first go over an overview of the topic to both refresh your current knowledge and to perhaps add some additional information which I have found to be helpful during the development of this talk. Explain how you want your fellow students to participate during thesession. For example - The overview material is on electronic media and Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 50 of 139you may / may not - follow along on your computers, however, for the clinical cases, I would prefer that you do not use your laptops for the searching of information, but we apply the knowledge we have just reviewed, to answer the case questions. I would like all students to participate in the development of the answers and perhaps to do this we can go around the room to give all a chance to participate. So once you have establishe d both the nature of the session and the ground rules that are to be followed, begin the session. Take care to try to accomplish the following: oAttention to time oPace yourself - stopping at the end of each segment to see if there are any questions and to perhaps ask a member of the audience to reflectback to you one of the important points you just discussed oDuring the case presentations - to focus attention of the students they should perhaps close their lap tops and interact with the rest of the class- using the computer to only look at important slides or pictures that come with the case. oTry to involve all members equally - do not keep going to one member forall of the answers oUse the board at the front of the room to help consolidate things likedifferential diagnosis, laboratory tests and possible treatments. oDo not be afraid to question the students after they give an answer. Suchas, yes, an x-ray of the hand is important in this case, but may I ask youthe reason why you want one - or perhaps, is there any simpler, moreaccessible tests before getting a CT scan? oThe facilitator is there to assist with this process - so if you are having difficulty or need assistance, just ask - At the end of the session, always present an overview of what you considered to be the important points, ask if anyone has any questions or comments, and if they do not, perhaps ask each member to tell you something that they learned or appreciated during the session. - Finally, thank your guests. - Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Page 51 of 139Role of the members of the small group teaching sessions To read ahead - all of the educational material listed for the seminar To participate in the discussion - with an understanding that there may be various levels of learn ers within the room and consideration given for the teaching component for each participant. Remember - when giving a presentation always try to give enough information about who you are, what is the topic, who is in the audience, how the session will be given and the general timings. In this way, if the Dean of Medicine drops by in on the session -he / she will quickly be able to understand not only the teaching method but the professional manner in which it is to be delivered. Best of luck and the Department of Surgery welcomes your participation with in the teaching program.

Pose associated questions to individual seminar participants. Seminar Participant: Review each of these cases and be prepared to answer the questions posed. Problems 1. A 14-year-old boy is seen in the Emergency Room with a 12 hour history of abdominal pan. He awoke this morning with a vague \"stomach ache\" and did not feel like eating breakfast. This afternoon he complained of more severe pain on the right side of his abdomen. Abdominal examination reveals moderatetenderness maximally on the right side of the abdomen and in the right flank. Laboratory findings show Hb 15.1 and hematocrit 48. WBC count is 12,500 with 50 segs, 27 bands, 15 leukocytes, 6 monocytes, 1 eosinophil. except for 10-15 WBC's and 5 -10 RBC's/HPF. Page 61 of 139 Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation ManualDepartment of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation Manual\u00b7 What is the most likely diagnosis? \u00b7 What other diagnoses should be considered? \u00b7 Are there any atypical findings in this case? Can they be explained? \u00b7 Are there any further diagnostic tests that should be done?\u00b7 How would you manage this patient?\u00b7 Are there alternatives to your proposed treatment? \u00b7 What are some of the other causes of acute abdominal pain?

General Physical Therapy Referrals: Ph ysical Therapy will work with the patient and the General Surgery team in maximizing the patient's goals, working together towards s afe and effective discharge. In dications when a Physical Therapy referral is appropriate: Pat ients with c hanges from baseline levels in ambulation ability, strength, endurance, balance, and functional tasks (ex: bed mobility, transfers). Patients who ar e need of instruction regarding positioning, post -op splinting and/or pain modulation techniques. Pat ients who require guidance regarding positioning, post -op splinting, and/or pain modulation techniques. Pat ients who would benefit from a formal review of gait and mobility aides (cane, walker, crutches) including sizing and training in safe and effective use. Pat ients who are deemed falls risk and require balance re -education and/or patient education. Pat ients needing multi -disciplinary discharge plan ning. T his may include patient education and family/caregiver training, continuity of care recommendations such as physical therapy services outside of acute care, home care services, Home First or perhaps alternate level of care. 2. Cardiorespiratory Physi cal T herapy (CRPT) referral s: Pa tients undergoing thoracic and upper abdominal surgery are at greater risk of developing post -op respiratory complications. In the wake of surgery , or injury to the lungs, patients may require our help. Cardiorespiratory P hysical Therapy is intended to mobilize or loosen secretions in the lungs and respiratory tract and improve oxygen up -take in the muscles. Te chniques commonly used may include: Po stural drainage Chest percussion Vibration Assisted cough maneuvers Deep b reathing with controlled coughing exercises Airway clearance device (Pep, IMT, etc.) In dications when a CRPT referral is appropriate: Pat ients who have s ecretion retention , with inability to clear secretions independently. Certain diseases foster retained secretions and benefit from regular CRPT. (Bronchiectasis, CF, Neuromuscular disease, etc) Pat ients presenting with and hypoventilation progressing to collapse /consolidation . Pat ients who are immobile due to low activity tolerance or bedridden. ***W ith all CRPT referrals, our first line of treatment is to mobilize!! If patient is unable to do so, we will determine the next line of treatment. In appropriate referrals for CRPT would include : Pu lmonary edema, including pneumothorax (with/without chest tubes) Hours Of Service: i) Mon day to Friday 0800 - 1630 Week ends and Holidays Patients will be prioritized on a needs basis, new referrals will be seen as time allow. ii) D o not hesitate to contact the therapist that is assigned to the ward to discuss the patient. Phone 655 -2430 during regularly scheduled work hours or via Switchboard on weekends between 0800 -1630.PROFESSIONALISM Page 117 of 139 Department of Surgery JURSI Surgery Rotation ManualDefinition and explanation of terms Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictio- nary defines professionalism as \"the conduct, aims and qualities thatcharacterize or mark a profession or aprofessional person.\" 1 Within the context of the physi- cian professional, there is a seriousbut largely unwritten understanding,both within the profession andamong the public at large, that physi-cians must hold themselves up tohigh ethical and clinical standards. 2-5 In essence, the basics of profes- sionalism are quite easy to articulate.In return for professional autonomy,self-regulation and a recognition oftheir unique place in society, thepublic demands of physicians ac-countability, ethical standards and analtruistic manner of delivering care. 4-6 Altruism, or the putting of the in- terest of patients and society consis-tently ahead of one's own, is thebedrock of professionalism for thephysician and has been recognized asa key, unifying concept by severalprofessional bodies. 7-11Altruism has also been defined as going \"aboveand beyond\" one's call of duty. 12 Historical perspectives and thecurrent increased interest incodification The different great ancient civiliza- tions have all made clear attempts todefine a code of conduct for themedical profession. 13-15 The Oath of Hippocrates deriving from ancient Greece was required ofall Western medical students ongraduation until very recently in thelatter half of the 20th century. 13,16In ancient India, the surgeon-teacherSushruta laid down a code of ethicaland clinical conduct for his pupilsembodied in an oath or promise thatstudents had to undertake to gradu-ate from his school of surgery. 17 The Canadian physician William Osler made seminal contributions tothe development of professionalismand to the promotion of medicine asa calling rather than a business. 18-21 Osler urged physicians to live and totreat patients by the golden rule andto practise medicine with compassionand competence. 22-24 Although the ideals championed by William Osler have been recog-nized by generations of physicians asdefining the basic tenets of profes-sionalism, there has been a recentsurge of interest in defining theseprinciples anew for a new generationof doctors. Changing clinical guide-lines for the practice of medicine, 25,26 differences in perceptions regardingphysicians' financial expectations, 7,8,27-30 an evolving legal framework in thecontext of well-publicized medical er-rors and justifiably increased patientexpectations 8,31,32and the increasingly nebulous boundaries of the relationbetween physicians and the medical-surgical-commercial complex 33-35have all had their part in shaping the cur-rent debate about professionalism fortoday's physician.

Page 118 of 139obligations of the profession toward the public and toward one anotherhas confirmed the basic validity oftimeless values as espoused by theclassical oaths and by such champi-ons of professionalism as WilliamOsler. 9,10,36-39In 1903 Osler himself, with uncanny insight, predicted thatthese ideals would remain the same: The times have changed, conditions of practice altered and are altering rapidly,but the ideals which inspired our earlierphysicians are ours today \u2014 ideals whichare ever old, yet always fresh and new. 22 These ideals have been reinterpreted for today's physicians in a manner that addresses the particular concernsarising from the progress of our sci-ence and art to the present time, butmajor medical societies, associationsand licensing bodies continue to es-pouse principles and values similar tothose that have guided past genera-tions, thus linking the past with thepresent in a meaningful, practicalway. 36-39 Recognition of the importanceof teaching professionalism Even though medical students and residents read about and hear princi-ples of professionalism described invarious informal forums, evidencesuggests that they tend to do as theirteachers do and not as their teachersor forebears say. 40-42 The contemporary medical stu- dent tends to become more cynicaland less idealistic by his fourth med-ical year, 43and students and residents react to belittling, harshness, nega-tive role models and the pressures ofoverwork by incorporating thosesame behaviours into their lives andpractices. 43 The need to reflect and contem- plate on one's own actions and theexperiences of the patient, as advo-cated by William Osler, has been rec-ognized as one of the key compo-nents of the teaching and learning ofprofessionalism by students and resi-dents. 43-45Charon defines this compo-nent of learning as \"the ability to ac-knowledge, absorb, interpret and acton the stories and plights of others.\" 46 Recognizing the importance of providing positive role models andtreating students humanely has beenshown to significantly increase thechance of producing humane, com-passionate physicians, 47and much ef- fort is now being expended to incor-porate formal and informal teachingand assessment of professionalism inmedical schools and hospitals aroundthe world. 41,43 Development of a code ofprofessionalism for Canadiansurgeons In February 2006, the Canadian Association of General Surgeons(CAGS) Board of Directors taskedthe Committee on Professionalismwith preparing a position paper onprofessionalism for Canadian sur-geons. In the fall of 2006, after much discussion and critique, the Commit-tee submitted its final drafts to theBoard. The Committee subsequently re- ceived comments and recommenda-tions from the Board that were incor-porated into the position statement. We present the latter document here. After further comments havebeen received from the members ofCAGS at large, the Board intends toapprove an final version of the posi-tion statement for Canadian surgeons.This official version is intended tomeet the needs of practising surgeons,residents and medical students. CAGS position paper on professionalism and the generalsurgeon Preamble Whereas the interest of the patient is paramount to the surgeon andwhereas the surgeon's contract withthe public must make the surgeon'scommitment to professionalism trans-parent and accessible, the CanadianAssociation of General Surgeons be-lieves that a position paper on profes-sionalism for the general surgeon willinform both the public and the pro-fession alike and be a ready referencefor students and residents. Code of professionalism Duty to consider first the well-being of the patient The surgeon recognizes the patient'sultimate trust in accepting evaluationfor and submission to an operationand will always put the interests ofthe patient above his or her own. Doing right by the patient will al- ways trump the business or pecuniaryinterests of the surgeon. Respect for patient and clinical autonomy and providing the highest quality of care The surgeon will keep abreast of thelatest advances in the science and artof surgery, including advances in thebasic sciences, in clinical researchand in technology, and will seek toapply these to the care of his or herpatients. Patient confidentiality and dignity will always be maintained. The surgeon will consistently ad- vocate for societal and patient needs,including access to care, equitabledistribution of care, quality of careand patient safety. Patient autonomy in decision making for surgical care and clinicalautonomy in advising patients aboutsurgical care will be respected andmaintained. The adoption of new technology, partnership with industry and participation in research that benefits the patient When new and potentially expensivetechnology is surgeon will uspeer-reviewed criteria for its adop-Professionalism Christian et al tion, independent of the influence of corporate promotion. When suchtechnology is deemed the standardof care, the surgeon will discuss itwith the patient; if the surgeon is un-able to provide the technology, thepatient must be taken into confi-dence and referred to a colleague, ifappropriate. The surgeon welcomes partner- ship with industry and acknowledgesindustry-led initiatives to improvepatient care. However, such partner-ship must only be accepted in thebest interests of the patient and mustbe open to public scrutiny. The goal of all research, whether basic or applied, must be the benefitof patients. All research will be conducted in a manner that conforms to the highestethical standards. Care without discrimination The patient's ability to pay must notinfluence the surgeon's decision tocare, and surgeons must provide high-quality care without discrimination. The surgeon will avoid discrimi- nation as to sex, ethnoracial back-ground, sexual orientation, disability,religion and social status. Working with other health care professionals as a team for the benefit of patients Recognizing that good teamworkimproves patient care, the surgeonmust strive to work with courtesy,respect, kindness and a mutual spiritof learning with fellow physiciansand nonphysicians. The surgeon willnot disparage a referring physician tofellow surgeons, residents, studentsor patients. Recognizing that we are role models for the students, residentsand nurses who work with us, thesurgeon will strive to communicateto them his or her knowledge andenthusiasm for the specialty as wellas the principles of professionalismoutlined in this document. Thesurgeon will treat students and res-idents with respect, kindness andcourtesy. Openness and honesty with the patient and disclosure of adverse events The surgeon will disclose adverseevents and medical errors and will beopen and honest with the patient atall times. Accountability to the courts, licensing bodies, peers and hospitals The surgeon must be a law-abidingcitizen, and adherence to this codeof professionalism in no way excusesthe surgeon from his or her obliga-tions to such institutions as the pro-fessional licensing body, local re-search and ethics committees andappropriate government and law en-forcement agencies. Balance between professional and private life Recognizing that a healthy andhappy surgeon will most often trans-late to better care for patients, thesurgeon will strive to find a balancebetween professional life, personaland family life and other interests.
