Self-harm is a behaviour that is often the expression of the person's emotional distress. Some examples are cutting, burning, biting or hitting, pulling out hair or scratching and picking at sores on skin. Self-harm also includes forms of behaviour with some level of suicide intent such as overdoses. Self-harm is not necessarily a suicide attempt and engaging in self-harm may not mean that someone wants to die. Most commonly, self-harm is a way of coping with dicult or painful feelings. However, people who self-harm are statistically at a greater risk of going on to take their own lives. If the emotional problems associated with self-harm escalate, and are not dealt with, they can sometimes lead to suicide. SELF HARM AND YOUNG PEOPLE 06 1 Adapted from HSE 2007, Understanding Self HarmSELF HARM AND YOUNG PEOPLE 07WHY WOULD SOMEONE HARM THEMSELVES? Self-harm may be used as a way to cope with stressful, upsetting or dicult experiences and the strong feelings associated with them. SELF/hyphen.linHARM MAY: \u2014 Provide a way to express dicult or hidden feelings. Overwhelming feelings can sometimes leave young people feeling numb or empty. Engaging in self-harm may provide a temporary sense of feeling again or be a way to express anger, sadness, grief or hurt. \u2014 Be a way of punishing themselves, or of cutting out their \"badness\".\u2014 Be a way of communicating a need for support when they feel unable to use words or any other way to do so. \u2014 Be a way of proving to themselves that they are not invisible. \u2014 Be a way of making themselves feel alive.\u2014 Provide a feeling of control. They might feel that self-harm is one way they can have a sense of control over their life, feelings, or body, especially if they feel as if other things in their life are out of control.\u2014 Provide the person with a means to comfort themselves. Self-harm is sometimes an indicator of more serious mental health problems. If you think your child or the young person you're concerned about is experiencing an underlying mental health problem you should bring them to their GP for a consultation.WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP? If you learn that a young person is self-harming: \u2014 Don't panic. \u2014 Deal with any immediate medical concerns. \u2014 Listen and nd out what they need.\u2014 Acknowledge their pain without being intrusive.\u2014 Try to understand the severity of their distress; self-harm is often an expression of intense inner turmoil. \u2014 Provide a safe and open environment in which they can freely discuss their thoughts and feelings.\u2014 Talk about the self-harm; pretending it doesn't exist will not make it go away and not talking about it often reinforces the shame and secrecy associated with it. \u2014 If they don't want to talk straight away, let them know you are there to talk whenever they want.\u2014 Let them know how you feel; many young people who self-harm have trouble expressing their thoughts and feelings, so don't withhold yours. \u2014 See the person, not the injuries; self-harm is a symptom of deeper underlying issues. \u2014 Encourage them to cry - crying is a healthy and normal way to express sadness or frustrations. \u2014 Tell them that when they get urges to self-harm to try to put o harming themselves. They can try to distract themselves until they feel the anxiety and the urge to self-harm have passed by: SELF HARM AND YOUNG PEOPLE 08 SELF HARM AND YOUNG PEOPLE 09 * Talking to someone; either face-to-face, by calling a helpline or going online. * Doing exercise. * Playing a game - a board game or online. * Shouting or singing at the top of their lungs, on their own or to music - they can do this into a pillow if they don't want other people to hear. * See www.nshn.co.uk for a list of over 100 distraction techniques. \u2014 Suggest keeping a journal, as it can help to relieve stress and tension by writing about feelings they might not be able to talk about. \u2014 Oer to help with relaxation activities such as yoga, meditation and breathing exercises, which are often helpful in reducing anxiety. \u2014 Talk to a professional, such as a GP, to get further information and advice about self-harm. \u2014 Encourage them to see a mental health professional to get support. They will need to understand why they self-harm and learn new ways to cope, if they are to stop the behaviour. Talking therapy is likely to be an essential part of the help that is needed. Talk to the young person about what kind of support they would consider, and help by bringing them to appointments. You may also be asked to take part in the therapy process. \u2014 Be realistic. Don't expect the behaviour to stop immediately. It may take a long time to replace the self-harm with a healthier coping strategy. Talking with you may be the rst step. \u2014 Devise an emergency care plan together, in case the person injures themselves more severely than intended. \u2014 Don't forget to look after yourself and your own mental health, by getting support from trusted family and friends. It can be emotionally draining to support someone who self-harms. By helping yourself you are also improving things for them too. You can also talk to your own GP to get help with your own feelings and reactions.See the person, not the injuries; self-harm is a symptom of deeper underlying issues. SELF HARM AND YOUNG PEOPLE 10SELF HARM AND YOUNG PEOPLE 11WHAT IS UNHELPFUL? Telling someone not to self-harm is both ineective and condescending. \u2014 Most young people who self-harm would stop if they could (it can be a coping mechanism they use to stay alive) and even casual comments encouraging your son, daughter or the young person you're concerned about to stop should be avoided because they run the risk of damaging your relationship and forming a barrier to eective communication. \u2014 Making assumptions that your son, daughter or the young person you're concerned about wants to talk about the self-harm, that they are doing it to seek attention or that they actually want to die.\u2014 Making them feel responsible. \u2014 Making them feel guilty. \u2014 Punishing them.
