In case you need a refresher: \"Anything below 7 is acidic. Above 7 is alkaline, and 7 is neutral, like water,\" explains cosmetic chemist Ginger King. As a high schooler on the brink of failing chemistry, all of this has a lot more to do with beauty, particularly skin care, than I ever imagined. The pH of your favorite cleanser, toner, and moisturizer affects your skin, whether you realize it or not. And chances are, it's not for the better. Because of this, Korean skin-care products are often specifically formulated so that doesn't happen. Lab researchers from the [beloved K-beauty brand](https://www.allure.com/story/cosrx-k-beauty-skin-care) tell Allure that they make it a mission to ensure as many of its products as possible have a low pH to effectively help its customers with their various skin concerns. In fact, several specifically request low pH products, which led Cosrx to make its signature [Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser](https://shop-links.co/1659023138923345275). Although Cosrx doesn't specifically list the pH level of its products on their packaging, many Korean beauty brands, like [Acwell](https://www.allure.com/story/acwell-licorice-ph-balancing-cleansing-toner-wait-list) and [Papa Recipe](https://www.paparecipeus.com/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-5-5-cleansing-foam), do, so people can build a perfectly pH-balanced skin-care routine. While pH has a major focus in Korean skin care, the concept is a concern that Western skin-care brands, Phace Bioactive and [Drunk Elephant](https://shop-links.co/1659023187668126159), for instance, take into account, too. That being said, let's take a closer look at how pH truly affects skin. No matter which expert you ask, they'll tell you skin rings up at a solid 5.5 on the pH scale. \"Skin is an incredibly delicate organ,\" says New York City-based dermatologist Rachel Nazarian. \"Like every other organ in our body, skin performs its best within a narrow, ideal environment, especially when it comes to pH.\" When it deviates from that magic number, harmful bacteria could grow, triggering inflammation and skin conditions, such as acne, eczema, and rosacea, she adds. Like coffee, your skin is on the acidic side. In fact, it's covered in what's called an \"acid mantle,\" which helps maintain your skin's pH, prevent infections, seal in moisture, and keep skin firm. \"Acidic conditions maintain skin-barrier function and the body's ability to ward off infection,\" Joshua Zeichner, the director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, [has told Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ph-balance). And with age, the acid mantle diminishes and skin becomes less acidic, making it drier and more prone to fine lines and wrinkles. As soon as you jump into the first step of your morning or nightly skin-care routine, you can alter the natural pH of your skin and dismantle the acid mantle. (Pun intended.) When that happens, \"the skin's ability to repel environmental insults could be affected,\" says Austin, Texas-based dermatologist Ted Lain. \"This would lead to increased water loss from the skin, causing dryness and scaling, as well as irritation, redness, and itching.\" Basically, your beloved skin-care products could be working against you and could be the source of your skin's woes. When former cosmetic and biotechnology analyst Marisa Vara Arredondo came to this very realization, she decided to start Phace Bioactive, a skin-care line that focuses on creating pH-balanced cleansers, serums, and creams. \"For most of my teen years and well into my 20s, I struggled with acne. I tried everything \u2014 benzoyl peroxide, scrubs, sulfur, antibiotics, Accutane,\" she tells Allure. After meeting with the head of research and development of a pharmaceuticals company, Arredondo discovered what she calls \"the significance of pH balance both in formulating products that work effectively on the skin and in maintaining healthy, radiant, youthful skin.\" She later realized that much of the irritation and inflammation on her skin was due to using products that were damaging her skin's pH level. Now, she formulates products she says are \"pH optimized.\" Other beauty brands use similar wording like \"pH balanced\" or \"balances skin pH level,\" Nazarian says. All means that they sit around the 5.5 mark on the pH scale unless otherwise noted. If they are higher or lower than that, here's how they'll affect your skin: Skin-care products with a high pH level (also known as alkaline) pose the biggest threat to your skin's pH and acid mantle. They'll make your skin feel smooth at first, but it'll be disturbed and rough in the long run, King says. That tight, squeaky-clean feeling you might experience after washing your face is the truest sign of cleansers with a high pH and damaged skin barrier. They, as well as other alkaline skin-care products, tend to strip away sebum and natural oils. As a result, undesirable effects such as redness, inflammation, scaling, and dryness can occur, Lain says. Your skin might even break out, just because you cleansed with an alkaline face wash. To help reverse this, Nazarian advises repairing the damaged skin barrier with topical probiotics. Depending on your skin type, you're sure to find amazing options on our list of [favorite skin-care products infused with probiotics](https://www.allure.com/gallery/probiotics-skin-care-products). Because products with a low pH are at a level closer to skin's natural pH, they will more effectively work with your skin and help cell turnover gently, King says. They're more likely to keep skin bright and smooth, instead of flaky and angry. However, certain products can be too low of a pH for skin and irritate it. [At-home peels](https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-at-home-peels) and other acid-spiked products like tend to have a lower pH level, making them great exfoliants but just as stripping as products with a high pH. \"I recommend following exfoliating products with a moisturizer to help restore the acid mantle and protect the barrier function,\" Lain suggests. Cosrx, in particular, counteracts the stripping nature of acids with soothing ingredients that still maintain a low pH. As for its low pH cleanser, Cosrx's lab researchers share that they use a milder form of surfactant derived from natural ingredients to cleanse thoroughly without irritating the skin. You obviously want to look for skin-care products with a pH of 5.5. If anything, they could be as low as 4.5 and as high as 7, King says. The general rule is \"slightly acidic is preferred for the best complexion,\" she adds. If you are unsure of what exactly the pH of your favorite skin-care product is, you can check by literally pH-testing them with litmus paper. Packs are available [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Litmus-Test-Strips-Universal-Application/dp/B089N8BQ32) for about $6. If you don't have the time to pH test your products or read the fine print, I've rounded up some options. Several Allure editors slather on Acwell's offerings on a daily basis, including its [Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner](https://sokoglam.com/products/acwell-licorice-ph-balancing-cleansing-toner) and the new [Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist](https://sokoglam.com/products/acwell-licorice-ph-balancing-essence-mist). Both have huge 5.5s printed on them, so you know they're serious. Personally, I'm a fan of the [Then I Met You Cleansing Duo](https://sokoglam.com/products/then-i-met-you-the-cleansing-duo). Founder Charlotte Cho ensured that the second step, aka the [Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel](https://sokoglam.com/products/then-i-met-you-soothing-tea-cleansing-gel), has a [pH of 6](https://www.allure.com/story/then-i-met-you-double-cleansing-duo). The editors over [at Allure Korea](https://www.allure.com/gallery/allure-korea-best-skin-care-k-beauty-products-list), on the other hand, swear by the gentle [Atrue Sweet Song Black Tea One-Step Cleansing Water](https://www.amazon.com/Atrue-One-Step-Cleansing-Compagnie-Coloniale/dp/B00T8UT65S) and the exfoliating [Dr.G pH Cleansing Foam Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-G-CLEANSING-GEL-FOAM-200ml/dp/B07QVX5BQ8) for their low pH levels, too. Of course, we approve of Cosrx and Phace Bioactive's pH-balanced products, too. Other than the low pH cleanser, my go-to picks from Cosrx are the [One Step Original Clear Pads](https://www.amazon.com/COSRX-Step-Original-Clear-Pads/dp/B01LZJ3LN7), which have a pH of about 4, and the new [Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream](https://www.amazon.com/COSRX-Balancium-D-Panthenol-Cream-fl-oz/dp/B07WC1CSJ1), which has a pH of about 4.5. As for Phace Active, I recommend trying the water-like [Detoxifying Gel Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/PHACE-BIOACTIVE-Detoxifying-Gel-Cleanser/dp/B00VGUWLRI) and blemish-busting [Clarifying Serum](https://www.amazon.com/PHACE-BIOACTIVE-Clarifying-Serum-1-0/dp/B00VGWHH4I). If anything, swapping out your face wash for something more pH-friendly should be your first line of action. Do your skin that favor, at the very least. I might have barely passed chemistry in high school, but at least my skin-care routine these days gets an A for adhering to the pH scale.
