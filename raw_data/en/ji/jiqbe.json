Our services now extend to nutritional therapy and detoxification diets because there's a direct connection between the overall health of your body and your ability to heal from injuries or live a comfortable lifestyle with a chronic disease. We value our standing as a chiropractor Indianapolis residents trust for compassionate, comprehensive services. Our goal is to ensure you get the most out of every visit, and that means caring for your whole body rather than treating only your aches and pains. What Is a Detoxification Diet? Unless you eat a clean diet with only natural, unprocessed foods, you consume a lot of chemicals and unhealthy nutrients that can make your body sluggish and inefficient. A detox diet is designed to eliminate these toxins from your body so that you can feel more energized and focused. What Are the Benefits of Detox? A good detoxification diet will eliminate some or all unhealthy toxins from your system. Your results will depend on the diet that you follow, the foods consumed, and the length of time of the detox plan. Your benefits will include: - Increased energy levels - Improved digestion - Healthy bowel functioning - Weight loss or maintenance - Reduced inflammation The reduction of inflammation throughout your body is one of the most important benefits of detoxification. As the swelling subsides, you may notice enhanced benefits from your chiropractic adjustments. A Chiropractor Indianapolis Residents Trust for Detox and Nutrition You don't have to follow a detox diet permanently. We encourage you to use it as a starting point for more prominent health and weight loss. Once you detoxify, we can help you adapt better nutrition choices to keep the weight loss going and avoid increasing inflammation in the future.
