More than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Why some people react to pollens, grasses, household dust and other triggers while others breeze by unscathed stems from a complex mix of individual genetics, physiology and past exposures to common allergens. Understandably, many allergy sufferers just want relief\u2014fast. You might reach for antihistamines or other pharmaceutical remedies the second your symptoms arise, without giving much thought to what's causing your reaction in the first place.
