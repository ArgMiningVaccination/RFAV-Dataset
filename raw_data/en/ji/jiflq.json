Mitchell Nolan Low August 2015 III Abstract There is increasing evidence that chronic inflammation is a contributing factor to many prevalent ageing -related diseases, such as acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, degenerative musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer . To date, pharmacotherapy of inflammatory conditions is based mainly on the use of non - steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAID s). However, the prolonged use of NSAIDs can cause se rious side effects . There is a need to develop novel and safe anti -inflammatory medicines. Andrographis paniculata (Acanthaceae), has been used as an herbal medicine in both traditional Indian and Chinese medicine for inflammation related ailments. A. pani culata anti-inflammatory activity is commonly attributed to the ent -labdane diterpenoid andrographolide, A. paniculata's characteristic and main secondary metabolite. This compound may be suitable as an alternative treatment for inflammation, with alternat e pharmacological targets to that of NSAIDs with reduced side effects. The commercial A. paniculata extract was fractionated based on polarity (by chloroform preparative HPLC and characterised by in a number of anti -inflammatory in cell based (Griess reagent) TNF - and PGE 27 simultaneous cytokines (bead based ELISA) and NF -B activation (flow cytometry). The andrographolide content accounted for the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of A. paniculata . Andrographolide is a potent inhibitor of many mediators of inflammation. IV NSAIDs were not effective inhibitors of any of the mediators tested except PGE 2. Andrographolide showed comparable inhibition of PGE 2 release to that of the weak NSAIDs aspirin and paracetamol. Andrographolide's IC 50 for most mediators was below the highest reported C max's in rats, but above those achieve in humans. The sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide had comparable activ ity to andrographolide against most inflammatory mediators and has greater activity against TNF - and IL -6. The sulphonation metabolite's IC50 for the majority of mediators was well below (47 times) which had the only reported Cmax in rats. The sulphonati on metabolite shows promise as a treatment for inflammation as it inhibited a wide range of inflammatory mediators below the reported in vivo levels. Pharmacokinetics studies in humans are needed to determine its pharmacokinetics. Further animal studies should be conducted to assess its safety.

The inflammatory response and herbal medicine 2 1.1. Inflammation Inflammation is the body's natural adaptive response to noxious stimuli such as infection and injury [1]. The role of inflammation is to resolve disruptions to homeostasis and return the body's systems to balance [2]. A controlled inflammatory response is beneficial (for example, destroying infection), however, if dysregulated or persistent can be detrimental (for example, inflammatory bowel disease or asthma) [3, 4]. Inflammation can be broadly classified into two type s based on the cause of the inflammation: pathogen associated molecular pa tterns (PAMPs) and damage -associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [5]. PAMPs inflammatory response typically invokes a series of events designed to destroy pathogens . PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan and viral or bacterial RNA/DNA. This type of inflammatory response is well understood and rationalised due to its large magnitude, clear inducers and it achieves a clear end goal . DAMPs induced inflammation covers a broad range of inflammatory conditions that are characterised by cell signaling molecules initiating a response specific to the stimulation. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, neuronal and vascular damage is commonly caused by DAMPs including advanced glycation end -products (AGE), amyloid - (A), and hyper -phosphorylated tau [5]. Unlike a response to PAMPs, DAMPs responses are usually of a lower magnitude and often do not resolve the initia l cause (which is not always apparent) , this can result in chronic or long -term inflammation. Due to the characteristically subtle inflammatory response and less clarity around the beneficial role of inflammation in many DAMPs cases, understanding is limit ed and the study of their mechanisms is challenging. Although the role of inflammation in PAMPs and DAMPs is different, many common mediators and mechanisms are shared , this is shown in Figure 1 [2]. Due to its larger magnitude, PAMPs inflammation is better suited to in vivo assessment for determining compounds that m ay elicit an anti -inflammatory response. 3 Figure 1: DAMPs and PAMPs role in ribonuc nucleotide -binding oligomerization domain protein, NLRs = NOD like receptors, DAMPs= damage associated molecular patterns, AGE= advanced glycation end products, ATP= adenosine triphospha molecular pattern's acute inflammatory response 1.1.1. Despite the complexity of the inflamm atory response, the PAMP s' induced inflammatory response is well understood and rationalised. The inflammatory response is complex, coordinated by a range of mediators working in an intertwined network. Concept ually, the inflammatory response can be divided into different phases that form a cycle: 1) inflammation is initiated by inducers, 2) inducers act on specific receptors, 3) receptor binding triggers the production and release of inflammatory mediators, 4) these mediators , in turn, act on and alter the functionality of inflamed tissues and organs, which then become the effectors of the acute inflammatory response [2]. The acute inflammatory response results in the increased transfer of immune blood components to the site of abnormality. Inducers are recognised by various receptors, for receptors (TLR) and nucleotide -binding oligomerizatio n-domain (NOD) 4 proteins [6]. Mast cells produce inflammatory mediators, cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, and locally activate endothelium blood vessels, allowi ng neutrophils to enter the site of disturbance. The neutrophils are activated either by the pathogen or the activation cytokines released by resident macrophages. The activated neutrophils indiscriminately release toxins to destroy the invading cells, sim ultaneously damaging surrounding host tissue [7, 8]. A successful acute phase response is proceeded by a repair phase mediated by resident and recruited macrophages [9]. If, however, the stimulus is not resolved, this cycle continues to escalate in seve rity unt il the instigator is resolved, leading to chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation 1.1.2. Chronic inflammation is long -term inflammation that ensues when the acute phase response fails to return the system to homeostasis [1]. When the acute inflammatory response fails to eliminate the source of disturbance, the inflammation persists and evolves. In response to persistent pathogens, macrophages and T cells replace the neutrophils, escalating the response. If these cells fail t o resolve the disturbance, a chronic inflammatory state ensues potentially resulting in the formation of granulomas in a final attempt to protect the host [1]. In addition to unresolved infections, chronic inflammation can result from inert foreign bodies or autoimmune responses [1]. Chronic inflammatory processes are less understood than acute inflammation, due to their discreet mechanisms, often developing over long periods of time and resulting from no apparent stimulus [2]. 5 Para -inflammation 1.1.3. Para-inflammation is the term given to less intense inflammatory responses that result in the persistence of a comparatively mild state of chronic inflammation (compared to the acute phase response) [2]. Although the physiological purpose of para -inflammation processes is to preserv e homeostasis, when a tissue is exposed to stress and/or malfunction for a prolonged period, para -inflammation is implicated in both initiation and progression of many human age-related disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease and macular degeneration [10, 11]) and modern diseases (such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease [12, 13]). The persisting causes of para -inflammation are not alway s understood. When there is a shift in homeostasis the system can either be induced into an acute stress response (that affords a transient adaptation to the condition) or a sustained change causing a slight redefinition to the homeostatic parameters [2]. A physiological illustration of this is observed in insulin resistance, where sustained insulin release leads to desensitisation to insulin, resulting in type-2 diabetes [14]. What begins as a minor adaptive change causes a long -term shift to homeostatic parameters with maladaptive consequences. This may be the cause of para - inflammation when there is no apparent inducer. The different rol es of inf lammation are summarised in Figure 2. 6 Figure 2: Physiological purposes of inflammation dependent upon the trigger [15]. Para-inflammation may be implicated in the progression of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Many chronic conditions progress over time and age is the leading risk factor for diseases such as chronic neurodegene rative disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and degenerative musculoskeletal disease [16-20]. Predicted increasing incidence of inflammation 1.1.4. The number of people aged 80 and over will increase significantly in the coming decades, and it is predicted that the proportion of elderly citizens above t he age of 60 will double between now and the year 2025 [21]. Consequently, age -related diseases are projected to be the leading cause of disability by the year 2020, imp osing a significant burden on affected individuals and on society in general [22]. Age is the leading risk factor for many chronic inflammatory diseases. To date, pharmacotherapy of inflammatory conditions is based on the use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Considering the prevalence of 7 degenerative and inflammatory disease, it is therefore not surprising that NSAIDs are presently among the most commonly used drugs [23]. Limitations of current treatment for inflammation 1.1.5. With the inc reasing prevalence of degenerative and inflammatory conditions as the global population ages, NSAIDs have become one of the most commonly prescribed and used drugs [23]. However, there are many side effects associated with their use. NSAIDs can cause serious gastrointestinal toxicity in 0.7 -1.3% of patients who take the drugs for one year or longer and 5 -15% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been reported to discontinue NSAID therapy due to dyspepsia [24]. Other side effects included nervous system impairment, renal impairm ent and allergic responses [25]. NSAIDs tar get the prostaglandin G/H synthase enzyme that is responsible for the production of prostaglandins (PGs) which are implemented in inflammation [26]. There are two major isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX ), namely COX -1 and COX -2. COX -1 is expressed constitutively in most tissue and its inhibition was theorised to be the major cause of the side effects, whereas COX -2 is subject to rapid induction by inflammatory cytokines and mitogens, so was thought to be exclusively linked to PG production at sites of inflammation [27, 28]. When COX -2 selective drugs were discovered, it was believed that a new era in NSAID pharmacology had been launched. COX - 2 inhibitors were quickly established as important therapeutic medications as it was assumed that they would have fewer side effects than traditional NSAIDs [28]. Unfortunately, some COX -2 inhibitors were found to increase the risk for thrombosis, heart attack and stroke. One such drug, Rofecoxib (commonly known as Vioxx), was removed from the US market in 2004 because of these concerns. It has been reported recently, however, that while complicated gastrointestinal events appeared to occur more frequently with NSAIDs than 8 with selective COX -2 inhibitors, serious cardiovascular events appeared to occur at approximately equal rates [29]. It is estimated that approximately 30% of hospital admissions related to adverse drug effects result from the gastrointestinal, nervous system, renal, or allergic effects of NSAIDs [25]. Thus, there is a need to develop anti -inflammatory drugs with minimal ad verse effects. Possible alternatives to NSAIDs 1.1.6. Natural products or derivatives of natural products have long formed \"the backbone of modern pharmacopoeias\" [30, 31]. There is an increasing realisation that purely synthetic approaches to drug development have not lived up to their promise thus renewing interest in natural products a s sources of drug discovery [32]. Plants have long been an important source for the discovery of new drugs. Herbal medicines derived from plants rich in the secondary metabolite salicylic acid , such as the bark of the willow tree (Salix alba) , have been used for the treatment of diseases with prominent inflammatory components for thou sands of years. The development of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) by the German drug and dye firm Bayer at the end of the 19th century, was motivated by the desire to find a less -irritating replacement for the traditional salicylate -based anti -inflammatory medicines of the time . Medicinal plants, the foundation material of traditional herbal medicines, constitute a particularly rich source of pharmacologically active compounds. 1.2. Principles of traditional herbal medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayruvedic (Indian) medicine are both empirical systems of medicine developed over thousands of years, utilising natural products to treat 9 disease and illness [33, 34]. TCM and Ayruvedia are the largest, best preserved and embraced remaining traditional medicine systems in the world, together utilising thousands of plant derived products. Like many other forms of alternative medicine they are holistic i n approach and focus more on the patient than the disease [35]. Individually tailored mixtures containing plant and animal -derived products, minerals and metals are prescribed based on traditional practice [36]. Both systems of medicine were developed through clinical use with no understanding of the microbiology involved. They are based on the world being composed of five elements that, in Ayruveda, interact to give three forces referred to as 'tridosha' which is believed to regulate every physiological and psychological process [37]. In TCM 'yin' and 'yang' are the two forces that are balanced by bodily humo urs ('qi' energy, blood, moisture and essence). Imbalance in the forces are corrected with the administration of herbs or other remedies [38]. These conceptual frameworks for treating disease have the ultimate goal of returning the system to homeostasis. The forces are not associated with target pathogens, enzymes or pathways, which is in stark contrast to western medicine which has a mechanistic view of disease. The unique origins of these traditional medicines, historically showing efficacy through clinical use, may present an alternate approach to resolving diseases tha t modern western pharmacotherapies fail to treat. This may be particularly relevant to inflammation , where western medicine s focus on COX inhibition by NSAIDs, yielding advers e side effects. Herbal medicine was developed to clinically treat inflammation but not necessarily by COX inhibition , it may have novel effective targets that create less side effects. 10 Andrographis paniculata for the treatment of inflammation 1.2.1. One plant that has traditionally been used for the treatment of conditions characterised by inflammation is Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata ) (Burm. Wall. paniculata extracts are commonly standardised to andrographolide concentration, the most abundant and researched secondary metabolite. A. paniculata belongs to the family of Acanthaceae and is endogenous to South India and South East Asia. This plant has been used in herbal medicine in traditional Indian and Chinese medicine since ancient time s; many of its uses are associated with inflammation or treatment of diseases that cause inflammation. Its use has been described in various pharmacopeias and traditional texts as a treatment for intestinal inflammation, kidney inflammation, lung inflammat ion, common colds, swelling, skin diseases, headaches, diabetes and colon inflammation [39-43]. The use of A.paniculata over thousands of years for treating inflammation related ailments strongly supports its anti - inflammatory activity and safety. However, western medicine is yet to accept the safety and efficacy of TCM and Ayruvedia . Herbal medicine's safety and efficacy 1.2.2. There are a number of concerns surrounding traditional herbal medicine's safety and efficacy. Significant variations in the chemical composition of herbal medicines must be resolved before they can be accepted as safe and consistently effective. Many factors influence the chemical composition of herbs and inconsistencies in final herbal products have been widely observed. As the scientific understanding and evaluation of herbal medicines in crease s, it is evident that the variations in the chemical components of herbal medicines are significant and require quality control to ensure safety and efficacy [44-47]. Standardisation is the process whereby the dried extract is prepared i n a way that a consistent concentration of one or more 11 analytes (usually a bioactive component found in relatively high concentration) is ensured, even though there may be variation s in the concentration of these substances in the raw herb from which the d ried extract is prepared. If standardisation can be achieved, the herbal extracts can be administered at consistent doses of phytochemicals, increasing product safety and efficacy. The standardised components of the herbs are often based on abundance of on e or two target analyte/s and not necessarily pharmacological activity. The components that are active in the herb should be determined in a system that is linked to the ailment the medicine is administered for. In complex conditions like inflammation, it is essential to assess efficacy using a number of mediators that adequately represent the system, this is exemplified by the failing of NSAIDs that simply focus on COX inhibition. Inflammation is a complex biological response involving a web of cell types and interacting through a number of cellular signals at various stages of inflammation. 1.3. Biological targets for investigating inflammation Role of macrophages in inflammation 1.3.1. Macrophages are a major cell type involved in inflammation and are implemented in the acute phase response and chronic inflammation as well as repair. Macrophages are specialised white blood cells, which constitute 10 -15% of most tissues. Under conditions of stress (disease, infection or injury), resident macrophages are activated by tissue -derived inflammation inducers and produce inflammatory mediators. These mediators have been classified into seven groups according to their biochemical properties [2]: vasoactive amines, vasoactive peptides, cytokines, chemokines and proteolytic enzymes. Macrophages ar e integral to the inflammatory response and influence the levels of a majority of inflammatory mediators. They are a crucial cell type 12 to assess when investigating inflammation. There are a number of macrophage cell lines that have been developed and used in in vivo studies of inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide's stimulation of macrophages 1.3.2. Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) is a heat resistant toxin that is located in th e outer membrane of nearly all g ram negative pathogens. As LPS is common to many pathogens it is no t surprising that immune cells have developed a receptor mechanism that detects its presence and elicits a pathogenic inflammatory response. Sensitivity to LPS has been demonstrated in human whole blood with adverse effects being detected with doses as low as 0.1g/ml [48]. Although LPS is associated with a PAMP inducer of inflammation, due to the cross talking nature of the inflammatory response, some downstream inflammatory effectors are common to both PAMP s and DAMP s responses, namely nuclear factor kappa -light-chain -enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and mitogen -activated protein kinases (MAPK) [49]. Therefore , LPS is commonly used to not only mimic inflammation pathogen induced inflammation, but is also useful in the study of inflammation induced by non -pathogenic stimuli in vitro . LPS binds to lipopolysaccharide binding protein, which aids the binding of mCD14 (membrane bound CD14) to form a tertiary complex, this enables transfer to the LPS receptor complex composed of TLR4 and lymphocyte antigen 96 ( MD-2) [50], as shown in Figure 3. LPS signaling leads to the activation of NF -B via the interferon regulatory factor 3 kinase pathways. by superoxide, hydroxyl radicals an d nitric oxide (NO) and up regulates cytokines and chemokines including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF granulocyte factor ( GM-CSF) and interferon gamma (IFN-), 13 which feed back into the signal to enhance activation. IFN - is used in vitro as a co - stimulator to LPS as it enhances activation. Figure 3: Schematic diagram of LPS induced inflammation in macrophage cells [51]. Interferon gamma stimulation of macrophages 1.3.3. IFN- is a well-accepted and long recognised host -derived factor in response to PAMPs. In an inflammatory response IFN- is released by cluster of differentiation ( CD) 4+ T helper (Th) cell type 1 lymphocytes, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer T can also produce IFN- activation [52, 53]. IFN- can enhance innate pro -inflammatory responses of immune cells if combined with TLR pathways [52]. IFN- was extensively studied, leading to the important finding of a common Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT) cytokine signaling pathway [54]. The binding of IFN- leads to the t ranslocation of STAT1 and interferon regulatory factor one ( IRF1) to the nucleus and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA ) 14 binding activity of phosphorylated STAT1 that initiates oxide synthase (iNOS) , as shown in Figure 4, leading to the production of the important anti -inflammatory molecule NO [54, 55]. Figure 4: Schematic diagram of canonical activation of IFN- receptor involving activation [56]. Role of nitric oxide in inflammation 1.3.4. NO is a radical metabolite, which has been shown to have numerous physiological functions both as a signaling molecule and as a toxic agent in inflammation [57]. NO is derived from the oxidation of L -arginine ( Figure 5) by three types of nitric oxide s ynthases (NOS); the constitutive forms, neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS iNOS, originally described in murine macrophages [58, 59]. NOS is well conserved across mammalian with 90% primary amino acid homology [58]. The constitutive forms are 15 activated in response to Ca2+ generated , for example, by an action potential, which initiates a rapid and short interval low concentration (pM) release of NO [60]. However, the inducible form is continually activated once expressed, and is therefore regulated at the transcription level by NF -B, stimulated by inflammatory molecules like LPS and IFN-. The production of NO by iNOS (due to the time taken for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA ) and protein synthesis) experience s hours of lag time before NO is produced in much higher (nM) sustained levels [58]. The inducible form of NOS is most likely implicated in inflammation and due to the higher levels of NO produced , it is more easily ass essed in-vitro . Figure 5: Formation of Nitric Oxide [61]. NO is an unusual signaling molecul e. As there is no specific cell surface receptor for NO it enters cells indiscriminately, where the effect is dependent on cell type and NO concentration, thus producing a wide range of physiological responses. NO causes increased vascular permeability, va sodilatation and generation of radicals which causes tissue damage and eliminates pathogens [62]. These physiological changes are associated with inflammation, increasing blood flow and allowing immune cells to enter affected tissue thereby destroying the pathogen. At high concentrations and under aerobic conditions NO is rapidly oxidised to form various reactive nitrogen oxide speci es (RNOS), N 2O3 being the major product. RNOS can induce cell toxicity by nitrosating tyrosine and DNA residues, and 16 inducing lipid peroxidation [63]. Furthermore , in the presence of oxidative stress, as can occur at the site of inflammation and as iNOS can also produce superoxides, NO and superoxides interact to generate the highly reactive oxidant peroxynitrite anion (ONOO -) (Figure 6) which is associated with more severe toxic effects [63]. The collateral damaging effect of these RNOS has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases like Alzheimer's [64, 65]. Figure 6: Superoxide and NO form peroxynitrite [66]. NO may also play a regulatory role in immunity and inflammation. In animal models iNOS deficient mice were shown to be more susceptible to inflammatory damage and tumours, but more resistant to septic shock [67]. There is evidence that NO inhibits NF -B and JAK/STAT by S-nitrosylation, which suggest a controlling mec hanism [68]. However, TNF - expression -B [69]. In asthma NO accumulation has been observed in human lungs, this may be beneficial by means of its muscle relaxing effect or it could exasperate inflammation [70]. In an iNOS knockout (KO) mice asthma model IFN- production was increased, but not IL -4 or IL -5, suggesting a pro -inflammatory role [71]. Although the role of NO in inflammation is not fully understood (much like inflammation itself) it plays an 17 importan t role in inflammation. Many mediators of inflammation seem to play this dual role of antagonist and protagonist like prostaglandin, produced by the COX enzyme. Prostaglandin 's role in inflammation 1.3.5. PGs play a major role in the generation of the inflammatory response. Their biosynthesis is significantly increased at sites of inflammation and they contribute to an escalation in inflammation. PGs are produced from arachidonic acid by prostaglandin G/H s ynthases, a bi - functional enzyme that contains both COX and peroxidase activity. There are four major bioactive PGs produced in-vivo; prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), prostacyclin, prostaglandin D 2 and prostaglandin F 2. PGE 2 is the most abundant prostaglandin in the body [72]. The prolife of PGs' production at the site of inflammation is determined by the immune cell 's activation state and cells types present. For example, macrophages favour the production of PGE 2 when activated by LPS, however, when resting produce thromboxane A2 (TXA2 ) in excess of PGE 2 [73]. There are two major isoforms of COX, COX -1 and COX -2. COX -1 is expressed constitutively in most tissue and is the dominant source of PGs that serve housekeeping functions, such as gastri c epithelial cytoprotection and homeostasis [74]. COX -2 is subject to rapid inductio n by inflammatory cytokines and mitogens, so is thought to be exclusively linked to PGs ' production at sites of inflammation [27, 28]. However, more recent evidence suggests that both is oforms play a role, albeit COX -1 the lesser. An early stage inflammation in air pouch study in COX KO mice found that PGE 2 production was reduced by 75% in COX -2 KO mice and 25% in COX -1 KO mice compared to the wild type (WT) [75]. COX -2 18 was also observed to have a pivotal role in resolution of inflammation with t he COX -2 KO failing to recover as well as the WT and COX -1 KO mice after 7 days. After PGE 2 is formed it diffuses across the plasma -membrane or is actively transported by multidrug resistant protein -4 [76]. PGE 2 exerts its effect activating spanning G couple inhibits cAMP [77]. PGE 2 increases blood flow to sites of inflammation by augmenting arterial dilation and increased microvasc ular permeability. Pain also results from PGE 2 action on sensory neurons and central sites within the spinal cord and brain [78]. Although COX inhibition is the major target of current anti -inflammatories it is only one of many mediators of inflammation. Cytokine's role in inflammation 1.3.6. Cytokines are released by nearly all cells in response to various stimuli. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators that act on and alter the functionality of inflamed tissues and organs. Cytokines bind to specific receptors located on the surface of cells res ulting in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, which in turn alter the functional state of the cells. There are approximately 150 cytokines produced by human cells. Cytokines are pleiotropic, for example, IL -1 which affects body temperature, liver protein synthesis, and T cell s' response to antigens. Many cytokines have similar or the same function in some systems and this is 19 how they are classified - for example, the IL -1 family has 11 members including IL -18 and IL-33, each is a separate ge ne, however, their products overlap in functioning as pro - inflammatory cytokines [79]. Many cytok ines appear redundant, their roles are performed by other cytokines. The cytokine signaling system is complex and influenced by many factors. It has evolved this way to maximise cell survival and resistance to antigens , i.e. the more complex and redundant a system, the more difficult it is to block or manipulate. Table 1 shows some cytokines and their functions. Table 1: Cytokine's roles in inflammation TNF - TNF - is a cell signaling protein (cytokine) involved mainly in the acute phase inflammatory response. Macrophages are the major source of TNF -, although it can be released by many other cell ty pes such as CD4+ lymp hocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, and neurons. TNF - is produced by activation of MAPK and NF -B. It acts to increase its own production and that of other pyrogens such as interleukin -1 beta (IL-1). Intracellular ca lcium levels mediate cellular contraction, enzymatic activity and mitochondrial function. TNF - depresses cellular calcium transients. TNF - induces fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inflammation and inhibits tumourgenesis and viral replication. TNF - is implicated in many disease states, including, sepsis, traumatic injury, ischemia, asthma, burns, irritable bowel syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major depression, arthritis and multiple sclerosis [80-82]. IFN- IFN- is an inflammatory cytokine. IFN - is produced predominantly by NK and NKT cells as part of the innate immune response, and by CD4 T h1 and CD8 cytotoxic once -specific immunity develops. IFN - is an important activator of macrophages and inducer of Class I ma jor complex molecule expression. IFN - stimulates IL (anti -inflammatory) secretion and inhibits viral replication directly. IFN - expression is associate d with a number of auto inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [83, 84]. IL-1 IL-1 is one of the most significant cytokines in acute and chronic inflammation. IL -1 is a pro -inflammatory cytokine involved in the generation of pain and inflammation at multiple levels, both peripherally and centrally. It is implicated in a wide range of disea se states, including gout, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathic pain, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease [85-87]. The IL receptor 20 domain is present in the TLR, which is a major inflammatory receptor responding to microbial products (LPS) and viruses and is present on many cell types. IL -1 binding triggers the activation of MAPK , translocation of NF-B to the nucleus is then observed [88], resulting in increased expression of many mediators including COX2, iNOS, IL to name a few [89]. The IL -1 promoter region contains a TATA box, a typ ical motif of inducible genes. LPS triggers transient transcription and steady state levels of IL -1 mRNA, which after 4 h rapidly decreases due to transcriptional repressors [90]. IL-1ra IL-1ra is considered an it regulates IL -1 and IL-1 pro -inflammatory activity by competing with them for binding sites of the IL -1 receptor, but does not activate downstream signaling [87]. IL-2 IL-2 is considered an anti -inflammatory cytokine [91]. It affects the differentiation of T cel ls as it directs the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells, which supress es the immune response. IL -2 promotes the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into effector and memory T cells, thus helping to further regulate the immune response. IL -2 does not directly affect T cell differentiation but influences the expression of the many receptors and transcription factors that control the differentiation [92]. IL-4 IL-4 is considered an anti -inflammatory cytokine due to its role in repair. However, overproduction o f IL-4 is associated with allergies and chronic inflammation such as asthma. IL -4 decreases the production of T h1 cells, M1 macrophages, IFN-, and dendritic cell IL -12. IL-4 triggers activated B cell s' differentiation into antibody secreting plasma cells. IL-4 increases the proportion of Th2 cells, which produce IL -4, IL -5, IL -6, IL -9, IL -10, and IL -13 and evokes strong antibody responses and eosinophil accumulation [93]. Macrophages play an important role in chronic inflammation but also repai r. The presence of IL -4 in extravascular tissues promotes activation of macrophages into repair macrophages, this causes the secretion of IL -10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF -) that result in a diminution of pathological inflammation [94]. IL-4 has two receptors , one specific and the other shared with IL -13, which induces similar signaling [93]. IL-5 IL-5 stim ulates B cell growth and differentiation into antibody secreting plasma cells. It is a key mediator in eosinophil activation, increasing proliferation, maturation and survival. IL-5 is associated with allergies and chronic inflammation such as asthma [95]. IL-6 IL-6 is mainly considered a pro -inflammatory cytokine but also acts as an anti - inflammatory cytokine. IL -6 is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune response, playing a role in fighting infection. IL -6 is responsible for increased production of neutrophils in bone marrow. It supports the growth of B cells and is antagonistic to differentiation of T cells into regulatory T cells. It is capable of crossing the blood -brain barrier and initiating synthesis of PGE 2 in the hypothalamus, thereby changing the body's temperature set point [96]. In muscle and fatty tissue, IL -6 stimulates energy 21 mobilisation that leads to increased body temperature [97]. IL-6 signals through a membrane bound specific receptor which upon ligand binding associates with a signal receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130 ). The specific IL -6 receptor is expressed in a few cells, however , gp130, is present on all cell surfaces. IL -6 is capable of trans signaling where free soluble IL -6 receptor protein forms a complex with IL -6 and binds to gp130, initiating a signal transduction cascade leading to c-Jun N -terminal kinases (JNK) activation and activation of MAPK pathway s. The inflammato ry activities of IL-6 are mediated by this trans -signaling , whereas the anti -inflammatory or regenerative activities are mediated by the classical signaling (binding to the specific receptor) [98]. IL-6 acts as an anti -inflammatory cytokine through its inhibitory effects on TNF - and IL -1, and activation of IL-1ra and IL -10. In addition, osteoblasts secrete IL -6 to stimulate osteoclast formation in bone repair and maintenance. IL-6 acts as a muscular repair signal (myokine) during ex ercise [97]. IL-7 IL-7 is a growth factor for various blood cells (including macrophages and monocytes) secreted by stromal cells [99]. IL-9 IL-9 is produced mainly by CD4+ T cells in response to TGF - and IL -4. This cytokine is a growth factor for mast and T ce lls and has an effect on B cell s' growth and function. It functions through the IL-9 receptor that has 2 sub units, one exclu sive and the other shared with IL -2, IL -4 and IL -7, binding activates the STAT1, 3, 5 proteins leading to further effects. IL -9 has been linked to asthma parthenogenesis, in KO mice models and with transgenic expression of IL-9 in lungs resulting in allerg ic inflammation. -9 production Anti-inflammatory cytokine STAT3 signaling and can block NF -B activity. IL -10 down regulates the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines (IL -1 and , IL -6, IL -12, IL -18 and TNF -) and pro - inflammatory chemokines ( monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) 5, MCP1, and secreted ( ), macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP) 2) in macrophages. It limits T cell activation and di fferentiation by inhibiting production of IL -2, IFN-, IL-4, IL -5 and TNF - by CD4+T cells. A number of pathogens have evolved to stimulate IL -10 production to avoid an immune response [102]. IL-12 (p70) IL-12 (p70) is the bioactive form of IL -12 made when two sub units, p35 and p40 combine. IL -12 is produced mainly by activated monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells. IL -12's major function is increasing the production of IFN- by NK cells and T cel ls via STAT4 activation, in a positive feedback loop producing more IL -12. This feedback loop greatly increases the cytotoxicity of T and NK cells. It also plays a role in the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to T h1 effector cells. IL -12 has an anti -inflam matory effect on T h1 memory cells causing them to produce anti -inflammatory IL -10 [103, 104]. 22 IL-13 Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL -13 was originally described as a T cell derived cytokine that inhibits inflammatory cytokine production [105]. Its roles are similar to IL -4, however , have been shown to diff er slightly. It is produced by Type-2 producing macrophages, T h2 T cells, NK cells, e osinophils, basophils and mast cells. It acts to promote tissue healing and repair and inhibits further inflammation. It s production is inhibited by IL -12, IL -18 and IFN- [106]. IL-15 IL-15 is an anti -inflammatory and pro -inflammatory cytokine [107], which plays a role in acquired immunity. IL -15 has a specific binding protein IL - 15R and signals through a and chain complex, which it shares with IL -2, as it does some fu nctionality. When IL -15 binds to its receptor, JAK, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6 transcr iption factors are activated. IL -15 plays a crucial role in the development, survival and differentiation of NK cells. It also plays an integral role in the development of i mmunity in memory T cells and co administration with vaccines has been shown to enhance vaccine effectiveness. IL-15 mRNA is present in many cell types, however, is only excreted in detectable amounts by monocytes, epithelial cells, bone marrow stromal cel ls and fibroblast s [108]. IL-17 IL-17 acts as a potent mediator in delayed -type inflammatory reactions by increasing chemokine production in many cells to r ecruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL -17 is produced mainly by specialised T h17 cells. IL -17 induces the production of many other cytokines (such as IL -6, RANTES ), and prostaglandins (e.g. PGE 2) from many cell types. As a result of these roles, the IL -17 family has been linked to many immune/autoimmune related diseases includ ing multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease [109]. Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) In normal blood vessels BFGF is present in basemen t membranes and in the sub-endothelial extracellular matrix. When , sulfate angiogenesis and endothelial cell mitogen. BFGF is increased at site s of chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthrit is, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma. BFGF synergistically promotes leukocyte recruitment [110]. G-CSF G-CSF's major role is increasing the survival, prolifera tion and differentiation of all cells in the neutrophil linage. It also mobilises haemopoietic stem cells from bone marrow into the blood stream. G -CSF has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in T -cells reducing T h1 cytokine ( IFN-), cytokine release and increasing T h2 (IL -10) release. It is released by cells including macrophages, endothelial and fibroblast cells when stimulated by IL -1, LPS, TNF - to the activation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5. In mic e G-CSF pre -treatment reduced T h1 cytokine levels and increased survival of sep tic shock, however, G -CSF in humans has been shown to exasperate arthritis [111]. GM-CSF GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor which stimulates the survival, 23 proliferation, differentiation, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils. It is produced upon stimulation (IL -6, IL -1, TNF -) by T fibroblasts recruiting neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes to the site of inflammation. Its receptor is associated with JAK2 , activating STAT5 and MAPK. Over expression leads to macrophage accumulation. GM -CSF is found in asthmatic lungs, arthritic synovial fluid and allergic reactions on skin [112]. Platelet - derived growth factor (PDGF) PDGF is secreted by platelet cells and macrophages, it promotes collagen repair by acting as a chemoattractant to fibroblast cells, but also, neutrophils, macrophages and smooth muscle cells. When an injury occurs , blood components rush to the site, platelets are then exposed to collagen and other extracellular components stimulating them to release PDGF, to recruit cells for the immune response. Macrophages release more PDGF, which acti ves, attracts and stimulates mitogenesis of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells to accelerate extracellular matrix and collagen formation and thus reducing the time for the healing process to occur. PDGF's role of increasing collagen repair and the formatio n of scar tissue is responsible for its association with atherosclerosis and fibrotic disorders. PDGF is also angiogenesis. VEGF enhances the permeability of the blood brain barrier. VEGF further promotes inflammation by up -regulation of CD54 and MIP -1 and monocyte extravasation. Low doses elicit the inflammatory and permeability effect, while higher doses induce vascular proliferation. High concentrations of VEGF are reported in asthma, diabetes, cerebral ischemia, trauma, pre -eclampsia, ov arian hyper epilepticus [114]. (c hemotactic cytokines) direct the movement of circulating leukocytes to the site of inflammation or injury causing an escalation in the response. There are around 50 chemokines segregated into four families based on structure and function. The nomenclature is based on the structure. The largest family is the CC chemokines, so named as the first two cysteine molecules are adjacent to one another. The second largest family is the CXC family, which has a single amino ac id group between the first cysteines. Chemokines affect cells by activating both specific and shared surface transmembrane -domain G -protein c oupled receptors. The leukocyte s' response to the chemokine binding is specific to the complement of receptors expr essed. The binding of chemokines to the receptor activates a signaling 24 cascade that causes a change in the shape and movement of the actin. Table 2 describes the function of a number of major inflammatory chemokines. Table 2: The function of inflammatory chemokines IL-8, (also known as CXCL -8) Inflammatory chemokine IL -8 is a potent promoter of angiogenesis and induces chemotaxis in neutrophils, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL -8 is secreted by cells with TLR that are stimulated in the innate immune response. Local tissue macrophages are usually the first to detect an antigen and thus are the first cells to release IL -8 in large amounts to recruit other cells [115, 116]. Interferon gamma - induced protein (IP) 10 (IP-10), (also known as CXCL10 ) IP-10 is a chemokine also referred to as CXCL10. IP -10 is secreted by several cell types in response to IFN -, but most abundantly by endothelial cells. IP -10 is involved in chemotaxis for monocytes/macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells. It i s an important inflammatory target as it increases mononuclear cellular infiltration in immune -inflammatory demyelination diseases [117]. It also has an as it monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to the sites of inflammation. It is released by many cell types, but mainly monocytes and macrophages in response to stimulation with IFN-, TNF -, IL-1 and endotoxins. Its release is inhibited by IL -4, IL -10 and IL -13. MCP -1 is implicated in the pathogenesi s of several diseases characteris ed by monocytic infiltrates, such as psor iasis, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. It has been shown to be a potential intervention point in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis and diabetes. MCP -1 is involved in neuro -inflammatory diseases as it induces an increase in the brain endothelial permeability [109]. MCP -1 expression in glial cells is increased in epilepsy, brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury [119, 120]. MIP-1, (also known as CCL3 ) MIP-1 is a major inflammatory factor produced by macrophages after stimulation with bacterial endotoxins. MIP -1 is best known for its chemotactic which can lead to acute neutrophilic inflammation. It induces the synthesis and release of other pro -inflammatory cytokines such as IL -1, IL for NK cells, macrophages and monocytes. It has been connected to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and transplant rejection [122]. MIP-1 is a major HIV -1 suppressive factor produced CD8+ T cells and monocytes RANTES, (also for T eosinophils, NK cells, 25 known as CCL5 ) mast cells and basophils. RANTES is not T -cell specific and is excreted by activated platelets, macrophages, eosinophils, fibroblast s, endothelium, epithelial and endometrial cells. RANTES binding causes the activation of NF-B, resulting in the transcription of a number of inflammatory mediators. RANTES also promotes angiogenesis. RANTES has been implemented in disease progression of inflammatory diseases like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Mutation of CCR5 (receptor) or blockage of RANTES by small molecules has a positive effect in the treatment of HIV [123]. RANTES has been shown to increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier [124]. Eotaxin -1, (also known as CCL -11) Eotaxin -1 is an inflammat ory chemokine that primarily It is excreted by eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells and chondrocytes. Its production is stimulated by IL -17, IL -1 and TNF -. It is present in h igh levels in adipose tissue of diet induced obesity. High e otaxin -1 levels are linked to allergic inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and eosinophilic oesophagitis . In ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowe l disease a direct correlation was established between the disease severity and the eosinophil recruitment [125, 126]. 26 Table 3 categori ses the cytokines discussed in Table 1 and Table 2, as either pro, secondary pro or anti -inflammatory cytokines. 27 Table in inflammation 1.3.7. Transcription factors control the expression of genes. NF-B has been shown to increase the expression of a number of genes including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, which are known to play a role in the maintenance of chronic inflammatory diseases. The NF-B dimers bind to specific DNA sequenc es referred to a s \"B\" sites. In most cells, NF-B is present in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to an inhibitor referred to as IB. NF -B can be activated by various stimuli, cytokines (TNF - and IL -1), T and B cell mitogens, viral proteins, UV a nd ROS. Activation of certain signaling cascades by inflammatory stimuli results in the phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IB, which frees NF -B to then move from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus. The most common NF -B dimer co ntains p50/p65 heterodimers, to as NF -B [128]. The importance of NF-B in inflammation and related diseases makes it a potential target for the development of anti -inflammatory drugs. Figure 7 shows the activation pathways of NF -B by LPS. Figure 7: Diagram showing the activation pathway of NF -B by LPS stimulation [129] 29 1.4. Hypotheses and aims Hypotheses 1.4.1. 1.

Cell culture methods Cell culture 2.3.1. Murine Macrophages RAW264.7 cells 2.3.1.1. The murine macrophages cell line RAW264.7 is a cell line that has been used widely in the study of inflammation. The cell line was established from a tumour induced by Abelson murine leukaemia virus in 1978 [130]. The cell line maintains many of the properties of macrophages including NO production, phagocytosis, extreme sensitivity to TLR agonists, release and motility [131, 132]. These traits make RAW264.7 cells one of the most widely used cell types for the study of inflammation. Whilst RAW264.7 cells are an excellent platform to study the inflammation response, they may be considered limited in human applicability as they are a murine cell line. Cell maintenance - RAW264.7 2.3.1.2. The RAW264.7 murine macrophages were containing 4.5 g/l D-glucose and supplemented with 2 mM l - U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml incubated at 37C, 5% CO 2 in 95% air in 75 ml vented flasks. Every 3 -4 days the culture was split to maintain a manageable number of cells. To split the cells they were aspirated with DMEM. Complete DMEM was then added to the cells and they were removed from adhesion to the bottom of the flask using a rubber cell scraper. The cells were diluted in fresh complete DMEM by gentle up and down pipetting, counted and used for experimentation or split according to cell count. The cells were transferred to a new 75 ml flask and made to 10 ml with fresh complete DMEM. The cells were incubated with the flask placed horizontally. 37 Human THP -1 cells 2.3.1.3. The human monocyte cell line THP -1 has been used widely in the study of inflammation. THP -1 is a human monocyte like cell line derived from the peripheral blood of a 1 year ol d human male with acute monocytic leukemia. It was isolated in 1980 by Tsuchiya et al. as single round suspension cells with distinct monocytic markers [133]. THP -1 cells can be differentiated to macrophages like cells when expo sed to phorbol -12-myristat -13-acetate (PMA) which activates protein kinase C. They and show other morphological changes consistent with macrophage phenotypes; flat and amoeboid in shape with a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum wi th abundant free ribosomes and g olgi apparatus [134] and expression of surface markers associated with macrophage differentiation [135]. Importantly when stimulated with inducers of inflammation like bacterial LPS they excrete a number of inflammatory proteins. Cell maintenance - THP -1 2.3.1.4. The THP -1 cells were cultured media containing 4.5 g/l D -glucose and supplemented with mM air in 75 cm2 vented flasks. Every 3 -4 days the culture was split as required to maintain a manageable number of cells. To split the cells they were transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube, this was then centrifuged at 200 RCF for 5 min to form a cell pellet. The expired medium was tipped off. The cells were re -suspended in fresh complete warm RPMI medium by gentle up and down pipetting and counted. The cells were then split according to cell count or used for experimentation. The cells were transferred to a new 75 ml 38 flask and made to 15 ml with fresh complete medium. The cells were incubated with the flask placed vertically. Cell counting 2.3.2. Cell counting was performed using the Vi-CELL XR cell viability analyser . The cells (passage number between 10 and 25) were counted after being suspended (well mixed) in complete medium according to cell splitting protocols 2.3.1. 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred to a counting v ial, the cells were diluted accordingly if high density was found or suspected. The cell suspension was then subjected to analysis according to the cell type parameters. The culture was then diluted to desired density and recounted to ensure correct diluti on. RAW264.7 Vi-CELL XR cell viability analyser analysis parameters 2.3.2.1. The counting parameters for RAW264.7 cells were optimised. The cells were counted accordin g to the following parameters; m inimum diameter 5 m, maximum diameter 20 m, the number of images 50, aspiration cycles 1, trypan blue mix cycles 3, cell brightness 90%, cell sharpness 120, viable spot brightness 70%, viable cell spot area 15%, minimum circularity 0 and de -cluster degree high. Vi-CELL XR cell viability parameters counting parameters for THP -1 cells were optimised. The cells were counted according to the following parameters; minimum diameter 5 m, maximum diameter 50 m, the number of images 50, aspiration cycles 1, trypan blue mix cycles 3, cell bri ghtness 85%, cell 39 sharpness 100, viable spot brightness 65%, viable cell spot area 5%, minimum circularity 0 and de -cluster degree medium Cell plating 2.3.3. The cells were plated at high density to limit the impact of proliferati on on cell number and to maximis e the readout amplitude. Plating of RAW264 .7 cells 2.3.3.1. After initial counting of the Raw264.7 cells the cells were diluted to 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml in complete DMEM. These were then recounted to ensure dilution and correct counting, if inconsistency was found the cell dilution was corrected. The cells (1x10^5/well, 100 l) were then transferred to a 96 well plate and incubated for 48 h at 37oC (5% CO 2) to allow the cells fully attach and reach consistent confluence. Plating and differentiation of THP -1 cells 2.3.3.2. After initial counting of the THP -1 cells the cells were diluted to 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI. These were then recounted to ensure dilution and correct counting. If any inconsistency was found the cell dilution was corrected. PMA was prepared in dime thyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and stored in 100 l frozen aliquots at 100 M. The PMA stock (10 l) was then added to the complete medium (10 ml, 1:1000) to produce a final concentration of 100 nM .The cells (100 l) were then transferred to a fresh 96 well plat e and incubated for 48 h at 37oC (5% CO 2) to allow the cells to differentiate. The cells were then washed in FBS free 40 RPMI and rested for 24 h in complete RPMI. Prior to compound addition the cells were washed again. Compound addition 2.3.4. The cells were pre-incubated with the compounds being tested prior to activation unless stated otherwise. Pre -incubation was performed to allow the compounds to interact with the cells prior to activation. This may allow sufficient time for the compound to enter the cell s and affect transcription and translational modifications. The compounds were either prepared in DMSO or PBS. Compound preparation 2.3.4.1. The compounds were prepared either in PBS or DMSO according to their solubility. The PBS soluble compounds were either weig hed ( 5 mg) out into a 15 ml or 2 ml centrifuge tube and made to concentration in PBS, typically at 20 times the desired final concentration, unless further dilution was required. The DMSO soluble compounds were weighed ( 5 mg) into a 2 ml centrifuge tub e and made to concentration in DMSO, typically at 1000 times the desired final concentration, unless further dilution was required. After the solvent was added the compounds were vortexed and sonicated for 10 min or until fully dissolved. The stock solut ions were then serially diluted to create the desired dose response curve. The DMSO stock solutions were diluted (1:10) in PBS prior to adding to the plate. 41 Compound pre-incubation 2.3.4.2. After cells had been incubated post plating for the recommended time, the cells were washed with fresh medium (100 l) and the medium was replaced with new complete medium (180 - 188 l, to produce a final volume of 200 l). The compound solution was then added and the plate incubated for 1 h at 37oC (5% CO 2) prior to activation. Compounds that were prepared in PBS were added to the cells at 1:20 dilution (10 l per well) and compounds that were prepared in diluted DMSO were added at 1:100 final dilution (2 l per well) (0.1% DMSO). Cell activation 2.3.5. After the cells were pre -incuba tion with the compounds being tested, they were activated to stimulate inflammation. The cells were activated by the addition of LPS and murine or human IF N- (unless otherwise stated) according to the cell type. LPS was prepared in sterile PBS to a concen tration of 2 g/ml and stored ( -20oC) in 1 ml aliquots until use. IF N- (both human and murine) was prepared to 20 g/ml in PBS and stored ( -20oC) in 100 l aliquots until use. The activation solution was prepared by adding 1 ml LPS to 10 l IF N- and 990l complete medium. Unless otherwise stated the cells were activated, by the addition of 10l of this solution to make a final volume of 200 L, giving a final concentration of 50 ng/ml LPS and 5 ng/ml IF N- in the well. The cells were then retur ned to the incubator for typically 18 h, depending on the assay being performed. 42 2.4. Cell viability by MTT Principles of MTT assay 2.4.1. The effect of the compounds on the viability of the cells was determined by MTT. Activity was determined spectophotometrically a s mitochondrial dehydrogenase present in viable cells cleaves the tetrazolium ring of MTT to yield a purple MTT formazan. The reaction is shown in Figure 8. The greate r the number of viable cells present the more purple MTT formazan will be formed and therefore the higher the absorbance. Figure 8: Cell viability quantification with MTT [136]. Protocol for MTT viability determination 2.4.2. To determine proliferation, 100 \u00b5l of MTT solution (0.2 mg/ml MTT in complet e medium) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37oC (5% CO 2). MTT solution was removed and 150 \u00b5l of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The plate was shaken for 5 min before absorbance was measured at 595 nm on the Fluostar plate reader. 43 2.5. Determination of NO production Principles of NO assay - Griess method 2.5.1. The Griess method is a colorimetric method for the quantification of nitrites. Cells produce NO in response to stress or stimulation with LPS. NO is a free radical and is spontaneously oxidised to nitrite when expose to oxygen . NO was indirectly quantified by nitrites dissolved in the cell culture medium . The Griess method quantifies nitrites based on the principle chromophore from diazotization of sulp hanilamide by nitrite -1-napthyl (NED D) [137, 138]. is sho wn in Figure 9. The diazonium product has strong absorbance at 543 nm. The NED D is supplied in excess so that the avalible nitirate in solution limits the production of the diazonium product, thus the stron ger the absorbance at 543 nm the more nitrate is present in the solution. Figure 9: Griess -reagent in nitrite quantification [139]. Nitric oxide quantification 2.5.2. Nitric oxide concentration in the cell culture medium was determined by the Griess reagent quantification of nitrite. The supernatent (100 l) collected after activation with LPS and 44 IFN- (18 h) was transferred to a new 96 well plate. To this 50 l of 1% sulfanilamide in 2.5% phosphoric acid was added followed by 50 l of 0.1% N -(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride to complete the reagent and cell supernatant was incubated for 5 min at room temperature to let the reaction go to completion. In the presence of nitrite the Griess reagent forms a violet colour measured by absorbance at 540 nm on a Flurostar plate reader. The amount of nitrite produced was normalised to the control wells, so that non stimulated cells were 0 % N O production and untreated stimulated cells were 100 % NO production. 2.6. Determination of TNF - release Principles of TNF- ELISA 2.6.1. The TNF - released by the cells after activation was quantified using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A specific TNF - antibody is coated onto a 96 well plate. Free TNF - present in the cell culture medium binds to this. A TNF - specific antibody bound to a biotin group is then added which binds to the TNF -. Strepavadin HPR is added which binds to the biotin group. After each step the plate is washed so that no unbound antibodies are left. A tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution is then added to the plate which is enzymatically oxidised by the HPR, to produce a strong blue colour. The blue colour can be measured by abs orbance at 655 nm. Additionally, stop solution (H 2PO 4) turns the colour from blue to yellow, which is detectable at 450 nm as illustrated in Figure 11 [140]. The higher the absorbance at 450 nm the more TNF - is present in the cell supernatant. An illustration of an ELISA is shown in Figure 10. 45 Figure 10: An illustration of the TNF - assay [141]. Figure 11: TMB colour development (modified from [142]). The concentrations of TNF - released into the cell medium, following 18 h incubation with LPS and IFN-, was determined by ELISA. The protocol accompanying the ELISA kit from Peprotech was altere d, to the following procedure: Reagent preparation 2.6.1.1. The reagents were prepared accordin manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies were reconstituted in Milli -Q water and aliquoted into 10 tubes each and refrigerated ( -20oC). The rest of the solutions were prepared daily or as needed. The diluent buffer for analysis was prepared by diluting 0.0 w/v) Tween -20 and 0.1% PBS. Block buffer was 655 nm 420 nm 46 prepared by addition of 2% BSA (w/v) in PBS and filtered through vacuum driven 0.22 m polyvinylidene fluoride filter. The wash buffer was prepared to contain 0.05% ( w/v) Tween - 20 in PBS. The co ating buffer (carbonate -bicarbonate) was prepared by mixing NaHCO 3 (4 g) and Na 2CO 3 (1.5 g) in 1l Milli -Q water and adjusting to pH 9.5. Phosphate citric acid (PC) buffer was produced by diluting 25.7 ml of 0.2 M dibasic sodium phosphate (NaH 2PO 4), 24.3 ml of 0.1 M citric acid, to 100 ml with Milli -Q water. Stock solution of TMB for colour development was prepared by diluting 1 ml DMSO (1mg/ml TMB) in 9.5 ml . Peprotech TNF - protocol for RAW264.7 2.6.1.2. The capture d antibody (100 \u00b5l) was dilu ted with carbonate -bicarbonate buffer (9.9 ml) and added (100 \u00b5l) to each well in the ELISA plate and incubated overnight. The plate was washed 4 times with wash buffer. The plate was blocked by adding block buffer (200 l) and incubated for 1 h on shaker at 250 rpm and 1 h still. The plate was then washed 2 times. The standard curve was prepared and added in duplicate as per instruction to give a range from 2000 -39 pg/ml. The supernatant was diluted in diluent buffer and added to the plate (100 ul). For th e RAW264.76 cells a 1:100 dilution of the supernatant was necessary. For the THP -1 cells a 1 in 10 dilution of the supernatant was necessary. The plates were incubated 2 h at room temperature and then washed twice before the detection antibody was added an d incubate d for a further 2 h. The plates were again washed twice, before the addition of the strep avadin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) which was purchased separately from the kit (BD, USA), 20l was diluted in 10 ml diluent and 100 l was added to each we ll and incubated for 45 min. The TMB solution was prepared in this time and 1 ul 30% H 2O2 prior to use. The plates were washed 4 times before adding the TMB solution (100 l per well). The colour development was monitored at 655 nm, with readings taken aft er every 5 min. After the plates were developed the reaction was stopped using 0.5 M sulphuric acid, and the 47 absorbance of the resultant yellow colour was measured at 450 nm. The standard curve for TNF - was produced by plotting respective data in GraphPad Prism version 5, where the standard curve was fitted to a 4 parameter logistic curve fit and used to calculate the concentration of the TNF - in each sample. The TNF - concentration was then normalised to the unstimulated and stimulated untreated control and expressed as a percentage of stimulated untreated TNF - release. The dose response curves were constructed in Graphpad prism by plotting the log of the dose concentration against the percentage release, to this a non-linear 4 parameters variable slope dose response curve was fit, to calculate the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC50) for each sample te sted. 2.7. Determination of PGE 2 release Principles of COX ELISA 2.7.1. The PGE 2 released by the activated cells was quantified by competitive ELISA. The quantification of PGE 2 in the supernatant is based on the competition between PGE 2 and a PGE 2-acetylcholinesterae (AChE) conjugate for a limited number of PGE 2 monoclonal antibodies. As the monoclonal binding sites are limited and the amount of the AChE conjugate is kept uniform in all wells, the amount of free PGE 2 present limits the amount of AChE conjugate that can bind to the monoclonal antibody, thus the level of free PGE 2 is inversely proportional to the AChE that is able to bind to the monoclonal ant ibody. The PGE 2 complexes then bind to the goat polyclonal anti -mouse IgG that is attached to the 96 well plate. The plate is washed to remove all unbound AChE conjugate that has not been able to bind to a monoclonal antibody and then to the polyclonal att ached antibody. Afte r washing the plate, the Ellman reagent which contains the substrate to AChE is added to the wells and an enzymatic reaction occurs. An illustration of the competitive PGE 2 ELISA is shown in 48 Figur e 12. The enzymatic reaction produces 5 -thio-2-Nitrobenzoic acid which absorbs strongly at 412 nm. The mechan ism of this reaction is shown in Figure 13. The intensity of the absorbance is inversely proportional to the amount of free PGE 2 in the supernatant. Thus compared to the standard curve, PGE 2 was quantified in the supernatant. Figur e 12: An illustration of the principles of the competitive PGE 2 ELISA [143]. 49 Figure 13: Ellman reagent acetylcholinesterase enzymatic reaction [143]. by RAW264.7 and THP -1 cells 2.7.2. The competitive ELISA was run as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the standard PGE 2, AChE conjugate and monoclonal antibody were resuspended according to the manufacturer's instructions. To each well of the supplied ELISA plate 50 l of supernatan t or diluted standard was added, followed by PGE 2 AChE conugate (50 \u00b5l) and PGE 2 monoclonal antibody (50 l). The plate was then incubated for 60 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker, while the Ellman reagent was prepared. The plate was washed 5 ti mes before the Ellman reagent (200 l) was added. The plate was then incubated in the dark on the plate shaker for 90 min for the colour to develop. The absorbance of each well was then read on the BMG plate reader at 420 nm. The results were exported to G raphpad prism5, where the standard curve was fitted to a 4 parameter logistic curve fit and used to calculate the concentration of PGE 2 in each sample. The PGE 2 concentration was then normalised to the unstimulated and stimulated untreated control and expr essed as a percentage of stimulated 50 untreated PGE 2 release. The dose response curves were constructed in Graphpad prism5 by plotting the log of the dose concentration against percentage release, to this a non -linear 4 parameters variable slope dose respons e curve was fitted, to calculate the IC50 for each sample tested. 2.8. Determination of NF -kB Principle of NF-B assay 2.8.1. compound's potency to inhibit NF -B activation. The ELAM 9 RAW 264.7 cells used in this study were modified to produce green florescence protein (GFP) when activated with LPS and IFN-. These cells were originally created by Dr. Tara Robertson from University of Queensland. The murine macrophage -like cell line w as stably transfected wit h the human endothelial -leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM 9) (E-selectin) promoter driving destabilis ed enhanced GFP. Activated NF-B can induce the transcription of many genes such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules in macrophage and microglial cells and GFP in the ELAM 9 macrophage cell line used in this study . The number of activated cells was counted by a flow cytometer setup to detect the florescence of the GFP protein. The percentage o f activated cells was used as the readout. Protocol for NF-kB activation assay 2.8.2. The (1x105cells/well), (1h 0.1% DMSO) and stimulated (50 g/ml LPS, 50 Units/ml IF) according to method described in section 2.3 Cell c ulture methods, however, were only incubated for 5.5 h after stimulation. The cells 51 were then washed twice with ice cold PBS and detached by trypsin (40 l) taking 10-15 min until they were all detached. PBS containing 10% FBS was then added to the wells and mixed well by pipetting to break apart cell clusters and dislodge loosely attached cells. The cells were then filtered through a 50 m Nylon filter into a new 96 well plate for flow cytometer analysis. The plates were kept on ice until run and mixed on the plate shaker just prior to running. Flow cytometer setup for analysis of GFP in ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells 2.8.3. The plates were analysed on the flow cytometer using the high through -put auto sampler, directly from the 96 well plates. The blue layer was used for the analysis of GFP in the ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells. The FSC and SSC were determined based on the size and shape of the control cells plated in each separate experiment. The readout of the laser intensity was normalised in each experiment to the fluorescence of the normal RAW264.7 cells. NF-kB data analysis 2.8.4. The data was analysed to obtain the percentage of cells where NF -kB had been activated to calculate a n IC50 for each compound. The data was analysed using FlowJo v10. The scatter plots were gated -A (40K -110K) and SSC -A (20K -120K) to disregard abnormal cells from the analysis as shown in Figure 14. The normal population was then separated by florescence at 530 nm with stimulated cells being sele cted above 104 units as shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16, based on experimen tal data. The percentage of stimulated cells was then normalised to the unstimulated and stimulated untreated control and expressed as a percentage of stimulated untreated NF -kB activation. The dose response curves were constructed in Graphpad prism5 by pl otting the log of the dose concentration against the 52 percentage release, to this a non -linear 4 parameters variable slope dose response curve was fitted, to calculate the IC 50 for each sample tested.

Figure 15: Gating of stimulated cells (stimulated control) . 53 Figure 16: Gating of 2.9. assay The 17 and 27 multiple cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released by the cells after activation were quantified using bead based ELISA assay (Bio -Rad, Philadelphia, USA). Principles of the multicytokine bead based assay 2.9.1. The principle behind the bead based ELISA assay are similar to the sandwich ELISA described in section 2.6.1 . An antibody specific to a desired cyto kine, chemokine or growth factor is covalently coupled to a uniquely dyed bead. These beads are allowed to react with the cell supernatant and bind the release target biomolecules. They are washed and a 54 biotinylated detection antibody specific to an epitop e different from the capture d antibody is added an d allowed to bind. The beads are again washed and a streptavidin -phycoerythrin reporter complex is added and allowed to bind to the biotinylated detection antibodies, sandwiched to the dyed bead where a rel eased biomolecule had bound. The more biomolecule s that bind from the cell supernatant, the more biotinylated detection antibody is able to bind to the bead, so the greater the intensity of fluorescence. This allows quantification in comparison to a standa rd curve. The correct biomolecule is identified by the uniquely dyed bead it is coupled to. Using this approach up to 100 unique biomolecules can be quantified in a single assay, with less incubation time and a larger dynamic range of detection concentrati ons (due to the much increased surface area of the beads compared to a flat surface). Protocol for THP -1 multicytokine assay 2.9.2. The to section 2.3.3.2 (1x105/well, 48 h PMA, 24 h rest) and compounds added according to section 2.3.4 (0.1% DMSO). The THP -1 cells were stimulated with 1g/ml LPS and incubated for 6 h before the supernatant was harvested and stored ( -80oC) for analysis using the bead based assay. Due to the high cost of the kit the supernatant was assayed for TNF - conte nt (according to the protocol outlined in section 2.6) prior to being tested in the multicytokine assays, to ensure the cytokine levels were co rrect. Cytotoxicity was then assessed on the remaining cells by MTT as described in section 2.4.2 . The 17 and 27 Bio -plex assays were performed acc ording to the manufacturer's protocol. The supernatant (50 l) was used without dilution. There were no alterations made to the standard curve or instrumental parameters. [144] 55 2.10. Statistical data analysis All data is reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation , with the standard error of the mean displayed in figure error bars. The in vitro experiments were performed in triplicates and the entire experiments repeated on three or more separate days , 3 repeat experiments is expressed as n=9 in the dose response curves figures . For the multicytokine assays they were only performed once and in duplicate, due to the expense of the assay, this is expressed as n=2 in the dose response curves. The dose response data were fitted wit h a log (inhibitor) vs. normalis ed response with variable slope model using Prism 5 for Mac OSX ( GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). IC 50 values were calculated from the fitted curves. The curves were constrained to a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 unless this did not fit the experimental results. The uncertainly in the IC 50 values is expressed as th e 95 % confidence interval (CI). 56 Chapter 3 ___________________________________________________________________________ 3. Identification of the major active component of A. paniculata 57 3.1. Introduction Complexity of characterising herbal medicine 3.1.1. Herbal medicine (HM) refers to medicinal products containing exclusively herbal materials or herbal drug preparations [145]. HMs can be composed of a single herb or a combination of herbs or added non-herbal material. In contrast to chemically defined drugs, HMs typically contain complex mixtures of chemicals that may have active, synergistic, complementary, antagonistic or even toxic effects. Even single herb HMs contain complex mixtures of chemic als, for example, A. paniculata has been reported to contain 55 ent -ladbane diterpenoids, 30 flavonoids, 8 quinic acids, 4 xanthones and 5 rare noriridoids [43]. HMs' active components are secondary plant metabolites which are compounds, that while not essential for plant growth, are thought to play a role in plant defence [146]. They are the component of the plant typically extracted and used as medicines, flavourings and illicit drugs [147]. The amount of secondary metabolites in HMs can vary depending on growing conditions (soil, climate), harvest season, and post -harvest treatment [148, 149]. Furthermore, once ingested, some secondary plant metabolites may be metabolised into active compounds, a process termed as bioactivation [150]. With the large number of compounds present and the possibility of interactions, variable compositions and the possibility of bioactivation, it is challenging to assess and ensure the efficacy and consistency of HMs. Standardisation as a means to control variation 3.1.2. As the scientific understanding and evaluation of HM increases, it has become evident that variation in the putative bioactive components of HMs is often significant and requires quality control (QC) to improve safety and efficacy [44-47]. Standardisation of the herbal extract is a method to address this variation. Extract standardisation is applicable because 58 herbs are typically c onsumed as an extract (often aqueous, sometimes aqueous ethanol) rather than being consumed directly. Standardisation is the process whereby an extract is prepared in a way that ensures a consistent concentration of one or more analytes (usually a bioactiv e compound found in high concentration) regardless of variation in the concentration of these substances in the raw material from which the extract is prepared. While the extract may be standardised to contain a predetermined concentration of a particular compound(s), other compounds in the herb which may or may not have an impact on its efficacy are ignored, [47, 151] often for reasons of practicality. In the case of A. paniculata , the extract is generally standardised to contain 10% or 30% w/w andrographolide which is the major secondary metabolite [42]. Prior to extraction, the correct identification of the starting ma terial is required. Importance of correct plant identification 3.1.3. To ensure that the correct plant is used to prepare the extract, the starting material needs to be authenticated by a systematic botanist. Due to their established traditional use, many herbs have different names based on locale - for example, A. paniculat a is known as: Chuan Xin Lian (Chinese), Kirayat (Hindi), Green chirayta, Creat, King of bitters, India echinacea, Se - ga-gyi (Burmese) and Sambiroto (Indonesian), to name a few. Due to the large number of local names, taxonomical classification is the pref erential method of nomenclature. The taxonomical classification for A. paniculata is given in Table 4. 59 Table 4: Taxonomical classification of A. A. paniculata is an annual, branched, herbaceous plant which grows to a height of 30 -110 cm. The leaves are green and taper from a rounded base toward an apex. The leaves are hairless and typically 2 -12 cm long by 1 -3 cm wide. The plant has small white flowers 2.5 -10 cm long with pink -purple spots and slender stems. Error! Reference source not found. and Figure 17 show a sketch and photograph, respectively, of A. paniculata . The leaves and stems are the most commonly used parts of the plant for medicinal purposes [152]. Figure 17: A photograph of A. paniculata from the Botanical Gardens, Berlin. [153] 60 Traditional uses of A. paniculata 3.1.5. A. paniculata is used in herbal formulations in traditional Indian, Chinese, Thai, Malayan, Japanese and Scandanavian medicines. Its use has been described in various pharmacopeia and traditional texts as a treatment for inflammator y conditions including dysentery (intestinal inflammation), enteritis (intestinal inflammation), pyelonephritis (kidney inflammation), respiratory infection, fever, pneumonia (lung inflammation), coughs, bronchitis (lung inflammation), excess mucus, sinusi tis, common colds, (inflammation of pharynx), tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis (inflammation the wounds, ulcers, skin diseases, eczema (inflamed skin), pruritus (itching skin), headaches, enc ephalitis B (viral inflammation of the brain), diabetes, and colitis (inflamed colon) [39-43]. A. paniculata achieved official status as a medicine in the Indian pharmacopeia in 1998 [154]. Most of its uses and pharmacological activity can be attributed to its major chemical component, andrographolide [155], however, there are many other compounds that have been identified in A. paniculata . Chemical substances in A. paniculata 3.1.6. A. paniculata has been reported to contain 55 ent -ladbane diterpenoids, 30 flavonoids, 8 quinic acids, 4 xanthones and 5 rare noriridoids [43]. Some has also been reported to contain quinic acids, for example, chlorogenic acid [152, 155-158]. The molecular structures of these major components are shown in Figure 18. 61 structure of some compounds identified in A. paniculata .

However, it remains unclear which compounds or combination of compounds contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory activity. A. paniculata 's inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide production 3.1.7. Prostaglandins play a major role in inflammation. Inhibition of the COX enzyme that produces prostaglandins is the current drug target for NSAIDs, the main modern treatment for inflammation. NO is similarly produced by an enzyme (NO S) and can be affected at a transcriptional or protein level. NO is also implicated in inflammation as discussed in section 1.3.4 . Table 5 summarises research related to A. paniculata and its components on the modulation of inflammatory enzymes COX and NOS and their products. Table 5: The effects of A. paniculata and andrographolide on inflammatory enzymes . Reference Method Effect Comment 2004 Wang [159] BV-2 microglia, LPS stimulated. Andrographolide reduced COX and iNOS activity, as determined by ELISA (PGE 2 levels) reagent (NO concentration) respec attenuated iNOS and protein expression. Andrographolide did not significantly affect iNOS mRNA expression but slightly - mRNA (20%). dependently attenuated the LPS -induced microglial activation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS ), which may be a secondary activator, were also reduced. In the presence of andrographolide, COX -2 showed increased protein degradation and r educed activity. There was an effect observed in suppressing protein expression. 2005 Hidalgo Human Andrographolide reduced The reduced expression 63 [160] promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) cells differentiated to neutrophils. COX -2 expression. Andrographolide reduced the DNA binding of NF - B. of COX -2 could be attributed to reduced NF - B DNA binding activity. 2007 Liu [161] Murin e macrophages RAW264.7, LPS stimulated. Neoandrographolide inhibited TNF - and NO production. This study uses a similar inflammation model to our study. 2009 Boa [162] BALB/c mice sensitised and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) develope d airway inflammation. Andrographolide reduced NO levels and release of IL-13 in the lungs. Andrographolide reduced expression of iNOS by reducing the transcr iption factor NF -B's activity. The reduced expression of iNOS could be attributed to reduced NF - B activity. 2010 Chan [163] Cerebral ischaemia rat model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Andrographolide reduced the production of TNF -, IL-1 and 2. The translocation of the NF-B su bunit, p65 from cytosol to the nucleus was suppressed by andrographolide. The results indicate reduced NF -B activation in activated microglial. NF-B inhibition could account for the reduced production of the cytokines and eicosanoid. It may not be the on ly effect. 2009 Chao [164] Murine macrophages RAW 264.7, LPS/IFN - stimulated. Mouse splenocytes, A-activated. The A. paniculata acetate fraction, caused decreased NF-B linked (by transfections) luciferase production and the secretion of NO and PGE 2 in the RAW264.7 cells. The fractions did not affect IFN - linked (by transfection) luciferase production or IFN - production in Con A activated mouse splenocytes. The suppression of NO and PGE 2 release may be caused by reduced NF -B activity. The acetate extract was shown to contain andrographolide and there were at least two other HPLC peaks but no other compounds were identified and none quantified. 2010 Chandrasekaran [165] J774A.1 calcimycin A. paniculata reduced the release of pro - inflammatory (NO, IL -1 beta and IL -6), inflammatory (PGE 2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB 2)) and allergic (LTB 4) mediators. The reduced production of NO may be due to inhibition of iNOS. The reduced production of PGE 2 and TXB 2 showed the inhibition of COX -1 and/or 2. 64 induced. Histamine measured i n RBL -2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells. No inhibition observed against histamine release. 2010 [166] Energy minimisation was simulated using MMFF94x. Stochastic conformational search using molecular mechanics method of MOE - 2007.0 9.02. Human fibroblast cell culture LPS stimulated. Andrographolide to COX - 2 binding was favoured in a computerised binding modelling. The docking simulation indicates that both andrographolide and neoandrographolide are able to be located in the COX -2's binding pocket but not in the COX -1's. The production of PGE 2 was reduced in LPS stimulated fibroblast cells. Both andrographolide and neoandrographolide showed selective inhibition of COX -2. Their selectivity is due to their specific interaction with Ar g 513 in the binding pocket of COX -2, which is also shown by SC-558, a COX -2 selective inhibitor. Andrographolide had a similar binding energy requirement to SC -558 (a known COX -2 inhibitor), of kcal/mol respectively. Andrographolide shown to ntially directly inhibit COX -2. 2010 Parichatikanon d [167] Human whole blood, LPS stimulated (platelet suspension for COX -1). COX -1/2 activity in human blood was down - regulated by andrographolide, neoandrographolide and 14-deoxy -11,12 - didehydroandrographolide . Andrographolide was active out of dehydro - and neo - andrographolide, the two next most abundant diterpenes in A. paniculata . Andrographolide was the best COX and COX -2 inhibitor, 14-deoxy - 11,12 - didehydroandrographolid e was similar but slightly less active. Neoandrographolide showed little COX -1 activity but inhibited COX -2 as strongly as andrographolide and celecoxib (selective COX -2 inhibitor). This study showed that 65 andrographolide is not the only active component of the herb. 2011 Chandrasekaran [168] J774A.1 -I and 7 - O-methylwogonin exhibited significant dose - dependent inhibition of NO and PGE 2 release. The study shows that andrographolide an d other components of A. paniculata , isoandrographolide, skullcapflavone -I and 7 - O-methylwogonin have anti-inflammatory activity against different pathways. Some of the effect may be associated with inhibition of NF -B. However, the inhibition of IL -1 7-O- but not and the of IL-6 by skullcapflavone -I but not IL -1 would not be explained by this theory. There may be a complementary effect present. 7-O-methylwogonin inhibited PGE 2 but not TXB 2 which are both part of the sa me pathway from COX enzymes. The inhibition may be due to inhibition at the PG synthases level and not the COX level. Skullcapflavone -I showed inhibition of PGE 2, TXB 2 and LTB 4 which may be due to its inhibition of phospholipaseA2 that is responsible for the synthesis of arachidonic acid the median of COX and lipoxygenase 5 (Figure 1). HL-60 human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, A23187 stimulated. Significant reduction in TXB 2 levels was displayed by andrographolide, isoandrographolide and skullcapflavone -I. 66 A. paniculata has been shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on COX -1, COX -2 and iNOS at both a transcriptional and protein level. Andrographolide is the most studied component of the herb and has shown this activity. Table 6 summarises the reported effects of andrographolide on the activity of COX and NOS enzymes, at a transcription and protein level. Table 6: Andrographolide's effect on NO and PGE 2 production 2004 Wang Microglia, LPS stimulation NO levels PGE2 levels iNOS protein COX -2 protein iNOS mRNA COX mRNA 2005 Hidalgo Murine Neutrophils COX -2 protein NF-B activity 2009 Boa Mice OVA NO levels NO expression NF-B activity 2009 Chao Macrophages NO levels PGE 2 levels NF-B activity 2010 Levita Computer model COX -2 biding 2010 Parichatikan Human whole blood COX -1 activity COX -2 activity 2011 Chandrasekaran Murine Macrophages NO levels PGE 2 levels It is clear from the literature that andrographolide exhibits an inhibitory effect on COX -1, COX -2 and iNOS at both a transcriptional and level. Neoandrograph olide isoandrographolide, skullcapflavone -I and 7 -O-methylwogonin have been shown to affect these enzymes at some level. Other components of A. paniculata may have a similar effect but the quantification of their contribution is lacking. Although other components of the herb have been shown to be effective at inhibiting COX and NO S function, it is unclear if in a 67 typical herbal extract these other components are present in high enough concentrations to elicit a measurable effect. Whilst inflammatory enzymes play a role in the inflammatory response, they are only one part of a compl ex system, cytokines are another major anti - inflammatory target. A. paniculata 's inhibition of inflammatory cytokines 3.1.8. Cytokines are cell signaling molecules that play a major role in inflammation, acting on cells to alter their functionality. A. paniculat a and its components have been shown to inhibit a variety of cytokines in many models, as summarised in Table 7. Table 7: Eff ects of andrographolide and A. paniculata on release pro -anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines Method cells, Concanava line A (ConA) stimulated. inhibited IFN - and IL - 2. Deoxyandrograph olide only inhibited IFN - and showed protection from PMA and hydrocortisone induced apoptosis in thymocyte cells (T cell Inhibition of extracellular - signal -regulated kinases (ERK ) 1/2 by reduced phosphorylation was attributed to the inhibition of IFN - and IL -2. Andrographolide suppressed T -cell immune response and potentially macrophage stimulation, deoxyandrographolide showed a similar effect. The other diterpe noids in the herb may also be active and contribute to these effects. 2004 Wang [159] BV-2 Microglia, LPS stimulated Andrographolide inhibited TNF -, ROS, NO and PGE 2 production. Attenuated iNOS and COX -2 protein translation and/or stability (w estern blot). Pre and post treatment were both effective. The pre- treatment effect was attributed to the reduction in pro -inflammatory mediators (TNF -) by possible reduction in LPS induced ROS. The post treatment of 68 No effect was found on transcription (PCR mRNA). andrographolide attenuated iNOS and COX -2 stability. Andrographolide was shown to inhibit inflammation by at least two related but separate mechanisms. 2006 Qin [170] Murine macrophages, LPS stimulated. Andrographolide decreas 12a and IL -12b at mRNA level, and reduced the production of TNF - and IL -12p70 proteins in a concentration dependent manner. Andrographolide inhibi ted the activation of ERK1/2, MAPK , which could reduce TNF - transcription but not IL -12a/b. Suppression of IL -12a/b transcription must be due to another effect of andrographolide. Andrographolide was shown not to affect the activation of JNK, p38 or NF-B. 2006 Sheeja inhibited TNF - production. IL-2 and IFN levels during CTX treatment were elevated. induced ROS production. Glutathione (GSH) (body antioxidant ) was shown to be depleted in CTX treated mice. Andrographolide and A. paniculata preserved normal bladder morphology and G SH levels. It is not clear whether the anti - inflam matory effect was due to antioxidant activity reducing inflammatory response stimulation (TNF -) or if it reduced inflammation and prevented further free radical production (NO). CTX in therapeutic doses suppressed immune response, increased IL -2 and IFN - shows andrographolide may attenuate this effect (mechanisms unknown). Liu [161] Murine Macrophage sRAW264.7, LPS Neoandrographolide inhibited TNF - and NO production. This study uses a similar inflammation model to our study. 69 stimul ated. 2007 Li [172] Muri ne inhibited TNF - and IL-6 production. This study synthesised and tested a number of andrographolide derivatives. Two isoandrographolide derivatives showed up to double the inhibition of andrographolid e in TNF - suppression but most were lower. Five andrographolide derivatives showed greater inhibition of IL -6. The study indicated that many of the diterpenes in A. paniculata may have an anti-inflammatory effect. 2007 Sheeja [173] B16F -10 melanoma cell line- in mice. A. paniculata and andrographolide increased IL -2 decreased IL -1, IL -6, TNF - and GM -CSF levels. The herbal e xtract containing both flavonoids and terpenoids showed similar activity to the pure andrographolide at 20 times the dose, but the andrographolide in the extract was not quantified. The reduction over 24 h was less than half but over 9 days there was up to 6 times less TNF -. NO production was inhibited and may have contributed to reduced release of cytokines. Results show that although there is a significant initial effect, the longer term effect is even greater. 2008 Liu [174] L-929 macrophage cells, LPS stimulated. Andrograpanin (diterpene in A. ta) reduced NO, TNF -, IL -6 and IL-12p70 production. This was determined by western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, showing reduced gene expression levels. Andrograp anin is a diterpene in A. paniculata . It is naturally much less abundant than andrographolide, the focus of most research. However, this study illustrated that andrograpanin has anti - inflammatory activity by reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs, which is different to the mechanism 70 Andrograpanin also caused down regulation of LPS induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPKs. However, phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, SAPK/ JNK MAPKs and degradation of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B -cells inhibitor, reported by Burgos et. al [169]. Other diterpenoids in A. paniculata may contribute to the anti -inflammatory effect by the same mechanisms as andrograph olide or complementary mechanisms as with andrograpanin. It is unclear if andrograpanin is in high enough concentration in the herb to contribute to this effect when A. paniculata is administered. 2009 Abu - Ghefreh [175] Mouse peritoneal macrophages and in vitro mice with OVA airway inflammation. Andrographolide suppressed the release of TNF - and GM -CSF both in vivo and in vitro . Andrographolide suppressed LPS - induced expression of mRNA for the two cytokines. The accumulation of lymphocytes and eosinophils in vitro was abolished. Andrographolide was as effective as the steroid drug - dexamethasone, and like steroids, it a ppears to act primarily by inhibiting the expression of mRNA for inflammatory cytokines. This effect may be due to reduced NF -B activity. Anti-inflammatory effects were conserved in vivo , showing the effect is independent of whole immune system stimulatio n, although this may have complementary effects in vitro . 2009 Boa [162] Balb/c m ice with OVA airway inflammation. TNF - induced activ ation in normal human bronchial IL-4, IL -5, IL-13, eotaxin and eosinophil despite increased I FN- in OVA inflamed mice. Andrographolide blocked TNF -, induced up regulation of IL -6, IL -8 and CCL5 mRNA expres sion. It was proposed that the inhibition of NF -B, was a result of kinase -b (IkBKb) (western blott). The reduced eosinphil count may have been caused by the reduced release of cytokines due to reduced NF -B activity or may be due to another effect of andrographolide. The reduced number of eosinophils may have 71 significantly reduced all inflammatory indicato rs at the site of inflammation. 2010 Chan [163] Cerebral ischaemia rat model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Androgr apholide reduced the production of TNF -, IL -1 and PGE 2. Suppressed the translocation of the NF - B subunit, p65 from cytosol to nucleus. The results indicated reduced NF -B activation in activated microglial. NF - B inhibition could account for the reduce d production of the cytokines and eicosanoid. It may not be the only effect. 2010 Chao [176] RAW 264.7 cells, LPS/IFN - stimulated. Andrographolide and components of A. paniculata reduced the production of TNF -, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein -2. Andrographolide and components of A. paniculata inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF -B. Several other compounds in the herb (flavonoids, phytosterols and diterpenes) w ere more active than andrographolide and 4 derivatives were up to 3 times more active. This suggests that the anti - inflammatory effect by reduced NF -B activity is caused by many components of the herb. It is unclear if the active compounds are present in high enough concentration to contribute to the activity of A. paniculata . The increased activity of the derivatives also highlights the potential for drug development from andrographolide. 2010 Parichatikanond [167] Human whole blood, LPS stimulated (platelet suspension for COX -1). Andrographolide reduced the production of TNF -, IL -6, IL -1 and IL -10. Andrographolide caused the down regulation of (JAK3 and STAT5A), Down regulation was observed in nearly all 76 gene expressions measured. Most were minor (<1.2 fold) and could be attributed to inconsistencies in blood samples. H owever, andrographolide down regulation of NF -B (2 fold) could cause some of the observed effects. Andrographolide down regulated 72 TLRs and their receptor superfamilies up to 12 fold. This is likely due to a sep arate effect to that on NF -B. 2010 Wang [177] Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), LPS stimulated. Andrographolide reduced expression and production of IL -18, IL - 1 and IL -1R. IL - 18BP increased which is an IL -18 inhibitor. In this st udy andrographolide showed regulation at a transcriptional level. This could be due to modulation of NF -B or another transcription factor. 2010 Sheeja Metastatic tumour bearing animals. A. panicul ata production of IL-1, IL -6, GM -CSF and TNF -. The mechanism was not explored. Andrographolide and A. paniculata extracts produced similar effect on inflammatory mediators, but the extract was not phytochemically characterised making comparison difficult. 2011 Chandrasekaran -I inhibited IL -6. This study indicated that some of these phytoc onstituents exhibit potent anti-inflammatory/anti - allergic effects by modulating different inflammatory/allergic mediators. Many of the components in A. paniculata are active and may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effect. A. paniculata has been shown to suppress the release of a number of different inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines are potent signallers and cells are very sensitive to cytokine levels. The concentration of the cytokine IL -1 that induces gene expression and synthesis of COX -2 is 10 pM, so that minute changes in cytokine levels can cause large responses [79]. Most of the research has focused on a small number of cytokines. Comparing different models and stimulations makes analysing results difficult. Many cytokines are interrelated, for example Burges et al. [169] shows andrographolide reduced IFN- release by T cells. IL -12p70 73 induces T h1 response which causes the release of IFN- from T cells. Qin et al. [170] shows that IL -12p70 is inhibited by andrographolide which may contribute to the suppression in IFN- release - in contrast, Sheeja et al. [173] showed in cancer models that IFN- levels were increas ed by andrographolide. Andrographolide was reported to reduce the levels of many cytokines in a variety of models. A summary of andrographolide's effects is shown in Table 8. Table 8: Andrographolide's effect on inflammatory cytokines and IL-2 2009 -Ghefreh macrophages GM-CSF mRNA - release GM-CSF release 2009 Boa OVA Bronchial epithelial cells IL-4 levels IL-5 levels -receptor release MIP-2 blood TNF - production IL-6 production IL-1 production IL-10 production 2010 Wang Human mononuclear IL-18 IL-1 release IL-6 release Andrographolide clearly plays a major role in the reduction of cytokine levels, both in vitro and in vivo . Neoandrographolide and andrograpin were shown to be active at inhibiting cytokine release, however, it remains unknown if they or other components contribute to the activity of A. paniculata . NF-B activity of andrographolide 3.1.9. NF-B is the controlling transcription factor for mediators of inflammation. The reduction in the expression of many cy tokines and reduced expression of iNOS, COX -1 and 2 may occur due to NF -B inhibition. Andrographolide is shown to inhibit NF -B activity through a number of mechanisms as shown in Table 9. 75 Table 9: The e ffects of A. paniculata and andrographolide on NF -B. Reference Method Comments 2004 Xia [179] Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and promyeloid cells HL -60, cells transfected with an NF-B-luciferase reporter. NF-B activity was reduced. Andrographolide formed a covalent adduct with reduced cysteine 62 of sup ported KO study on p50 C62S mutants and mass spectroscopy showing increase in mass of the p50 subunit. Andrographolide was shown to bind to p50 as mechanism of inhibiting NF stimulated. Action of andrographolide on NF - B determined by IB in cytosolic extracts and by binding to DNA using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in nuclear extracts. Andrographolide inhibited the NF -B- luciferase production induced by PAF. did not reduce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK or ERK1/2 and did not change IB degradation. Reduced NF -B DNA binding was inferred from lack of degradation of IB , and directly observed in EMSA. 2006 Iruretagoyena [181] Female C57BL/6 mice bone NF-B-luciferase reporter . Andrographoli de NF -B-blockade was observed. It can benefit by interfering with unwanted T cell responses by inhibiting maturation. 2007 Wang [182, 183] Isolated primary murine pulmonary vein endothelial cells and p50 null mice, with carotid artery restriction. Andrographolide attenuated the up regulation of NF -B target genes detected within the injured arterial walls. Genetic deletions of p50 caused the same effect . No effect on -50p mutant with andrographolide was observed so no other complementary effect in t his pathway assumed. However, this only confirms p50 is necessary for transcription. In this model , inhibition of NF -B by andrographolide binding supported. 2009 Bao [184] BALB/c mice sensitised and challenged with OVA developed airway inflammation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was assessed for total and differential cell counts, and cytoki ne and chemokine levels. TNF - induced In normal human bronchial epithelial cells, andrographolide blocked TNF - induced andrographolide blocked p65 nuclear translocation and DNA -binding activity in the nuclear extracts from lung tissues of OVA - challenged mice. 76 activation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Inhibiting the NF -B pathway was proposed to occur at the level of IB kinase -b activation by reduced phosphorylation (western null -1 cells transfected activity in stimulated endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages similar to deletion of p50. Results o f the electrophoretic mobil ity shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated the direct interaction of the p50/p65 heterodimer with the NF -B site interrupted by andrographolide. 2010 Chang [163] Rat model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). pMCAO was found to induce activation of microglia and TNF -, IL -1 and PGE 2, in the ischaemic brain areas. Andrographolide significantly attenuated or abolished these effects. In addition, andrographolide suppressed the translocation of p65 from cytosol to nucleus, reduced stimulated. NF-B-promoted activity of to inhibit NF -B. Andrographolide was part of the most active fractions, other fractions showed lesser activity. Andrographolide was one of the less active compounds in its fraction of flavonoids, phytosterols and other diterpenes . Greater activity of andrographolide was achieved by hydrogenation, oxidation, or acetylation thereby showing the potential of andrographolide as a lead. This study shows that other components of the herb contribute to NF-B inhibition. Andrographolide ma y not be the major contributor to NF -B activity. 2010 Levita [166] Energy minimisation was simulated using MMFF94x software. cell culture, LPS sti mulated. Andrographolide fulfils Lipinkis rule of 5 as a drug and has favourable van der Wall's and electrostatic interactions with the proposed binding site on the p50 subunit of NF -B. Scoring values of binding was 10 kcal/mol similar in binding strength and mechanism to gallic acid and tricarboxyl ic acid (12 kcal/mol). This s tudy supports andrographolide's of 2010 Parichatikanond [167] Human blood levels of mRNA usi ng human cDNA microarrays, stimulated with LPS. Andrographolide showed the most inhibition of COX -1 and 2 out of neo - and dehydro - andrographolide. Andrographolide attenuated the expression of 77 TLRs leading to modulation of inflammatory responses through th e inhibition of NF -B. Andrographolide affected many transcription factors other than NF -B which have been shown to participate in the induction of chemokine gene transcription by cytokines and engagement of TLRs. Most of the genes in the micro assay were slightly down regulated. This could be due to inconsistencies in blood samples. NK -kB was 2 fold down regulated, more than other transcription factors. 2010 Ren [186] Human lung adenocarcinoma (cancer) cell line A549, stimulated with TNF - to study the expression of NF -B signaling proteins by western blotting and NF -B DNA binding activity using ELISA. Andrographolide inhibited TNF - induced phosphorylation of IK in A549 cells, reduced phosphorylation of IB, blocked the subsequent degradation of IB , and had no effect on the expression of IK . Andrographolide decreased the DNA binding activity of NF -B p65 in the nucleus of A549 cells, inhibiting their growth. This may have been due to the inhibition of activation or previously shown p50 binding. 2011 Hsieh [187] Rats vascular smooth muscle cells, LPS/IFN - stimulated. Pre-treatment with andrographolide decreased iNOS an d -9 expressions and markedly impaired p65 translocation from cytosol to nucleus in cells exposed to LPS/IFN -. Andrographolide inhibited p65 nuclear downstream inhibitory IB phosphorylation and degradation were not altered by the presence of andrographolide. Andrographolide did not affect NF -B NF -B inactivation. This was supported by Okadaic acid (a selective inhibitor of PP2A) pre-treatment, which prevented induce PP2A activation inhibiting NF-B. 78 PP2 activation has bee n shown to inhibit NF - B. (Li, S., Wang, L., Berman, M. A., Zhang, Y., and Dorf, M. E. (2006) Mol. Cell 24, 497 - 509) of PP2 to attenuate andrographolide NF -B suppression. Other pathways have been shown to be regulated by PP2, for example, JNK -AP-1 cascade and p65 cascade. This may culminate in decreasing iNOS and MMP -9 expressions and other anti -inflammatory effects. There is a large body of research ( Table 9) supporting andrographolide's activity on NF -B. There are three main mechanisms whereby activity has been shown, namely p50 binding, reduced phosphorylation of IB on. Andrographolide's on NF-B appears to be due to a number of possible interactions. Many compounds in A. paniculata are structurally similar and could also elicit an effect. 79 3.2. Aims of the chapter 3 The aims of this chapter are to identify if andr ographolide is solely accountable for the activity of the commercial A. paniculata commercial extract on: The activity of inflammatory enzymes, iNOS and COX The release of inflammatory cytokines The activation of NF -B 80 3.3. Methods Materials 3.3.1. Standards used in analysis 3.3.1.1. The standards and reagents used are from reputable sources and with claimed purity . Apigenin (9 8%) and chlorogenic acid (99%) were China). Source of the A. paniculata extract 3.3.1.2. The A. paniculata commercial extract (extract ratio 14:1) standardised to 30% andrographolide was donated by LIPA Pharmaceuticals Ltd (NSW, Australia). The sample was re -analysed by HPLC with photodiode array detection (PDA) for andrographolide content to confirm the manufacturer's certificate of analysis. The extracts comply with the Therapeutic Goods Administration's guidelines for in corporation in herbal medicines manufactured in Australia. The plant material used to prepare the extract was sourced from and manufactured in southern India. The plant material was authenticated by a systematic botanist and extract traceability documents were provided by the manufacturer. Method used to partition and prepare extracts 3.3.2. The standardised A. paniculata commercial extract was separated by solvent partitioning to produce an extract with increased diterpene concentration (non -polar fraction) and an extract free from andrographolide (polar fraction). The standardised A. paniculata commercial 81 extract (40 g) was dissolved in chloroform (500 ml), it was then partitioned between water (200 ml) and acetonitrile (200 ml). The mixture was shaken and sonic ated for 10 min and left to settle. The top aqueous layer was removed and washed twice with chloroform 200 ml, to yield the \"Polar f raction\". The original organic layer was washed twice with water/acetonitrile (50/50, 200 ml) to yield the \"Non -polar fracti on\". Both extracts were gravity filtered and evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporator. The dry extracts were then resuspended in minimal water and freeze dried to yield an extract powder. Preparation of the mixed standard solution 3.3.3. A mixed standard sol ution containing compounds identified in A. paniculata was used to assess the performance of the partition system. The mixed standard solution contained 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The mixed standards were prepared at concentrations that produced comparable peak sizes. HPLC system 3.3.4. HPLC -PDA was used to profile the phyt ochemical composition of the A. paniculata extracts. The HPLC -PDA analysis was performed on Shimadzu UFLC system (Shimadzu, Australia) comprising of was controlled using Class -VP 7.4SP4 software. 82 HPLC analysis of extracts 3.3.5. This method was used to detect the minor components of the herb but not for quantification, therefore, the samples were run at high concentrations. The A. paniculata commercial extract (30 mg/ml), Non -polar fraction (15 mg/ml) and Polar fraction (50 mg/ml) were dissolved by sonication in 50 % aqueous acetonitrile. The HPLC -PDA analysis of the extracts was performed using an Alltech Alltima (Alltech , Australia) reverse phase C18 column 150 mm I.D., 5 \u00b5m) with a Phenomenex (California, USA) Security C18 guard column (20 mm \u00d7 4 mm, 5 m). HPLC -PDA profiles were generated by 5 \u00b5l injection of fractionated samples. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % ( v/v) aqueous form ic acid (mobile phase A) and 0.1 % ( v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient program was 10% B for 10 min with a linear increase; to 50% B at 63 min, 70% B at 72 min and then 100% B (wash) for 8 min before equilibrating at the starti ng composition for 5 min. Mobile phase flow rate was maintained at 1 ml/min. The PDA was set to acquire absorbance data from 200 to 500 nm. HPLC method used quantify to quantify in the A. panicula ta extract, non -polar fraction and polar fraction. The extracts ( A. paniculata 1.5mg/ml, Non -polar fraction 0.8mg/ml and Polar fraction 1.7 were dissolved by sonication in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. HPLC analysis of the extracts was performed using a n Alltech Alltima (Alltech Australia) reverse phase C18 column (46 \u00d7 150 mm I.D., 5 \u00b5m) with a Phenomenex (California, USA) Security C18 guard column (20 mm \u00d7 4 mm, 5 m). 83 HPLC -PDA profiles were generated by 10 \u00b5l injection of extracted samples. The mobile phase was isocratic 30% aqueous acetonitrile (200-500 nm) was recorded and 227 nm was used to quantify the andrographolide peak.

It is outside the scope of this project to repeat the work and identify all peaks present in the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar an d polar fractions. Instead a mixture of standards was composed to assess if known components of A. paniculata were detectable in the commercial extract using the HPLC -PDA system and using mixed standards to determine the family of compounds being divided b y the solvent partitioning. Figure 19: HPLC chromatogram of A. paniculata commercial extract at 254 nm. Figure 19 is a chromatogram of the A. paniculata commercial extract used in the study. It is standardised to contain 30% w/w andrographolide, which is the largest peak (retention time 35.9 min) in the chromatogram with other compounds also present. To simplify the determination of the compounds responsible for activity in the in vitro anti-inflammatory testing, the complexity of the extract was reduced by separation into crude fractions by solvent parti tioning based on polarity. 0 700 1400 Retention time (min) 40 20 0 60 80 Absorbance (mAu) Andrographolide detection = 254 nm 86 Compounds have different absorption peaks ( max) and molar absorptivitie s () at different wavelengths, depending on the chromophore in the molecule. As the A. paniculata commercial extract contains different compounds with different structures, a wavelength that detects most of the compounds was selected for visualisation. Figure 20: Heat map contour chromatogram of A. paniculata commercial extract. The colours indicate intensity 20 shows a contour heat map chromatogram of the A. paniculata commercial extract where the colour from red (the hotter (red) the colour the higher the absorbance) to white shows the relative absorbance as a function of retention time (X axis) and wavelength (Y axis). The line drawn at 254 nm shows the wavelength sel ected for visualisation of the chromatograms. detection = 254 nm gave a balance for detecting the most number of compounds, whilst not showing the absorbance from the increasing % acetonitrile in the mobile phase. As this chromatogram was run over a steep gradient, this is more of a factor 200 300 400 Wavelength 40 20 60 80 0 Retention time (min) 87 than when it runs at shallow gradient where the normalised absorbance reduces the acetonitrile visibility.

The overlay (black) was normalised to the absorbance of A. paniculata commercial extract, with an offset of 10 mAu. Figure 21 is a chromatogram of the A. paniculata commercial extract overlaid with the mixed standard. Comparison of the UV spectrum of the sample and standard peaks allow the tentative identity confirm ation for some peaks. 0 100 200 Retention time (min) 40 20 0 60 80 Absorbance (mAu) detection The chlorogenic acid peak was Rt 14.7 min in the mixed standard and 14.8 min A. paniculata extract (green) . The isoquercetin peak was Rt 25.9 min in the mixed standard and 25.8 min A. paniculata extract (green) . The andrographolide peak Rt was 35.9 min for both the mixed standard and A. paniculata extract (green) . The apigenin peak was Rt 41.5 min in the mixed standard and 41.6 min A. paniculata extract (green) . The 14 -deoxy -11,12 - didehydroandrographolide peak Rt was 49.1 min for both the mixed standard and A. paniculata extract (green) . Figure 22: UV spectrum comparison between standards and peaks tentatively identified as corresponding peaks in A. paniculata commercial extract . It can be seen in Figure 22 that the peaks with the matching retention times to the mixed standards have similar UV spectrum.

In any case there is a good retention time match between sample and standard peak s and there is a fair match between their UV spectrums. There was no matching peak identified for wogonoside, despite it being reported in A. paniculata , as it may be below the detection limit. The identification of the small peaks is considered only tenta tive as some are close to detection limit. Partition of the mixed standard 3.4.1. The mixed standard was subjected to the solvent partitioning described in section 3.3.2 to assess its suitability for fractionating the A. paniculata commercial extract. Figure 23 shows an overlay of the mixed standard and the aqueous partition of the mixed standard. Figure 23: HPLC chromatogram of aqueous fraction of mixed standards at 254 nm. Polar fraction of mixed standard ( green ), mixed standard (black). The overlay (black) wa s normalised to the absorbance of the polar fraction of mixed standard with an offset of 20 mAu. 0 75 150 Retention time (min) 30 15 0 45 60 Absorbance (mAu) detection 90 It can be seen in Figure 23 that only chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin and wogonoside were extracted into the aqueous fraction. There is no detectable andrographolide, apigenin or 14 - deoxy -11,12 -didehydroandrographolide. This can be explained by the chemical structure and hence polar ity of the analytes. As can be seen in Figure 18, wogonoside and isoquercetin, both contain a polar sugar group making them water soluble. Chlorogenic acid is composed of a polar quinic acid and caffeic acid , making it polar and therefore water soluble. In contrast andrographolide, apigenin and 14 -deoxy -11,12 -didehydroandrographolide are would partition into chloroform. The partiti oning results are supported by the predicted pH dependent partition coefficient (log D) by ACD/Labs Percepta Platform - PhysChem Module . The compounds that were present in the aqueous fraction are chlorogenic acid (log D (pH 7.4) = -3.91) wogonoside (log D (pH 7.4) = -3.42), isoquercetin (log D (pH 7.4)= -1.19). In contrast the compounds that were not in the aqueous fraction are andrographolide (log D (pH 7.4) = 1.90), apigenin (log D (pH 7.4) = 1.26) and 14 -deoxy - 11,12 -didehydroandrographolide (log D (pH 7.4) = 2.48). Figure 24 shows the chromatogram of the chloroform fraction of the mixed standard, overlaid with the non -partitioned mixed standard. 91 Figure 24: HPLC chromatogram of chloroform fraction of mixed standards at 254 nm. Non-polar fraction of mixed standard ( green ), mixed standard (black). The overlay (black) was normalised to the absorbance of the non -polar fraction of mixed standard with an offset of 20 mAu. It can be seen in Figure 24 that the remaining analytes, andrographolide, apigenin and dehydroandrograpohlide are present in the non -polar extract, whereas chlorogenic acid and isoquercetin are not detected. Wogonoside may also be present in small quantities, so there may be some overlap in the extraction of mid -polarity molecules. This overlap is likely due to the non -polar wogonin ( o-methylated flavone) group that is attach ed to a sugar to form wogonside. Based on the separation achieved with the mixed standard, this method of partition is suitable to reduce the complexity of the extract and produce chemically fractionated extracts useful in locating the major active compo nent(s) of the A. paniculata commercial extract. 0 85 170 Retention time (min) 30 15 0 45 60 Absorbance (mAu) detection A. paniculata commercial extract 3.4.2. As the partition method described in section 3.3.2 was able to resolve compounds present in the mixed standard solution into different fractions, it was applied to the A. paniculata commercial extract. Figure 25 shows the chromatogram of the aqueous fraction of the A. paniculata commercial extract overlaid with the mixed standard. It can be seen that andrographolide is not detected in this fraction. Figure 25: HPLC chromatogram of the polar fraction of A. paniculata commercial extract at 254 nm.

It can be seen that andrographolide and 14 -deoxy -11,12 - didehydroandrographolide are present in this fraction. Figure 26: HPLC chromatogram of non-polar fraction of A. paniculata commercial at 254 nm . Non-polar fraction of A. paniculata commercial extract ( green ), mixed standard (black). The overlay (black) is normalised to the absorbance of the non -polar fraction of mixed standard with an offset of 50 mAu. 0 700 1400 Retention time (min) 40 20 0 60 80 Absorbance (mAu) detection shows an overlay of the A. pani culata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction. This overlay allows the observation that the less retained compounds before the andrographolide peak are excluded from the non -polar extract, to the enrichment of andrographolide and possible other dite rpenes. The enrichment of the non -polar compounds in the A. paniculata non-polar extract is difficult to observe in Figure 27 as A. paniculata (30 mg/m l, 5 l) was injected at twice the concentration of the non -polar fraction (15 mg/ml, 5 l). The enrichment of andrographolide from 32.1 mg/ml to 65.1 mg/ml in the non in 3.4.3 . Figure 27: chromatogram of non A. paniculata overlaid with the A. paniculata commercial extract at 254 nm .

It can be seen that some peaks are common to both fractions, however , andrographolide is only detected in the non - polar (chloroform) fraction. Figure 28: HPLC chromatogram of aqueous and chloroform fraction of the A. paniculata commercial extract at 254 nm. A. paniculata commercial extract ( green ), polar fraction (black). The overlay (black) was normalised to the absorbance of the A. paniculata with an offset of 10 mAu. The solvent partitioning procedure , developed and applied to the mixed standard containing compounds present in A. paniculata , was also applied to the A. paniculata commercial extract. The resulting polar (or aqueous) extract contained no detectable compounds eluting before andrographolide. In the mixed standard this correlated to the polyphenolic acid (chlorogenic acid) and flavo nol glycoside (isoquercetin). The non -polar (or chloroform) extract showed a lower concentration of other glycosides, correlating to wogonoside in the mixed standard and has enrichment of andrographolide and likely enrichment of other more hydrophobic comp ounds. The polar fraction had no detectable andrographolide or 14-deoxy - 0 100 200 Retention time (min) 40 20 0 60 80 Absorbance (mAu) detection = 254 nm 96 11,12 -didehydroandrographolide. These extracts will assist in narrowing down the major active components of the A. paniculata commercial extract and assessing the contribution of andrographolide to the herb's total activity. The disadvantage of this crude extraction is that there is some overlap with compounds being in both the polar and non -polar fractions. There are also multiple components in ea ch fraction so we cannot determine the compound responsible for activity without further fractionation. Quantification of andrographolide 3.4.3. The concentration of the andrographolide in the standardised A. paniculata commercial extract as well as the non -polar fraction created by the solvent partition was determined using the HPLC method described in section 3.3.6 . Figure 29 shows an overlay of the chromatograms of the andrographolide standard, the andrographolide present in the A. paniculata commercial extrac t and the non -polar fraction. 0 100 200 Retention time (min) 5 2.5 0 7.5 10 Absorbance (mAu) Andrographolide A. paniculata Non-polar extract Reference nm 97 Figure 29: HPLC chromatogram comparing andrographolide standard to the A. paniculata commercial extract and non-polar fraction at 227 nm . The retention time for the peak identified as andrographolide in the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction are almost the same. This identity of this peak is further supported by the UV spectrum of these peaks shown in Figure 30.

The overlay (black) was normalised to the absorbance of the A. paniculata with an offset of -15 mAu. In Figure 31 there is a peak of similar retention time (5.8 min) to that of andrographolide.

In Figure 32 it can be seen that the UV spectrum of the peak at 5.8 min in the polar extract does not match that of andrographolide and their retention times are different by 0.2 min. It is therefore likely that it is not andrographolide so was not quantified as andro grapholide. nm200 225 250 275 300mAu 01020 mAu 01020 100 Figure 33 shows the linear relationship between the peak area versus concentration produced by a range of known andrographolide concent rations standards. The calibration curve is linear (R2 = 0.9996) over the range relevant to this study. Figure 33: Andrographolide standard curve (n=3) . Table 10 shows the results for the analysis of andrographolide in the A. paniculata commercial extract in the non -polar fraction and polar fraction. The absence of andrographolide in the polar fraction shows the effectivenes s of the parti tioning, as does enriching of andrographolide in the non -polar fraction. The calculated concentrations of andrographolide were used to normalise the in vitro doses to the andrographolide concentration of the extracts, to determine if the activity observed was accounted for by andrographolide concentration alone. y = 968.95x + 6.7907 R\u00b2 = 0.9996 0100200300400500600700800 0 0.8 1Peak area Andrographolide concentration (mg/ml) Andrographolide standard curve 101 Table 10: Concentration of andrographolide in the A. paniculata commerc ial extract, non -polar fraction and polar fractions. % w/w RSD (%) A. paniculata un-partitioned commercial extract 32.1 0.1 Non-polar fraction 65.1 0.1 Polar fraction Not detected Nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells 3.4.4.

The dose response curve is shown in Figure 34. It can be seen that andrographolide is the most potent by weight (g/ml) at inhibiting NO production, followed by the non -polar fraction, the A. paniculata commercial extract and then the polar fraction. 102 Nitric Oxide production by RAW264.7 cells 1 10 100 1000 -100102030405060708090100110 Andrographolide Non-polar fraction Polar fraction A.paniculata Concentration ( g/ml)NO production (%) Figure 34: NO dose response curve for andrographolide ( red, circles), A. paniculata commercial extract ( green , inverted triangles), the non -polar fraction (blue, squares) and the polar fraction ( black , triangles), by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The data was fitted with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=9) To determine if the activity observed i n the NO production assay can be attributed to andrographolide in the extract and non -polar fraction, the doses were normalised to andrographolide concentration (M andrographolide) so that the dose of the non -polar fraction and the A. paniculata commercia l extract reflected the calculated concentration of andrographolide present. The dose response curve when normalised to andrographolide concentration (M andrographolide) is shown in Figure 35. 103 Nitric Oxide production by RAW264.7 cells (normalised) 1 10 100 -100102030405060708090100110 Andrographolide Non-polar fraction A.paniculata M andrographolideNO production (%) Figure 35: NO dose response curve for andrographolide ( red, circles), A. paniculata commercial extract ( green inverted, triangles) and the non -polar fraction (blue, squares), by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The doses have been normalised to andrographolide content (M) for A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=9) In Figure 35 it can be observed that the dose response curves for the andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and non -polar fraction, when normalised to andrographolide concentration are very similar. A c omparison of the resulting IC 50s and confide nce intervals is given in Table 11. 104 Table 11: NO IC 50's IC50 of IC50 M andrographolide Pure andrographolide 2.6 2.4 to 2.9 7.4 6.7 to 8.1 A. paniculata commercial extract 6.2 5.6 to 6.9 6.3 5.6 to 6.9 Non-polar fraction 3.5 3.2 to 3.7 7.2 6.7 to 7.7 Polar fraction 330.6 285.8 to 382.5 NA The IC 50 is calculated from the fitted curves in Figure 34 and Figure 35. Table 11 shows that per gram of andrographolide the A. paniculata commercial extract is the most active. This would suggest that other components of the herb contribute to the NO inhibition, however, this contribution can also be attributed to the uncertainty in the assay, as the results for the A. paniculata commercial extract and pure a ndrographolide overlap when considering the 95% confidence interval. It is probable that andrographolide is the exclusive contributor to the effect. The NO inhibition dose response curves were compared for andrographolide and the normalised (to andrographolide concentration) A. paniculata commercial extract and non - polar fraction. An F -test was used to compare the curves, fitting the three curves to on e curve and giving a p -value that reflects if the model fit is statistically significantly. The dose response curve comparison is shown in Figure 36. 105 Nitric Oxide production by RAW264.7 cells (normalised) F-test -100102030405060708090100110 A.paniculata M andrographolideNO production (%) Figure 36: NO dose response curve combined F -test for pure andrographolide, A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction normalised to andrographolide concentration. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line s show the 95% confidence interval range. p= 0.1278. Andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction were potent inhibitors of NO in RAW26 4.7 cells. The polar fraction containing no detectable andrographolide was considerably less active. The dose response curves when normalised to andrographolid e content are similar. The IC 50s of the andrographolide content in each extract are within statis tical agreement and the dose response curves when fitted to a single curve showed statistical agreement with the fit. Thus, at this level of analysis, there is no evidence for antagonistic, additive or synergistic effects between andrographolide and other phytochemical constituents of the A. paniculata commercial extract. The extract's activity was almost entirely accounted for by the andrographolide content, and the contribution of the other compounds is not evident, probably due to their low concentration . 106 PGE 2 release by RAW264.7 cells 3.4.5. To determine if the results observed for NO inhibition are applicable to other mediators of inflammation, pure andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract (normalised to andrographolide concentration) were tested for their inhibition of PGE 2 release by LPS and IFN- stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The dose response curve is shown in Figure 37. PGE 2 released by RAW264.7 cells 1 10 100 A.paniculata M andrographolide% PGE2 release dose response curve for andrographolide ( red, circles) and the A. paniculata commercial extract (green , squares ), by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The doses have been normalised to andrographolide content (M) for the A. paniculata commercial extract. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=9) In Figure 37 it can be observed that the PGE 2 release dose response curves for the andrographolide and A. paniculata commercial extract (normalised to andrographolide concentration) are very similar. A comparison of the resulting IC 50s and confidence intervals is given in Table 12. 107 Table 12: PGE 2 inhibition range of IC 50 M andrographolide Pure andrographolide 8.8 7.4 to 10.4 Andrographolide in A. paniculata commercial extract 6.1 4.4 to 8.4 * CI, confidence interval It can be seen in Table 12 that the A. paniculata commercial extract normalised to andrographolide content i s slightly more potent at inhibition of PGE 2 release from RAW264.7 cells than andrographolide. The IC 50s are in agreement as to the difference between andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract but again the results are not outside the range of the uncertainty for the assay. The PGE 2 inhibition dose response curves were compared to pure andrographolide and the normalised (to andrographolide concentration) A. paniculata commercial extract. An F -test was used to compare the curves, fitting the two curves to one curve and giving a p -value that reflect if the model fits are statistically significant . The dose response curve comparison is shown in Figure 38. 108 PGE 2 released by RAW264.7 cells F-test 1 10 PGE2 release Figure 38: PGE dose response curve combined F -test for pure andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract normalised to andrographolide concentration. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line s show the 95% confidence interval range; p= 0.0849 Andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract are both potent inhibitors of PGE 2 release from RA W264.7 cells. The dose response curves when normalised to andrographolide content are similar. The IC 50s of the andrographolide content in the extract are within statistical agreement and the dose response curves when fitted to a single curve showed statis tical agreement with the fit. Thus, at this level of analysis, the A. paniculata commercial extract's activity appears to be almost entirely accounted for by the andrographolide content. RAW264 .7 TNF - assay 3.4.6. To determine if the andrographolide concentrati on accounts for the activity of the A. paniculata commercial extract on the release of TNF -, pure andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract were tested for their inhibition of TNF - release by LPS and IFN- stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The do se response curve is shown in Figure 39. 109 TNF- released by RAW264.7 cells 1 10 100 1000 A.paniculata M andrographolide% TNF released Figure 39: TNF - dose response curve for andrographolide (red, circles) and the A. paniculata commercial ( green , squares), by LPS and IFN - stimulate RAW264.7 cells. The doses have been normalised to andrographolide content (M) for the A. paniculata . The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised respon se with variable slope model. (n=12) Table 13: IC 50s for TNF - inhibition by andrographolide and the andrographolide in the A. paniculata extract. IC50 M normalised to andrographolide content 95% CI* range of IC 50 M andrographolide Pure Andrographolide 23.3 20.1 to 27 Andrographolide in A. paniculata commercial extract 22.3 19.5 to 25.5 *CI - confidence interval It can be seen in Table 13 that A. paniculata commercial extract normalised to andrographolide content was slightly more potent at inhibition of PGE 2 release from RAW264.7 cells than pure andrographolide. However, the IC 50s are in agreement and the 110 difference between pure andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract is not outside the range of the uncertainty for the assay. The TNF - inhib ition dose response curves were compared for pure andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract (normalised to andrographolide concentration). An F -test was used to compare the curves, fitting the two curves to one curve and giving a p -value tha t reflect s if the model fits are statistically significant. The dose response curve comparison is shown in Figure 38. TNF- released by RAW264.7 cells F-test 1 10 100 andrographolide% TNF released Figure 40: dose response curve combined F -test for andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract normalised to andrographolide concentration. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line s show the 95% confidence interval range. Pure andrographolide and the A. paniculata commercial extract are both potent inhibitors of TNF - release from RAW264.7 cells. The dose response curves when normalised to andro grapholide content are similar. The IC 50s of the andrographolide content in each extract 111 are within statistical agreement and the dose response curves when fitted to a single curve showed statistical agreement with the fit. Thus, at this level of analysis, the extract's activity against LPS and IFN - induced TNF - release from RAW264.7 cells appears to be almost entirely due to andrographolide content. THP -1 TNF - results 3.4.7. The results observed so far indicate that in the LPS and IFN - stimulated murine RAW2 64.7 cell line, inhibition of the release of NO, PGE 2 and TNF - is due to the andrographolide in the extract. If the other components of the herb were contributing to the inhibition, it is not evident in the assays. To see if the effect was conserved in hu man THP -1 cells the inhibitory effect of pure andrographolide was compared to the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non-polar fraction. TNF- released by THP-1 1 TNF release - dose response curve for pure andrographolide ( red, circles), the A. paniculata commercial extract (green , squares) and the non -polar extract (blue, triangles), by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. The doses have been normalised to andrographolide content (M) for the A. paniculata commerci al extract and the non -polar fraction. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=12) 112 Table 14: IC50s for TNF - inhibition by pure andrographolide and andrographolide in the A. pa niculata commercial extract THP cells . IC50 M normalised to andrographolide content CI range of IC 50 M andrographolide Pure andrographolide 16.5 13.1 to 21.0 Andrographolide in A. paniculata commercial extract 17.5 14.7 to 20.1 Andrographolide in non - polar fraction 22.3 19.5 to 25.5 It can be seen in Table 14 that pure andrographolide is slightly more potent at inhibition o f TNF - release from THP -1 cells than the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction. However, the IC 50s are in agreement. The TNF - inhibition dose response curves were compared for pure andrographolide and the normalised (to andrographolide concentration) A. paniculata commercial extract. An F -test was used to compare the curves, fitting the three curves to one curve and giv ing a p -value that reflect s if the model fit is statistically significant . The dose response curve comparison is shown in Figure 42. 113 TNF- released by THP-1 F-test 1 TNF release TNF - dose response curve combined F -test for pure andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction normalised to andrographolide concentration. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line s show the 95% confidence interval range; p= 0.0981 Pure andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction are all potent inhibitors of TNF - release from LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. The dose response curves when normalised to andrographolide content are similar. The IC 50s of the andrographolide content in each extract are within statistical agreement and the dose response curves when fitted to a si ngle curve showed statistical agreement with the fit. Thus, at this level of analysis, the extract 's activity against LPS and IFN - induced TNF - release from THP -1 cells is almost entirely accounted for by the andrographolide content. Multiplex results 3.4.8. The release of 27 cytokines by a multiplex bead based ELISA was performed on the supernatant of LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. The experiment was to determine if 114 andrographolide has an inhibitory effect on the 27 cytokines and chemokines and to see if the effect of the A. paniculata commercial extract could be accounted for by the andrographolide concentration alone. The commercially available kit was expensive, limiting the number of replicates to 2. This limitation means that the statistical significance of the results is also limited. Figures 44 to 68 show the dose response curves and the F -test for pure andrographolide, the commercial extract of A. paniculata and the non -polar fraction, normalised for andrographolide content. A summary of the IC 50 values and p -tests is presented in Table 16, after the figures. The polar fraction is also shown in the figures, however, as it contained no quantifi able andrographolide content, the dose cannot be converted to M andrographolide concentration , so is presented as g/ml. This makes comparison from the dose response curves difficult. In the vast majority of the cytokines quantified the polar fraction is significantly less active. The polar fraction displayed the most activity at IP -10 inhibition. The IC 50 for the polar fraction was less than but comparable to andrographolide in this assay. The IC 50s converted to g/ml are shown in Table 15. Table 15: IP-10 IC 50 comparison between extracts of the A. paniculata commercial extract and pure andrographolide Assay Pure andrographolide Non- polar fraction A. paniculata commercial extract Polar fraction IP-10 IC -50 (M andrographolide) 12.8 15.6 17.9 CI 95% IC 50 6.8 to 24.1 7.4 to 32.9 11.2 to 28.8 IP-10 IC -50 (g/ml) 4.5 8.4 19.7 9.1 CI 95% IC 50 2.4 to 8.5 4.0 to 17.8 12.3 to 31.6 5.2 to 16.1 115 As can be seen in Table 15, the IC 50 when converted to g/ml for pure andrographolide , decreased by about a third, the non -polar extract decreased about a half and the A. paniculata commercial extract remained comparable. In virtually all other cytokine assays the IC 50 of the polar fraction was greater than the others tested, indicating less activity. This would be exaggerated further in by presenting all the data in g/ml. Figures 44 to 68 show the dose response curves and the F -test for pure andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction, normalised to andrographolide content and the polar fraction in g/ml.

The dotted line s show the 95% confidence interval range. 123 The dose response curve in Figur e 55, for the non -polar extract did no t fit with the F -test for BFGF release. This may be due to a limited number of data points showing significant inhibition, as the extracts were less active at BFGF inhibition.

The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs . normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line shows the 95% confidence interval range. In Figure 57, the A. paniculata commercial extract was excluded from the F -test as its fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model was ambiguous. This is a result of the steep decline in G -CFS release observed in Figure 56, meaning there was only one point on the IC 50 curve between near 100% and 0% inhibition. This makes the fit unreliable and the error in the IC 50 too large to compare. More replicate s with closer intervals in the doses tested might correct for this in future studies and make comparison possible. 125 GM-CFS release by THP-1 cells 1 10 100 1000020406080100120140 Androgragholide Non-polar fraction A.paniculata Polar fraction Dose (M andrographolide)%G-CFS release Figure 58: GM -CFS dose response curve for pure andrographolide ( red, circles), the A. paniculata commercial extract ( green , triangles), the non -polar fraction (blue, squares) and the polar fraction ( black , inverted triangles), by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells.

The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line shows the 95% confidence interval range. In Figure 61, the non -polar fraction was exclud ed from the F -test as the fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model was ambiguous. This is a result of the steep decline in VEGF release observed in Figure 60, meaning there is only one point on the IC 50 curve between near 100% and 0% inhibition. There were also large differences between duplicates in the assay when normalised to % release, complicating the analysis. This makes the fit unreliable and th e error in the IC 50 too large for reliable comparison. More replicates with closer intervals in doses tested might correct for this in future studies and make comparison possible. 128 IP-10 released by THP-1 cells 1 10 100 -20020406080100120 Androgragholide Non-polar fraction A.paniculata Polar fraction Dose (M andrographolide)%IP-10 release Figure 62: IP-10 dose response curve for pure andrographolide ( red, circles), the A. paniculata commercial extract (green , triangles), the non -polar fraction (blue, squares) and the polar fraction ( black , inverted triangles), by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells.

The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=2) An F -test curve fit was not possible for MCP -1 inhibition as the A. panic ulata commercial extract and the nonpolar fraction were significantly more active than pure andrographolide. 131 Eotaxin released by THP-1 cells 0.1 1 10 100020406080100120 Androgragholide Non-polar fraction A.paniculata Polar fraction Dose (M andrographolide)%Eotaxin released Figure 65: Eotaxin dose response curve for pure andrographolide ( red, circles), the A. panicu lata commercial extract (green , triangles), the non -polar fraction (blue, squares) and the polar fraction ( black , inverted triangles), by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells.

The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line s show the 95% confidence interval range. The non -polar fraction did not fit the F -test in Figure 66. This may be due to a limited number of data points showing significant inhibition, as the non -polar extrac t appears to be less active at e otaxin inhibition. 133 RANTES released by THP-1 cells 0.1 1 10 100020406080100120140160 Androgragholide Non-polar fraction A.paniculata Polar fraction Dose (M andrographolide)%RANTES released Figure 67: RANTES dose response curve for pure andrographolide ( red, circles), the A. paniculata commercial extract ( green , triangles), the non -polar fraction (blue, squares) and the polar fraction ( black , inverted triangles), by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells.

The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=2) An F -test was not possible for RANTES inhibition as there is insufficient activity to fit a dose response curve. Higher doses may be needed to test RANTES inhibition. There were a number of cytokines that showed no dose dependent inhibition by the A. paniculata commercial extract or it s components. The effect of the tested extracts on IL -9 release is shown in Figure 68. It can be seen that although IL -9 was released at detectable levels, there was no observed dose dependent response with little difference between LPS stimulated and non -stimulated cells. 134 Figure 68: IL-9 release d by A.panicualta, P=polar extract of A. paniculata In Figure 69 the % release of IL -17 is shown, normalised t o LPS stimulated and non - stimulated. It can be seen that there was no dose dependent response to A. paniculata nor any of its components. Figure 69: %IL -17 release by LPS IL -9 released Dose IL-17 release by THP -1 cells 135 Due to the high cost of the multicytokine assay, it was not possible to optimise the parameters for each cytokine, as a result of this not all of the 27 cytokines assayed produced usable results. Indeed, due to the limitations of the single cell and model not all cytokines were released by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. These results are summarised in, Table 16. NF-B results 3.4.9. The results presented thus far, testing the A. paniculata commercial extract and its components ' effect on the release of a number of inflammatory mediators in murine RAW264.7 and human THP -1 cells, suggest that in the vast majority of these mediators the effect can be attributed to andrographolide concentrations. This would strongly suggest an overa ll controlling factor. NF -B is the transcription factor that controls the transcription of many inducible inflammatory mediators. It is plausible that its inhibition could account for the observed wide spectrum effect. The dose response for NF -B testing is shown in Figure 70. 136 NF-B activation assay in ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells response curve pure andrographolide ( red, circles ), the A. paniculata commercial extract (green , squares ) and the non -polar fraction (blue, inverted triangles ) by LPS and IF N- stimulated ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells.

The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=12) 137 NF-B activation assay in dose response curve combined F -test for pure andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar fraction normalised to andrographolide concentration. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. The dotted line shows the 95% confidence interval range. It can be seen in Figure 70 that andrographolide, the A. paniculata commercial extract and the non -polar extract all inhibited NF -B activation in a similar dose dependent manner. This was confirmed with the F -test showing that they could all be fit to a single curve. The activity of the A. paniculata commercial extract o n NF -B activation inhibition is due to the andrographolide content in the extracts. Summary of results 3.4.10.

This was tested by F -test curve fits that displayed the variation observed was within the uncertainty of the assay. Pure andrographolide showed inhibitory activity against IL-1ra and MCP -1, however, is not the active component of the extract that the activity could be attributed to. In examples such as IL -6 and IP -10 where the polar extract containing no detectable andrographolide showed activity comparable to t he A. panicula ta commercial extract, it is likely that there is another highly active compound (or compounds) present. However, in the A. paniculata commercial extract where this compound should also be present , the activity is masked by andrographolide 's activity. The in-vitro anti-inflammatory results suggest that the pure andrographolide has equivalent anti-inflammatory activity to the extract. The pure compound ha s additional advantages such as decreased risk of side effects from other components and as it is pure , it is able to be administered practically at higher doses. However, the pharmaco kinetics research suggest that 14-deoxy -11,12 -didehydroandrographolide , deoxyandrographolide and neoandrographolide all play a role in reducing the rate of metabolism of andro grapholide [188], so the extract has justifiable favourable pharmacokinetics [189]. This might mean that clinically the pure andrographolide and A. paniculata may not be equivalent . 141 Andrographolide shows strong inhibition of a large number of inflammatory mediators. This would strongly suggest an overall controlling factor. NF -B is the transcription factor that controls the transcription of many inducible inflammatory mediators. Andrographolide's effect on NF -B activati LPS and I FN- stimulated ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells to see if this was the controlling factor. The most commonly implicated molecular mechanism underpinning the anti -inflammatory and immunomodulato ry effects of andrographolide is the inhibition of the -activated pro tein signal - regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling (specifically p38 MAPK/ERK1/2) pathway and downstream transcription factors such as NF-B and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) [190]. As the THP -1 and RAW264.7 macrophages models are not T cells, NFAT 's role is excluded, meaning, the role of NF -B activation should be a major factor. In Table 16, it can be see n that the majority of the IC 50s for the inhibition of mediators of inflammation within agreement of that of NF -B activation. It is therefore likely that NF -B activation inhibition is the major controlling effect of andrographolide for these cytokines . In a number of mediators the IC 50 observed is significantly below that of NF -B activation, this may b e due to an undetermined secondary or specific mechanism of action . It is probable that inhibition is happening at both a transcriptional level and directly on the enzyme for nitric oxide and PGE 2. Investigation of the mechanism for VEGF, NO, PGE 2, IL-6, IFN- and TNF - is warranted. The IC 50 results for andrographolide in decreasing order are shown in Table 17.

The IC 50 confidence interval was within agreement with NF -B activation and so the inhibition of these cytokines may occur due to th is mechanism of action.

In vitro comparison of Andrographolide to common NSAIDs 146 4.1. Introduction to chapter 4 NSAIDs are the current pharmacotherapy of choice for inflammation related diseases. With inflammation being implicated in an increasing number of diseases and the ageing population, the use of NSAIDs is growing strongly. Their use comes at a cost, with NSAIDs being linked to serious adverse side effects including gastric toxicity and cardiovascular failure. The adverse effects are directly linked to NSAID's mechanis m of action, namely inhibition of prostaglandin production by the cyclooxygenase enzymes. Due to the widespread reliance on NSAIDs there are practices in place to control the impact of their side effects, however, an alternative medication is needed. Infla mmation is a complex response and there are a number of mediators that control its severity. NSAIDs focus on reducing prostaglandin levels, however, prostaglandins are only one mediator in the complex inflammatory response mechanism. Additionally their red uction leads to negative side effects. In this chapter, andrographolide, a potential anti -inflammatory compound isolated from a traditionally used Ayruvedic herb A. paniculata , is compared to NSAIDs in a variety of in vitro cell based inflammatory assays. A broad array of inflammatory mediators was assayed, this reflecting the complex mechanism of inflammation, not just the prostaglandin reduction that NSAIDs are targeted to and is the cause of their side effects. By approac hing inflammation in this way it is hoped that a more holistic treatment will emerge with reduced side effects but increased efficacy. The use of NSAIDs 4.1.1. NSAIDs are one of the most widely used therapeutic agents [191]. They are used for relieving both pain and inflammation [192]. NSAIDs are often self -medicated for the treatment of short term inflammation and pain, such as headaches, injury, cold, flu, muscular 147 pain and menstrual pain. Common over -the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs available in Australia include aspirin, ibuprofe n (Neurophen), paracetamol (Panadol) and diclofenac (Voltaren). A US poll of more than 2,000 adults found that approximately 30% used OTC NSAIDs for pain on a regular basis [193]. The most commonly used NSAIDs are diclofenac (27.8 %), ibuprofen (11 %) and naproxen (9.4 %) in Australia by sales and this is reflected globally [194]. Intriguingly, diclofenac is by far the most popularly used NSAID despite having a risk to rew ard ratio identical to that of R ofecoxib, which was withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns [195]. NSAIDs are also the pharmacotherapy of choice for chronic inflammatory diseases including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease [196]. The use of NSAIDs, especially chronic use, increases with age with an estimate of up to 40% of people aged over 65 using NSAIDs daily [197, 198]. Increasing use of NSAIDs 4.1.2. With the high prevalence of chronic use among the elderly, society's dependence on NSAIDs is growing. Th e number of people aged 80 and over will increase dramatically in the near future, and it is predicted that the proportion of citizens above the age of 60 will double between now (2015) and the year 2025 [21]. Consequently, age -related diseases are projected to be the leading cause of disability by the year 2020, imposing a significant burden on affected individuals and on society in general [22]. Age is identified as a leading risk factor for many diseases such as acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and degenerative musculosk eletal disease. There is increasing evidence suggesting that chronic inflammation is a contributing factor in these age -related diseases [16-20]. With the increasing elderly population and the growing implication of inflammation in a wide range of age related diseases, chronic use of NSAIDs is set to rise 148 rapidly. However, the widespread use of NSAIDs comes at a price - NSAIDs can cause serious gastrointestinal toxicity [24] and some have been linked to increased blood pressure, greatly increasing the risk of congestive heart failure and thrombosis [25]. Side effects of NSAIDs 4.1.3. NSAIDs are often naively perceived as a safe over the counter medicine without awareness of their potential adverse effects [196]. A combined US study of 9,062 adults found OTC NSAIDs were used on an as -needed basis, with 40% using prescription and OTC NSAIDs at the same time and 26% using OTC NSAIDs above the recommended do se [199]. NSAIDs are responsible for the largest number of hospital admissions for adverse prescription drug reactions, with a UK s tudy finding they are responsible for 29.6% of all hospital admissions for adverse drug reactions [25]. The risks of adverse events increase with long -term use but NSAIDs remain the major pharmacotherapy for a number of chronic inflammatory conditions like asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and inflamma tory bowel disease. The serious adverse effects of NSAIDs are well understood to be largely related to their mechanism of action [200]. NSAID mechanism of action 4.1.4. NSAIDs target the prostaglandin G/H synthase enzyme (COX) that is responsible for the production of PGs which are implicated in inflammation [26]. There are two major isoforms of COX, COX -1 and COX -2. Many NSAIDs inhibit both COX enzymes to different degrees. COX -1 is expressed constitu tively in most tissue, giving the impression its major role is housekeeping. This impression gave rise to the theory that COX -1 inhibition is the major cause of the side effect observed with NSAID treatment. COX -2 on the other hand is subject 149 to rapid indu ction by inflammatory cytokines and mitogens, so is thought to be exclusively linked to PG production at sites of inflammation [27, 28]. It was thought that COX -2 selective inhibitors would reduce the side -effects and incr ease the potency of NSAIDs. COX -2 conformational protein studies revealed that COX -2 has a wider binding site compared to COX -1, favoring targeted inhibition [201]. The rapid development of selective COX -2 inhibitors ensued which ultimately led to the development of selective COX -2 inhibitors. These, however, failed to mitigate the side effects and in some ca ses increased the cardiovascular side effects leading to the withdrawal of a selective COX -2 inhibitor, Rofecoxib from the North American market. The major failure of NSAIDs is that their mechanism of action is directly linked to the adverse side effect [200]. Due to the prevalence of adverse events and an understanding of their mechanism of action, the side effects of NSAIDs are well understood leading to a number of strategies to help mitigate them. Strategies to reduce NSAIDs' adverse effects 4.1.5. Despite the adverse effects of NSAIDs and selective COX -2 inhibitors, in the majority of cases there is no viable alternative. Recently TNF - inhibitors have been developed that are appropriate alternatives in some cases and steroid ba sed anti -inflammatory drugs are used in other cases [23, 202, 203]. The side effects of steroids limit their use and popularity - in fact it led to the coining of the term \"Nonsteroidal\" to differentiate NSAIDs from the adverse even ts of steroids used in the 1950 s [204]. There are a number of strategies employed to reduce the adverse effects of NSAIDs, with gastrointestinal dama ge being reduced with the co - prescription of proton pump inhibitors [205] and lower risk NSAIDs are used with patients identified as having a high cardiovascular risk [206]. This has led to the continual increase in non-selective NSAID (as tested in this study), where selective COX -2 inhibitors is in decline 150 [207, 208]. These efforts to mitigate the adverse events highlight the need for NSAIDs despite the cost which underpins the need to develop novel and safe anti -inflammatory medicines [209]. Alternatives to NSAIDs 4.1.6. In vivo inflammation is a complex interaction of different cells and signals [210]. Targeting just one major pathway (PG, NSAIDs) for inflammation, especially one linked to so many harsh side effects, is a very limited approach to solving a complex problem. The development of TNF - inhibitors shows a step away from the traditional prostaglandin focused pathway. However, it is still limited to a specific pathway where there are many other inflammatory mediators that also contribute. NSAIDs were simp listically developed to target specific enzymes and have been linked to serious side effects. Traditional systems of medicine developed with no knowledge of enzymes are likely less targeted to COX inhibition than modern NSAIDs. Traditional medicines have b een developed based on human studies and efficacy, with no in vitro bias toward COX inhibition. Herbs/components of herbs are theorised to act synergistically on separate related pathways and systems to produce a stronger but less focused effect than moder n pharmaceuticals [211-214]. It is plausible tha t traditionally used anti -inflammatory drugs may target other mediators of inflammation and present a different approach to anti - inflammatory development that is not narrowly focused on a pathway that has been linked to many serious adverse effects. 151 Andro grapholide as an alternative to NSAIDs 4.1.7. Andrographolide is an ent -labdane diterpenoid and the major secondary metabolite isolated from the historically used medicinal herb, Andrographis paniculata (Acanthaceae) [42, 167, 168, 175, 215-227]. A. paniculata is used as a herbal medicine in both traditional Indian and Chinese medicine (where it is known as Kalmegh and Chuanxinlian, respectively) to treat a wide variety of ailments linked to inflammation [228, 229]. Andrographolide has been shown to be the major active component and inhibits a wide range of inflammatory mediators and accounts for most of the activity of the herb. Andrographolide is a potential lead compound for the dev elopment of new anti -inflammatory compounds guided by historic use and not by specific COX inhibition. Intriguingly, andrographolide has been reported to exhibit gastro - protective and ulcer preventive effects, which, combined with its well documented anti - inflammatory effects could make it a safe alternative to traditional NSAIDs [230]. A proprietary A. paniculata extract (HMPL -004, Hutchison MediPharma) is under development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [231, 232] and is currently being tested in a global phase III clinical trial ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01805791 ). 152 4.2. Aims of chapter 4 The aims of this chapter are to compare current NSAIDs to andrographolide in in vitro inflammation a ssays to assess their effect on: The activity of inflammatory enzymes, iNOS and COX The release of inflammatory cytokines The activation of NF -B 153 4.3.

Briefly the cells were seeded at 1\u00d7105 cells/well in a 96 well plate for 48 h. The compounds of interest were added in DMSO (final concentration 0.1 % DMSO), 1 h be fore stimulation with LPS and I FN-. After 18 h the supe rnatant was tested (180 l) in the TNF - ELISA. A MTT solution (60 l) was used to assess the vi ability of the remaining cells. 155 4.4. Results and d iscussion Nitric oxide production by RAW264.7 cells 4.4.1. The andrographolide and NSAIDs were tested in the NO assay t o determine their IC 50 for inhibiting NO production by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The dose response curve is shown in Figure 72. It can be seen that andrographolide is more potent at inhibition of NO production.

This experiment was carried out to compare andrographolide's inhibition of NO production to that of aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen and naproxen . Andrographolide inhibited NO production a t much 156 lower doses than NSAIDs. As NSAIDs are not targeted at inhibition of iNOS it is not surprising that they show little to no activity. On the other hand andrographolide showed strong inhibition. PGE2 release by RAW264.7 cells 4.4.2. PGE 2 is a major inflammatory mediator and a product of the enzyme target by NSAIDs . The pure andrographolide and NSAIDs were tested in the PGE 2 assay to determine their IC 50 for inhibiting PGE 2 release by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264. 7 cells. The dose response curve is shown in Figure 73. It can be seen that NSAIDs are more potent at inhibition of PGE 2 release. . 157 PGE 2 release by RAW264.7 cells 0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 10 curve for andrographolide ( red circles), diclofenac ( green inverted triangles), aspirin triangles ), paracetamol (blue diamond ) and ibuprofen ( grey circles) by LPS and IFN - by stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The data is fit wit h a log (inhibitor) vs. normalis ed response with variable slope model. (n=9) In Figure 73, it can be seen that andrographolide is a weaker inhibitor of PGE 2 than diclofenac and ibuprofen, but is similar to a spirin and paracetamol. The COX enzyme, which produces PGE 2, is the pharmacological target for NSAIDs. This causes and anti -inflammatory effect and has been linked to side effects [200]. Andrographolide inhibits PGE 2 production at about the same potency as weak non selective NSAIDs such as aspirin and paracetamol. Diclofenac and ibuprofen are stronger PGE 2 inhibitors but they are not considered selective COX -2 inhibitors though they show some selectivity for COX -2 [196]. Compared to andrographolide, diclofenac and ibuprofen are much more potent at inhibiting COX. The long 158 term use of diclofenac and ibuprofen is associated with s ide effects [196] while paracetamol and aspirin are considered comparatively safer [233]. Aspirin has even been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (opposite to the side effect of selective COX -2 inhibitors) [234]. Andrographolide displayed less potency than the semi selective COX -2 inhibitors, diclofenac and ibuprofen, making it appear inferior as a treatment for inflammation. However, P GE 2 inhibition has been shown to be an undesirable pharmacological target, due to side effects. Furthermore , the inflammatory response involves many other mediators that should also be considered in assessing anti -inflammatory potential. TNF- release by RAW264.7 cells 4.4.3. TNF - is a mediator of inflammation. The pure andrographolide and NSAIDs were tested to determine their IC 50 for inhibiting TNF - release by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells. This experiment was carried out to compare andrographolide's inhibition of TNF - to NSAIDs. The dose response curve is shown in Figure 74. It can be seen that andrographolide is more potent at inhibition of TNF -. . . 159 TNF- released by RAW264.7 cells Andrographolide curve andrographolide ( red circles), diclofenac ( green diamond circles ) and ibuprofen ( grey inverted triangles ) by LPS and IFN - by stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The data is fit wit h a log (inhibitor) vs. normalis ed response with variabl e slope model. (n=9) TNF - is a cytokine which is a mediator of inflammation. This experiment was carried out to compare andrographolide's inhibition of TNF - release to that of diclofenac, aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen. Andrographolide inhibited TNF - release at much lower doses than the NSAIDs, and the only NSAID that showed any detectable activity diclofenac. As NSAIDs are not targeted at inhibition of TNF - release , it is not surprising that they show little to no activity. On the ot her hand andrographolide displayed strong inhibition of TNF - which is considered an alternative anti -inflammatory treatment to NSAIDs [203]. 160 Multiplex assay 4.4.4. by LPS stimula ted THP -1 cells was determined by multiplex bead based ELISA . The experiment was performed to determine if andrographolide and the NSAID s had an inhibitory effect on the 17 cytokines and chemokines linked to inflammation. The commercially available kit was expensive, limiting the number of replicates to 2 and the range of doses. This limitation means that the statistical significance of the results is also limited. The dose response curves are shown in figures 76 to 84 and IC 50 summarised in Table 18.

(n=2) 165 Due to the high cost of the multicytokine assay, it was not possible to optimise the paramete rs for each cytokine, as a result of this not all of the 17 cytokines assayed produced usable results. Indeed, due to the limitations of the single cell and model not all cytokines were released by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. These results are summarised in, Table 18. NF-B activation assay 4.4.5. Andrographolide and diclofenac at high doses ha ve shown activity against a number of inflam matory cytokines and chemokines, suggesting an overall controlling factor. In contrast , the other NSAIDs have not (unsurprisingly ) but show exclusively to PGE 2 inhibition . As NF -B is the transcription factor that controls the transcription of many indu cible inflammatory mediators, if NSAIDs inhibited its activation, reductions in downstream inflammatory cytokines would have been observed in the multicytokine assay . It is therefore unlikely that NSAIDs inhibit the activation of NF -B at doses below 100 M. However, to complete the comparison , the dose response for NF -B testing is shown in Figure 84. 166 NF-B activation assay in ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells -B activation response curve for andrographolide ( red circles), diclofenac ( green squares), aspirin ), circles ) and ibuprofen ( grey by LPS and IFN - stimulated ELAM9 RAW264.7 cel ls. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. It can be seen in Figure 84 that andrographolide and diclofenac (to some extent) both inhibit NF-B activation in a dose dependent manner. However, andrographolide is far more potent. Diclofenac's ability to inhibit NF -B activation at high doses (>100 M), could account for its inhibition of multiple cytokines at similarly high doses. 167 Summary 4.4.6. A summary of the IC 50s for the in vitro anti-inflammatory assays is given in Table 18.

The inhibition of IL -2 and IL -4 is not desirable for an anti -inflammatory drug as their roles as cytokines are considered anti-inflammatory. Andrographolide inhibited IL -2 (IC 50 35.7 M) and IL -4 (IC 50 32.8 M), however , not as potently as major inflammatory cytokines such as IL -6 (IC 50 12.2 M) and IL-1 (IC 50 18.1 M). The mechanism of andrographolide action was not determined in this study , however , it would appear from the IC 50 that andrographolide may be acting by inhibition of NF -B activation, as the IC 50 observed (23.4 to 29.0 M ) is in agreement or below most of the assayed mediators. The major inflammatory cytokines IL -6 (IC 50 12.2 M) and IL -1 (IC 50 18.1 M), showed IC 50s below this, so it is possible that there is a specific undetermined mechanism for their inhibition , which warrants further study. For an estim ation of the IC 50s in vivo potential , the reported Cmax plasma concentrations for andrographolide and NSAIDs are compared in Table 19. 169 Table 19: PGE 2 IC50s for andrographolide and NSAI 7.73 0.0925 *minimal IC 50 from Table 18 >1000 3.8 to 34.2*** 4.4 to 9.4 111 to 422 46 to 79 359 to 394 *excluding PGE 2. ** the C max is typically reported as g/ml however was converted to M to enable comparison to IC 50's which are reported in M. The literature references for the reported ranges are; diclofenac [235],aspirin [236], paracetamol [237] and ibuprofen [238]. to 3.8 M reported in human plasma [239] up to 34.2 M in rat plasma [240]. Cmax plasma levels are only a guide used to assess pharmacological potential, and in vivo testing is needed to determine if there is a pharmacological ly significant effect. In addition , the IC 50 concentrations reported are nominal concentrations and the \"actual\" concentration at the site of interacti on between andrographolide and their potential (extra - and/or intracellular) target proteins (receptor(s) or enzymes) , have not been determined. NSAI Ds have displayed COX inhibitory activity and at pharmacological doses are specific to COX inhibition, which is supported by the PGE 2 results in this study . Andrographolide was shown to inhibit NO production, PGE 2 and TNF - release and NF -B activation in RAW264.7 cells and TNF -, IFN IL -1, IL MCP -1 in human THP -1 cells, below or within (the uncertainty) the maximum reported Cmax in rats [240]. Andrographolide has a greater widespread anti -inflammatory effect than NSAIDs and may be better suited to the complex nature of the inflammatory immune response. 170 NSAID 's defined mechanism of action makes understanding a nd rationalising their anti-inflammatory effect simpler. Their side effects are easily linked to the mechanism of action because as it is clearly understood. Andrographolide 's widespread action makes its safety and side effects more difficult to predict. However, A. paniculata has be en used for thousands of years in Ay urvedic medicine and is considered safe [39-43]. Andrographolide has been shown to have a high saf ety margin with the 50% l ethal dose (LD 50) for andrographolide through intraperitoneal rout es being 11.46 g/kg [241]. Andrographolide also been reported to exhibit gastro -protective and ulcer preventive effects, which, combined with its anti -inflammatory effects could make it a safe alternative to traditional NSAIDs [230]. Taking all evidence together andrographolide presents as a promising alternative to NSAIDs for broad inflammatory aliments but further study is required to establish this . 171 4.5. Conclusions of chapter 4 Pure andrographolide was tested in and compared to common NSAIDs , in in vitro anti- inflammatory assays where the NSAIDs diclofenac and ibuprofen were found to be more potent inhibitors of LPS and IFN - induced PGE 2 production in RAW264.7 cells. Andrographolide showed comparable potency to the NSAIDs, aspirin and paracetamol. Andrographoli de was found to be more potent than an y NSAID tested at inhibition of: The activity of inflammatory enzymes, iNOS and COX in RAW264.7 cells. The release of cytokines linked to inflammation, TNF -, IF N-, IL and TNF and cells. activation of NF -B in ELAM9 RAW264.7 cells. Andrographolide may have pharmacological anti -inflammatory activity based on the inhibition of a wide range of inflammatory mediators. 172 Chapter 5 ___________________________________________________________________________ 5. Synthesis and in vitro assessment of the sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide 173 5.1. Pharmacokinetics of herbal medicines The use of HM has grown steadily over the two las t decades [242, 243]. This may be due to an increasing view that natural products are safer and have fewer side effects. With the rapid growth in modern use of HM, there has been an i ncrease in the in vitro and clinical evidence that supports supposed efficacy. Unlike synthetic pharmaceutical products, HMs can be marketed without strong supporting clinical evidence. Due to the time and cost of clinical studies, in vitro data is more ab undant for most HMs. However there is often a disconnect between in vitro data and the clinical results. One of the major hurdles faced by many HMs is that the dose required to reach the pharmaceutical threshold of activity is not being reached due to poor bioavailability of the active components. For the more popular HMs, such as A. paniculata , processing techniques like forming liposomes and nanoparticles have been used to try to boost bioavailability. However if the concentration of an active constituent is too high, toxic effects may be observed. There are 5 main factors that are considered when assessing pharmacokinetics of a drug candidate: Liberation - the process of release from the compounding of the drug. As traditional medicines were often administered as a water decoction, liberation is a modern dosage issue. Absorption - the process of the drug crossing the lipophilic cell linings of the digestive tract or skin and entering the blood stream. Distribution - the transport of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body. Some drugs are soluble in the blood stream and some interact with pro teins in the blood stream. Metabolism - the irreversible transformation of parent compounds into daughter metabolites. The metabolites can be active (biotransformation) or inactive. Excretion - the removal of substances (parent and metabolites) from the body. 174 There are many parameters that effect bioavailability. It can be estimated by molecular size, shape, functional groups and lipophilicity, however, administration of the substance and analysis of the blood remain the most widely accepted method. Andrographolide 's Cmax in human plasma 5.1.1. The maximum plasma levels observed are a good indicator of the compound's absorption and bioavailability, but there are other factors that play a role in the compound's in vivo efficacy. Despite the widespread use of A. paniculata , there are relatively few human pharmacokinetics studies. Figure 85 shows the C max for the human pharmacokinetics studies reported. Figure 85: Human plasma C max of andrographolide. The dose is given in mg (andrographolide) / kg (bo dy weight). As can be seen in Figure 85, the reported C max varies between 0.058 to 1.34 g/ml . In humans andrographolide appears to be rapidly absorbed and excreted. Administration of maximal plasma levels (1.34 \u00b5g/ml) after 1.5 -2 h, with a half -life of 6.6 h in humans [239]. The drug appears to be non -toxic and well tolerated by humans with no serious adverse effects at doses in the range of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day [244, 245]. Andrographolide's Cmax in animal plasma 5.1.2. There are a greater number of animal pharmacokinetics studies that administer andrographolide at higher doses, as presented in Figure 86. 176 Figure 86: C max of andrographolide in animals. The dose is given in mg (andrographolide) / kg (body weight). 012345678 2000 Panossian (rats, 1 mg/kg)2000 Panossian (rats, steady 1 mg/kg2000 Panossian (rats, 3 mg/kg)2014 Zhang (rats, 5 mg/kg)2007 Chen (rabbits, 8.8 mg/kg)2007 Suo (rats, 10 mg/kg)2011 Chellapillai (rats, 10 mg/kg)2009 (rabbits, (rats, 25 mg/kg)2014 Bera (rats, 30 mg/kg)2012 Du (rabbits, 40 mg/kg)2014 Wu (rats, 40 mg/kg)2009 Akowuah (rats, 44 mg/kg)2014 Wang (rats, 48.75 mg/kg)2009 Liu (chickens, 50 mg/kg)2014 Chen (rats, 50 mg/kg)2014 Chen (rats, ~50 mg/kg)2014 Wu 80 120 mg/kg)Andrograpohlide Cmax ( g/ml) Increasing andrographolide dose Rats Rabbits Chickens 177 As can be seen in Figure 86, the plasma levels of andrographolide are higher in animals with higher doses being administered. However, in these animal studies, reported plasma C max is not always dependent on the dose, especially when comparing dosing levels between studies. This is assuming that the observed variation in reported C max's are not due to different procedures employed in the plasma extraction and analysis. Ho wever, it should be noted that the result obtained is significantly dependent on the analytical method employed. An extreme example is Panossian et al. [246], reporting plasma levels of 1.3 g/ml with a dose of 1 mg/kg in rats, whereas at a dose 120 times higher Ye et al. [247] report a C max of 0.23 g/ml. The dosage form and preparation may play as important role as the dose level. The study by Chen et al. [189] which compared pure andrographolide pharmacokinetics to that of equivalent andrographolide amounts administered as A. paniculata extract, found that the dosage form as a whole herb greatly improved pharmacokinetics. This would support the important role of dosage form in the final plasma levels. The reason(s) for this is likely to be a complex interplay of factors and requires furth er research. Andrographolide 's C max after formulation modification 5.1.3. There have been a number of attempts to improve pharmacokinetics, these are presented in Figure 87. 178 Figure 87: C max for modified andrographolide formulations. Note : Figure organised according to principal Chellapillai (rabbits)2009 (rats, micelles)Andrograpolide Cmax ( g/ml) Rats Humans 179 Attempts to improve the pharmacokinetics by altering the dosage form, as shown in Figure 87, produced mixed results. Many of the studies foun d no impro vement while increasing the Cmax of andrographolide in the plasma. Chellapillia et al. prepared andrographolide in nanoparticles sensitised to release at pH 5.5, preserving them from degradation in the stomach and targeting the upper GI tract [248]. Micro emulsions were also shown to improve pharmacokinetics in rabbits [249]. The highest plasma levels reported for andrographolide were by Suo et. al. [240] and Matiti et al. [250] with the ir liposome preparations. These modifications may improve the pharmacokinetics of andrographolide in humans. A. paniculata pharmacokinetics 5.1.4. Considering the popularity of A. paniculata as a medicine there is a surprising lack of high quality pharmacokinetic studies. Of the studies available, there are many inconsistencies making comparisons difficult. In some studies andrographolide dose is not reported, only the grams (or tablets) of A. paniculata administered. Sometimes the dose is reported but not the weight of the animals, so convers ion to a comparable dose unit (dose/kg) is not possible. The pharmacokinetic studies of A. paniculata are summarised in Table 20. 180 Table 20 Pharmacokinetic studies of andrographolide Publication Subject Analytical method Dose equivalent andrographolide Cmax plasma Tmax Comments -andrographolide administered i.g rapidly was absorbed and distributed to organs in 30 min maximum. By 24 h 90 % was excreted in urine and faeces, with only 10 % accounted for at 48 h as andrographolide, the rest was metabolised. 1995 Wang [252] Rabbit Chemiluminescence 22.4 \u00b5g/ml The andrographolide rapidly reached maximum concentration, the half-life of elimination is long and bioavailability high. The study lacked detail. 2000 Panossian [239] Rats n=42 HPLC -UV/PDA Methanol acetone 5.6 0.25 h The bioavailability of andrographolide at 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg was 91 % and 21 % respectively, 90 % and 99 % was reported to be metabolised. The pharmacokinetics in humans was highly variable but was explained by an open two -compartment model. In the two compartment model the concentration of the drug is first highest in organs with high blood flow i.e. brain, liver, lungs, then disperses to the rest of the body. Sites of inflammation often attract higher blood flow, so andrographolide may have a targeted e ffect, with higher concentrations at the site of inflammation. Up to 55 % of andrographolide was reported to be bound to protein. Renal excretion is not the main route for eliminating andrographolide. It is most likely intensely and dose dependently metabo lised. All doses were administered in Kan Jang tablets. Elimination halftime is 2 -7 h in humans.

[239] found that with a dose 10 times less they detected 7 times more andrographolide in plasma. 2009 Liu [265] Chicken n=10 HPLC -fine A. paniculata powder 1.6 \u00b5g/ml h Although the content of 14-deoxy -11,12 -didehydroandrographolide is lower than that of andrographolide in paniculata , mean residence time of 14-deoxy -11,12 -didehydroandrographolide was longer than andrographolide in chicken plasma. The pharmacokinetics is described well by a two -compartment model 1.4 \u00b5g/ml 14- andrographolide had improved pharmacokinetics, higher C retention. 25 mg/kg andrographolide liposomes 9.64 \u00b5g/ml (27.5 \u00b5M) 4 Rabbits HPLC -UV apholide 0.6 h 0.65 h Pharmacokinetics followed the two compartment model. The levels of andrographolide reported are likely wrong. In the chromatogram they appear to have quantified the wrong peak, possibly isoandrographolide, as the andrographolide appears to co -elute with a peak in the blank plasma. This is supported by Liu. et al. [265], Chen et al. [261] and Wu et al . [267] showing andrographolide is more abundant in the herb and comparable in the body when ingested. 2 g/kg (approx. 20 mg/kg Mice Radionuclide labelling of andrographolide The andrographolide was distributed to all organs with the highest distribution in the stomach. 2011 Ye [247] Rats n=5 UPLC -MS/MS 120 mg/kg i.g 0.23 \u00b5g/ml 0.5 h The absolute bioavailably was reported to be very low (2.67%), this may be due to the high dose used, as Panossian et al. [239] reported that as the dose was increased the bioavailability dropped significantly. Efflux at the terminal ileum and colon was found to contr ibute to low bioavailability at high doses by Ye et al. [247]. 184 24 mg/kg i.v 7.5 \u00b5g/ml (at 0.5h) This may have also been due to Ye's sample preparation, dissolving andrographolide (not very water soluble) in ice cold water, then filtering through a 0.2 m, likely losing large amounts of the andrographolide, so the dose delivered may not be lower than assumed. This would account for the low C max, even with the dose 10x-100x most other studies. Ye also reports that andrographolide has high permeability and that this is not the reason for its poor bioavailability, but its rapid and extensive metabolism to 14 -deoxy - 12-sulfoandrographolide is. Ye et al. detected ~14x levels of the metabolite in the blood and organs. 2011 Chellapillai The nanoparticle encapsulation greatly increased the uptake speed and maximum plasma concentration. It was sensitised to release below pH 5.5, targeting the upper GI tract. 10 mg/kg i.g 0.83 \u00b5g/ml h The micro emulsions improved the rate of uptake and the amount of andrographolide detected in the plasma. Du et al. [249] also performed an in vivo anti-inflammatory experim ent using an albumin induced rat paw oedema model. Andrographolide (50 mg/kg) matched the positive control (aspirin, 150 mg/kg) and the micro emulsions outperformed the positive control at all doses (4, 8 and 16 mg/kg). The LD50 of the micro emulsion prepa ration was determined in mice to be 138.36 mg/kg, 266 times the daily oral dose (~0.5 mg/kg). 5.37 \u00b5g/ml Micro emulsion 0.5 mg/kg form of 14-deoxy -11,12 - didehydroandrographolide reached The sulphonated form of andrographolide reached much higher plasma concentrations compared to other studies where the C max reported for andrographolide i.g is 12 g/ml 14 -deoxy -12-hydroxy -andrographolide is a phase one metabolite of andrographolide, but there was no experimental evidence presented i n the paper or reference for the claim. 2014 Wu [273] Rats h Andrographolide was quantified in organs after i.g administration of the 80mg/kg dose - the highest level of sulphonate metabolite was observed in the liver, which may be a main metabolising organ. On the cont rary, increasing concentrations of sulphonate metabolite in kidney over time indicated that renal excretion might be a major elimination route. Meanwhile, at 45 min the high levels in the pancreas demonstrated that it might be the target organ. The concent ration of sulphonate metabolite in brain samples was consistently low at all the time points, indicating its poor penetration across the blood -brain barrier in the range of 1 g/ml. 40 mg/kg i.g 3.9 \u00b5g/ml 1.1 h h \u00b5g/ml 0.5 h Andrographolide was absorbed more rapidly, to a higher concentration and retained for longer when administered at the same dose as in the herb as compared to the pure compound. There was a 5x increase in bioavailability from 1 to 5% when andrographolide was administered as the whole herb extract. 940 mg/kg A. paniculata 0.86 \u00b5g/ml 0.35 h 2014 extraction 5 mg/kg i.v 1.98 \u00b5g/ml The area under the curve and retention time was longer for the micelles. 5 mg/kg \u00b5g/ml 0.75 h More andrographolide was detected in the organs when administered as the herb and it is retained for longer. 2014 Wang [267] Rats LC-MS/MS 750 mg/kg i.g A. paniculata Andrographolide was reported to be unstable in plasma , but stabilised by acidification. The metabolite had a molecular weight of 368, however, no structure was proposed. 48.75 mg/kg andrographolide 3 - deoxyandrographoli de 0.06 \u00b5g/ml 7.5 mg/kg apigenin - 7-O--D- glucuronopyranosid e 0.1 \u00b5g/ml 6 h 2015 Tian [276] liver microso mes Glucironidation was the main metabolism pathway reported for humans, pigs, dog and monkey. 187 As can be seen in Table 20, there is wide variation in the reported pharmacokinetics of andrographolide. Taken together, the research presented in Table 20 sheds some light on its pharmacokinetics. It is clear that andrographolide is absorbed to some extent and passes into the blood stream with T max's of between 0.5 to 2 h. Andrographolide is quantifiable in the g to ng/mg range in the reported studies. The lower doses tested in humans may limit the plasma concentrations being observed and higher doses may be advisable. Promisingly, it is reported t o follow a 2 compartment model, being distributed first to areas of high blood flow. This is desirable for anti -inflammatory compounds, as areas of inflammation attract increased blood flow, meaning that andrographolide might be considered a targeted appro ach for treating inflammation. A. paniculata appears to be non -toxic even at very high doses in animals [277] and is well tolerated. A. paniculata has a high safety margin with the LD50 of the alcohol extract is 1.8g/kg [278]. When administered as the pure andrographolide the safety LD50 is higher. The intraperitoneal 11.46 on these findings, andrographolide and A. paniculata extracts show promise as potential lead s for the development of novel safe anti -inflammatory drugs . Further investigations into their molecular eff ects would therefore be justified. Biological significance of andrographolide's sulphonation metabolite 5.1.5. One of the major drawbacks of andrographolide's pharmacokinetics is it is highly and rapidly metabolised. It has been reported that even when andrographolide is administered 188 intravenously, the plasma levels still decline rapidly. The major metabolite obser ved is a sulphonation product of andrographolide, shown Figure 88. Sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide Andrographolide 88: sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide and andrographolide As evident in Figure 88, much of the structure of andrographolide is conserved in the metabolite. The conserved structure might mean that the bioactivity is conserved. The sulphonation metabolite has been tested in vivo by Guo et al. [279] in a mouse sepsis model. The sulphonated metabolite was shown to o utperform andrographolide in preventing death from sepsis in CH3 CH2OHSO3H CH3O 5.2. Aims of c hapter 5 The aims of this chapter are to report on the synthesis of the sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide and test it in comparison to andrographolide in a number of in vitro anti- inflammatory assays, to determine if the anti -inflam matory activity is conserved on: The activity of inflammatory enzymes iNOS The release of inflammatory cytokines The activation of NF -B 190 5.3.

The nitrogen gas (HP grade) and argon gas (HP grade) were supplied by B OC gases (Sydney, Australia). HPLC system 5.3.3. HPLC -PDA was used to profile the products of the sulphonation of andrographolide and the fraction that was identified as the metabolite. The HPLC -PDA analysis was performed on comprising Class -VP 7.4SP4 software. a Shimadzu Australia) comprising of and FRC -10A fraction collector. The system was controlled using Labsolutions software. LC-MS instrumentation 5.3.5. Samples and standards were analysed using a Waters Inc. (Waters, Australia) Acquity ultra high performance liquid chromatography ( UPLC ) with a Xevo TQ MS tandem MS detector. Data processing was performed using the Waters MassLynx V4.1 SCN the analysis of the we used a Varian 300 MHz spectrometer ( Palo Alto , USA) . The Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer was equipped with a 5 mm 4 -nuclei (1H, 13C, 31P 5.3.7. The method to convert andrographolide to its sulphonated form was based on that described by He et al. [253]. Androgr apholide (196 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (15 ml), to which an aqueous solution of Na 2SO 4 (2 ml, 1 M), H 2SO 4 (2.4 ml, 2% v/v) and water (8 ml) was added. The mixture was refluxed (40 min) and the pH adjusted to ~7 using Na 2CO 3 solution (1 M) and the solve nt removed in vacuo. The residue was then dissolved in water (20 ml) and washed with chloroform (3 \u00d7 25 ml). The aqueous layer was collected and evaporated in 192 vacuo. The residue was dissolved in methanol and filtered, yielding the andrographolide sulfonate upon evaporation (210 mg). HPLC -PDA analysis of sulphonation products 5.3.8. This method was used to determine the sulphonation products, the fractions collected of the sulphonation products and the commercial XiYanPing. The sulphonation products and fractions were dissolved (200 g/ml) by sonication in 50 % aqueous acetonitrile. The concentrated XiYanPing was dissolved in minimal 50 % aqueous acetonitrile by sonication. The HPLC -PDA analysis of the extracts was performed using an Alltech Alltima (Alltech Australia) reverse phase C18 column (46 \u00d7 150 mm I.D., 5 \u00b5m) with a Phenomenex (California, USA) Security C18 guard column (20 mm \u00d7 4 mm, 5 m). HPLC -PDA profiles were generated by a 5 \u00b5l injection of samples. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % ( v/v) aqueous formic acid (mobile phase A) and 0.1 % ( v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient program was 10% B for 3 min with a linear increase to 40% B at 30 min, and then a 95% B (wash) for 5 min before equilibrating at the starting composition for 5 min. Mobile phase flow rate was maintained at 1.3 ml/min. The PDA was set to read absorbance from 200 to 500 nm. Preparative HPLC to partition the sulphonate product 5.3.9. The method of synthesising the andrographolide sulphona te produced a mixture of products which had to be resolved by preparative HPLC. The sulphonation products were dissolved in 193 a minimal amount of 50 % aqueous acetonitrile by sonication. A Shimadzu Shimpack colu mn used. LC fractionation was performed with repeated 50 \u00b5l injections of the sample. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % ( v/v) aqueous formic acid (mobile phase A) and 0.1 % ( v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient program was 23% B with a linear increase to 56% B at 21.5 min, and then a 95% B (wash) for 5 min before equilibrating at the starting composition for 10 min. Mobile phase flow rate was maintained at 5 ml/min. The chromatogram was visualised at 226 nm. The fractions collected were pooled and neutralised with ammonia (3%) solution and evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporation followed by drying under a stream of nitrogen. The residue from each fraction was dissolved in a minimum volume of water by sonication and pas sed through a C18 SPE column. The column was washed with Milli -Q water and eluted with methanol. The eluate was filtered through a 0.2 m syringe filter and evaporated to dryness to yield the dry fraction.

The 300 MHz Varian spectrometer was manually tuned before analysis and MeOD was used as the lock signal, the sample was ma nually shimmed. Characterisation product was (2 g/ml) by sonication in 50 % aqueous acetonitrile. The analytical column was a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH reversed phase C18 column (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m), with a Waters reversed phase C18 guard column. LC-MS analysis was performed with a 1 \u00b5l injection of the sample. The mobile phase consiste d of 0.1 % ( v/v) aqueous formic acid (mobile phase A) and 0.1 % ( v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The gradient program was 10% B held for 1 min with a linear increase to 35% B at 15 min, and then a 35% B (wash) for 2 min before equilibrating at the starting composition for 3 min. Mobile phase flow rate was maintained at 0.1 ml/min.

The andrographolide was successfully reacted with sulphuric acid by the method described in section 5.3.7 to yield a mixture of compounds as shown in Figure 89. Figure 89: HPLC chromatogram of the sulphonation product overlaid with 210 nm. Sulphonation product (black) and andrographolide standard ( red). The overlay ( red) was normalised to the absorbance of the largest peak in the sulphonation product with an offset of 100 mAu. One of the peaks elutin g before andrographolide would be the sulphonated product because with a sulphate group attached, it would be more polar than andrographolide and hence elute earlier on a C18 column. As can be seen in Figure 89 the andrographolide is nearly completely reacted but a mixture of products is formed. The reaction conditions were optimised, but a mixture was still left. 0100200300400500600700 5 10 15 20 25 30Absorbance (mAu) Retention time (min) Sulphonation metabolite 197 Purification by preparative 5.4.2.

The coloured sections ( pink and purple ) show the fractions that were collected for further analysis.

The HPLC for the sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide is shown in and andrographolide ( red). The overlay ( red) was traced from the andrographolide in Figure 89 with an offset of 100 mAu. In Figure 91 it can be seen that the fraction collected for the sulphonation product of andrographolide contained a single detectable compound by HPLC -PDA analysis. Characterisation of the -MS of andrographolide was run on LC -MS to determine the likely molecular weight and detect other impurities that were not identified by HPLC -PDA. The LC-MS total ion count ( TIC) is shown in Figure 92, the m/z spectrum for the major peak at 11.2 min in the TIC is given in Figure 92. 0200400600800100012001400 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25Absorbance (mAu) Retention time (min) metabolite .

Figure 95: Structure of sulphonation product with carbons numbered . The 1HNMR of the isolated andrographolide sulphonation product matched that of the metabolite (in rats) of andrographolide 's spectrum reported by He et al. [253]. As a 300 MHz NMR was used in this study and He et al. [253] were using a 600 MHz NMR their resolution could not be matched . However, the spectrum was a reasonable match with only the second CH3O O OHCH2 CH3 CH2OHSO3H1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 202 signal for carbon number 17 not being detected. It is also not possible to confirm the stereo chemistry of carbon number 12 without further spectroscopic analysis. It is likely that the sulphonation product of andrographolide is the biologically significant sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide reported by He et al. (in rats), synthesised in this study using a method adapted from the work of He et al. [253]. The molecular mass detected for the synthesised sulphonatio n derivative of andrographolide by LC -MS (414 m/z) and 1HNMR match that of the sulphonated product reported by He et al. [253]. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the metabolite that was synthesised by sulphonation of andrographolide is the same as that reported by He et al. in rats [253]. Nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 and synthesised andrographolide sulphonation metabolite were tested in the NO assay to determine their IC 50 for inhibiting NO production by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The dose response curve is shown in Figure 96. It can be seen that andrographolide is more potent at inhibition of NO than the sulphonation metabolite. 203 NO production 1 10 100 1000 10000020406080100 Metabolite Andrographolide Dose (M)%NO release Figure 96: NO dose response curve for andrographolide ( red squares) and the sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide ( brown circles), by LPS and IFN - stimulated RAW264.7 cells.

The biologically significant sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide is evidence of biotransformation for andrographolide, in terms of TNF - release. 205 Multiplex assay for 27 cytokine s 5.4.7. The honation metabolite shown improved anti -inflammatory activity red ucing the release of TNF - in THP -1 cells more potently than andrographolide. Andrographolide was shown to be active at inhibiting a number of cytokines linked to inflammation ( as discussed in chapter s 3 and 4), the sulphonation metabolite could have maint ained or enhanced similar broad activity. The release of 27 cytokines by a multiplex bead based ELISA was performed on the supernatant of LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. The experiment was completed to determine if andrographolide and the sulphonation metabol ite have an inhibitory effect on 27 cytokines and chemokines related to inflammation. The commercially available kit was expensive, limiting the number of replicates to 2. This limitation means that the statistical significance of the results is also limit ed. The dose response curves are shown in figure s 99 to 114 and IC 50s are summarised in Table 23. 206 INF release by THP-1 cells 0.1 1 10 100020406080100120140 Androgragholide Metabolite Dose (M)%INF release Figure 98: IFN response curve for andrographolide ( ) and the sulphonation metabolite brown squares ), by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells.

(n=2) Due to the high cost of the multicytokine assay, it was not possible to optimise the parameters for each cytokine, as a result of this not all of the 27 cy tokines assayed produced us eable results. Indeed, due to the limitations of the cellular model (single cell type) not all cytokines were released by LPS stimulated THP -1 cells. These results are summarised in Table 23. activation assay in cells 5.4.8. Andrographolide and the sulphonation metabolite number of inflam matory cytokines and chemokines, su ggesting an overall controlling factor. NF -B is the transcription factor that controls the transcription of many inducible inflammatory mediators. It is plausible that its inhibition could account for the observed wide spectrum effect. The dose response f or NF -B testing is shown in Figure 113. 214 NF-B activation assay in ELAM9 RAW264.7 dose response curve for andrographoli de (red squares) and the sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide ( brow n circles), by LPS and IFN - stimulated ELAM9 RAW264. 7 cells. The data is fit with a log (inhibitor) vs. normalised response with variable slope model. (n=2) It can be seen in Figure 113 that that andrographolide and the sulphonation metabolite both inhibit NF -B activation in a dose dependent manner. However, andrographolid e is far more potent.

The sulphonation metabolite showed much more potency at inhibiting the cytokines tested (>100 M). It is therefore unlikely that activity of the sulphonate can be attributed to inhibiting NF -B activation. However, it should be noted that both the assays, NF -B and NO, where the sulphonation metabolite showed little activity were in a murine model . It is possible that the effect is species dependent or specific to either the THP -1 cells or RAW264.7 cells. Further experiments are required to determine this. The first experiment required would be testing the sulphonation metabolite 's activity on the release of cytokines like TNF - and IL -6 in the RAW264.7 cells. The inhibition of IL-1ra, IL-2 and IL -4 is not desirable for an anti -inflammatory drug as they have anti-inflammatory functions . Andrographolide inhibited IL -2 (IC 50, 26.1 M) and IL -4 217 (IC 50, 34.3 M), however , not as potently as major inflammatory cytokines such as TNF - (IC 50, 16.5 M) and IL -6 (IC 50, 10.2 M). The sulphonation metabolite 's inhibition of IL-1ra (IC 50, 14.5 M) was potent, this may account for the sulphonation metabolite's inability to inhibit IL -1 where the parent andrographolide was active, as IL-1ra is an agonist for IL -1. This warrants further study to determine the mechanism and confirmation of the effect. In the m ajority of cytokines Eotaxin), sulphonation metabolite displayed similar activity to the parent andrographolide. It is therefore likely that for these cytokines the mechanism of action is conserved. This also suggests an additive effect ma y occur, where the metabolite and andrographolide equally contribute to the inhibition of the mediator. This would affect required in vivo doses to reach therapeutic effects. Dose response assays , where andrographolide and the sulphonate metabolite are added in combination , are needed to assess if this is occurring. The sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide showed significantly greater activity than the parent compound andrographolide in the TNF - and IL -6 assays. These are both major inflammatory mediators in the acute inflammatory response. This may be due to a s pecific undetermined mechanism. The significantly increased activity observed for the biological metabolite , over the parent compound , is evidence of biotransformation in rats . 218 The sulpho nation metabolite may be exclusively relevant to rats as a metabolite. A recent study by Tian et al. [276] showed that glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway of andrographolide in humans, with the sulphonation pathway being species s pecific to rats. This may limit the sulp honation metabolite 's biological significance to dose and pharmacokinetics to rats. Sulphonation metabolites are still reported in humans, however , are likely a minor metabolite, whereas they are the major metabolite reported in rats [272]. Despite the sulphonation metabolite 's biological significance to rats , in humans this appears to be minor. However, the sulphonation metabolite still showed high potency in the in-vitro assays and presents itself as a viable alternative anti-inflammatory drug to NSAIDs. The pharmacokinetics of the sulphonation metabolite , reported in only a limited number of studies , were extremely promising. Ye et al. reported that the concentration for the metabolite in rat plasma and liver was ~14 times of that observed for the parent andrographolide [247]. Liu et al. reported that when the sulphonation m etabolite of andrographolide was administered to rats as an i.g dose, the T max was reached after 2 h, with a C max plasma level of 132.3 g/ml (319 M). This reported C max is significantly (~47 times) higher than the IC 50 value observed for TNF - release in hibition in human THP -1 cells. The study is published in Chinese , making assessment of the techniques used difficult. More pharmacokinetics studies of the andrographolide sulphonate are required to confirm this finding. 219 5.5. Conclusions from chapter 5 The sulphonated metabolite of andrographolide was synthesised and tested in comparison to pure andrographolide in vitro . The sulphonation metabolite was found to have biological activity similar to andrographolide on the release of cytokines by and e which are linked to inflammation . The sulphonation metabolite was found to be less active on: The activity of inflammatory enzymes, iNOS in RAW264.7 cells. The activation of NF -B in RAW264.7 cells. The release of cytokines linked to inflammation, IL -1, G -CSF and V EGF by THP -1 cells. The sulphonation metabolite was found to have higher potency than andrographolide on t he release of cytokines linked to inflammation TNF -, IL-6 and IL -17 by THP -1 cells. 220 _____________________________________________ 6. Conclusions and future work 221 Conclusion 6.1.1. In contrary to the hypothesis , the A. paniculata commercial extract , with its complex mixture of phytochemicals , exhibit ed less potent anti -inflammatory activity than the pure andrographolide and the activity was attribute d to andrographolide alone . The A. paniculata commercial extract and andrographolide had a broader range of anti-inflammatory acti vity on key mediators in cell line model s of inflammation compared to current NSAIDs. The metabolites of andrographolide retain ed some anti -inflammatory activity of the parent and showed improved inhibition of important inflammatory mediators TNF - and IL -6. Future work 6.1.2. The commercial extract of A. paniculata was standardised to 30% w/w andrographolide concentration. I t was shown that at this concentration andrographolide was solely accountable for the anti -inflammatory activity of the extract. Future work should be directed at the raw herb and lesser concentrated (for example, 5% or 10% w/w) standardised extract, to assess if the effect is conserved at lower andrographolide concentrations. The andrographolide and A. paniculata were shown to be as effective as weak non selective NSAIDs, paracetamol and aspirin. Further study should be directed to determining which specific enzyme is being inhibited , be it COX -1 or COX -2. This could be achieved by testing the activity of androgra pholide , A. paniculata and NSAI Ds in isolated preparations of COX -1 222 and COX -2. This would aid in a ssessing the mechanism of andrographolide's inhibition of PGE 2 and determining if it is likely to have related side effects. NF-B activation inhibition was attributable to much of the observed inhibition of cytokines by andrographolide , this should be confirmed firstly with more replicates and concentrations. In a number of mediators the IC 50 observed is significantly below that of NF -B activation and this m ay be due to an undetermined secondary or specific mechanism of action. An investigation of the mechanism for VEGF, NO, PGE 2, IL-6, IL-1, IFN- and TNF - is warranted, firstly by confirming the result with more replicates and concentrations. The reported Cmaxs for andrographolide in plasma , varied significantly between studies. It would be ideal to have human pharmacokinetic s studies that: test the pharmacokinetics of andrographolide , in known and increased doses , both at steady repeated doses and s ingle administration, test different dosage form s of A. paniculata and andrographolide , for example , liposomal enhancement in humans, which was reporte d to be effective in rat models, quantify the metabolit es of andrographolide in humans to aid future bioactiv ation studies , test the pharmacokinetics of andrographolide when administered as A. paniculata tablets, tea, ethanol decoction and pure andrographolide , to determine what components were reaching pharmacological levels of significan ce in traditional use compared with modern use . It is suggested to confirm, in humans , if other 223 components of the herb improve the pharmacokinetic s of andrographolide as reported in a rat model. The andrographolide sulphonate had little activity in the NF-B and NO assays . It is possible that the effect is species dependent or specific to either the THP -1 cells or RAW264.7 cells. Further experiments are required to determine this. The first experiment required would be testing the sulphonation metabolite 's activity on the release of cytokines such as TNF - and IL-6 in the RAW264.7 cells. The sulphonation metabolites inhibition of IL-1ra (IC 50, 14.5 M) was potent and this may account for the sulphonation metabolites inability to inhibit IL -1 where the parent andrographoli de was active, as IL-1ra is an agonist for IL -1. This warrants further s tudy to determine the mechanism and confirm the effect with more replicates and concentrations . The sulphonation metabolite of andrographolide showed significantly greater activity t han the parent compound andrographolide in the TNF - and IL -6 assays. These are both major inflammatory mediators in the acute inflammatory response. This may be due to a s pecific undetermined mechanism. Future experiments should be directed to confirm thi s observation with more replicates and concentrations before mechanistic studies. There were impurities of salt and charcoal observed and low levels of comparable andrographolide sulphonation products in the commercial andrographolide sulphonation 224 product obtained from mainland China . This should be further investigat e with confirmation of the salt and charcoal content and the sulphonation products. A wider study should investigate if these impurities are present in other similar commercial products. The pharmacokinetics of the sulphonation metabolite is presented in a limited number of studie s, however, was extremely promising. More pharmacokinetics studies of the andrographolide sulpho nate are required to confirm these finding s. As this preparation has not been traditionally used , safety of the drug should be determined , particularly as it can reach reported high plasma concentrations. These studies should not be conducted in rats if possible as they may have a yet undetermined specie specific resistance to the sulphonation metabolite. Pigs were reported to be the most appropriate model, by Tian et al. [276]. 225 7. References 1. Majno G, Joris I: Cells, tissues, and disease : principles of general pathology. 2nd edn.
