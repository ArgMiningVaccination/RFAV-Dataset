These guidelines were made in collaboration with COVID -19 vaccination providers and in accordance to requirements set out by the Commonwealth Government. Compliance with the most current version of these guidelines is a condition of the Public Health Emergency Orders and Secretary' s Approval (see section on Legal authorisation of workforce ). Background COVID -19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person -to-person or from surface to person . Making safe and effective COVID -19 vaccines available to all Australians i s a key priority of the Australian, State and Territory Governments. The Australian COVID -19 Vaccination Policy , endorsed by National Cabinet on 13 November 2020, set s out key principles for the roll out, such as that COVID -19 vaccines will be made available for free to all Australian citizens, permanent residents, and visa -holders. Further, it outlines how COVID -19 vaccines will be accessible on a rolling basis, depen dent on vaccine delivery schedules and the identification of groups for most urgent vaccination. Over 280 different COVID -19 vaccines are in various stages of development. While it normally takes several years develop a vaccine, scientists across the world have worked collaboratively and rapidly to achieve the same amount of work in a few months in order to make a safe and effective vaccine available as soon as possible . Although clinical trials have been carried out more rapidly than they have for other va ccines, this has been achieved by conducting some of the steps in parallel rather than sequentially and vaccine safety has not been compromised.1 The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has rigorously assessed COVID -19 vaccine applications for safety, quality and effectiveness before provisionally approving their use for Australians. For more information regarding COVID -19 vaccines, see the department's website for COVID -19 vaccines ( https:/ /www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/vaccine ). Vaccine rollout The purpose of the COVID -19 vaccination program is to protect those who are at most risk from serious illness or death due to COVID -19. A vaccine to prevent COVID -19 is likely to be most effective way to control the pandemic. Initial roll out began with the delivery of the Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty BNT162b2 [mRNA] COVID -19 COVID -19 COVID -19 vaccine (Novavax COVID -19 1 Public Health England COVID -19 vaccination programme Information for healthcare practitioners Version 3.1 11 January 2021. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/951155/COVID - 19_vaccination_programme_guidance_for_healthcare_workers_11_January_2021 _V3.1.pdf 16 OFFICIAL vaccine) have also been approved. The Victorian Department of Health (the department) has nominated nine public health s ervices, and a network of community health organisations (C19), aligned with the department's local public health units (LPHUs), to deliver COVID -19 vaccine s as part of the Commonwealth Government's COVID -19 vaccine roll out strategy. These nine health service hubs include: Albury Wodonga Health Austin Health Ballarat Heath Goulburn Valley Health Latrobe Regional Hospital Monash Health Western Health Some of the hubs will have other heal th services and locations that will serve as outreach or sub - hubs. Overall implementation in outreach or sub -hubs will be led by the primary hub in which they are a part of sit. The Commonwealth Government will lead an in -reach workforce that will deliver the Pfizer COVID - 19 vaccination program in private residential aged care and disability care. COVID -19 vaccine s are available at general practitioner respiratory clinics, general practices and community pharmacies that meet specific requirements, and Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Services. COVID -19 vaccines approved for use in Australia The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is responsible for assessing any COVID -19 vaccines for safety, quality and effectiveness before they can be supplied in Australia. More information, including the approval process, safety monitoring and reporting and product informatio n is available from the TGA website ( https://www.tga.gov.au/covid -19-vaccines ). The TGA has granted provisional approval for the use of four COVID -19 vaccines in Australia. These are: The Comirnaty BNT162b2 [mRNA] COVID -19 vaccine (PfizerBioNTech COVID -19 vaccine) for individuals 5 years of age and older. The AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 -S CO ndix VID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine) for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Spikevax (elasomeran) COVID -19 vaccine (Moderna COVID -19 vaccine) for individuals 6 months of age and older. The Nuvaxovid (NVX -CoV2373) COVID -19 vaccine (Novavax COVID -19 vaccine) for individuals 1 2 years of age and older The Janssen -Cilag COVID -19 vaccin e (Johnson & Johnson COVID -19 vaccine) for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Janssen -Cilag COVID -19 vaccine s is not currently available in Australia. 17 OFFICIAL Provisional approval for each of these vaccines is valid for two years and is subject to certain strict conditions. Further information is available from the following TGA websites: COVID -19 vaccine: Pfizer Australia - COMIRNATY BNT162b2 (mRNA) - approved for use in individuals 12 years and olde r | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) COVID -19 vaccine: approves Biocelect Pty Ltd's (on behalf of Novavax Inc) COVID -19 vaccine NUVAXOVID | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) COVID -19 vaccine: Janssen | Therapeutic Goods Administration (T GA) This web page provides answers to the common types of questions you may have about how the TGA assesses and monitors a vaccine for safety, quality and effectiveness. COVID -19 vaccine: Information for consumers and health professionals. For detailed information on COVID -19 vaccines used in Australia, including dosing information - please refer to COVID -19 Vaccines Information section of these guidelines . Governance All COVID -19 vaccinatio n providers will be responsible for organising the governance and leadership of their COVID -19 immunisation program. This includes health services hubs and any sub-hubs and outreach locations. It is anticipated that each provider will appoint a clinical an d operational lead who will be responsible for the delivery of all aspects of the COVID -19 vaccination services in all relevant settings. This leadership should lead the development and implementation of local delivery plans to ensure all systems and proce sses, workforce, training and all other relevant preparatory requirements are in place to support delivery of the COVID -19 vaccination service. All COVID -19 vaccination providers must ensure that all staff involved in the COVID -19 vaccination service are aware of escalation processes for clinical and operational incidents, including reporting of suspected adverse events. Clinical governance Safer Care Victoria has published Victoria's clinical governance framework2 that outlines expectations regarding clinical governance and provides best practice guidance to inform good clinical governance. 2 https://www.bettersafercare.vic.gov.au/publications/clinical -governance -framework 18 OFFICIAL The five domains of the framework, underpinned by continuous monitoring, evaluation and improvement are: leadership and culture consumer partnerships workforce risk management clinical practice. The framework is designed so that the COVID - 19 vaccination providers can adapt and implement the components to best meet the needs of their clients and organisation. Leadership and culture All staff have a shared responsibility for building a positive workplace culture Organisational culture - a 'just' culture exists whereby staff are supported, and their wellbeing prioritised Clinical leadership - strong, transparent, supportive and accessible leadership fosters a culture of learning, accountability and openness, with strong clinical engagement Teamwork - staff are supported at all levels of the orga nisation by skilled management Ownership and accountability by all staff. Consumer/client partnerships The consumer/client is at the centre of care and viewed as a critical partner in the design and delivery of the immunisation service. Consumer engagement and input is actively sought and facilitated Using and improving systems to support organisational and community priorities Partnering with consumers/clients and management to ensure consumers/clients receive appropriate information and care Commitment to providing a positive consumer experience every time. Workforce COVID -19 vaccination providers are responsible for a safe environment for both consumers/clients and staff. All immunisation staff have the required knowledge and skills, technolo gy and equipment to provide the best care possible, and are accountable for the care they provide. Risk management Safeguarding against clinical risk requires a structured approach to safety that is both proactive and reactive. Active participation in site processes that support consumer/client safety and identify and act on opportunities for quality improvement Reporting incidents and near misses Following through with open disclosure to consumers/clients and families Analysing and add ressing adverse events Appropriately escalating safety issues to managers. 19 OFFICIAL The COVID -19 vaccination provider must ensure that any authorised COVID -19 vaccination workforce meets and maintains the requirements for professional registration for the full peri od of their engagement , where applicable . It's strongly recommended that the COVID -19 vaccination provider develops and institutes policies/procedures to confirm a ll COVID -19 vaccination workforce s' registration status on initial engagement. Clinical pract ice Good clinical practice requires systems that provide safe and appropriate care for each consumer/clients with the best possible outcome. Shared responsibility for protocols, equipment, and resources. The framework is underpinned by continuous monitorin g, evaluation and improvement. Code of Conduct: Self and family vaccinations Vaccine providers and authorised vaccination workforce should be aware of the medico - legal regulations associated with vaccinators administering COVID -19 vaccines to themselves and family members as well as recording their own vaccination and family member's vaccination. These requirements have been outlined i n the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Regulations 2017 and the Medical Board APHRA Guidelines as detailed below . Self-vaccinations COVID -19 vaccines are classified as a Schedule 4 poison under the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Regulations 2017 (R.105 (1)) - Part 12. An individual is not permitted to self -administer the COVID - 19 vaccine , nor record their own, family members' o r friends' vaccination details . However, self -administering can be permitted in exceptional circumstances, when the vaccine is lawfully prescribed and supplied specifically for the treatment of that person by another authorised person (prescriber) . This structure does not apply to persons authorised under the COVID -19 Secretary Approvals or Public Health Emergency Orders. Authorised workforce vaccinating family members Authorised vaccination workforce , where ver possible, should avoid providing vaccination care to anyone with whom they have a close personal relationship such as providing health care to close friends, those they work with and family members would be inappropriate because of the lack of objectivity, possible discontinuit y of care, and risks to the patient and healthcare provider relationship. In instances where providing care to individuals having close personal relationship to the provider is unavoidable, for example in an emergency. Whenever this is the case, good clinical practice requires recognition and careful management of these situations. As an example, f or further guidance refer to Section 4.15 of the Medical Board Ahpra Guidelines: Good medical practice: a code of conduct for doctors in Australia . 20 OFFICIAL Feedback and complaints Consumer feedback is a valuable resource and should be encouraged in all aspects of the service. Complaints should be responded to in consultation with the consumer to reach suitable resolution, outcomes should then be used to drive quality improvement. Systems should be in place to ensure: consumers and their needs are key organisational prioriti es consumers are provided with the relevant knowledge to participate fully in their care to extent they wish clear, open and respectful communication exists betw een consumers and staff at all levels of the health system services respond to the diverse needs of consumers and the community the rights and responsibilities of consumers are respected and promoted to the community, consumers, carers, clinicians and other health service staff, as required by the Australian Charter o f Healthcare Rights (Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care , 2019) consumers are act ively invited to provide feedback on their experiences of care services learn from and act on the feedback on clinical care and service delivery as provided by consumers in order to make improvements consumers are provided with the opportunity and information to fully participate in organisational processes for planning, monit oring and improving services consumer participation processes are monitored for their effectiveness in empowering consumers to fully partner in their care complaints are responded to compassionately, completely and in a timely fashion, with feedback provid ed to all parties about the action resulting from their input issues arising from complaints are analysed, reported and used to improve care and services.

The information provided in this section is not intended to serve as legal advice. COVID -19 vaccination providers are advised to seek independen t advice from legal professionals. Authorisation of workforce The department has reviewed the existing and potential immunisation workforces available to support the delivery of the Victorian COVID -19 vaccination program and has assessed the capa city of existing vaccination delivery models in Victoria. A large workforce will be required to deliver the COVID -19 vaccination program in Victoria, including additional workforces to prepare and administer the COVID -19 vaccine. Nurse immunisers and pharmacist im munisers, who are already authorised under the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Regulations 2017 (Vic) to administer Schedule 4 poisons, now have provisions for the COVID -19 vaccine enabled through the issuing of COVID -19 Secretary Approvals. Other workforces participating in Victoria's COVID -19 vaccine program have been authorised through Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) issued under Section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 19813. A PHEO enables the Secretary to authorise additional workforces to prepare and/or administer vaccinations for an initial period of up to six months. This can be extended if required. The emergency orders include specific conditions and limitations relating to each authorised workforce. Persons responsible for managin g the vaccination sites must be clear about the authorisation of their vaccination team members including the conditions and limitations under which they are authorised to prepare and/or administer the vaccine. The successful completion of the required training modules , competency assessments and adherence to these guidelines is include d as a condition of the Secretary Approvals and PHEO s. Please refer to the Workforce requirements section for more detail on the authorisations, training, assessment and supervision requirements. COVID -19 vaccination providers are advised to consult closely with unions whose members may be directly impacted by the introduction and operation of this program. Table 1 below lists the professions that have been authorised to participate in Victoria's COVID -19 vaccination program. Targeted external consultation has also occurred with a large number of external stakeholders including Victorian health services, professional bodies, unions and universities. possession and/or supply of the COVID -19 vaccine and any Schedule 3 poisons necessary for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions to the vaccine by public/private hospitals, aged care services and disability services and State or Commonwealth contracted agencies in Victoria. The intention of thes e PHEOs is to facilitate logistical arrangements for both Commonwealth and State led components of the COVID vaccination program. The PHEOs and Secretary's Approvals on issue can be viewed from the following link: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information -covid -19-vaccine -providers in Victoria's COVID -19 vaccination program 23 OFFICIAL 24 OFFICIAL Obtaining consent for vaccination There is a legal obligation to obtain valid consent prior to a medical procedure, including administering a vaccine. Verbal or implied consent is acceptable and written consent is not required (although may be obtained in some settings as per l ocal practices). For consent to be considered legally valid, the Australian Immunisation Handbook4 describes the following elements as neces sary: It must be given by a person with legal capacity, and of sufficient intellectual capacity to understand the implications of receiving a vaccine. It must be given voluntarily in the absence of undue pressure, coercion or manipulation. It must cover th e specific procedure that is to be performed. It can only be given after the potential risks and benefits of the relevant vaccine, the risks of not having it, and any alternative options have been explained to the person. The person must have the opportunity to seek more details or explanations about the vaccine or its administration. The information must be provided in a language or by other means that the person can understand. Where appropriate, involve an interpreter or cultural support person. Consent must be obtained before vaccination, after establishing that there are no medical condition(s) that contraindicate vaccination. The Commonwealth Government has developed a consent form that is available from the following link: https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/covid -19-vaccination -advice -for-covid to COVID -19 vaccines, including consumer factsheets, is also available from this website. Discussions, statements and decisions about treatment can be recorded in the person's health care record (for example, in the Critical Health Summary section in CVMS, or the per son's My Health 4 https://imm unisationhandbook.health.gov.au/ 25 OFFICIAL Record), including but not limited to the outcomes of any assessment of the decision -making capacity of the person. Aged care In addition to the above general consent requirements, in an aged care setting, the following should be considered when obtaining consent: Residents must be supported to exercise choice and independence in making decisions; Regard must be had to whether resident capacity is fluctuating or whether it is specific to only certain types of decisions; The information presented may need to be adjusted and tailored to the resident ( e.g. consider whether larger font size on documents, provision of a verbal explanation in the presence of family members or undertaking the consent conversation at varying times of the day are appropriate measures for particular residents); and Where appropriate to do so, family members may be involved in the process. In residential aged care facilities, residents often do not have capacity to make decisions regarding medical treatment (although there is a presumption of capacity unless there is evidence to the contrary). Careful consideration must be given to residents ' capacity to consent to vaccination particularly where cognition fluctuates and communication in the usual way may be difficult due to physical impairment. In circumstances where there is insufficient capacity, it will be necessary for consent to be provi ded to the COVID -19 vaccine from a Medical Treatment Decision Maker. This person will often be known to the residential aged care facility and may be a close loved one of the resident. The residential aged care facility, or a staff member of that facility is not able to consent on behalf of a resident who does not have decision making capacity. As the administration of a COVID -19 vaccination is unlikely to be unplanned medical treatment and not required in an emergency, it is recommended that residential aged care facilities make significant efforts to obtain consent from a resident's appointed Medical Treatment Decision Maker prior to turning to alternative Medical Treatment Decision Makers, which are outlined in section 55 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). Disability In addition to the above general consent requirements, in a disability setting, the follow ing should be considered when obtaining consent: Whether the person's capacity is fluctuating or whether it is specific to only certain types of decisions; Whether reasonable adjustments can be made to the information provided to the person with disability to enable them to understand the COVID -19 vaccination process in order to consent to the treatment; and Where appropriate to do so, family members may be involved in the process. It is sometimes assumed in the disability context that people w ith disability are unable to make their own decisions in relation to medical treatment. As with all other adults, it should be assumed that a person with disability is able to consent to their own medical treatment, unless there is evidence to 26 OFFICIAL the contrar y. It should be considered whether adjustments can be made to assist the person to make a decision for themselves in relation to receiving the COVID -19 vaccine. In the event that a person with disability is unable to consent to receiving the COVID -19 va ccine, it will not be possible for their facility or carers to consent for them, and the alternate -decision maker process under section 55 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) will need to be considered. Mental health patients In addition to the above general consent requirements, it is important to note that 'mental health patients' being compulsory, security and forensic patients under the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic) are not subject to the alternate decision maker provision at section 55 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). Rather, the alternate decision maker for a mental health patient will need to be dete rmined through section 75 of the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic). As with all adults, whether a mental health patient has capacity to consent to medical treatment needs to be considered in their particular circumstances, and the assumption should not be made that they do not have capacity simply because they are receivin g mental health treatment. In relation to children who are mental health patients, there is a particular process for alternate decision makers at section 75(2) of the Mental Health Act 2014 (Vic). Children (under the age of 18) For certain procedures, in cluding vaccination, a child or adolescent may be determined to be mature enough to understand the risks and benefits, and thereby provide informed consent. This principle applies to people under the age of 1 8 years requesting COVID -19 vaccination. In acco rdance with the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) , a medical treatment decision maker for a child wil l be the child's parent or guardian or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is reasonably available and willing and able to make the medical treatment decision. For the purposes of the MTPD Act, a child means any person under the age of 18 years. For children or adolescents under the age of 18 years, who are presenting for vaccination without a parent, guardian or other medical treatment decision maker, capacity to consent will be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority. Children assessed as being ' Gillick competent' can consent to the COVID -19 vaccination.5 These principles are enshrined in section 4 of the MTP D Act. Before administering the COVID -19 vaccination to a person under the age of 18 years, the immuniser must assess whether: 1. the child or adolescent understands the information relevant to the decision to be vaccinated and the effect of that decision (th at is, they understand an explanation of the information given by the 5 Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (2011), Consent to medical treatment: the mature minor - available at https://www .racgp.org.au/download/documents/AFP/2011/March/201103bird.pdf 27 OFFICIAL immuniser in a way that is appropriate t o the child or adolescent's circumstances, whether by using modified language, visual aids or any other means); 2. the child or adolescent can retain that information to the extent necessary to make the decision; 3. the child or adolescent uses or weighs that information as part of their decision making process; and 4. the child or adolescent communicates the decision, and their views and needs as to the decision in some way, including by speech, gestures or other means. There is no presumption that a child or adolescent has capacity; therefore, it is important to consider all of the above factors in relation to the child or adolescent's individual cir cumstances. A child or adolescent should be provided with practicable and appropriate support in making and communicating any decision as to vaccination. This includes: using information or formats tailored to the particular needs of the person; communicat ing or assisting a person to communicate the person's decision; giving a person additional time and discussing the matter with the person; and using technology that alleviates the effects of a person's disability. Immunisers who are assessing whether a chi ld or adolescent has decision making capacity should take reasonable steps to conduct the assessment at a time and in an environment in which the child or adolescen t's decision making capacity can be most accurately assessed. Immunisers who decide not to a dminister the COVID -19 vaccine based on their assessment of the individual's capacity to provide informed consent in line with the principles above, should refer the individual back to their medic al practitioner. If the child or adolescent refuses a COVID -19 vaccination that a parent and/or guardian has given consent for, respect the child's or adolescent's wishes. As detail ed above, d iscussions , statements and decisions about treatment can be recorded in the person's health care record (for example, in the Critical Health Summary section in CVMS, or the person's My Health Record), including but not limited to the outcomes of any assessment of the decision making capacity of the person. For further guidance on 'Consent for COVID -19 vaccination administration in children and adolescents', please view Appendix 15 . This guidance is targeted to vaccination services delivered within scho ols, state -run vaccination sites, disability services and in-reach programs. Working with Children Checks For the purposes of working in COVID -19 vaccination program, workers are not required to have a Working with Children Check (WWCC) under the Worker Screening Act 2020 (Vic). Organisations may have their own policies about who requires a WWCC, over and above what is required under the Act. A WWCC is recommended but not required for those involved in the vaccination of minors. It may be a requirement in some settings, for example schools. 28 OFFICIAL Employers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. Keeping and accessing records related to vaccination It is the responsibility of the COVID -19 immunisation provider to ensure that the administration of all vaccination records complies with relevant legislation. Privacy Each COVID -19 vaccination provider should have its own privacy policy. Copies should be readily available to the public upon request, including at immunisation sessions. All COVID -19 vaccination providers must comply with the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 and Health Records Act 2001 whenever personal information about clients or staff is collected, stored, transmitted, shared, used or disclosed. Providers should be mindful of client privacy when conducting administrative procedures, collecting personal information and administering v accines. In addition to the above legislation, the use and management of vaccination records are also governed by the following: Public Records Act 1973 Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 Australian Standards for Record Management - AS ISO 15489 It is important to note that health services are also sub ject to confidentiality obligations pursuant to the Health Service Act 1988 . A health service must not disclose any information acquired except to carry out functions, exercise powers or disclose information authorised to be disclosed under the Health Services Act 1988 , or another Act. The disclosure of information by a health ser vice is permitted in circumstances where the person to whom the information relates has given their prior consent to the disclosure. All health services should ensure they are aware of their obligation under the Health Services Act 1988 and takes steps, including but not limited to ensuring the notification requirement below are complied with, to ensure that the health service remain compliant with its confidentiality obligations. Privacy notification As routine practice, vaccinees or their guardians shou ld be informed that immunisation information will be passed to Australian Immunisation Register and under what circumstances this information is released. In accordance with the Health Records Act 2001 guardians and adult vaccinees should be given appropri ate notice regarding the use of health information collected as part of the immunisation service. Health privacy principle (HPP) 1.4 extracted from the Health Records Act is reprinted below and outlines the information that should be notified to individua ls in relation to their health information. At or before the time (or, if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable thereafter) an organisation collects health information about an individual from the individual, the organisation 29 OFFICIAL must take steps that are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the individual is generally aware of: (a) the identity of the organisation and how to contact it; and (b) the fact that he or she is able to gain access to the information; and (c) the purposes f or which the information is collected; and (d) to whom (or the types of individuals or organisations to which) the organisation usually discloses information of that kind; and (e) any law that requires the particular information to be collected; and (f) the main consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the information is not provided. Reporting data to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) The Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) is a national register that records vaccinations given to people of all ages in Australia. It is managed by the Australia Government through Services Australia. Late last year, the Australian Immunisation Register Amendment (Reporting) Bill 2020 was tabled to amend reporting advice to the AIR, which previously recommended that vaccine providers only have a discretionary duty to report any vac cinations they administer. As of 1 March 2021, all vaccine providers will be required to report influenza vaccinations to the AIR, with all other National Immunisation Program vaccinations to be reported from 1 July. Reporting of all COVID -19 vaccinations is mandatory from commencement of the COVID -19 vaccination program. The following manner and period of reporting will apply: Manner of reporting: electronic or if this is not reasonably practical then in written form Reporting period: within 24 hours, and no more than 10 working days after the vaccination Personal information: Medicare number (if applicable), name, date of birth, gender Vaccine information: brand name, dose number and batch number, date of administration Provider information: provider numb er, name and contact details More information is available from the AIR website6. The COVID -19 vaccination management system, if applicable to the site, will enable dir ect upload of vaccination information into AIR (see section on COVID -19 vaccination management system below). Practice management software is required to send data about vaccines to the AIR. If a ser vice provider does not have practice management software or they need to view an individual's immunisation record held on the AIR, they can access the AIR using Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). 6 https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health -professionals/services/medicare/australi an- immunisation -register -health -professionals 30 To HPOS an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account. Furth er information about how to register to access the AIR is available from https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/business/services/proda -provider -digital -access Occupational health and safety The Occupational Health and Safety Act 20047 and related regulations aim to keep Victorian workplaces safe. The Act, in conjunction with the Austral ian Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of infection in Healthcare 20198 should guide the development of occupational health and safety protocols the hubs. COVID -19 vaccination providers should maintain up to date, easily retrievable protocols relev ant to their scope of practice in immunisation concerning all relevant aspects of occupational health and safety including, but not limited to: blood spills disposal of infectious waste needle stick injuries medication errors equipment used using multidose vials repetitive strain injury prevention of transmission of infectious diseases in the health care setting safety of interior and exterior of venues where immunisation sessions are held All staff should be familiar with the content of the protoc ols and how to follow them. WorkSafe have developed the following policies, which may assist hubs to identify potential risks to the workforce. Further information with regards to returning, new and redeployed employees and employee fatigue can be found providers , education providers and authorised workforces are required to hold appropriate insurance for the administration of vaccines and provision of a vaccination service. Health professi onals and education providers should consult with their insurance provider regarding insurance appropriate to their circumstances, including the provision of care outside of employer premises or clinical placement providers' premises, as relevant to the insured party/ies. Workforce requirements COVID -19 vaccination providers are responsible for deploying a skilled workforce in sufficient numbers to meet their localised COVID -19 vaccination obligations. This includes adhering regulatory requirements , which authorise specific professions to perform specialist activities, as well as ensuring staff have completed the appropriate training. COVID -19 vaccination providers must also manage and support staff to run sites safely and efficiently. These requirem ents are important to deliver vaccinations to priority groups with a consistent client experience across COVID -19 vaccination locations whilst managing clinical and operational risk. These guidelines provide a base level of workforce guidance, which COVID -19 vaccination providers can use to inform their workforce planning. Please also see section Legislative and Regulatory frameworks - Authorisation of workforce for additional detail. Further information can be requested from workforce.training@health.vic.gov.au . Workforces may be authorised to perform distinct roles, following completion of essential e ducation and training. These include: b. Possess and prepare vaccine: Includes preparing, reconstituting, labelling, and drawing - up of the vaccine (including multi -dose vial handling). c. Possess , prepare and administer vaccine : Includes the above functions, in addition to obtaining consent (where authorised) , administering vaccine, record keeping and disposing of clinical waste. Where a vaccine is prepared and administered by the same person, it is recommended that a second person checks to ensure the dose is correct. Workforces authorised to participate in the COVID -19 vaccination program are classified as: supervising authorised immunisers (also referred to as authorised immunisers) emergency authorised workforce and emergency authorised student workforce emergency authorised surge workforce and emergency authorised surge student workforce Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators . Persons responsible for managing the vaccination sites must be clear about the authorisation of their vaccination team members includ ing the conditions and limitations under which they are authorised to prepare and/or administer the vaccine. The successful completion of the required training modules and adherence to these guidelines is included as a condition of the Secretary Approvals and PHEOs. Note: Factsheets that provide detail on eligible workforces, training, and supervision requirements are available at coronavirus.vic.gov.au/covid -19-vaccine -program -workforce The PHEOs and Secretary Approvals relevant to the COVID -19 vaccine in Victoria are available from: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information -covid -19-vaccine -providers Note: Under the Commonwealth's Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) COVID -19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service and the COVID -19 Vaccination in Community Pharmacy (CVCP) Program, the workforce s eligible for Commonwealth program funding to perform COVID -19 vaccination activities within general practice/primary care/community pharmacy settings may di ffer from those described within Victoria's Secretary Approvals and PHEOs. Further details on the Commonwealth's programs can be found at Appendix 16 - Information for Victorian general practices providing COVID -19 vaccination services and Appendix 17 - Information for Victorian community pharmacies providing COVID -19 vaccination services and : 32 OFFICIAL MBS patient CO VID19 Vaccine Suitability Assessment Service information via MBS Online, available at: http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Conten t/News -210302 COVID -19 Vaccination at: id-19-programs/covid -19-vaccination vaccine preparation supervisors COVID -19 vaccination providers are to ensure there are sufficient, trained authorised immunisation staff on site. Supervising authorised immunisers are listed in Table 2. These are: 1. Medical practitioners 2. Nurse practitioners (within scope of practice) 3. Nurse immunisers 4. Pharmacist immunisers 5. Paramedics with experience in immunisation. Supervising authorised immunisers sh ould have the relevant skills and experience (preferably approximately 6 months experience and current/recently completed anaphylaxis management and basic first aid) to provide supervision to less experienced, and emergency authorised vaccination staff. It is recommended that s upervising authorised immunisers provide clinical supervision of up to 15 emergency -authorised workforce , ensuring the vaccination clinic can continue to operate in parallel to any responses to adverse event following immunisation (A EFI). Supervision requirements for nursing and midwifery staff and students must adhere to Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia requirements. Supervising authorised immunisers should have additional knowledge and experience in the technical aspects of vaccination which enables them to respond to clinical questions and issues escalated to them by the emergency -authorised workforce , including the management of an AEFI and the administration of adrenaline, if required. Where the emergency -authorised worker (regardless of role) has not previously demonstrated practical competence in all authorised vaccination activities, the supervisor should demonstrate, teach and supervise all authorised vaccination activities, until such time as the worker's supervisor is confident the worker demonstrates practical competence prior to undertaking the authorised vaccination activities. 6. Note: Registered nurses/midwives with experience in immunisation and clinical supervision are not considered authorised immunisers but may provide a supervisory role to other emergency authorised workforces and students where there are insufficient supervising authorised immunisers available to meet supervision quotas. Further information is provided later in the chapter. 33 OFFICIAL Table 2: Supervising authorised immunisers Profession Clinical roles Authorised to supervise the following groups: Possess and administer vaccine Supervise the possession and administration of vaccine Possess and prepare Super vise the possession and preparation of vaccine Medical practitioner A medical practitioner can supervise all workforces except enrolled nurses (without notation) and nursing/midwifery students. Nurse practitioner (within scope of practice) A nurse practitioner can supervise all authorised workforces. Nurse immuniser (see definition below) A nurse immuniser (preferably with approximately 6 months experience) can provide supervision to all authorised workforces. Pharmacist immuniser (see definition below) Pharmacist immunisers can supervise all workforces except enrolled nurses (without notation) and nursing/midwifery students. Paramedic with experience in immunisation Paramedic with experience in immunisation can only supervise paramedics and paramedicine students. 34 OFFICIAL Profession Clinical roles Authorised to supervise the following groups: Possess and administer vaccine Supervise the possession and administration of vaccine Possess and prepare Super vise the possession and preparation of vaccine Registered nurses/midwives with experience in immunisation and clinical supervision ~Note: Not considered authorised immunisers but can supervise according to requirements specified A registered nurse/midwife with experience in immunisation and clinical supervision can supervise all authorised workforces.

While paramedics are part of the emergency authorised workforce for COVID -19 vaccination (see below), paramedics with experience in immunisation are only able to supervise other paramedics and paramedicine students administering the COVID -19 vaccine, where requ ired. Pharmacist is not a supervising authorised immuniser, but under the Public Health Emergency Order: Authorisation for preparation and administration - COVID -19 VACCINE, is authorised to supervise the preparation of vaccine (only) by most emergency authorised workforces. A pharmacist is a registered pharmacist who meets all requirements of the relevant PHEO (noting a separate PHEO is applicable to COVID -19 vaccination administration for pharmacists), issued under section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) and has completed all mandatory training listed in Table 3. A pharmacist can provide clinical supervision to a maximum of 1 0 emergency authorised workforce undertaking COVID -19 vaccine preparation activities. Registered nurses/midwives with experience in immunisation and clinical supervision Recognising that Victoria's COVID -19 vaccination roll out has been in operation since February 2021, there may be nursing and midwifery staff with a high level of clinical and supervisory experience working in the program. These nurses and midwives may be considered by vaccination providers to be appropriate candidates for t he supervision of other emergency authorised (and surge) workforces in the COVID -19 vaccination program. To be considered appropriate for a supervisory role, the staff member must meet the following criteria: Be a registered nurse or midwife that has worke d in the COVID -19 vaccination program for approximately six months preparing and administering the COVID -19 vaccine. Has demonstrated the ability to work autonomously and can respond to clinical questions from vaccinees. Has previously acted in a role wh ere they have been responsible for supervising other registered nurses/midwives or enrolled nurses. 36 OFFICIAL Holds current basic life support credentials and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. A registered nurse or midwife performin g this role (and all supervisees) must still have direct access (see definition for Indirect supervision I) to an authorised immuniser (e.g. nurse immuniser, medical practitioner) at all times to escalate complex clinical issues and to respond to serious a dverse events, including anaphylaxis. Emergency authorised workforces Recognising that sites may need to draw upon other key professions and student workforces to meet vaccination demand and other healthcare demands, the Department of Health has expanded the list of eligible workforces authorised to possess, prepare and/or administer COVID -19 vaccines in Victoria. Time limited Public Health Emergency Orders detailing specific requirements and conditions have been issued under Section 22D of the Dr ugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic). The PHEOs and Secretary Approvals relevant to the COVID -19 vaccine in Victoria are available from: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information -covid -19-vaccine -providers Under the time limited emergency orders, workforces (including students) are eligible to participa te in the COVID -19 vaccination program where they: hold appropriate registration with their professional regulating body (e.g. Ahpra) or Australian industry or professional association (where specified); successfully complete all mandatory training and ass essments comply with all supervision ratios and requirements (see Tables 3, 4 and below information of note) comply with the version of the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines (this document) current at the time of vaccine administration. Emergency authorised workforce and emergency authorised student workforce The emergency authorised workforce includes healthcare professions and students who have experience in intramuscular injection but whose scope may not usually include immunisation. Emergency authorised surge workforce and emergency authorised surge student workforce In September 2021, additional professions and student groups were authorised under Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) , issued under Section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic). Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators In January 2022, Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators were authorised as a class of persons meeting critical Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Program requirements as described in Appendix 22 - Victorian Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinator Position Description . This class of work force has a limited scope and was authorised under a PHEO issued under the abovementioned Act. As these workforces may have limited/no experience in immunisation, they are required to successfully complete additional training that will provide them with the specific clinical knowledge and practical s kills required to safely prepare and/or administer the COVID -19 vaccine. 37 OFFICIAL Authorised workforces and their employers must ensure they understand the scope of their authorisation, the restrictions and requirements that apply, and limit their practice to the e xtent of their training. Please note: Health services are recommended to follow the below supervision ratios as outlined in Tables 3 and 4 . Where health services determine the appropriate ratio for the safe and effective delivery of COVID -19 vaccination services (especially when in excess of the recommended r atios ), the below factors , as a minimum, should be considered when making this decision: the experience and seniority of the supervising authorised immuniser ; the composition of the group (with respect to prior skills and experience) being supervised ; the p hysical layout of the vaccination site and the ability to undertake line -of- sight supervision where relevant ; and workforce and rostering pressures. Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators ar e not authorised to vaccinate persons under 1 8 years of age , establish consent f or COVID -19 vaccination or support or manage response to adverse events . Emergency authorised students may be classified as either emergency authorised students or emergency authorised surge students, depending on their year level. This impacts their roles and training requirements. For example: Second and third year pharmacy students may prepare the vaccine only, while fourth year pharmacy students are authorised to possess, prepare and administer the vaccine. Third year nursing students are considered emergency authorised student workforce, while second year nursing students are emergency authorised surge workfo rce, so must complete additional practical training. 38 OFFICIAL Table 3: Emergency authorised workforce and emergency authorised student workforce Category and profession* * Profession - refer to the Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) for complete definitions and requirements of all professions including the specific requirements of students.

Vaccination site leads should c onsider the skills, competencies and relevant experience of nurse immunisers and other workforce members in determining those appropriate to engage in the vaccination program targeted at 5 -11 year old children. To ensure consistency of practice, vaccinatio n sites, including state -led vaccination hubs, should consider the use of a dedicated workforce for the vaccination of children aged 5 -11 years. However, where agency workforces are required, suitably skilled, competent and experienced agency staff should be selected for deployment/placement at sites. Practical training specific to vaccinating children is strongly recommended for any workforce member that does not have experience and/or currency of practice vaccinating children in this age cohort. Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators are not authorised to undertake vaccination of children aged under 1 8 years. Workforce requirements for sites administering vaccin es to children aged 5 -11 years Vaccination sites administering vaccines to children aged 5 -11 years must ensure that an experienced authorised immuniser is present on -site, who has completed all required COVID -19 vaccination training and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. It is recommended that a health profession al with qualifications in basic paediatric life support be present in any setting where children aged 5 -11 years are being vaccinated. Authorised immunisers Whilst additional practical training and competency assessment specific to the vaccination of children 5 -11 years of age is not mandatory for authorised immunisers , the scope of practice and experience of all staff who will be engaged in administering vaccines to children in this age cohort should be considered. Vaccination providers may determine on a case -by-case basis whether an authorised immuniser has the pre -existing skills, knowledge and experience required to immediately vaccinate children 5-11 years of age, or whether they need to undertake additional training and a competency assessment. Where their experience has not previously or recently included child hood vaccination, it is strongly recommended that the staff member undertake practical training and be able to demonstrate the clinical skills and competencies set out in Appendix 5, Part 2 (Clinical Skills and Competen cy Assessment) . Examples of situations where additional practical training for authorised immunisers is recommended include: Nurse immunisers that have recently completed an Immuniser Program of Study and do not have experience vaccinating children. Pharmacist immunisers whose individual scope and recency of practice has not included the vaccination of children under 10 years of age. 46 OFFICIAL For authorised immunisers, the need to have sign -off of the clinical competency assessment for children will be at the d iscretion of the clinical leads at each vaccination site. Emergency authorised workforces Emergency authorised workforces (also including emergency authorised student, emergency authorised surge or surge student workforce members , but excluding Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators) are eligible to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to children aged 5 -11 years (within the classifi cation and scope of their authorisation - see Table s 3 and 4 ). The suitability of emergency authorised workforce should be considered, including their experience as a vaccinator, communication skills, and previous experience working with children. All emergency authorised workforce members who will be administering COVID -19 vaccines to this age group are required to undertake training as set out below, including any additional paediatric specific modules as part of the Commonwealth COVID -19 training program, the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) 'Immunising children and infants' webinar, onsite practical training, and satisfy the requirements of the Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment specific to the 5 -11 years age group (Appendix 5, Part 3 ). Emergency authorised workforce members (including Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators) who will be engaged in preparation only of the COVID -19 vaccine for children aged 5 -11 years (i.e. will not be administeri ng vaccinations) are required to complete the any relevant Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination Training Program modules, and only those sections of the clinical skills and competencies assessment relevant to possessing and preparing the vaccine (Appendix 5, Part 3 ). Training for vaccination of 5 -11 year old children (refer to Training requirements section for more detail) Online training Required training modules (eLearning): All staff involved in the preparatio n and/or administration of a paediatric COVID -19 vaccine must complete any relevant additional modules from the Commonwealth COVID - 19 Vaccination Training Program available from: https://covid19v accinationtraining.org.au An online 'Immunising children and infants' webinar has been developed by the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC). This is available to any vaccinator and is a mandatory requirement for all staff administering the vaccine to children aged 5 -11 years at a state -run vaccination clinic, and for any emergency authorised workforces. The training is recommended but not mandatory for authorised vaccination workforce working in primary care settings. The webinar available from: https://education - mvec.mcri.edu.au/courses/mvec -immunising -children -and-infants -webinar/ Practical training Practical training is strongly recommended for any staff member th at does not have experience vaccinating children. Examples of practical training include: Mentoring by experienced paediatric vaccinators Attendance at council immunisation clinics 47 OFFICIAL Structured training by registered training organisations, nurse educator s, etc. Part 3 of the Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment (Appendix 5 ) may be used as a guide for training purposes. The training of other workforce members at vaccination sites and any associated competency assessment is the responsibility of the relevant Local Public Health Unit or vaccination service provider. Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment ( Appendix 5, Part 3 ) Part 3 of the Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment outlines the key skills required for vaccinating children aged 5 -11 years. This checklist and training certificate must be completed and issued by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised worker for any emergency authorised vaccination staff member prior to vaccinating children aged 5 -11 years. Completion of this assessment is strongly recommended for authorised immunisers who do not have e xperience vaccinating children. Additional training and resources for vaccinating children aged 5 -11 years A number of other resources and training packages are available to help upskill the workforce to deliver the COVID -19 vaccine to children. MVEC CO VID-19 vaccination (COVID -19) Amaze Community Information H ub.

On most occasions, the TGA approval and the ATAGI guidance will align f or the approved/recommended patient groups to receive a particular COVID -19 vaccine. This advice should be followed when the TGA approval and ATAGI recommendation(s) do not align . Authorised vaccination workforces should read and understand their individual authorisation requirements (see the department's Information for COVID -19 vaccine providers page for all the COVID -19 vaccine Public Health Emergency Orders and Secretary Approvals). 48 OFFICIAL Vaccination service providers should consider the skills, competencies and relevant experience of authorised vaccination workforce members in det ermining those appropriate to engage in the vaccination program when administering COVID -19 vaccines under these circumstances. Escalation processes must be in place to support safe and timely clinical decision -making. Clinical assessment Emergency autho rised workforces must be competent to make a thorough, detailed and documented clinical assessment as to the appropriateness of that particular COVID -19 vaccine to be administered to a person (based on successful completion of the relevant training and competency assessments described below in the Training requirements section and also in Appendix 5 of these Guidelines). If the staff member is not confident in their ability to make a thorough, detailed and documented clinical assessment of the patient under these circumstances, they should escalate their concerns to their supervising authorised immun iser for more education and training, or the assessment to be completed by an experienced supervising authorised immuniser or another trained, competent and confident authorised vaccinator. Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators are not authorised to make a pa tient assessment as to vaccine suitability. Informed by best practice clinical guidance If the COVID -19 vaccine is being administered as per the ATAGI guidance, rather than the TGA approval for that particular patient group, the vaccine must be administe red in line with best practice clinical guidance current at the time of vaccine administration (i.e. these Guidelines and the specified ATAGI guidance for that particular vaccine in those particular circumstances). Please check these Guidelines regularly f or updates and consult the relevant sections of these Guidelines for TGA approval information and the current ATAGI guidance as it is published (see section COVID -19 Vaccine Information in these Guidelines). Informed consent Prior to administering the COVID -19 vaccine under these circumstances, the emergency authorised worker (not Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators) needs to inform the person receiving the vaccine that the administration of [that specific COVID -19 vaccine] has not been approved by the TGA for the patient group that the person belongs to. It is important that this is clearly conveyed to the patient for them to make an informed decision about receiving that particular vaccine, for th at particular purpose. Details of clinical discussions, statements and decisions about treatment should be recorded in the person's health care record (for example, in the Critical Health Summary section in CVMS, or the persons My Health Record), including but not limited to the outcomes of any assessment as to the suitability of the COVID -19 vaccine. See section Obtaining consent for vaccination for more details about informed consent. Decision aids Clinical decision -making aids may assist the emergency authorised workforces to perform this activity thoroughly and as per legal requirements. They should include an appropriate script or prompts for the authorised vaccinator to convey critical information to the person receiving the vaccine and contain reminders to document the person's consent and decisions about receiving the COVID -19 vaccine in the person's health care record. Contact VVCC@health.vic.gov.au for support to identi fy decision -making aid(s) if these circumstances apply. 49 OFFICIAL Training requirements To support each COVID -19 vaccination provider in training its workforce, the department has provided guidance on the pre -requisite training modules, and skills and competencies demonstration required to consider the workforce ready for delivering COVID -19 vaccinations. It is the responsibility of each COVID -19 vaccination provider to: Identify members of the workforce who need to complete pre -requisite training modules Structure a training plan accordingly Confirm and document that training has been comple ted Ensure staff have the appropriate experience or have demonstrated the skills and competencies to fulfill their role safely within their individual scope of practice. Where the emergency authorised worker (regardless of role) has not previously demonst rated practical competence in all authorised vaccination activities, the supervisor should demonstrate, teach and supervise all authorised vaccination activities, until such time as the worker's supervisor is confident the worker demonstrates practical com petence prior to undertaking the authorised vaccination activities. Training activities Training pre -requisites are dependent on the roles and authorisations of different workforces in the program. A summary of training requirements can be found in Table 5. Training requirements are listed in the suggested order of completion. Victorian COVID -19 eLearning Competency Training package https://education -mvec.mcri.edu.au/courses/dh -covid1 9/ This online training is hosted by the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) and must be completed by all emergency authorised (including paramedics with experience in immunisation) and student workforces. It consists of three modules: Introduction to immunisation Administering vaccines Adverse events following immunisation Training verification: User issued with a certificate of completion through MVEC. Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination Training program https://www.health.gov.au/covid -19-vaccination -training -program This mandatory training is available for all COVID -19 vaccination providers. Core COVID -19 training modules cover: 50 OFFICIAL COVID -19 introduction Handl ing and storage Communication and purpose Multi -dose vial (MDV) training Documentation and reporting Safety and surveillance monitoring and reporting for adverse events following immunisation Additional COVID -19 training modules include specific training f or individual brands of the vaccine. Select modules may also be completed by non -clinical staff working in administrative roles. Training verification: User issued with multiple certificates of completion - one certificate for the core modules, and another for each vaccine specific module. Victorian COVID -19 AstraZeneca Supplementary eLearning https://education -mvec.mcri.edu.au In response to the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) statement released on 8 April 2021 recommending that Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine is the preferred COVID -19 vaccine for people aged under 50 years, and later updated to people under 60 years (17 June 2021), the department has released a COVID -19 AstraZeneca sup plementary training package for the vaccination workforce in Victoria. This training is mandatory for completion by all emergency authorised workforce and strongly recommended for completion by authorised immunisers (paramedics with experience in immunisat ion must complete this training). Training verification: User issued with a certificate of completion through MVEC. Victorian COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Training Certificate (Appendix 5 of the Guidelines) The COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment is to verify that every emergency authorised worker (under a Public Health Emergency Order) is deemed clinically skilled and competent to possess, prepare and/or administer COVID -19 vaccines. This i s not a pre -employment exercise and cannot be completed prior to commencing employment. The assessment will be completed as part of the onboarding process, by the COVID -19 vaccination provider. A certificate of completion will be issued upon successful co mpletion (the assessment is only required to be completed once). This checklist and training certificate must be completed and issued by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised worker (for example a pharmacist could oversee the vaccine prepar ation skills and competencies of a pharmacy technician, or an experienced nurse immuniser could oversee the vaccine administration skills and competencies of a registered 51 OFFICIAL nurse). It is only required to be completed once and a copy must be made available to the emergency authorised worker as evidence of their clinical competency in Victoria, available to use across all Victorian health services. To minimise the risk of misplacement and loss, where possible, the worker and employer should keep a digital copy of the assessment when completed. There are three parts to the COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competency Assessment: Part 1 - Practical training: This must be completed by emergency authorised surge workforces and Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccination workforce s, due to the lower baseline level of skills and competency in vaccination. Part 2 - Clinical skills and competency assessment: Must be completed by all emergency authorised workforces Part 3 - Competency for vaccination of children 5 -11 years: must be com pleted by all emergency authorised workforces engaged in preparing or administering vaccines to children under 12 years of age. Workers who are authorised to prepare the vaccine only (not administer) must demonstrate competence in vaccine preparation only. Workers who are administering the vaccine must show competence in both preparation and administration steps. Training verification: This assessment must be completed by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised immuniser. MVEC 'Immunising ch ildren and infants' webinar The vaccination of children aged 5 -11 years requires skills and competencies different to those required in relation to the vaccination of adults and adolescents. This webinar, 'Immunising children and infants', is mandatory for any emergency authorised workforce member (including emergency authorised student, emergency authorised surge workforce or surge student workforce member), who will be engaged in administering paediatric dosage of the COVID -19 vaccine to chil dren less than 12 years of age. It is mandatory for all vaccination staff working at state -run vaccination clinics and recommended for other vaccination settings workforce. See Table 5 below. Training verification: User issued with a certificate of comple tion through MVEC. Additional training requirements Vaccination provider s may identify other suitable training for vaccination staff. For example : staff working at state -run vaccination clinics may be required to complete COVID -19 Vaccine Management Syste m (CVMS) training. COVID -19 Vaccination Management System All COVID -19 vaccination providers commissioned by the department will be required to use the CVMS to support operational and clinical management. 52 OFFICIAL The CVMS offers a centralised vaccine registration, administration, cold chain management and supply chain management process. CVMS introductory training package The Department has developed a CVMS introductory training package that introduces new staff to the CVMS system. It is strongly encouraged that all staff at vaccination sites complete the training. The 30 minute online training introduces new staff to the CVMS system. It explains how staff register to CVMS before they begin working at vaccination sites, and demonstrates the key functionality of the Frontline Clinician app. The training contains links to a quick reference guide, the CVMS Knowledge Hub, and technical support contacts. A certificate is issued upon completion of the training. The onlin e training is suitable for all staff working at vaccination sites. Access to the training may be provided by the vaccination site, and can also be viewed here (https://rise.articulate.com/share/Y_pyjIlPdOHUL7CUDl4OT0hcB0VTM8kY#/ ) Training verification It is the responsibility of COVID -19 vaccination providers to verify and document that their workforce has completed the requisite training, and to manage the associated records. COVID - 19 vaccinator providers are also required to notify their workforce of any updates to training packages. 53 OFFICIAL Table 5: Summary of training requirements Workforce Online training Practical training Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination Training Program Victorian COVID -19 eLearning Competency Training Package Victorian COVID -19 AstraZeneca Victorian COVID -19 eLearning competency - MVEC Immunising children and infants* Victorian COVID - 19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Certificate Victorian COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Certificate (Part 3) for 5 - 11 year old vaccinations* Authorised immunisers Paramedics with experience in immunisation not exempt Strongly recommended * Mandatory in state -run vaccination centre.

For the purposes of these guidelines, all non -clinical staff have been grouped together as supporting administration, logistics and non -clinical work force. Where appropriate, non -clinical staff may also be trained to observe for adverse effects post -vaccination and escalate to the supervising authorised immuniser who is the designated first -responder. Emergency response COVID -19 vaccination providers are to ensure that they have suitably qualified and experienced workforce available for emergency response. Providers must ensure an appropriate clinical response in the case of an emergency, and must make certain that: an experienced clinician, who is tr ained and authorised to possess and administer adrenaline, is available on site and able to respond in the case of anaphylaxis following vaccine administration vaccinations can continue regardless of an AEFI sufficient workforce is available to deliver vaccination, supervise vaccination and respond to the AEFI concurrently; and the emergency response is in addition to vaccination supervision requirements. It is recommended that vaccination sites have a desig nated medical or nurse practitioner to provide oversight and clinical advice, including emergency response to an AEFI. For example, an easily deployed and available Medical Emergency Team (MET) team or response team to respond to vaccination sites that are co-located at a health service. Where the medical or nurse practitioner is not available on site, they must be immediately available via phone or video consultation during clinic operational hours. An experienced nurse immuniser must be present on site i f a medical or nurse practitioner is only available via phone or video consultation. Managing and responding to adverse events following immunisation and other emergency responses A requirement of the ATAGI Site Requirements for COVID -19 vaccination provi ders is the ability to monitor, manage and report AEFIs and to have incident management measures in place (and documented), ensuring staff are fully informed of any relevant procedures and able to report any clinical incident. Vaccination sites also have a duty of care to respond to other medical emergencies that may occur on site. Vaccination providers should ensure that all staff working at the vaccination site are trained on this procedure including their points of escalation in the case of a medical eme rgency. COVID -19 vaccination providers can refer staff who wish to complete a refresher in anaphylaxis management to the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA). ASCIA 58 OFFICIAL Anaphylaxis e -training for health professionals is available online free of charge at https://etraininghp.ascia.org.au/ Roles and responsibilities In delivering the end -to-end vaccination journey, a mixture of both clinical and non -clinical professions are likely to be mobilised. The exact workforce model will be influenced by individual COVID -19 vaccination providers and site configurations. COVID -19 vaccination providers are to appoint suitability qualified personnel (such as an associate nurse unit manager) to oversee the clinical governance and day -to-day operations of vaccination sites. End-to-end workforce journey The end -to-end workforce journey covers both clinical and non -clinical functions as part of the COVID -19 vaccination program. Its purpose is to assist COVID -19 vaccination providers in identifying the underlying activities that the workforce will perform. These major functions include: Vaccine logistics Client pre -appointment Site management Vaccine preparation Client arrival Pre-vaccination Vaccination Post-vaccination Client follow -up Ongoing site management It is critical that the workforce has visibility over how their activities work together in this end -to-end journey to both enable a smooth client journey, and clearly delineate handoffs between functions.

The surge clinical workforce pool i s managed through Torrens Health and play a key role in providing a surge clinical workforce. Torrens Health uses an 'any appropriate clinician' model for staffing vaccination activities, to ensure effective use of the immuniser workforce. If required, si tes can still nominate where they require individuals with specific qualifications. Torrens Health is aware of the approved professions who can undertake vaccinations as well as other duties related to vaccination activities. Read more information on how to join the surge clinical workforce pool https://www.torrenshealth.com.au/ 65 OFFICIAL For small scale requests for staffing support of less than 20 people and/or for periods of less than a week, services should submit their request to Torrens Health directly via: bookings.vic@yna.com.au For larger requests for staffing support of more than 20 people and/or for periods of longer than a week, requests should be submitted to the Department of Health via: covidstaffing@health.vic.gov.au Accreditation / minimum site requirements All COVID -19 vaccination providers (including any sub -hubs) will need to comply with the site readiness requirements for the that have been developed by the Commonwealth Government in consultation with ATAGI. Prior to commencement, COVID -19 vaccination providers would have signed a declaration form. The site requirements checklists are available from the following Commonwealth Government website: https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid -19- vaccination -site-requirements -for-covid -19-vaccination -clinics Site readiness declarations (covering site requirement checklist items) should be completed prior to a new vaccine clinic bei ng established. The declarations are completed through the Commonwealth Government COVID -19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS) . Further instruction on how to complete a site readiness declaration through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID -19 Order Management - User Guide The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual site readiness declarations. Any forms received will be returned. In addition to Commonwealth Government site requirements, COVID -19 vaccination providers may also need to abide by any additional requirements as set out by the department and state legislation, such as training requirements and supervision ratios. Vaccination locations will be run by a registered healthcare provider and will comply with the relevant accreditation and clinical governance standards for that provider (e.g. hospital, general practice, GP Respiratory Clinic, pharmacy setting, community health, ACCHO). It is a requiremen t of the ATAGI Site Requirements for COVID -19 vaccination providers is the ability to monitor, manage and report AEFIs and to have incident management measures in place (and documented), ensuring staff are fully informed of any relevant procedures and able to report any clinical incident. See Emergency response section for further details. In keeping with site requirement 6.1 of the Commonwealth Government's site ), all sites must have access to a patient management system (e.g. CVMS) and the Australian Immunisation Register via Provider Digital Access (PRODA). For further information about report ing to the AIR, see section Reporting data to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) . In keeping with site requirement 6.6.1, all sites must: Have a process in place to confirm record of previous receipt of any COVID -19 vaccine doses (including date and brand of product received) A range of documents can be used to confirm previous receipt including Individual personal record via MyGov / Medicare / My Health Record 66 OFFICIAL Vaccination card issued at first encounter Patient management systems (e.g. CVMS) Verbal verification Where there is any ambiguity regarding vaccination status, sites should have a process for accessing AIR to confirm records. Where there are ongoing concerns, an appropriate process for clinical escalation should be in place to support decision -making. 67 OFFICIAL Vaccine Logistics Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine logistics This section provides information specific to logistics and storage for the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech has provided a document titled Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution9, which has been distributed to sites who are administered Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine. Reference, where appropriate, has been made to where further information can be obtaine d 9 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution January 2021 OFFICIAL OFFICIAL Figure 1: Vaccine logistics journey for Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine Vaccine logistics journey: Provided by the Commonwealth Gover nment 69 OFFICIAL The responsibility of the COVID -19 vaccination provider starts from the point the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine is delivered to the site. This includes storage, transfer, handling and administration. The COVID -19 vaccination provider and associated locations must ensure all staff have completed the appropriate training in the st orage and handling requirements of the vaccine, in accordance with the training requirements set out by the Commonwealth Government (see section on Training ). Table 8: Summary of the logistics journey 1. Thermal shipper arrival 2. Storage and handling 3. Returning thermal shipper Vaccines arrive in thermal shippers that can be used as temporary storage for up to 30 days, as long as dry ice is replenished upon receipt and there after every 5 days. A tempe rature range between -90 and -60C is maintained by the thermal shipper. If the vaccine is stored within this temperature range it is not considered an excursion from the recommended vaccine storage condition. The vaccines should be protected from light and kept in the original packaging when stored in a ULT freezer between -80 and -60C. Vials should never be in direct contact with dry ice. During storage vials should remain upright in trays and well secured (preventing movement or rolling around) when transported. If stored between -80 and -60C, vials are stable for up to twelve months (Pfizer 5 -11 years) or fifteen months (Pfizer 12+ years) from the date of manufacture. The vaccine vials are made of glass and should be handled with care. A visual inspect ion must be carried out prior to use. Once removed from trays the vials should be refrigerated between 2 and 8C. Within 30 days of delivery the thermal shipper and temperature logger must be returned to Pfizer. Instructions for thermal shipper and temperature logger return are available on/with the shipper. Pfizer is responsible for the return of the thermal shipper. 70 OFFICIAL When the vaccine has been reconstituted and is ready for use, there should be no evidence of particulate matter. The diluted 12+ vaccine, in either vials or syringes can be stored or transported at room temperatures of up to 30\u00b0C for up to 6 hours .10 There is currently no data on the stability of the 5 -11 vaccine during transport . Thermal shipper The Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine arrives in a thermal shipper. Each thermal shipper can hold up to 5 vial trays (pizza boxes). Each box will contain 195 vials. More details and specifications on the Pfizer thermal shipper can be found in Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine: Storage, Handling and Redistribution , p. 5 -6. The thermal shipper also comes with a temperature and location tracking device. Once received, the GPS enabled data logger should be turned off by pressing 'stop' on the tracker. Within one hour of p ressing the stop button temperature records will be provided. Upon delivery to the health service, it would be the responsibility of the health service to ensure the required temperature specifications are maintained at their site. Thermal Shipper Configuration (Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine) Vaccine storage On receipt of the thermal shipper from DHL, the health service will need to transfer the vial trays into their own ultra-low temperature (ULT) freezer be tween the range ( -90 to -60C). Alternatively, the vaccine can be temporarily stored in the thermal shipper by replenishing the dry ice on receipts and at 5 -day intervals thereafter11. Upon receipt of the vaccines in the thermal shipper, the GPS enabled lo gger must be disabled and the trays need to be transferred to the ULT freezer within 3 minutes (or within a maximum period of 5 mins). Sites are recommended to use their own temperature monitoring devices if the ULT freezer does not have one. Appropriate P PE needs to be used while handing the vaccine under ultra -low temperature conditions.12 Each thermal shipper with 5 vial trays would weigh around 36.7 kgs.

Further instruction on how to submit vaccine delivery acceptance through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID -19 Order Management - User Guide . The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual forms. An y forms received will be returned. Each delivery should come with the following: Dry ice handling insert Safety data sheet for dry ice Return instructions for GPS loggers and the thermal shipper Blank label to cover 'dry ice' label when container is empty, return shipping label, outbound shipping label and contents label on the inside flap. Deliveries without a cold chain monitor should not be accepted. Stock management Stock management reports should be completed weekly through the Commonwealth Government COVID -19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS) . Further instruction on how to submit stock management reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID -19 Order Management - User Guide . The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual forms. Any forms received will be returned. It is critical that cold -chain storage and handling requirements are always maintained and are not breached during the stockt ake process. It is recommended that one key person is nominated to oversee the stock management including the cold chain with the support of a backup person in the absence of key person. Facilities should have a process in place to support the required freezer monitoring. Storage in ULT freezers (range -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C) Once the trays are moved to a local ULT freezer at a health service hub, there should be a system to continuously monitor the temperature. Most ULT freezers come with an inbuilt monitoring system which would record the data. Current maximum and minimum temperatures must be recorded at least 4 times per day and whenever they are accessed. The freezer should be connected to a reliable power supply with appropriate electricity back up. Storage in refrigerators (range 2 \u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) Refrigerator temperatures should be stabilised at least 48 hours prior to stocking the vaccine. The use of purpose -built vaccine refrigerators is mandatory . Data loggers are required for the refrigerator to record temperature automatically and should be set to no less than 5 -minute intervals. The minimum and maximum temperatures in all refrigerators must be monitored and recorded at least twice daily regardless of the monitoring system used. 76 OFFICIAL Please note that the val idity of the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine in a refrigerator (2 \u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) is only for 31 days (Pfizer 12+ years) or 10 weeks (Pfizer 5 -11 years) . Use of coolers for offsite/outreach Coolers should be used only as a last option, as the risk of freezing is high. Coolers are not recommended for more than 8 hours or extreme conditions. Conditions for using icepacks can be found in National Vaccine Storage Guidelines 'Strive for 5' | Australian Government Department of Health . Temperature should be monitored and recorded every 15 minutes, or a temperature logger should be used. The temperature must be recorded at least hourly during mobile and outre ach immunisation clinics. This includes the current minimum and maximum temperature measured with a digital thermometer. A specialised vaccine cooler is recommended in an extreme climate (environmental temperature is <0\u00b0C or >40C) or for long -term portable storage more than 8 hours. Specialised coolers have thicker walls for insulation resulting in a minimum 'cold life' of 120 hours in temperatures of 43\u00b0C if the lid is not opened. Thawing At the point of delivery, the vials need to be thawed and diluted be fore use. Once a vial is thawed it should not be re-frozen. Frozen vials should be transferred to an environment of 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C to thaw. Alternatively, frozen vials may also be thawed for 30 minutes at temperatures up to 30\u00b0C for immediate use . Please refe r to the Product Information14 for more information. Movement of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine from hubs to other locations Movement of thawed vials The Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine can be moved thawed at 2 -8\u00b0C. The recommended option is to move the vials from the health service hub to other locations using a portable refrigerated or temperature controlled and monitored container. If hubs do not have the ca pacity to move the vaccine stock from hub to sub -hubs or any other location, then they may: engage an existing logistics provider used by the health service to move vaccines and other medicines at 2 -8\u00b0C, or use the department's logistics provider to mov e thawed vaccine at 2 -8\u00b0C. The department will provide contact details directly to health services. Movement of frozen vials The Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine can only be moved frozen when in a full shipper or full tray. If appropriate freezer capacity is ava ilable at a sub -hub or other non -hub location, then a hub may request DHL to move the stock frozen. Appropriate guidance on the use of DHL will be provided to health services by the department.

The following are the storage and handling vaccines considerations: All deliveries received at a facility will be accompanied by a cold chain monitor which monitors temperature during transit and detects temperature excursions outside acceptable requirements for the vaccines. Deliveries must be checked and stored promptly without delay. Deliveries without a cold chain monitor should not be accepted. Instructions for unpacking the vaccines are provided by the logistics provider depending on the delivery model being used. The vaccine comes ready to use once thawed. Provider s should confirm that the syringe containing the dose is not cold to touch prior to administration to minimize discomfort from receiving an injection of a chilled product. This vaccine must not be mixed with other medicinal products or diluted. For more in formation, refer to TGA product information for Spikevax.

The four vaccines have different handling requirements, which means reducing any confusion is very important. Storage in the same fridges may be more of a concern than storage at the same hospital or facility however can be overcome with good clinical governance standards and processes. To reduce confusion and dose mishandling, ATAGI recommends the following: Clear standard operating procedures and clinical governance standards with good workflow and processes that are clearly separated and defined. Adequate training, sup ervision and quality controls in the hubs with experiences immunisation teams/supervisors, Separate teams and outreach clinics using each/different vaccines. Use of a single vaccine brand on any outreach (i.e. administration of 1 vaccine for any remote ve nue). Further to the above, the below suggestions can assist sites to reduce the risk of administration errors and vaccine wastage when sites are managing different COVID -19 vaccines. Incorporating dedicated morning or afternoon sessions for one type of th e COVID -19 vaccine and/or schedule, e.g. Friday morning for Moderna booster doses Assigning dedicated booths or staff members at the vaccination site, to administer only one type of the vaccine and/or schedule e.g. Immuniser A administers Pfizer booster dose only. Some sites e.g. pharmacies may have the facilities to store different COVID -19 vaccines in different fridges or different shelves, to clearly distinguish between COVID -19 vaccine types . Ensuring clear labelling of the shelf/location where each t ype of vaccine vials is located, to reduce the risk of selection error eg.are located, to reduce the risk of selection error e.g. Moderna vials stored in fridge 1 or Paediatric Pfizer vials stored on shelf 2 . Stock management Stock management reports should be completed weekly through the Commonwealth Government COVID -19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS) . Further instruction on how to submit stock management reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID -19 Order Management - User Guide . The Commonwealth will no longer accept manual forms. Any forms received will be returned. It is critical that cold -chain storage and handling r equirements are always maintained and are not breached during the stocktake process. It is recommended that one key person is nominated to oversee the stock management including the cold chain with the support of a backup person in the absence of key perso n. Facilities should have a process in place to support the required freezer monitoring. 91 OFFICIAL Cold chain management Vaccines management guidelines are contained within National Vaccine Storage Guidelines 'Strive for 5' | Australian Government Department of Health . Identifying a cold chain breach A cold chain breach may happen when vaccine is stored outside the recommended temperature range. Any service storing vaccines must have a strategy for dealing with cold chain breaches. In case of a power failure or fridge breakdown, a backup plan should be practiced by all key personnel. Alternate purpose -built vaccine fridges/coolers should be able to contain the full vaccine stock supply. The time and temperature must be recorded as soon as practicable after the breach commences. Please refer to Table 9 for Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine , Table 10 for AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine , and Spikevax COVID -19 vaccine logistics section for information on storage and stability. Any temperature recorded outside the recommended temperature ranges is a cold chain breach. Reporting a vaccine cold chain breach Vaccine stored outside of the recommended storage requirements is considered a vaccine cold chain breach. The following actions must be implemented: Isolate affected vaccines in the recommended temperature range. Label 'Do not use'. Notify the Commonwealth VOC immediately on 1800 318 208 and follow the advice g iven. If advised to discard vaccine follow the reporting guidance in the Vaccine Wastage section below . Patients who are inadvertently administered a cold chain breached vaccine: A cold ch ain breached vaccine that has been administered inadvertently is consider a vaccine administration error. SAEFVIC must be contacted: 1), and complete SAEFVIC online report form . For all other non -COVID -19 vaccines affected by a cold chain breach, go to Cold chain breach reporting and follow the directions. Vaccine wastage Vaccine wastage can be due to cold chain breach , under utilised stock at end of session, damage to vials or vaccine passing expiry date . Vaccine waste a voidance While the Australian rollout of the COVID -19 vaccine through dedicated phases ensures those most at risk receive priority doses, there are circumstances where it is appropriate for health services to deviate from the phases to avoid vaccine wastage. One of these scenarios is if booked appointments do not attend and doses 92 OFFICIAL have been prepared/drawn up in preparation for their attendance. In this situation use the prepared doses to vaccinate people who are currently not 'eligible' but are availab le to be vaccinated at short notice. Reporting vaccine wastage Less than 5 vials (minor wastage) In the event of a potential or actual wastage incident (e.g. damaged vials, breach of cold chain requirements), that is less than 5 vials , a site must discard the vaccine in the biohazard clinical waste container. For general practice and other Commonwealth -funded vaccine providers, report wastage less than 5 vials through the Commonwealth Government COVID -19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS). Further instruc tion on how to submit minor wastage reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID -19 Order Management - User Guide . 5 or more vials (major wastage) In the event of a potential or actual wastage incident (e.g. damaged vials, breach of cold chain requirements), that exceeds the threshold (5 or more vials at a time), a site must \u00b7 Notify the Commonwealth VOC immediately on 1800 318 208 \u00b7 Report wastage of more than 5 vials through the Commonwealth Government COVID -19 Vaccine Administration System (CVAS). Further instruction on how to submit minor wastage reports through CVAS is outlined in CVAS COVID -19 Order Management - User Guide . Strategies to manage a power outage or refrigerator breakdown with vaccine stock All COVID -19 Vaccination Clinics should have a site-specific Emerge ncy Planning and Response Tool / Policy including procedures to manage cold chain during extrem e weather events, planned or unplanned power outages , or other service disruptions. Cold chain breach steps Immediately isolate the vaccines and prepare to transfer them into temp orary monitored vaccine storage, if necessary. Start conditioning ice packs/gel packs. Keep vaccines refrigerated between 2 and 8\u00b0C for as long as possible, and label them 'Do not use' while preparing to transfer them. Do not discard any vaccine until advised to do so by either the State or Commonwealth Government. Take steps to correct the problem and to prevent it from recurring. Record fridge temperature issues and actions on the minimum/maximum vaccine refrigerator temperature chart required: A back -up purpose -built vaccine fridge for a refrigerator breakdo wn (if feasible onsite) A sign reading 'Keep the fridge door closed and do not use vaccine until further notice' Sufficient number of ice packs / gel packs to place in the fridge and cooler/s 93 OFFICIAL Insulating material such as bubble wrap/cardboard to cover the g lass door of the fridge Cooler/s to fit the vaccine stock (see National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 , Section 9.3 How to pack a cooler ) Polystyrene chips/bubble wrap to protect the vaccine s tock from the icepacks and allow air circulation in the cooler A battery -operated digital minimum/maximum thermometer with a temperature probe and external display, for use in a cooler or an alternative fridge A data logger for use in a cooler or an altern ative fridge. (see Appendix 2 - Data loggers ) Alternative vaccine storage in the event of a power failure may include any of the following: A monitored purpose -built refrigerator offsite, for instance at a local hosp ital or pharmacy - ensure that an agreement has been put in place with the relevant organisation before the event, and also consider that this organisation may be affected by the same power failure Cooler/s - each facility should ensure that they have sufficient coolers for an emergency Action during a power outage for vaccines in the purpose -built refrigerator: Place a sign on the door of the fridge 'Keep the fridge door closed and do not use vaccine until further notice'. Insert icepacks in empty spaces in the fridge to maintain the temperature Place the battery -operated digital minimum/maximum thermometer temperature probe into a vaccine box in the middle of the fridge Place the external display of the min/max thermometer on the outside of the fr idge to limit the need to open the door. Ensure the data logger is near the temperature probe Lock the fridge door if possible Closely monitor the refrigerator temperature Prepare the cooler for vaccine stock transfer Remove ice packs/gel packs from the freezer: Place the number of packs you require for your cooler on the bench to 'sweat' ( see National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 Section 9.2 for information about conditioning ice packs/gel packs). Place the ice packs/ gel packs in your cooler to chill the inside of the cooler. Remove the ice packs/gel packs from the cooler and place insulating material (bubble -wrap or polystyrene chips) in the bottom of the cooler. Reset the minimum/maximum thermometer and insert the thermometer probe inside an empty vaccine box with the product information intact. Make sure the minimum/maximum temperature is between 2 and 8\u00b0C at the time the vaccines are placed in the cooler. 94 OFFICIAL If the temperature rises to 8\u00b0C (less than 9\u00b0C) move vaccines to a prepared cooler. Actions when vaccines are transferred into a cooler: Place the vaccine stock in the cooler with the box containing the thermometer probe and the data logger in the center. All vaccines should remain in their original packaging until they are administered or returned to a purpose -built vaccine refrigerator \u2014 this prevents damage from exposure to light and ambient temperature. Surround the vaccines with polystyrene chips or bub ble wrap and place conditioned ice packs/gel packs on the top before closing the cooler. Ensure that vaccine stock is not in direct contact with the ice packs/gel packs, to minimise risk of freezing. Close the cooler lid and fix the digital thermometer d isplay to the outside of the cooler. Keep the cooler out of direct sunlight. Record the date, time, and minimum and maximum temperatures on the temperature chart now. Then record temperatures at the following times: - every 15 minutes for the first hour - hourly thereafter, provided the temperatures are stable. Note: Freezing vaccines occurs most commonly in the first 2 hours of storage in a cooler. Ensure that ice packs/gel packs do not become displaced and have direct contact with vaccines \u2014 this may fre eze the vaccines and render them unviable. Remove vaccines from the cooler only as they are required. Only move vaccines back to a purpose -built vaccine refrigerator in which the temperature is between 2 and 8\u00b0C. Ensure that all vaccines are packed and monitored in the cooler with a digital minimum/maximum thermometer and data logger. Do not transport vac cines to another vaccine refrigerator, cooler without a minimum/maximum thermometer or data logger to monitor the temperature. Do not place vaccines in a domestic refrigerator (including bar fridges) as they are not designed to store vaccines and must not be used. If at any time the temperature goes outside the recommended temperature range do not use or dispose of vaccine. See section on Reporting a vaccine cold chain breach. Power restored - what to do When power is returned: Record the minimum and maximum temperatures for the fridge. Reset the min/max fridge temperatures once the temperatures are in the 2 to 8\u00b0C range. If the temperature readings are outside 2 to 8\u00b0C, do not use or discard vaccine. Monitor t he fridge closely (e.g. hourly) to ensure that the temperature is consistently stable, then return to twice -daily monitoring. 95 OFFICIAL Please see Appendix 3 for cold chain management checklists. Transporting doses for home visits When transporting Pfizer, Moderna , AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID -19 vaccines for a home visit, there are 2 options: Where possible, transport the vial at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 6 hours, and draw up the dose at the site of administration. A pre -drawn dose in a syringe can be transported if it can be appropriately stored (protecting from light and maintaining the cold chain) and can be administered as soon as practicable and not exceeding the total maximum sto rage period of 1 hour if at room temperature, and within 6 hours if at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

Moderna COVID -19 vaccine dosing The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommended schedule for Moderna COVID -19 vaccine in individuals 6 months and older, is two doses, 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened to a minimum of 4 weeks, for individuals at risk of moderate to severe COVID -19 in special circumstances (as outlined in ATAGI clinical guidance on medical conditions associated with a higher risk of severe COVID -19 disease ). Please note that administration of the second dose of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine less than 4 weeks after the first dose must be reported to SAEFVIC as an administration error. Call complete the SAEFVIC online report form . If a dose has been inadvertently given before the minimum 4 -week interval, it is not currently recommended that the vaccine dose be repeated. ATAGI advi ses that the absolute minimum interval between the first and second dose is 14 days to be considered valid as fully vaccinated in the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). ATAGI has provided further guidance regarding a repeat dose after an unacceptably short interval . For more information, please see the ATAGI fact sheet on Spikevax (Moderna) . Additional TGA resources Additional resources are available from the TGA related to this vaccine including: Consumer Medicine Information. This leaflet can be used to provided recipients of the vaccine with the necessary information. Moderna COVID -19 vaccin e for ages 6-11 years The Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA) has provisionally approved the use of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine in individuals 6 years and TGA COVID Moderna COVID -19 vaccine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6 -11 years. ATAGI recommends that immunisation providers are vigilant for the potential for dosing errors with the Moderna vaccine for children. The paediatric ( 6-11 years ) dose of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine is half that of the dose used for the primary course for people 12 years and older. Please note a booster dose of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine has not been approved for those under 18 years. Further information on schedules, co administration, and safety can be found at ATAGI recommendations on the use of Spikevax (Moderna) COVID -19 vaccine in children aged 6 to 11 years | Au stralian Government Department of Health Moderna COVID -19 vaccine for ages 6 months - <5 years ATAGI recommends Moderna COVID -19 vac cine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6 months to <5 years with severe immunocompromise, disability and those who have complex and/or multiple health conditions which increase risk of severe COVID -19. These include children with the following or similar conditions: - Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments as listed in the ATAGI advice on 3rd primary doses of COVID -19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised - Bone marrow or stem cell tran splant or chimeric antigen T -cell (CAR -T) therapy' - Complex congenital cardiac disease; - Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease; - Type 1 diabetes mellitus; - Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions; or - A disability that require frequent assistance with activities of daily living, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). The recommendation is for 2 primary doses, except for those with severe immunocompromise who require 3 primary doses. The recommended interval between each dose is 8 weeks. ATAGI does not currently recommend vaccination for children aged 6 months to <5 years who are NOT in the above risk categories for severe COVID -19. The recommended dose for this age group is 25 micrograms compared with 50 mic rograms in children aged 6 - 11 and 100 micrograms for those aged 12 years and over. Where possible, it is preferable to separate administration of Moderna paediatric COVID -19 vaccine and other vaccines by 7 -14 days to minimise risk of adverse events such as fever. Prophylactic paracetamol to reduce risk of fever is not routinely recommended prior to or immediately after vaccination though, however can be given as required after for any discomfort or fever. Nuvaxovid NVX-COV2373 (Novavax) COVID -19 Vaccine The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has granted provisional approval for the use of Nuvaxovid (Novavax) for primary dose in individua ls 12 years and older. On 10 June 2022 the TGA issued provisional 110 OFFICIAL approval for the use of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine as a booster to individuals aged 18 years and over. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI ) has advised that if no other COVID -19 vaccine brand is s uitable for a person age 12 -17, Novavax COVID -19 vaccine can be used as a booster . Summary table of Nuvaxovid (Novavax) COVID -19 Vaccine Use in Victoria 12 years old Preparation Multi -dose vial, each vial containing 10 doses of 0.5ml. The vial should not be diluted. Primary dose volume (strength) 0.5ml (5ug) per dose (Adjuvanted with Matrix -M) Primary dose schedule 2 doses, a minimum of 3 -8 weeks apart * Primary dose schedule for immunosuppressed 3rd primary dose at 2 months after the 2nd dose ** Booster dose volume ( strength) 0.5ml (5ug) dose Booster dose schedule (Third dose/fourth dose for severely immunocompromised) 3 months following the primary vaccination course *** Additional winter booster dose Novavax can be used in those who have a contraindication to mRNA vaccines or for people who do not prefer an mRNA vaccine . Additional booster dose is only recommended for specific cohorts. For more information on eligibility see the additional winter booster doses Additional winter booster dose schedule 3 months or longer after first booster dose or after a confirmed SARS - CoV-2 infection (if infection occurred since the person's first COVID -19 booster dose). *Myocarditis and/or pericarditis can occur after Novavax . Providers can consider extending the interval between 2 primary doses of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine to 8 weeks (from a minimum of 3 weeks) to potentially improve effectiveness and reduce any potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. **ATAGI advises that a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd primary dose, may be considered in exceptional circumstances (e.g, anticipated intensification of immunosuppression). ***ATAGI considers Novavax COVID -19 vaccine to be acceptable for use as a booster dose in an individual aged 12 years or older if no other COVID -19 vaccine brand is suitable for this person. Novavax can be administered as an additional dose following discussion with a clinician, an assessment tool for suitability for Novavax has been provided to state hubs. Product information The TGA has provided Product Information on Novavax COVID -19 vaccine . Preparation of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine Each multidose vial contains 10 doses of 0.5 mL. One dos e (0.5 mL) contains 5 micrograms of SARS -CoV-2 spike protein and is adjuvanted with Matrix -M. The vaccine comes ready to use. Do not dilute. An overfill is included in the vial to ensure that a maximum of ten (10) doses of 0.5 mL each can be extracted. 111 OFFICIAL Each 0.5 mL dose is withdrawn into a sterile needle and sterile syringe to be administered by intramuscular injection, preferably in the delt oid muscle of the upper arm Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual dose Do not mix the vaccine in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Novavax COVID -19 vaccine dosing and interva l Novavax COVID -19 vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. The recommended in terval between the first and second dose is 3-8 weeks . Myocarditis and/or pericarditis can occur after Novavax . Providers can consider extending the interval between 2 primary doses of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine to 8 weeks (from a minimum of 3 weeks) to potentially improve effectiveness and reduce any potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. There is no data available on the interchangeability of Novavax with other COVID -19 vaccines to complete the primar y vaccination course. Individuals who have received a first dose of Novavax should receive the second dose of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine to complete the vaccination course . ATAGI recommends that Novavax COVID -19 vaccine can be administered as part of a heterologous (mixed) primary schedule to people who have received one or more doses of another COVID -19 vaccine, including as a third dose for people with severe immunocompromise. If AstraZeneca COVID -19 vac cine is inadvertently given as a first dose to a person aged under 18 years, Pfizer , Moderna or Novavax COVID -19 vaccines should be used for the second dose. See Clinical recommendations for COVID -19 vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health Please note that administration of a dose of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine at less than the recommended interval must be reported to SAEFVIC as an administration error. Call the SAEFVIC online report form . If a dose has been inadvertently given before the minimum interval of three weeks, it is not currently recommended that the vaccine dose be repeated. ATAGI advises that the absolute minimum interval between the first and second dose is 14 days to be consid ered valid as fully vaccinated in the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). ATAGI has provided further guidance regarding a repeat dose after an unacceptably short interval. The most commonly reported reactions include headache, paraesthesia, chest pain, fatigue and dizziness. To date, no safety signals have been identified for Novavax COVID -19 vaccine based on this limited number of reports. Paraesthesia is an unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a c rawling sensation, and has also been reported for other COVID -19 vaccines. It is not known why paraesthesia sometimes occurs after vaccination, but it is thought it may be a stress -related response to immunisation rather than an immune reaction.

Patient Information Safety considerations for in -home COVID -19 Vaccination For operational and clinical s afety considerations to support in -home COVID -19 vaccination model/s, please refer to Appendix 21 Safety Considerations for in -home COVID -19 vaccination Primary Course of Vaccination A primary COVID -19 vaccine cour se consists of two doses of the following COVID -19 vaccines available in Australia: Pfizer, Moderna , Novavax or AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccines ; or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID -19 vaccine (which is registered but not available in Australia). Mixed schedules of these vaccines are also included in the definition of an acceptable primary course, as are additional TGA-recognised vaccines . Key definitions Terminology Definition Thirdprimarydose Refers to an additional COVID -19 dose required as part of the primary course to reach a comparable (optimal) level of protection. Generally, provided to those with significant immunosuppression(short interval after 2nddose e.g.,2 months). On 8 October 2021, ATAGI recommended that individuals with severeimmunocompromisehave a third dose of a COVID -19 vaccineas part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure optimalimmune response. First booster dose Refers to additional COVID -19 dose for those eligible to optimise protection due to waning of immunity (loss of protection) over time. Also referred to as 3rd dose / 4th dose for severely immunocompromised. Additional winter booster dose ATAGI recommends an additional booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine to increase vaccine protection before winter for selected population groups. For eligibility and interval recommendations please latest ATAGI recommendations on the COVID -19 vaccine winter dos e. ATAGI updated recommendations for a winter dose of COVID -19 vaccine Up to date status Up-to-date vaccination status is defined by the number and timing of appropriate COVID -19 vaccine doses recommended for and received by an individual, according to their age and other factors. See defining 'up -to-date' status for COVID -19 vaccination | Australian Government Department of Health 113 OFFICIAL Third primary doses for severe ly immunocompromise d People with immunocompromising conditions or therapies have been recognised as being at increased risk of severe outcomes due to COVID -19. Those aged 6 months and over who have immunocompromise or are taking immune -weakening treatments should be vaccinated against COVID -19. COVID -19 vaccines are safe for those with immunocompromise. Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are not live COVID -19 vaccines. AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine contains a virus which cannot replicate or spread to other cells and does not behave like a live virus. There is no reason to expect a higher rate of safety issues with either COVID -19 vaccine in those with immunocompromise. ATAGI recommends the use of a third primary dose for individuals who are severely immunocompromised from 6 months and above. Antibody testing is not recommended to assess for immunity to SARS -CoV-2 following COVID -19 vaccination including in immunocompromised people. For details on the eligibility and indications for a third primary dose, see ATAGI recommendations on the use of a third primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - COVID -19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - Provider guide to COVID -19 vaccination of people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health Timing of third primary doses Third primary doses can be administered 2 months after the 2nd dose. In exceptional circumstances, ATAGI advises that a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd primary dose, may be considered in exceptional circumstances ( e.g, anticipated intensification of immunosuppr ession ). Vaccine preference for third primary dose ATAGI recommend s that it is preferable to use the same brand for all doses of the primary course, an alternative brand can be used for the second/third dose if a patient is unable to access or declines another dose of the same brand . An mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) or the Novavax COVID -19 vaccine can be used for this third dose. Please note that Novavax COVID -19 vaccine can be administered as part of a heterologous (mixed) primary schedule to people who have received one or more doses of another COVID -19 vaccine, including as a third dose for people with severe immunocompromise. T here is very limited data on the immunogenicity and efficacy of Novavax as a third dose in people with severe immunocompromise. AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine is not preferred. Please note, paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine is only approved for use in th ose aged 5 years and above . Moderna COVID -19 vaccine is approved for those 6 months and above. Novavax COVID -19 vaccine is approved for those 12 years and above . AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine is only approved for use in those aged 18 years and above. See Appendix 18: Third primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine for for severely immunocompromised . 114 OFFICIAL Booster doses ATAGI recommends a first booster dose (ie 3rd dose) for all those aged 16 years and above . For further information for those aged 16 years and above see ATAGI recommendations on the use of a booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine . First booster doses are recommended for those aged aged 5-11 years and those aged 12-15 years for select cohorts only . A booster is not recommended for all children though aged 5 -15 years. mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna or Moderna Bivalent) are the preferred vaccine for a booster dose. A second booster dose (ie a 4th dose) is recommended for people in the following groups 3 months after the first booster dose: people 50 years or older residents aged 16 y ears and older of an aged care or disability care facility people aged 16 years and older who have complex, chronic or severe medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness from COVID -19 people aged 16 years and older with disability with si gnificant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of poor outcome from COVID -19 People aged 30 -49 years can receive a second booster but the benefit in this age group is less certain.

There is insufficient evidence of severe disease in otherwise healthy adolescents in this age group who have already received two primary doses of a COVID -19 vaccine. ATAGI continues to recommend that all children and adolescents ag ed 5-15 years complete a primary vaccine course of 2 doses of COVID -19 vaccine, 8 weeks apart. The Influenza vaccine can be co -administered with the additional booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine. However, if a person is not yet eligible for their additional booster dose, influenza vaccine could be given ahead of the additional booster dose.

Evidence demonstrates that the initial protection following a primary course of COVID -19 vaccination wanes over time, therefore ATAGI recommends all individuals aged 16 years and over receive a COVID -19 va ccine booster dose to maintain an \"up -to-date\" status on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). An individual will be considered 'overdue' if a booster has not been received within 6 months of completing their primary schedule. This booster dose is n ow recommended from 3 months after the last primary dose. Children aged 6 months to <5 years with severe immunocompromise, disability or complex medical conditions are up to date after completion of a primary course of vaccination. A booster dose is not currently recommended for this age group. These children with severe immunocompromise require a 3rd primary dose from two months after dose 2 to remain up to date. Children and adolescents aged 5 -15 years are up to date after completion of a primary course of vaccination. A booster dose is not currently recommended for this age group except for those in special cohorts Severely immunocompromised individuals aged 5 years and over require a 3rd primary dose of a COVID -19 vaccine from 2 months (and no later than 6 months) after dose 2 to remain up to date. Severely immunocompromised individuals who are aged 5 years and over are recommended a booster (4th) dose, 3 mont hs after dose 3 of their primary vaccination course. However, for the purpose of being up to date in AIR (which does not contain any information on medical conditions) only a total of 3 doses will be counted as being up to date in this subgroup. Individuals who have had prior COVID -19, including asymptomatic SARS -CoV-2 infection, still require completion of the above vaccination schedule, but can defer receipt of the next dose for up to 3 months following their infection. This recommendation has c hanged from the previous 6 -month interval. Refer to ATAGI clinical guidance on people with a past SARS -CoV-2 infection . Vaccine schedules using mixed , or the same brand of COVID -19 vaccine are acceptable for being considered up to date. The determination of the vaccination status of a person who has recei ved a vaccine which is recognised by the TGA but not registered for use in Australia (e.g ., fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, requiring a booster etc) will follow ATAGI's advice on these matters. Refer to International COVID -19 vaccines recognised by Australia | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Safety Considerations for vaccinating children aged 5 years and above For information relating to the safety considerat ions for children aged 5 -11 years please see Appendix 20: COVID -19 vaccinations for children aged 5 -11 years For safety considerations relating to children and adolescents aged 12 and above, plea se see 117 OFFICIAL Appendix 13: Guidance - Considerations for vaccinating children aged 12 years and above Safety Considerations for Booster Dose Vaccinations in Aged Care Facility Outbreaks Vaccination in an outbreak setting is not routinely recommended due to safety considerations for workforce as well as conflicting evidence on the benefit Booster vaccination may be considered in RACF in outbreak settings on a case -by-case basis where there is high case loa d and/or morbidity and mortality and the RACF residents and/or staff are due for their booster dose. Consideration should be given to not enter outbreak settings if the workload placed on the facility impacts on other outbreak mitigation efforts Booster vaccines should be given in line with ATAGI advice The decision on which RACF may meet this approach should be made by the relevant Local Public Health Unit. Consultation will also be required with the corresponding health service's in -reach vaccination team. Check the resident's vaccination status prior to administering a booster to ensure they have finished their primary course or whether a third primary dose due to immunosuppression is more appropriate Eligibility Individuals with known exposure to COVID -19 (i.e.close contacts) are not recommended to proceed to vaccination based on current national and international guidance but may be considered in the setting of high morbidity and mortality. Individuals who are receiving screening testing would be eligible for vaccination following testing The Commonwealth has provide a COVID -19 vaccination - resource pack for residential aged care, see below COVID -19 vaccination - Resource pack for residential aged care | Australian Government Department of Health COVID -19 Vaccine Co -admin istration advice ATAGI recommends that COVID -19 vaccines can be co -administered (i.e. given on the same day) with an influenza vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines can also be co -administered with other vaccines including routine childhood and adolescent vaccines if required, however, given the current limited evidence on the concomitant use of COVID -19 vaccines with other vaccines, providers need to balance the opportunistic need for co -administration with giving the vaccines on separate visits. There is the pote ntial for an increase in mild to moderate adverse events when more than one vaccine is given at the same time. Co -administration or near administration (e.g. within days) with another vaccine may also make the attribution of potential adverse events more c hallenging. The benefits of ensuring timely vaccination and maintaining high vaccine uptake outweigh any potential risks associated with immunogenicity, local adverse reactions or fever. Providers need to balance the opportunistic need for co -administrat ion with the benefits of giving the vaccines on separate visits. When giving a COVID -19 vaccine and another vaccine , the provider should administer each vaccine in opposite arms (right and left deltoid) . If this is not possible, separate the injections by 2.5cm as outlined in the Australian Immunisation Handbook . Vaccinating children aged 6 months to <5 years however, it is preferable t o separate administration of Moderna paediatric COVID -19 vaccine and other vaccines by 7 -14 days to minimise risk of adverse events such as fever. 118 OFFICIAL Prophylactic paracetamol to reduce risk of fever is not routinely recommended prior to or immediately after vaccination though, however can be given as required after for any discomfort or fever. For further advice on the Co -administration of COVID -19 vaccines and the seasonal influenza vaccine in 2022, please refer to Appendi x 23 Guidance on Co -administration of COVID -19 and Influenza Vaccines Useful resources: Commonwealth Department of Health resources - Getting vaccinated against influenza ATAGI advice on seasonal influenza vaccines in 2022 Clinical recommendations for COVID -19 vaccines - Timing of administration of other vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health . Clinical guidance on coadministration of MPX (Monkeypox ) vaccine s and COVID -19 vaccines ATAGI clinical guidance on vaccination against Monkeypox was originally released June 2022 . There are two vaccines available in Aust ralia for prevention of Monkeypox: the 3rd generation JYNNEOS\u00ae and the 2nd generation ACAM2000TM vaccine. JYNNEOS\u00ae is the preferred vaccine and limited supplies of it have been secured by the Commonwealth and some states and territories. ATAGI advises there is a rare risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis with both ACAM2000 TM and with mRNA COVID -19 vaccines, espec ially in people under 40 years of age and in males. This risk should be considered when deciding the timing of vaccination. It is considered safe to co -administer JYNNEOS\u00ae and ACAM2000 TM with mRNA Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) purposes only, a spacing of 4 weeks between an MPX vaccine (JYNNEOS\u00ae and ACAM2000 TM) and mRNA (Moderna or Pfizer) or Novavax COVID -19 vaccine s should be considered for people with increased risk of myocarditis and/or perica rditis . However, the decision to delay administration should be balanced against the need for earlier protection and the potential to miss an opportunity to vaccinate. For further information refer to - ATAGI clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox Mixed (heterologous) schedules ATAGI recommends that, if available, the same COVID -19 vaccine brand should be used for the tw o doses of the primary vaccination course. Third primary doses are currently only indicated for those who are severely immunocompromised . While it is preferable to use the same brand for all doses of the primary course, an alternative brand can be used for the second/third dose in select circumstances including if a pa tient is unable to access or not accepting of a second dose of the same brand . There is emerging data supporting the safety and efficacy of mixed brand schedules. 119 OFFICIAL Mixed dose schedules are also appropriate in the instance that a pregnant woman has received first dose of AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine prior to pregnancy and wants to complete this course with Pfizer COV ID-19 vaccine (see relevant section on pregnancy ).

This is consistent with A TAGI advice on the definition of fully vaccinated: ATAGI advice on the definition of fully vaccinated | Australian Government Department of Health This definition includes homologous (two doses of the same vaccine) and heterologous (two doses of different TGA-approved or recognised vaccines) schedules. The above referenced ATAGI document also provides vaccination recommendations for indivi duals returning from overseas travel and who have received: one dose of a TGA -approved or TGA -recognised vaccine only and will need to complete their primary vaccination course within Australia A first dose or a full course of a COVID -19 vaccine that is not TGA-approved or TGA -recognised . For further advice and vaccine recommendations please refer to: COVID -19 vaccination - Clinical advice on the use of a different COVID -19 vaccine as the se cond dose | Australian Government Department of Health . 120 OFFICIAL Even if an individual meets the definition of fully vaccinated for the purposes of international travel, they may not be considered 'up to date' with COVID -19 vaccinations in some states and territories. Therefore, international travellers are encouraged to access Australia's vaccination program to bring their vaccinations 'up to da te' Considerations for special cohorts Children aged 5 years of age As per ATAGI , all children aged 5 years and above are recommended for COVID -19 vaccination as per advice for children 5 -11 years . Five year old children can receive either Moderna 25 micrograms or Pfizer 10 micrograms COVID -19 vaccine. It is preferred to complete a primary vaccination schedule in children aged 5 years or older with the same brand of vaccine for both doses. Children w ho turn 6 years old between doses should receive the dose that is applicable to them on the day of vaccination. Providers should note that the dose of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine is the same for children aged 5 years and those aged 6 to 11 years. However, th e Moderna dose increases from 25 micrograms in 5 year old children (0.25ml of 100mcg/ml BLUE cap vial) to 50 micrograms for those aged 6 to 11 (0.25ml of 200mcg/ml RED cap vial) Pregnant , planning pregnancy or breastfeeding - COVID -19 vaccination considerations As per ATAGI mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) are the recommended COVID -19 vaccines for pregnant and breast -feeding women. This is based on the growing body of evidence supporting the safety of mRNA vaccines in pregnancy, wherea s there are still very limited data on the safety of the other COVID -19 vaccines (AstraZeneca and Novavax) in pregnancy. However, people who cannot access an mRNA vaccine can consider vaccination with AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID -19 vaccines if the benefit s to the individual outweigh the potential risks. Women who received their first dose of AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine and are pregnant can receive either Pfizer or Moderna or AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccines for their second dose, although Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccines are preferred. Pregnant women should speak with their health care provider about the best choice for them. Pregnant women with severe immunocompromise are recommended to receive a 3rd primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine. Women aged 16 years or older who are pregnant or breastfeeding , and had their primary course at least 3 months ago are recommended to receive a first booster dose . This includes sever ely immunocompromised people who had 3 doses as part of their primary course . Pfizer (for those 16 years and older) or Moderna (Moderna Spikevax or Moderna B ivalent) (for those who are 18 years and older) COVID vaccines are the preferred vaccines for the booster dose, regardless of the COVID -19 vaccine that was given for the primary course. Those considering a booster dose during pregnancy should speak to their health professional for consideration of whether to proceed with a booster dose. 121 OFFICIAL People aged 30 -49 years, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, may receive a second booster dose at any stage of pregnancy. Pregnant women and adolescents aged 16 years and older with a medical condition or disability that puts them at greater risk of severe COVID -19 should also receive the second booster dose . Pregnant women with no other medical conditions or disability below 30 years of age are not currently recommended to receive a 2nd booster dose based on the low likelihood of severe disease. COVID-19 vaccination may provide indirect protection to babies by transferring antibodies through the placenta (during pregnancy) or through breastmilk (during breastfeeding) . For more information, please see the COVID -19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for women who ar e pregnant, breastfeeding or planning pregnancy Please see the below statements from ATAGI and Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Obstetricians (RANZCOG) Joint statement between RANZCOG and ATAGI about COVID -19 vaccination for pregnant women | Australian Government Department of Health RANZCOG - COVID -19 Vaccination Information Individuals with previous COVID -19 infection The Commonwealth Government has released inf ormation regarding the timing for administration of a COVID - 19 vaccine after an infection with SARS -CoV-2, and is available from the following link: Clinical recommendations for COVID -19 vaccines | Austral ian Government Department of Health If a person tests positive to COVID -19 they should not receive a COVID -19 vaccine dose until they have recovered from the acute illness . There is no need to provide a negative PCR test or serology following an acute in fection, prior to vaccination. ATAGI have updated their advice on when people who have had SARS -CoV-2 infection should receive a subsequent COV ID-19 vaccine dose. It is now recommended that all people should wait for 3 months after confirmed SARS -CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID -19) infection before they receive their next COVID -19 vaccine dose (primary course, first booster dose or additional winter dose) . The next scheduled dose should be given as soon as possible after this period. Waiting for a 3 -month period after infection before COVID -19 vaccination is intended to optimise protection for that person. A longer gap between infection and va ccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection. This change in recommendation applies to all people who are recommended to receive COVID -19 vaccination (i.e., from 6 months and above), regardless of how many COVID -19 vaccine doses they have received. It does not apply to other vaccines (for example, influenza vaccinations) which can continue to be administered as usual. An infection with COVID -19 will provide some natural i mmunity, but it is recommended that vaccination should not be delayed beyond 4 -months after an acute infection, due to waning immunity. ATAGI recommends an additional winter booster dose for specific cohorts (see Additional winter booster dose section for eligibility) and can be given from 3 months or longer after the person has received th eir first booster 122 OFFICIAL dose, or after a confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection, if infection occurred since the person's first COVID -19 booster dose. Anti-SARS -CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies can be used for treatment in the setting of SARS -CoV-2 infection, or as pre or po st -exposure prophylaxis. When given following infection, ATAGI does not recommend a specific minimum time to defer vaccination due to monoclonal antibody therapy. However, people are still recommended to follow guidance to defer vaccination for 3 months f ollowing infection As with all vaccines, COVID -19 vaccination should be deferred in people who are acutely unwell (e.g., acute febrile or systemic illness). People with prolonged symptoms from COVID -19 beyond 3 months should be vaccinated on a case -by-case basis. Those who have had a PCR -confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection may be eligible for a temporar y exemption for vaccination for a maximum of 4 months. Rapid an tigen tests (that where possible have been reported to the relevant State or Territory reporting system) are now considered acceptable proof of infection for the purposes of a temporary medical exemption to delay vaccination. For further information on me dical exemptions see ATAGI Expanded Guidance on temporary medical exemptions for COVID -19 vaccines | Australian G overnment Department of Health Serological Testing for immunity Testing for anti -spike antibodies or neutralising antibodies to demonstrate immunity against SARS -CoV-2 in vaccinated individuals is not recommended. An immune correlate of protection has not yet been established for SARS -CoV-2 infection. Serological testing or other testing to detect current or previous infection with SARS -CoV-2 is neither necessary nor recommended before vaccination. Serolog y testing should not be used to determine the need for a third primary dose . Individuals requiring sedation On 6 April 2022 ATAGI released a statement on advice for use of sedation to assist in the safe administration of COVID -19 vaccines. See, ATAGI advice on use of sedation for COVID -19 vaccination In most cases, sedation should not be used as a first line option. Many individ uals with anxiety or behavioural disorders can be safely vaccinated in the community using non -pharmacological techniques, such as a low-sensory stimulation environment, presence of comfort person/object, distraction with music, video or toys, relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy (for anxiety/needle -phobia). Possible indications for sedation include people with severe anxiety or needle -phobia and developmental or behavioural disorders, where non -pharmacological measures to facilitate vacci nation have been exhausted. The choice of sedative agent and the degree of sedation required will need to be determined on a case -by-case basis. A tiered approach initially using non -pharmacological measures may assist in facilitating vaccination. In patie nts where non -pharmacological techniques have failed, sedation may facilitate safe administration of vaccines in some special circumstances. Informed consent must be obtained prior to each dose from the patient themselves, or, where the patient does not ha ve capacity to give consent, from the parent, guardian or substitute 123 OFFICIAL decision -maker. Sedation should not be used as a measure to enforce compliance with vaccination requirements. Individ uals 16 years and older who may require sedation for COVID -19 vaccinat ion Can be referred through the Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) pathway. To access the DLO pathway please email requests through to DLO@coordinator@dhhs.vic.gov.au and complete the online request for Disability Liaison Officer Support Form Other Cohorts Please refer to the below guidance and shared decision -maki ng resources in relation to certain cohorts at higher risk of disease .

Contraindications to Pfizer or Moderna COVID vaccines are: A contraindication to one mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should be considered a contraindication to other COVID -19 vaccines made with that vaccine platform. For example, a person who is contraindicated for Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine would also be contraindicated for Moderna COVID -19 vaccine . Contraindications M oderna COVID -19 vaccines are: anaphylaxis to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) any other serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of P fizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccines (and without another cause identified) that has been reported to state adverse event reporting programs and/or the TGA, and has been determined following review by, and/or on the opinion of, an experienced immunisation pr ovider/medical specialist to be a contraindication to future doses, taking into account whether repeat vaccine doses would be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event. People who have myocarditis or pericarditis following Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccines may still be able to receive further doses following a risk assessment. Please refer to ATAGI guidance for further details. Contraindications to the Novavax COVID -19 vaccine are: Anaphylaxis after a previous dose 125 OFFICIAL Anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polysorbate 80 Any other serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of Novavax COVID -19 vaccine (and without another cause identified) that has been reported to state adverse event reporting programs and/or the TGA, and has been determined followi ng review by, and/or in the opinion of, an experienced immunisation provider/medical specialist to be a contraindication to future doses, taking into account whether repeat vaccine doses would be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event. Consultation with a specialist is required to assess for potential vaccine -induced adverse events and to inform future vaccination options. Suitable specialists include immunologists or immunisation specialist services such as the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Services (VicSIS).

Providers can consider extending the interval between 2 primary doses of Novavax to 8 weeks (from a minimum of 3 weeks) to potentially improve effectiveness and reduce any potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis. For further information see individual product information for each vaccine: Product Information* Spikevax (Moderna) elasomeran Product Information Nuvaxovid (Novavax) Product Information Thrombosis with Th rombocytopaenia Syndrome (TTS) A link has been established between the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine and a rare but serious side effect - thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS). TTS can cause long -term disability and death. TTS involves blood clotting (thrombosis) combined with low platelets (thrombocytopenia). The risk of TTS appears to be higher in younger people, hence ATAGI advises an alternative to AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine is preferred for people under 60 years of age. People aged under 60 years can still receive the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine if the benefits outweigh the risks and they provide informed consent. ATAGI statement on revised recommendations on the use of COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, 17 June 2021 | Australian Government Department of Health COVID -19 vaccination - Weighing up the potential benefits against risk of harm from COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZenec a | Australian Government Department of Health When to suspect TTS Consider TTS in a patient who has received AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine 4-42 days prior to presentation, and: 1. has signs or symptoms of thrombosis (see below for manifestations) or 126 OFFICIAL 2. has signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, e.g. petechiae, noting platelet count may be normal in early stages . Possible presentations of thrombosis in TTS include cerebral venous sin us thrombosis (CVST) TTS symptoms and signs TTS can present variabl y. Signs and symptoms to look out for can be seen below . Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) : Headaches related to a CVST diagnosis have been described as starting any time following AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine , and may initially respond to simple analgesia (e.g. paracetamol or ibuprofen). What makes them different to the common, expected headache is that they are persistent beyond 48 hours or appear later than 48 hours after vaccination, and they may progress t o have some unusual features, such as: o Signs or symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (e.g. headache worse when supine or associated with nausea and vomiting) o Neurological deficit (e.g. blurred vision, dysarthria, altered mental status or seizures) Abdominal (splanchnic) : Variable presentation and can be asymptomatic. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom, accompanying symptoms may include gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea or constipation, or fever. DVT: Lower limb pain, redness or swelling PE: Sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath Arterial ischaemia : Limb coldness or pallor, of myocardial ischaemia or stroke Thrombocytopenia : Petechiae, purpura, acute onset bleeding (e.g. nose, gums). To assist in screening and diagnosis o f TTS please refer to the below resources: Primary care approach to thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after -19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) | Australian Government Department of Health TTS can be treated effectively. Guidance on the identification and managemen t of TTS is available from the Thrombosis and Haemostasis Society of Australia and New Zealand Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocyt openia (ITP) In Australia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been reported in less than one in every 100,000 people following the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine. In many cases ITP is mild with up to a third of people having no symptoms at all, or only minor bruising. However, about 5% develop severe bleeding. We encourage people to seek medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms that could suggest ITP, such as unusual skin bruising or clusters of small red or purple spots that do not lose their colour when pressed. Unusu al bleeding is another sign, for example bleeding from the nose or mouth that is hard to stop, or blood in the urine or stools. For more information and up to date reports on suspected ITP post COVID -19 vaccination, please review COVID -19 vaccine weekly safety report | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) 127 OFFICIAL MVEC - Immune (Idiopathic) Thrombocytopenia People who develop immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) within 42 days after receiving AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine should consult a haematologist whether to proceed with the second dose using the same or an alternative vacci ne, and the timing of the second dose. For further information see COVID -19 vaccination - ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID -19 vaccine in Australia in 2021 | Australian Government Department of Health Myocarditis and Pericarditis The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation ( ATAGI) highlights that the benefits of COVID -19 vaccination outweigh the rare risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. COVID -19 Vaccination continues to provide protection against severe disease and risk of hospitalisation. mRNA vaccines ATAGI reports a small increased risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in people vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccines, compared with unvaccinated people. This risk is higher with Moderna than with Pfizer COVID -19 vaccines. There is no evidence that the severity of the myocarditis and pericarditis cases differs when comparing Moderna and Pfizer Myocarditis is more commonly reported after the second dose in males under 40 years, however these conditions can occur in any gender, and after any dose , including a third or fourth dose Non mRNA vaccines AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine may also be associated with a small increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, though this risk appears lower than with Moderna or Pfizer COVID -19 vaccines. Myocarditis and/or pericarditis can occur after Novavax . Providers are recommended to extend the interval for the primary schedule to 8 weeks between dose one and two for Novavax For further details and rates of myocarditis/pericarditis post mRNA COVID -19 vaccination refer to Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID -19 vaccines TGA - COVID -19 vaccine weekly safety reports Precautions People with a history of any of the following conditions can receive a COVID -19 vaccine but should consult a GP (General Practitioner), immunisation specialist service or cardiologist about the best timing of vaccination and whether any additional precauti ons are recommended: 3. Recent (i.e., within the last 3 months) myocarditis or pericarditis 4. Acute rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease (i.e., with evidence of active inflammation) 5. Acute decompensated heart failure Pfizer and Moderna COVID -19 va ccines continue to be recommended as per latest COVID -19 vaccine adverse events | Australian Government Department of Health for people with a history of most chronic cardiovascular conditions and can be given to people in the following groups without any specific precautions: Coronary artery disease Myocardial infarction Stable heart failure 128 OFFICIAL Arrhythmias Prior history of r heumatic heart disease Kawasaki Disease Congenital heart disease An implantable cardiac device Cardiomyopathy Cardiac transplant recipients Myocarditis and/or pericarditis occur very rarely in younger people aged 11 years or younger. At present there is no clear attributable risk of myocarditis an/or pericarditis from the COVID -19 vaccines in this age group Vaccination ATAGI's i nterval recommendations to potentially reduce risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis: - Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax: 8 week interval between dose one and dose two (particularly for males aged 12 to 39 years) - AstraZeneca: 12 week interval between dose one and dose t wo If people are moderately to severely immunocompromised, at risk of severe disease or aged 65yrs and over: - A shorter interval between first and second dose is acceptable Pfizer and Novavax - down to 3 weeks Moderna and Astrazeneca - down to 4 weeks Symptoms Symptoms of myocarditis/pericarditis generally, appear within 1 -5 days of vaccination . The majority of cases myocarditis reported after COVID -19 vaccines have occurred within 1 -5 days (median 2 days) . Symptoms include those in the table below and individuals with these symptoms in the days post vaccination should seek urgent medical care. 129 OFFICIAL Myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination can present with atypical features such as absence of chest pain or presence of abdominal pain or other non -specific symptoms. It is important to consider myocarditis in the differential diagnosis if som eone presents with ongoing non -specific symptoms in the 1 -2 weeks following a COVID -19 vaccine. Chest pain is less common in children and adolescents. Younger people with myocarditis and pericarditis may present with symptoms that are non -specific. Investigation and Management Guidance on assessment of children or adolescents presenting with chest pain following an COVID -19 vaccine is available at: www.predict.org.au/mrna -chest -pain-guideline/ Initial investigations can be performed in primary care if: - Patient is not acutely unwell and has mild symptoms - Referring practice can obtain and review all results of initial investigations within 12 hours Patients with significant clinical suspicion of myocarditis and/or pericarditis should be immediately referred to ED. Treatment is determined on a case -by-case basis and often supportive treatment is all that is required. After a diagnosis of myocardit is and/or pericarditis, cardiology follow up will be required for at least 12 months. Future vaccine dose recommendations For people who have had confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis attributed to a COVID -19 vaccine, further doses should be consider ed on a case -by-case basis with a cardiologist or specialist immunisation service, and usually deferred until they have been symptom -free for at least 6 weeks Refer to COVID -19 vaccination - Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID -19 vaccines | Australian Government Department of Health MVEC - Myocarditis and Pericarditis Other pharmacotherapy associated with myocarditis Some patients will be taking prescribed medications that have myocarditis listed as an uncommon side effect (e.g., antipsychotic drugs and biological chemotherapeutic agents). Treatment with these medications does 130 OFFICIAL not constitute a contraindication to vaccination with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. Vaccination is the greatest protection an individual can have against severe COVID -19 disease, and mRNA vaccines remain the preferred option in Australia for those under the age of 60. Cloza pine is an antipsychotic drug used in patients with treatment -resistant schizophrenia. If a patient develops myocarditis in close proximity to the initiation of clozapine, this may preclude its use for the patient in the future. Clozapine -induced myocardit is tends to present early after commencement, generally within the first 2 - 8 weeks of therapy. Therefore, given the small increased risk of myocarditis after COVID -19 mRNA vaccination it is recommended that clozapine is not commenced within 21 days of an mRNA vaccine, to avoid uncertainty about the precipitant of the myocarditis diagnosis. For clinical considerations for clozapine myocarditis refer to Clozapine - induced Myoca rditis - Monitoring Protocol . If clinicians are aware that an individual uses recreational sti mulant, they should discourage patients from the use of these stimulants, especially in the week following their mRNA COVID -19 vaccine.

Chest Pain Guideline - PREDICT Guillain -Barre Synd rome (GBS) There is growing evidence of a possible link between GBS and the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine following rigorous investigations of safety data by the TGA and other international regulators. In response to rare cases following vaccination, warning statements about GBS have been added to the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine. Please see the Product Information for more detail. Current data on GBS associated with AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine can be found at: COVID -19 vaccine weekly safety report | Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) MVEC - Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) We encourage people to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms that could suggest GBS. This includes weakness and paralysis in the hands or feet that can progress to the chest and face over a few days or weeks. Capill ary Leak Syndrome Cases of capillary leak syndrome following immunisation with the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine have been reported overseas. As a precautionary measure, the sponsor of the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine has included a warning in the Product I nformation about capillary leak syndrome and specifically advise that the vaccine should not be used in people who have a history of this condition . 131 OFFICIAL Patients with a past history of capillary leak syndrome should therefore not be vaccinated with the AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine and an alternate vaccine can be considered . COVID -19 vaccine adverse events | Australian Government Department of Health Paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia The potential adverse events paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia have been added to the Product information for the Astra zeneca COVID -19 vaccine under adverse effects. Paraesthesia is an unusual feeling in the skin, such as tingling or a crawling sensation, and hypoaesthesia is a decreased feeling or numbness. These ad verse events have also been reported for other COVID -19 vaccines. It is not known why they sometimes occur after vaccination, but it is thought they may be a stress -related response to immunisation rather than an immune reaction. Symptoms are usually mild, however, if they persist, people should seek medical attention. Transverse myelitis A warning about transverse myelitis has been included in the P roduct Information for AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine under sections 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 4.8. This follows a review by the European Medicines Age ncy's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee(link is external) which concluded there is a reasonable possibility of a causal link to the vaccine. Transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder of the spinal cord caused by inflammation and has been rep orted very rarely following vaccination. It has multiple causes including infection, in particular viral infection, and underlying demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. However, transverse myelitis can present with no known cause and this occur s at a background rate of 1 -4 people per million in the general population. Transverse myelitis develops quickly over hours to days and worsens over weeks. Symptoms include burning, tingling or numbness that starts in the feet, muscle weakness in the arms and legs and, in some cases, problems with bladder or bowel control. These effects can be long -lasting. Health professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms to ensure early diagnosis, supportive care and appropriate treatment, and to rule out other causes. Vaccin e errors Immunisation errors can include errors in vaccine storage, handling, preparation or administration.

ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID -19 vaccine administration errors | Australian Government Department of Health If a COVID -19 vaccination administration occurs, we recommend the site follows their health service's existing incident reporting, management, and improvement processes . Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA) SIRVA is a rare complication of suspected incorrect vaccine administration into the shoulder and not into the correct site of the deltoid muscle. T his can cause a local inflammatory response and damage to local structures within the shoulder joint (e.g. ligaments, tendons) resulting in shoulder pain and a limited range of movement. The onset of s ymptoms of SIRVA usually occurs within the first 24-48 hours after vaccination . SIRVA can be an extremely painful condition. The pain and limited range of movement can impact a person's ability to perform work, sporting activities and basic activities of daily living. Symptoms can last for days, w eeks, months or years. Following investigation, many affected individuals are diagnosed with bursitis, impingement syndrome or ligament tears. The Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) developed an education module on correct vaccination technique and the prevention of SIRVA : MVEC module: Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration (SIRVA) and all vaccine providers are recommended to complete this module. To prevent SIRVA, vaccine providers must know : understanding the surrounding structures and how to identify the correct injection site using the anatomical landmarks . the correct positioning of the vaccinee for safe vaccination. the correct vaccination technique and needle length for the vaccine being administered and the age of the vaccinee Useful resources For information on route of administration, preparing the person receiving the vaccine , positioning for vaccination , vaccine injection techniques, identifyin g the injection site, and recommended needle size, length and angle, see the Australian Immunisation Handbook - Section on administering vaccines Avoiding shoulder injury related to vaccine administration MVEC administration technique 133 OFFICIAL Safety considerations during administration of vaccines Images below are taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook: Avoiding shoulder injury related to vaccine administration - This printable PDF can be printed and displayed as a reminder to vaccine providers and included in educational material for clinical staff.

Choose the correct needle length For the recommended needle length, see table below from the Australian Immunisation Handbook . Expose the entire upper arm Find the correct injection site The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in individuals 12 months of age. 134 OFFICIAL Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid injection site Older children and adults can also receive vaccines in the anterolateral thigh and ventrogluteal area if the deltoid muscle is not suitable by suitably trained vaccine providers . Refer to the links below to see the alternative injection sites: Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection site on the anterolateral thigh. Anatomical markers used to identify the ventrogluteal injection sit e Position the individual encouraging them to relax the muscle ( Asking the patient to place their hand on their thigh when sitting can help to relax the deltoid muscle - see the Australian Immunisation Handbook Administration of vaccines for positioning for children and infants). If the skin is visibly clean, there is no need to wipe it with an antiseptic (such as an alcohol wipe). If you use alcohol or other disinfecting agents to clean skin that is visibly dirty, the skin must be allowed to dry before injecting the vaccine. This prevents inactivation of live vaccines and reduces the likelihood of irritation at the injection sit 135 OFFICIAL Insert the needle 90 degrees to the skin to the needle hub . Inject the vaccine as per the Australian Immunisation Handbook and dispose of sharps appropriately Cover the injection site with a bandaid / gauze if required / requested Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) - Reporting and Management COVID -19 vaccination providers should reasonably anticipate three medical emergencies associated with vaccination: fainting, hyperventilation, and anaphylaxis. All clinical staff should have up to date CPR training and immuniser training in managing anaphylaxis response. Steps for managing an adverse event following immunisation An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is an unwanted or unexpe cted event following the administration of a vaccine(s). AEFIs may be caused by a vaccine(s) or may occur by coincidence (that is, the event would have occurred regardless of vaccination). AEFIs also include conditions that may occur following the incorrec t handling or administration of a vaccine. The following documents contain official general advice on managing medical emergencies associated with vaccination: Recognising and treating anaphylaxis19 Managing | The Australian Immunisation Handbook (health.gov.au) Anaphylaxis Clinical Care Standard developed by Safer Care Victoria Appendix 6 - Guidance for differentiating anaphylaxis from acute stress response for vaccine providers and emergency departments MVEC resources and video on Allergy and COVID -19 vaccines Fainting and syncopal seizures There may be variations in the frequency and type of adverse events following immunisation for children aged 5 years and above compared to children aged 11 years and above . Anxiety/pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. An Australian study20 showed the occurrence of syncope and seizures following vaccination administrating is higher in children and adolescents compared to adults. While most cases o f fainting and syncopal seizures are not serious, some children may sustain injury from high impact falls, so it is important to have a safe vaccinating environment and an awareness of the clinical signs of a faint/syncope. Reporting an immediate AEFI (at place of vaccination) Clinics using CVMS Record all medically attended AEFI in CVMS as an adverse event report - Report will automatically be forwarded to SAEFVIC Medically attended events are defined as medical assistance from the onsite clinician, paramedic attendance or transfer to an emergency department or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious , IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Clinics not using CVMS All medically attended AEFI to be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au or by using the QR code Medically attended events are defined as medical assistance from the onsite clinician, param edic attendance or transfer to an emergency department or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below 20 Syncope and seizures following human papillomavirus vaccination: a retrospective case series | The Medical Journal of Austral ia (mja.com.au) 137 OFFICIAL Serious or unexpected AEFI Serious or unexpected AEFI require urgent direct notification in addition to routine reporting via CVMS or online SAEFVIC form. Reporting a delayed AEFI (outside place of vaccination) Vaccinees are advised to seek medical attention from their local general practitioner or emergency department should a d elayed AEFI occur. Following medical attention, clinicians should report an AEFI to SAEFVIC via usual practices either online www.saefvic.org.au or by phone call (as above). Vaccinees may also choose to report directly via the Victorian Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 or the National Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 020 080 or to SAEFVIC. Vaccinees can find more information online at https://saefvic.online/report or by using the QR code. Please refer to Appendix 7 - Factsheet - Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) for a factsheet that can be printed out and displayed for COVID -19 vaccin ation site staff to easily locate contact information. Managing anaphylaxis and other serious AEFI Serious AEFI such as anaphylaxis is a rare adverse event that can occur after administration of a COVID -19 vaccine. The current incidence of anaphylaxis to a COVID -19 vaccine is estimated internationally to be 7.91 cases per million vaccinations. A component of the ATAGI Site Requirements for COVID -19 vaccination providers is the ability to monitor, manage and report AEFIs and to have incident management measu res in place (and documented), ensuring staff are fully informed of any relevant procedures and able to report any clinical incident. Vaccination sites also have a duty of care to respond to other medical emergencies that may occur on site. a. Vaccination p roviders and sites are being asked to review their AEFI management and response plans as required. Vaccination providers should consider the below for each vaccination site: b. All staff working at the vaccination site should be trained on this procedure incl uding their points of escalation in the case of a medical emergency. c. Vaccination sites (including all spoke sites) that refer to a standard emergency response procedure should clearly document how their emergency response applies at their vaccination site (e.g. when a MET call or Code Blue activation is not possible). d. Anaphylaxis kits must be available onsite where the vaccination program is occurring. e. An experienced clinician, who is trained and authorised to possess and administer adrenaline, must be available on site and able to respond in the case of anaphylaxis following vaccine administration. f. Anaphylaxis training is recommended for all staff administering the COVID -19 vaccination. The recommended training is the Australian Society of Clinical Immunolo gy and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e-Learning for Health Professionals. g. AEFI involving adrenaline administration, defibrillator use, transfer to hospital care, life -threatening AEFI, or death, require IMMEDIATE notification 138 OFFICIAL If vaccination providers have any concerns regarding management and escalation procedures associated with AEFIs, they should contact their performance and monitoring manager.

All COVID -19 vaccines approved in Australia are safe and most people should be able to be vaccinated without needing a referral to a specialist i mmunisation service, regardless of underlying comorbidities and this should be discussed with their treating GP and subspecialist as required. A list of FAQs can be found here. 140 OFFICIAL VicSIS is comprised of four adult and five paediatric COVID -19 Specialist Immunisation Clinic s. Our current adult VicSIS clinics are located at Monash Health, Austin Health . Barwon Health and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and our current paediatric VicSIS clinics are located at Royal Children's Hospital, Austin Health, Barwon Health, Monash Health and Western Health. Appointments may be via telehealth or face to face. Which patients are eligible for referral to a VicSIS clinic? Patients who experience a significant AEFI * following a dose of a COVID -19 vaccine should be reported to SAEFVIC and referred to a VicSIS clinic for further assessment . Please ensure that management of serious medical issues are not delayed pending a VICSIS appointment . Referral criteria : 1. Significant AEFI* post dose of a COVID -19 vaccine e.g. anaphylaxis 2. Anaphylaxis or immediate generalised allergic reaction (without anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID -19 vaccine to be administered or a history of multiple allergic reactions to othe r medications containing PEG e.g. in Pfizer (Comirnaty) or polysorbate in Astrazeneca (Vaxzevria) 3. Mastocytosis with recurrent anaphylaxis that requires treatment 4. Recent (i.e within the past 3 months) inflammatory cardiac illness (e.g. myocarditis), acute rheumatic fever or acute rheumatic heart disease (i.e. with active myocardial inflammation) or acute decompensated heart failure . Please see ATAGI guidance on Myocardits and Pericarditis here. 5. Previous s ignificant adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) * 6. Severe needle phobia (only for PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS < 16 years old) - Please note that all avenues for addressing needle phobia should be exhausted before referral to VicSIS. Please see MVEC strategies for m anaging needle -phobia for more information. *An AEFI is considered significant if it is life -threatening, requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, deemed clinically significant, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage Patient s with other types of allergy (i.e. to other vaccines or medications, food, latex or venom allergies) do not require a VicSIS referral - vaccination can be administered safely at a routine vaccination centre. Information on COVID -19 Vaccines and allergy can be found on the ASCIA website linked here and the COVID - 19 vaccine FAQs . To help guide clinician decision making around referrals, please ref er to the following: Appendix 9 - Clinician referral guide to the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Services (VicSIS) VicSIS Webpage The MVEC FAQs can be found here. 141 OFFICIAL How to refer to a specialist immunisation service All referrals to specialist immunisation clinics must be submitt ed using the VicSIS eR eferral portal . All information regarding t his can be found on the VicSIS page of the MVEC website linked here. All referrals must be made by a Medical Practitioner , with mandatory fields completed , including a SA EFVIC number for those who have experienced an AEFI .

Temperature data loggers are small electronic devices that measure temperatures at preset time intervals and record the results over a period of time. Data loggers should be set to record temperatures at 5 -minute intervals. Each logger is a self -contained miniature computer. Data loggers come in a range of shapes and sizes. Once programmed using a computer, loggers are disconnected from the computer and placed in the vaccine refrigerator near the temperature probe or vaccines. The logger then operates indep endently on its own battery until the recording is downloaded to the computer. Some purpose -built vaccine refrigerators have an inbuilt data logger. Information from the data logger should be downloaded at least weekly (or more frequently if recommended b y the manufacturer), reviewed and digitally stored. Advances in technology are producing more features in data loggers; the information in this section refers to basic models. What information do data loggers provide? Data loggers provide an accurate in dication of vaccine refrigerator temperatures and can be used to map 'cold spots' or investigate problems. Loggers use a similar measuring principle to chart recorders; however, they record the data electronically. The data can be stored by the monitoring system and can also be downloaded to a computer. The objective of data logging is to build up a 'temperature map' for the refrigerator (see Section 5.4 'Stabilising the vaccine refrigerator temperature'), to identify which areas are safe for vaccine stora ge. In particular, it is important to identify areas where vaccines could freeze. Twice -daily minimum and maximum temperatures must still be manually recorded as a timely alert to any breach in the cold chain. If a data logger is used for routine temperatu re monitoring (instead of a minimum/maximum thermometer), it must have a visual display of minimum/maximum temperatures to allow twice -daily real -time readings to be viewed and manually recorded. Many data loggers can be programmed to alarm when a tempera ture outside the 2 to 8C range is recorded. Using a data logger The data logger and the minimum/maximum thermometer should be co -located in the refrigerator; otherwise, different recordings can occur. If the data logger and probe have a fixed position in the refrigerator and cannot be moved, the vaccines should be stored as close as practicable to the probe. The results from the data logger can be printed in graph and numerical formats, including times that the temperature was recorded outside the 2 to 8\u00b0C range, and the minimum and maximum temperatures. All staff should be trained in how to operate and manage the data logger and interpret its readings. Data logging will help immunisation service providers to get to know their refrigerator (see National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 , Section 5.4 'Stabilising the vaccine refrigerator temperature'). Any actions 146 OFFICIAL taken in response to d ata logging should be documented and retained according to state or territory health department policy or medico -legal requirements. Continuous logging All vaccine refrigerators should have a permanent data logger in place to continuously measure the refrigerator temperature at preset 5 -minute intervals. The data should be downloaded at least weekly, in addition to twice -daily minimum/maximum recordings. The data logger can be a portable digital data logger or may be built into the refrigerator. Benefits of continuous temperature monitoring Continuous temperature monitoring: provides information on the duration of a cold chain breach and supplements a cold chain audit confirms that the cold chain has been maintained and provides accurate knowledge of the vaccine refrigerator temperature identifies times when there is a risk of vaccines freezing (0C or below) \u2014 for example, overnight, long weekends and when the refrigerator is not in use assists staff to understand the functioning of the refrigera tor identifies temperature fluctuations between the refrigerator shelves and the location of any cold spots on each shelf supports accreditation documentation and audits helps to assess the refrigerator thermometer's accuracy. Points to consider when purchasing a data logger Review National vaccine storage guidelines - Strive for 5, 3rd edition pg 24 https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/national -vaccine -storage -guidelines -strive -for-5 147 OFFICIAL Checklist for data loggers 1. Place the data logger where it is easily seen and in the middle of the vaccines. 2. Measure the current, minimum and maximum temperatures twice daily, and record them. 3. Set the alarm system to alarm outside the 2 to 8C range. Check that the alarm is wo rking. 4. Train all staff to recognise the alarm and download information from the data logger. 5. Download and record information as soon as possible after an alarm is activated. 6. If recordings are outside the 2 to 8C range, follow the cold chain breach protoco l (see the National Vaccine Storage Guidelines - Strive for 5 , Appendix 3) and notify the relevant state or territory health department. See contact details on the last page of these guidelines. 7. Regularly check and record the accuracy of the data logger. Record the date the accuracy check is done. To check the accuracy, place a second data logger in the refri gerator next to the existing data logger to obtain comparison temperature readings. Inbuilt data loggers should be checked for accuracy according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 8. Change the battery according to the manufacturer's recommendation, or when the battery life displayed on either the data logger or computer set -up screen is low. Record the date the battery is changed. Life of the replaceable battery may be dependent on usage (e.g. how frequently the tempera ture is recorded and data are downloaded) 148 OFFICIAL Appendix 3: Cold chain management checklists Receipt of vaccines on delivery Step What to do Complete 1 Vaccines must be received by immunisation staff who are educated in cold chain management. 2 Sign the delivery docket and return it to the courier. 3 Check the temperature monitoring device. 4 Check that the vaccine consignment matches the delivery invoice. 5 Place the vaccines in a purpose -built vaccine fridge with a data logger and minimise the time that the vaccine fridge door is open. 6 Rotate vaccines so that the stock with the earliest indication for use is used first. 7 Do not remove vaccines from their packets - this protects them from light and temperature fluctuation. 8 Document vaccine delivery and record and reset fridge temperatures 149 OFFICIAL Mobile or outreach immunisation clinics, or emergency storage of vaccines Step What to do Complete 1 Remove ice packs/gel packs from the freezer: Place the number of packs you require for your cooler on the bench to 'sweat' (see Strive for 5 Section 9.2 for information about conditioning ice packs/gel packs). <https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/national -vaccine - storage -guidelines -strive -for-5> Place the ice packs/gel packs in your cooler to chill the inside of the cooler. 2 Remove the ice packs/gel packs from the cooler and place insulating material (bubble -wrap or polystyrene chips) in the bottom of the cooler. 3 Reset the minimum/maximum thermometer and insert the thermometer probe inside an empty vaccine box with the product information intact. 4 Make sure the mi nimum/maximum temperature is between 2C and 8C at the time the vaccines are placed in the cooler. 5 Place the data logger next to the thermometer probe 6 YOU ARE NOW READY TO MOVE YOUR VACCINES INTO THE COOLER. Place the vaccine stock in the cooler with the box containing the thermometer probe and the data logger in the centre. Note: All vaccines should remain in their original packaging until they are administered or returned to a purpose -built vaccine refrigera tor \u2014 this prevents damage from exposure to light and ambient temperature. Surround the vaccines with packing material and place conditioned ice packs/gel packs on the top before closing the cooler. Ensure that vaccine stock is not in direct contact with t he ice packs/gel packs, to minimise risk of freezing. Close the cooler lid and fix the digital thermometer display to the outside of the cooler. Keep the cooler out of direct sunlight. 7 Record the date, time, and minimum and maximum temperatures on the temperature chart. Then record temperatures at the following times: every 15 minutes for the first hour hourly thereafter, provided the temperatures are stable. Reset the min/max temperature after every reading 150 OFFICIAL Note: See Appendix 1 below - Vaccine temperature monitoring form. Freezing vaccines occurs most commonly in the first 2 hours of storage in a cooler. 8 Ensure that ice packs/gel packs do not become displaced and have direct contact with vaccines \u2014 this may freeze the vacci nes and render them unviable. Remove vaccines from the cooler only as they are required. 9 Download the data logger on return to base. Any cold chain breach vaccines of >5 vials must be isolated in the fridge and advice sought from the VOC on 1800 318 208. 10 Only move vaccines back to a purpose -built vaccine refrigerator in which the tempera ture is between 2C and 8C. 11 Protect vaccines from light exposure by keeping them in their vaccine packaging.

Appendix 5: Training Certificate Victorian COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competencies The Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment is to verify that every emergency authorised worker (under a Public Health Emergency Order) is deemed clinically skilled and competent to possess, prepare and/or administer COVID -19 vaccines. This checklist and training certificate must be completed and issued by an appropriately experienced and qualified authorised worker (for example a pharmacist could oversee the vaccine preparation skills and competencies of a pharmacy technician, or an experienced nurse immuniser could oversee the vaccine administration skills and competencies of a registered nurse). All other pre -requisite training (including the Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination Training Program, Victorian COVID -19 eLearning Competency and Victorian COVID -19 AstraZeneca Supplementary eLearning) must be completed before the COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment. There are three parts to this Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment: Part 1: Practical training (some workforces) Some workforces authorised under Public Health Emergency Orders have lower baseline level of skills and competency in vaccination and will require additional training to address knowledge and practical training gaps. Part 2: Skills and competency assessment This is a requirement for all emergency authorised vaccination workforces. It is only required to be completed once and a copy must be made available to the emergency authorised worker as evidence of their clinical competency in Vic toria, available to use across all Victorian health services. To minimise the risk of misplacement and loss, where possible, the worker and employer should keep a digital copy of the assessment when completed. Workers who are authorised to prepare the vaccine only (not administer) must demonstrate competence in vaccine preparation only. Part 3: Competency for vaccination of children aged 5-11 years Vaccinating children 5 -11 years requires a different skillset to vaccinating adults and a dolescents . Any emergency authorised workforce administering the vaccine to children less than 12 years of age must also complete a clinical skills and competency assessment specific to this age group (Part 3).

Appendix 6: Guidance - differentiating anaphylaxis from acute stress response for vaccine providers and emergency departments For immunisers in primary care and vaccine hubs and clinicians in emergency departments Anaphylaxis can be a life -threatening condition. The mainstay of management is adrenaline. There are no contraindications for the us e of intramuscular adrenaline in the setting of anaphylaxis. There are however a number of conditions that can mimic anaphylaxis, such as vagal reactions, anxiety and vocal cord dysfunct ion. While it can be difficult to distinguish at times between these three conditions, if you suspect anaphylaxis, follow appropriate guidelines from your workplace and transfer to hospital. If there is uncertainty around diagnosis, treatment of anaphylaxis should not be withheld. However, if adrenaline is administered, it is important to reassure the person receiving the adrenaline of the possibility of an alternate diagnosis, but that the adrenaline is being given as it is safe to do so. The possible diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be reassessed at later stage. An adrena line autoinjector (EpiPen) prescription is not required post discharge following a queried vaccine adverse reaction. To help confirm the possibility of anaphylaxis, a serum tryptase should be taken within 30 minutes to 2 hours after the onset of symptoms and 24 hours after symptoms have resolved. A serum tryptase assists in a retrospective review of the case, guides diagnosis and assists in reass uring the person regarding future vaccinations. Reporting adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) Clini cs using CVMS Record all medically attended AEFI in CVMS as an adverse event report - Report will automatically be forwarded to SAEFVIC Medically attended events are defined as a visit to general practitioner, emergency department, or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box (right) Clinics not using CVMS All medically attended AEFI to be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au or by using the QR code Medically attended events are defined as a visit to general practitioner, emergency department, or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box (right) Serious or unexpected AEFI Serious or unexpected AEFI require urgent direct notification in addition to routine reporting via CVMS or online SAEFVIC form. ACUTE STRESS RESPONSE ANAPHYLAXIS SIGN AND SYMPTOM Vasovagal reaction Generalised Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) ONSET (AFTER INJECTION) Before, few seconds to minutes after injection. May present after 5 mins if the individual stands suddenly Before, few seconds to minutes after injection A few seconds to minutes after injection and up to 2 hours post administration. Within 30 mins after injection most start within 15 mins. In rare cases in can be within 60 mins CLUSTERING* Can occur Can Occur Can Occur Uncommon SERUM TRYPTASE Not elevated Not elevated Not elevated Elevated SYSTEM NEUROLOGICAL AND OTHER SYMPTOMS Fainting sensation, dizziness, loss of consciousness in some cases or head spinning. Transient loss consciousness with good response to lying flat, with or without tonic -clonic seizure Fearfulness, sensation of dizziness, light headedness. Tingling around the lips, spasms in the hands, feet Fearfulness, sensation of dizziness, light headedness. Tingling around the lips, spasms in the hands, feet Uneasiness, restlessness, agitation, loss of consciousness, little response when supine or lying flat RESPIRATORY Normal to deep breaths, can be slow with a few seconds of apnoea in some cases. Fast and shallow, difficulty getting air in, Stridor and cough. Throat symptoms without objective signs of angioedema can predominate (sensation of lump in throat) Hypoxia does not occur Difficulty getting air in, Stridor and cough. Throat symptoms without objective signs of angioedem a can predominate (sensation of lump in throat) Hypoxia does not usually occur Audible wheeze without auscultation. Symptoms out of proportion to objective measures. Voice often quiet Respiratory difficulties, coughing, sneezing, wheezing, stridor. In severe cases respiratory arrest. Hypoxia can occur. NB: At times only one symptom may be present for each of the conditions. i.e. Anaphylaxis may have only hypotension without cutaneous or respirator y symptoms or a vasovagal may just present with loss of consciousnessCARDIOVASCULAR heart rate with or without transient in blood pressure Preserved carotid pulse Transient hypotension can occur heart rate, normal or systolic blood pressure Palpitations; Chest pain heart rate, normal or systolic blood pressure Palpitations heart rate, blood pressure , circulatory arrest SKIN Diaphoresis, clammy skin, pallor, sense of warmness over skin. Tingling around mouth and hands; Flushing over chest and face Tingling around mouth and hands; Flushing over chest and face Warm skin progressing to clammy and pallor, pruritus and urticaria, swelling of the face and tongue GASTROINTESTINAL Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps Nausea Rarely Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea (this can be pronounced with incontinence) TREATMENT Place client in a recumbent position and elevate legs above head; Ventilate the room well; Place cold, damp cloth on face; Give reassurance Place cold damp cloth on face; Give reassurance; Offer drink of water Give Reassurance. Offer drink of water or a warm drink As per anaphylaxis guidelines PREVENTION Do not vaccinate a standing person; Before vaccinating ask if the person tends to faint, if so ask patient to lie down. Ask person if they are prone to anxiety/stress episodes. If so, ask for measures which assist person; Do not vaccinate standing up Ask if person has a past history of VCD. If so ask which measures assist in managing condition. Ask if the person has had anaphylaxis to any vaccine components Appendix 7: Factsheet - Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) An Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) is any untoward medical occurrence that happens following administration of a vaccine. An AEFI can be coincidentally associated with the timing of immunisation without necessarily being c aused by the vaccine or immunisation process.

Cases of COVID -19 in patients with haematological malignancy have been associated with high c ase fatality ratios of up to 60 per cent [2-4]. In addition, COVID -19 positive cancer patients experience more rapid deterioration, have more concurrent infections, have higher rates of intensive care unit admission and need for mechanical ventilation [1, 5] . Australia has secured four COVID -19 vaccines based on different platforms [6]. They are the Pfizer - BioNTech (Pfizer) protein with adjuvant) vaccine. COVID -19 vaccination in patients with cancer Vaccination is an effective strategy to reduce risk and burden of infection in at -risk patients. However, in patients receiving treatment for malignancy, response to vaccination may be impaired due to patient, diseas e or treatment -related factors [7-13]. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Moderna vaccines do not contain live SARS -CoV-2 and as such do not pose a risk of infection to recipients. Although the initial clinical trials of vaccines against SARS -CoV-2 have excluded patients receiving anti -cancer therapies, there are now multiple published studies evaluating the use a nd safety of COVID -19 vaccines in patients with cancer. Immunogenicity of COVID -19 vaccines in patients with cancer is highly variable. Studies suggest high immune response rates in patients with solid organ malignancies with responses comparable to patien ts without cancer [14]. However, response rates are significantly lower in patients with haematological malignancy, in particular patients receiving active therapy with anti -CD20 antibody therapies [15, 16] . Overall, vaccination associated adverse event rates are lower in patients with cancer [16]. Based on available s tudies, recent reports and guidance provided by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) [7, 17 -25], the following broad princ iples for COVID -19 vaccination have been developed. Vaccination against COVID -19 is highly recommended. Guidance for clinicians: Vaccine type and response Patients with cancer are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality associated COVID -19 infection. Therefore, vaccination against COVID -19 is highly recommended. Carers and family members of patients with cancer are encouraged to keep up to date with their COVID - 19 vaccination. Vaccines available in Australia do not contain live SARS -CoV-2, therefore do not pose an infectious risk to patients. Vaccine choice, number of doses and timing of vaccination should be guided by the latest ATAGI advice, taking into account patient age, community outbreaks of COVID -19, risks for severe complications from COVID -19 infection and possible vaccine related adverse e vents. Immune response to COVID -19 vaccination will likely be negatively impacted by underlying disease or therapy and patients should be advised to continue general measures such as hand hygiene, physical 205distancing and mask wearing. Early investigation of respiratory symptoms for SARS -CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses remain vital to guide need for antiviral therapies. Adverse events Local adverse effect (e.g. pain) is the most common reported adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI). Fever is a less common adverse effect following vaccination. Persistent fever for more than 48 hours after vaccination (or fever in association with concerning symptoms (e.g. sweats, rigors) should prompt medical review and investigation for a cause including testing for COVID -19. A rare but serious adverse event, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome/vaccine -induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, has been linked with use of the AstraZeneca -Oxford vaccine. New or persistent symptoms such as severe headache un responsive to simple analgesia, beyond 3 days following vaccination should prompt medical review. A rare adverse event, myocarditis has been linked with the use of mRNA vaccines. Although rare, it is more likely to occur in the younger age groups. New symp toms such as chest pain within days of vaccination should prompt medical review. Radiation recall reactions have been noted in patients who have received radiotherapy prior to vaccination. These are usually mild. In addition to symptomatic management (ana lgesia and barrier creams), if this is suspected, please contact the treating radiation oncology team. A serious/severe immediate allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to a COVID -19 vaccine or known component (such as polyethylene glycol [PEG] or polysorba te) is a contraindication to vaccination. PEG and polysorbate are also components in some conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (see Table 2 below). Referral for specialised review via the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Service is recommended. Patients sh ould be assessed for whether they have subsequently tolerated other medications containing PEG or polysorbate before referral. Serious or unexpected AEFI Clinics using CVMS Record all medically attended AEFI in CVMS as an adverse event report - Report w ill automatically be forwarded to SAEFVIC Medically attended events are defined as a visit to general practitioner, emergency department, or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Clinics not using CVMS All medically attended AEFI to be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au or by using the QR code Medically attended events are defined as a visit to general pract itioner, emergency department, or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Serious or unexpected AEFI require urgent direct notification in addition to routine reporting via CVMS or online SAEFVIC form . 206 Timing of vaccination Where possible, commence vaccination prior to anticipated commencement of myelosuppressive, lymphodepleting therapy or targeted therapies taking into account the need for and timing of subsequent vaccine dose(s). Delaying or interrupting cancer treatment/ cycles to potentially improve responses to COVID -19 vaccination is not currently recommended. Where possible, avoid COVID -19 vaccination during anticipated periods of immune nadir (e.g. expected neutropenic nadir) or risk period for immune -related adverse event associated with the specific cancer therapy. Patients on dual checkpoint inhibitor therapy should discuss with their treating physician about the optimal timing of their COVID -19 vaccine in relation to their cancer therapy. If vaccinating during tre atment, it would be preferable to vaccinate during the 'off' week during the treatment cycle to avoid potential overlap of treatment -related and vaccine -related adverse events. Defer vaccination if severe neutropenia present (ANC < 0.5 x109/L) until antici pated recovery. Patients have been able to mount an immune response to vaccination 3 -6 months following autologous (as early as 2 months) and allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Patients could be vaccinated from 3 months following HCT. Use of inactivated vaccines has not been associated with flares of graft vs. host disease (GvHD) and patients with stable GvHD on therapy could be vaccinated for COVID -19. Anti-CD20 antibody therapy is likely to negatively impact response to vaccination. How ever, with significant risk posed by COVID -19 it would be reasonable to vaccinate during or within 6 -months of anti - CD20 with the understanding that protection maybe limited. Special considerations Where possible, avoid COVID -19 vaccination on the same d ay as intravenous immunoglobulin replacement to minimise confusion around any adverse events. Currently, COVID -19 vaccines can be co -administered with the seasonal influenza vaccine. They can also be co -administered with other vaccines if required. However , interval administration of vaccines reduces the potential overlap of local and systemic side effects. 207 If positron emission tomography (PET) scan is planned, discuss recommended timing of vaccination relative to PET scanning with their treating speciali st and ensure receipt of recent vaccination is highlighted/communicated to the PET imaging team. Patients who have thrombocytopenia or on oral anticoagulants may develop a haematoma at the injection site. To minimise risk, application of prolonged pressure at injection site recommended. Suitability of vaccination in patients receiving end of life care should be evaluated in line with their goals of treatment/care. Avoid vaccination in a body area where a patient is receiving or has received radiation therap y to (e.g. use contralateral upper limb). Safety and follow up Currently routine measurement of serological response to COVID -19 vaccination is not recommended as there is no established cut -off value which correlates with protection/response. Consider enrolling patient in available immunogenicity studies. Any suspec ted adverse event following immunisation should be reported to SAEFVIC , the state vaccine safety team based at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), Parkville.

What does it do? The staff attestation and visitor register tool (SAVR) is an electronic app that rapidly screens for COVID 19 symptoms and records the details of any visitor or staff member prior to entering a Victorian health facility. SAVR is designed to assist with the contact tracing of visitors when indicated, and provide a record of daily staff attestation. The app asks a set of questions to ascertain if visitors to a health facility present a risk of COVID -19 transmission. If there are no risks, a green tick is pro vided to the visitor or staff member, for display as they enter the building. If risk factors are present, a red cross will appear. The user will be instructed not to travel to or enter the facility. Why do staff have to attest I am symptom free every day ? The daily attestation process reinforces that staff must remain at home and not work if they are unwell or have any symptoms of coronavirus (COVID -19). The measures are intended to help create a work environment where staff can feel confident to not att end work at the very earliest of symptoms, even if they seem minor. A process of daily attestation is also required under the Workplace (Additional Industry Obligations) Direction No 17. How is the screening tool accessed? Is it an app on my smartphone? The screening tool is a secure web form. It requires an internet connection and can be accessed via personal computer, a smartphone or tablet. Where is it hosted? At my healthcare facility, or somewhere else? Victoria's Department of Health hosts, suppo rts and maintains the app. How can I be sure the data is secure? The application applies the highest data security levels to ensure data protection. After 28 days the data will be securely destroyed. Who can use the tool? The tool is available to Victo rian health services. 210Is this screening tool mandated by the department, or can I pick another tool or vendor? The screening tool is not mandated for use by the department. 2 OFFICIAL Will the tool link to rostering or other existing health organisation systems? The screening tool is a stand alone application that does not link to other healthcare facility appli cations. Are the questions different for staff attestation and visitor screening? If you are a staff member, your questions will be different to those asked of a visitor or contractor. Can I tailor the questions to my organisation? Not at this stage. T his is a state -wide tool which will cover a large range of health organisations. The questions reflect Victorian Government COVID -related guidance on hospital visitors at: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/visiting -hospitals#current -restrictions Does the tool have a QR code like those used in a lot of social venues and shopping centres? Yes a QR code is available to be used in conjunction with SAVR (Included on page 7). What sort of reporting is available to my organisation from SAVR ? SAVR will send a daily report showing the number and type of attendee to your facility, and those who did not meet the criteria for entry. (refer to sample report on page 7) Can other organisations using the tool see my data? No. Is the tool proven? Do other organisations use it anywhere? The tool is used at a number of health organisations in large and small jurisdictions. It is proven, stable and can be rapidly deployed. How often will the questions be updated? The screening tool will be updated as required to keep pace with known outbreaks and virus hotspots, as well as border entry requirements and other Public Health and workplace safety orders. Is there a cost to use the tool? There is no cost to use the staff attestation or visitor screening t ool. Where can I go to for further support and information on use of the application?

Overall, the COVID -19 vaccination procedures for children aged 12 and above are same as for adults. Informed Consent For certain procedures, including vaccination, a child (any person under the age of 18 years) may be determined to be mature enough to understand the risks and benefits, and thereby provide informed consent. This principle applies to people under the age o f 18 years requesting COVID -19 vaccination. In accordance with the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) , a medical treatment decision -maker for a child will be the child's parent or guardian or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is reasonably available and willing and able to make the medical treatment decision. For children under th e age of 18 years, who are presenting for vaccination without a parent, guardian or other medical treatment decision maker, capacity to consent will be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority . Children assessed as being 'Gillick competent' can consent to the COVID -19 vaccination. These principles are enshrined in section 4 of the MTPD Act. Before administering the vaccine, an immuniser must verify the minimum eligible age (12 years and above) wit h identification (ID) or any proof of age document, such as a birth certificate, passport, or school card. Cross -referencing Medicare card details with the Australian Immunisation Register or a letter from the child's general practitioner or school is also acceptable if there is no other 'proof of age' documents available at the relevant time. A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider. Before administe ring the COVID -19 vaccination to a person under the age of 18 years, the immuniser must assess whether: The child or adolescent understands the information relevant to the decision to be vaccinated and the effect of that decision (that is, they understand an explanation of the information given by the immuniser in a way that is appropriate to the child or adolescent's circumstances, whether by using modified language, visual aids or any other means); The child or adolescent can retain that information to th e extent necessary to make the decision; The child or adolescent uses or weighs that information as part of their decision -making process; and The child or adolescent communicates the decision, and their views and needs as to the decision in some way, inc luding by speech, gestures or other means. 217 Informed consent should take into consideration adverse events relating to mRNA COVID -19 vaccines as described in ATAGI guidance regarding vaccination of adolescents in Australia For further information, refer to Guidance on Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines . Risks of allergy and anaphylaxis relating to mRNA vaccines - refer to ATAGI Clinical guidance . Administration Recommended injection sites and needle length The injection sites are same for this cohort as adults. Needle length is the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. Supporting those with needle phobia Pain and anxiety associated with vaccine administration can be a source of distress for children and their families. There a re a range of techniques that can be used to reduce this pain and anxiety, such as effective preparation, distraction techniques and pain management strategies. See additional resources developed by the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre Post -vaccination observation Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Immunisation is effective and safe. Like adults, some children may experience a reaction to a vaccine. In virtually all cases, a dverse events following immunisation are not as serious as the symptoms a child would experience if they were to contract the disease. This cohort is likely to experience the same mild, common and expected adverse events as adults. To 6 March 2022, the TGA has received about 3,800 reports from approximately 3.5 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines in 12 -17 year olds. The most reported reactio ns are chest pain, headache, dizziness, nausea and fever. More information is available in the AusVaxSafety survey for adolescents. Anxiety /pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. One of the most immediate adverse events in older children is fainting. This can occur before or after vaccination. Refer the Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. Myocarditis is a known but very rare side effect of Pfizer and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines . It is usually temporary, with most people getting better within a few days. The risk is higher with Moderna than with Pfizer Children or adolescents and their parents/guardians should be advised of possible symptoms of myocarditis and/or pericarditis after vaccination, which include ch est pain, pressure or discomfort, palpitations (irregular heartbeat, skipped beats or \"fluttering\"), syncope (fainting), shortness of breath, and pain with breathing. Symptoms typically start within a few days after vaccination (median 2 days). Myocarditis and/or pericarditis following vaccination can present with atypical features, such as absence of chest pain, or the presence of abdominal pain or other non -specific symptoms. It is important to 218consider myocarditis in the differential diagnosis if someon e presents with ongoing non -specific symptoms in the 1 -2 weeks following a COVID -19 vaccine. If children or adolescents experience any of these symptoms after receiving a COVID -19 vaccine, prompt medical attention should be sought. Children or adolescent s who already have underlying heart dysfunction should seek medical attention for new onset or worsening of pre -existing symptoms following vaccination. Systemic adverse events are more common after the second dose. Concerns about adverse events followin g immunisation Clinics using CVMS Record all medically attended AEFI in CVMS as an adverse event report: a) Report will automatically be forwarded to SAEFVIC b) Medically attended events are defined as medical assistance from the onsite clinician, paramedic attendance or transfer to an emergency department or hospital admission c) If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Clinics not using CVMS All medically attended AEFI to be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au or by using the QR code Medically attended events are defined as medical assistance from the onsite clinician, paramedic attendance or transfer to an emergency department or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Serious or unexpected AEFI Serious or unexpected AEFI require urgent direct notification in addition to routine reporting via CVM S or online SAEFVIC form. 219 Resources needed Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Before each vaccination session, check that you have the protocols, equipment and medicine to manage anaphylaxis . Always keep an anaphylaxis response kit handy. See Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Please note: The Adrenaline dosing and needle size are same as the adult intramuscular injection Laminated copy of Table. Doses of intramuscular 1:1000 adrenaline for anaphylaxis in After vaccination Laminated copy of Table. Recognising and treating anaphylaxis Workforce training Vaccination hubs should ensure that an experienced immuniser is pr esent on -site, who has completed all required COVID -19 vaccination training and has completed recent anaphylaxis training. All authorised immunisers are eligible to vaccinate this age group , with the exception of Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators . Respon ding to AEFIs - including anaphylaxis is covered in the mandatory COVID -19 training program. Anaphylaxis training is recommended for all staff administering the COVID -19 vaccination. The recommended training is the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e-Learning for Health Professionals . There is no requirement for staff to be trained in paediatric life support. Vaccination sites should have protocols for the management of serious adverse events including anaphylaxis. There is no requirement for staff to have a Working with Children Check. 220Appendix 14: Guidance - for people at r isk of acute kidney injury (AKI) Version 1.0, 16 August 2021 OFFICIAL In some people, COVID -19 vaccination may be associated with prominent constitutional symptoms, such as: vomiting, diarrhoea and decreased oral fluid intake, especially in the first 1 -2 days following the vaccine. The impact of associated decreased volume status may lead to decreased blood pressure, postural hypotension and falls, as well as acute kidney injury (AKI). Decreased volume may manifest as decreased urine output with or without an obvious decrease in blood pressure. Some vaccinees may have symptoms and signs of postural hypotension including dizziness upon standing. There is also an increased risk of falls particularly in the frail and elderly. Blood pressure may be found to be lower than usual or there may be a significant drop upon sitting or standing (drop of >20mmHg systolic). Blood tests may show a decrease in the eGFR and a rise in the serum creatinine . In extreme cases, it may precipitate acute tubular necrosis and the need for supportive measures such as dialysis. People especially susceptible to low blood pressure, postural hypotension, and AKI in the setting of dehydration or hypovolaemia include th e following groups: The frail, debilitated or cognitively impaired Those using diuretics e.g. frusemide, hydrochlorothiazide, Those using ACE inhibitors or Receptor (ARBs) Those using non - steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Patients with cardiac failure or severe liver disease Patients with existing kidney disease Patients with a kidney transplant How to minimise the risk of dehydration, decreased blood pressure, falls related to postural hypotension, and acute kidney Injury (AKI) It is important to remind those at risk to maintain adequate oral hydration at home when the above symptoms occur and to seek urgent medical attention when vomiting makes this impossible or when diarrhoea is severe. Anti-hypertensives and/or diuretics may need to be temporarily withheld until volume status and blood pressure have improved. An assessment of renal function and other metabolic parameters (various electrolytes) may be necessary in the emerge ncy department along with the need for electrolyte and fluid replacement intravenously. If significant renal impairment develops or there are unusual features such as proteinuria or haematuria noted, review by a nephrologist is strongly recommended. 221There are reports of glomerulonephritis possibly arising from mRNA vaccines, however these cases are extremely rare, and causality with the vaccines has not been clearly established. Reporting an immediate adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) at place of vaccination Clinics using CVMS Record all medically attended AEFI in CVMS as an adverse event report . o Medically attended events are defined as a visit to general practitioner, emergency department, or hospital admission . o Report will automatically be forwarded to SAEFVIC & followed up if required . If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Clinics not using CVMS All medically attended AEFI to be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au . or by using the QR code o Medically attended events are define as a visit to the general practitioner, emergency department or hospital admission If the adverse event is serious, IMMEDIATE notification is also required - see red box below Serious or unexpected AEFI Serious or unexpected AEFI require urgent direct notification in addition to routine reporting via CVMS or online SAEFVIC form . Reporting a delayed AEFI outside place of vaccination Vaccinees are advised to seek medical attention from their local general practitioner or emergency department should a delayed AEFI occur. Following medical attention, clinicians should report an AEFI to SAEFVIC via usual practices online www.saefvic.org.au . Vaccinees may also choose to report directly via the Victorian Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 or the National Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 020 080 or to SAEFVIC. Vaccinees can find more informat ion online at https://saefvic.online/report or by using the QR code. 222Appendix 15: Consent for persons under 18 years of age - Schools and in -reach programs. Schools, State -run vaccination sites, disability services and in-reach programs This document provides guidance for COVID -19 vaccination providers in schools, State -run vaccination sites, disability services and in -reach programs in vaccinating an eligible child or adolescent against COVID -19. This document is provid ed as guidance only and is not to be taken as or substituted for legal advice. All health professionals authorised to administer the COVID -19 vaccine (with the exception of those authorised as Limited Scope COVID -19 Vaccinators) can provide detailed inform ation about a COVID -19 vaccine and obtain informed consent. However, where possible, COVID -19 vaccination providers will use experienced immunisers to provide information about a COVID -19 vaccine and obtain consent for the vaccination of children or adoles cents against COVID -19. 'child or adolescent ' in this document refers to any person under the age of 18 years. 'decision maker ' in this document refers to a person with parental responsibilities for a child or adolescent, or a person who holds an authority to make decisions about medical treatment on behalf of a child or adolescent. 'authorised accompanying adult ' in this docum ent refers to an adult attending a vaccination site with the child or adolescent, for example, a grandparent or other family member, or a person with a family -like relationship to the child or adolescent, who is not the decision maker and who meets one of the following criteria: o Has: o written consent from a decision maker for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated; or o written authority from a decision maker authorising them to give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. o If no written cons ent or written authority from the decision maker is presented, the health professional can phone the decision maker to: o obtain verbal consent from the decision maker for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated; or o obtain verbal authorisation from the decision maker that the accompanying adult may give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. o If the health professional is unable to contact the decision maker, the accompanying adult can sign a statutory declaration to validly declare that th e decision maker has provided them with the authority to give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated . Children and adolescents may present in a range of ways for vaccination. This guidance is to support COVID -19 vaccination providers to ensur e they are prepared to manage all scenarios including presentation: with a decision maker; without a decision maker but with an authorised accompanying adult; or without a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult. 223Where a child or adolescent presen ts without a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult, they can be assessed for decision -making capacity to provide informed consent in accordance with legal requirements (see section 3 below in this document). Establishing consent in advance of COV ID-19 vaccination From a decision maker A clear process should be established to obtain and record consent, or refusal to consent, from a decision maker prior to COVID -19 vaccination of children and adolescents in schools, State -run vaccination sites, disability services, in -reach programs and other COVID -19 vaccination settings. This process may differ depending on the model and the setting but must comply with legal requirements under the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). As part of the process, the decision maker should be provided with adequate information to enable them to make an informed decision about the benefits and risks of vaccinating the child or adolescent against COVID -19. Establishing a clear process is particularly im portant where the decision maker, child or adolescent has a disability that raises any doubt about their decision -making capacity, or their capacity to clearly communicate their consent to someone who does not know them well. From an authorised accompanyi ng adult Ideally, the decision maker will provide written consent in advance of the day that the child or adolescent presents for COVID -19 vaccination. Where an authorised accompanying adult is attending the vaccination site with the child or adolescent, t hey should be asked to provide a copy of written evidence either that the decision maker has provided consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated, or that the decision maker has authorised the accompanying adult to give consent for the child or ad olescent to be vaccinated. Written evidence of consent can be a signed COVID -19 vaccination consent form (such as the form of consent in the links at section 6 below) or a letter or document signed by the decision maker clearly and expressly providing such consent. Similarly, authority given by the decision maker for the accompanying adult to provide consent can be in the form of a letter or other document that clearly and expressly provides such authorisation. The authorised accompanying adult should also provide acceptable evidence to verify their identity and their name should be recorded as part of the record keeping requirements set out in section 4 below. Where an accompanying adult does not have written consent or written authority to consent from t he decision maker for the vaccination of the child or adolescent they are accompanying, the health professional administering the vaccination can contact the decision maker directly by phone. The health professional can obtain verbal consent from the deci sion maker for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated, or verbal authorisation that the authorised accompanying adult may give consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated. The authorised accompanying adult or the child or adolescent can assist the experienced health professional to contact the decision maker. Where the decision maker cannot be contacted by phone on the day of the COVID -19 vaccination, but the authorised accompanying adult verbally states that the decision maker has given them aut hority to consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated, the authorised accompanying adult must be requested to confirm this by signing a statutory declaration stating that they are so authorised. This must be witnessed in accordance with the legal requirements for the making of such declarations, noting that nurses and medical 224practitioners may witness statutory declarations. All efforts should be made to obtain written or verbal consent from the child's or adolescent's decision maker before resorti ng to this option. The health professional administering the vaccination is ultimately responsible for obtaining and recording consent for the child or adolescent to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Other staff, including administrative staff, teachers and /or support workers, can help to coordinate this process (for example, by making contact with the decision maker) but cannot obtain that consent. Schools, State -run vaccination sites, disability services and in -reach programs should have systems in place t o support this process if required. Children or adolescents in out -of-home care For children or adolescents in out -of-home care, it is the responsibility of the child or adolescent's carer to bring a copy of their child -specific instrument of authorisation or standard authorisation, issued by their Community Service Organisation, to medical appointments as evidence of their authority to give valid consent to immunise the child or adolescent. Children of separated or divorced parents Where pare nts are separated or divorced, only one parent is required to provide consent unless there is a court order or agreement in place. If a court order or agreement is in place, this generally requires that the parents alert the service or vaccinator that an o rder is in place, and this may delay the vaccination. If the court order or agreement is in place, the family may attend a Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner or be seen in a specialist immunisation clinic to try to come to a decision together. If there is no court order or agreement in place, and the child or adolescent does not refuse to be vaccinated and the accompanying parent or guardian provides informed consent, the vaccinator may proceed with the vaccination of the child or adolescent, regardless of the views of a non -accompanying parent or guardian. Where a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult has provided consent, but the child or adolescent is refusing vaccination Where a decision maker or authorised accompanying adult has provided consent but the child or adolescent refuses due to anxiety, the person supporting them on the day (their decision maker or authorised accompanying adult), may provide counselling and gene ral support. Where required, the support person is able to support the use of prescribed medication to assist with reducing anxiety or use other behavioural support practices contained in the child or adolescent's behaviour support plan for the environmen t where vaccination takes place (i.e. school, in -reach settings). Further information is available at: https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/document/2756 . If these strategies are not availab le or successful, the vaccination should not be administered to the child or adolescent. Vaccination service providers should refer the child or adolescent and/or their decision maker or authorised accompanying adult to their usual medical practitioner, be haviour support service, a specialist immunisation clinic or the Disability Liaison Officer program to explore options that will meet the child or adolescent's needs. This referral may be provided via a written document or via a conversation with the decis ion maker, if present, or the authorised accompanying adult. 225 Where a decision maker refuses consent If a decision maker refuses a COVID -19 vaccination for a child or adolescent, attempts should be made to understand the reasons and determine if the provisi on of additional support, tailored to the child or adolescent's needs, would alter that view. Examples may include a one -off vaccination at a different location, vaccination at a drive -through clinic where the child or adolescent can stay in a vehicle, or a home visit by a medical practitioner or nurse immuniser. If additional support is required to facilitate delivery of the COVID -19 vaccination, the child or adolescent and their decision maker (or their authorised accompanying adult) may be referred to a local Disability Liaison Officer and/or a specialist immunisation service to explore these options. If a decision maker maintains refusal for the COVID -19 vaccination following the above provision of support and information, that refusal should be respec ted unless the child or adolescent chooses to be vaccinated on the day and they are deemed to have decision -making capacity (see section below). In this case, the decision of the child or adolescent should be respected and upheld, even if it conflicts with the views of their decision maker or authorised accompanying adult. Assessing a child or adolescent's decision -making capacity to provide informed consent Where no consent or refusal to consent for a child or adolescent's vaccination can be obtained from the decision maker or an authorised accompanying adult, an experienced health professional must assess whether a child or adolescent has decision -making capacity and can provide informed consent to receive the COVID -19 vaccination. A child or adolescent's decision -making capacity needs to be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority . Children or adolescents assessed as being 'Gillick competent' can consent to vaccination. These principles are ensh rined in section 4 of the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic). It is expected that the health professional administering the COVID -19 vaccine will have the appropriate level of expertise to assess a child or adolescent's decision -making capacity in accordance with the Act. In assessing decision -making capacity, the experienced health professional must consider whether the child or adolescent can: understand the information relevant to the decision to be vaccinated and the effect of the d ecision to be vaccinated; retain that information to the extent necessary to make the decision; use or weigh that information as part of their decision -making process; and communicate the decision and their views and needs as to the decision in some way, including by speech, gestures or other means. The child or adolescent should be provided with practicable and appropriate support in making and communicating any decision. This includes: o using information or formats tailored to the particular needs of the child or adolescent, for example, information may be provided via modified language, visual aids or other means, including using assistive technology, as appropriate; o communicating or assisting the child or adolescent to communicate their decision inc luding by speech, gestures or other means, including using assistive technology; and 226o giving the child or adolescent additional time to discuss and consider their decision. The experienced health professional must take reasonable steps to conduct the assess ment at a time and in an environment in which the child or adolescent's decision -making capacity can be most accurately assessed. When a child or adolescent is assessed as having decision -making capacity When a child or adolescent is assessed as having de cision -making capacity, their decision should be respected and upheld, even if it conflicts with the views of their decision maker. When a child or adolescent is assessed as not having decision -making capacity When the experienced health professional asse sses that a child or adolescent does not have decision - making capacity, the experienced health professional must determine who has authority to provide consent on behalf of the child or adolescent (i.e. who is their decision maker or an authorised accompan ying adult). The school, disability service or in -reach program can assist with this information. If consent for the vaccination of the child or adolescent has not been obtained, the vaccination should not be given. Clinic organisers should refer the decis ion maker or authorised accompanying adult to the child or adolescent's usual medical practitioner or a specialist immunisation clinic to seek COVID -19 vaccination. Record keeping When assessing a child or adolescent's decision -making capacity, each stage of the decision -making process and the outcome of the assessment should be recorded in the child or adolescent's health care record (for example in their Australian Immunisation Re gister record, in their COVID -19 Vaccination Management System (CVMS) record and/or the child or adolescent's My Health Record). In the same way that records of the consent provided by a decision maker must be kept, where an authorised accompanying adult has attended the vaccination with the child or adolescent, the name and contact details of the authorised accompanying adult and their relationship to the child or adolescent should also be recorded in the child or adolescent's health care record, along wi th the form of consent and relevant details of evidence of that consent (for example, the form of the written consent from the decision maker that was presented by the authorised accompanying adult, or that verbal consent was obtained via phone call with t he decision maker, or that a statutory declaration was made before consent was provided by the authorised accompanying adult). Working with Children Check (WWCC) For the purposes of working in the COVID -19 vaccination program at State -run vaccination clini cs, workers are not required to have a WWCC under the Worker Screening Act 2020 (Vic) if their only contact with children is via the COVID -19 vaccination program, and their work outside of that program does not usually involve direct contact with children. Organisations may have their own policies about who requires a WWCC, over and above what is required under the Act. Employers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. COVID -19 vaccination providers who are undertaking in -reach vaccination services in school settings in Victoria are likely to require a WWCC. 227 Further information The Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines and related documents and can be accessed from: https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information -covid -19-vaccine -providers .

Background On 8 October 2021 ATAGI recommended that individuals with severely immunocompromising conditions were advised to receive a third primary dose as part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure optimal vaccine effectiveness. On 11 February 2022 ATAGI extended this recommendation to immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11 years. Definition There are three types of additional doses, these are defined in table 1. Table 1: Definition of third primary dose and additional doses Type Definition Third primary dose Refers to additional COVID -19 doses required as part of the primary course to reach a comparable (optimal) level of protection. ATAGI recommend a third primary dose for individuals with severe immunocompromise. Third dose / fourth dose for severely immunocompromised Refers to additional COVID -19 doses required at a broader population level, to optimise protection due to waning of immunity (loss of protection) o ver time, with booster doses also leading to improved immune memory. Additional winter booster dose for specific cohorts ATAGI recommends an additional booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine to increase vaccine protection before winter for selected population groups . For eligibility and interval recommendations please see ATAGI updated recommendations for a winter dose of COVID 19 vaccine Also referred to as 4th dose/5th dose for severely immunocompromised. Up to date status Up-to-date vaccination status is defined by the number and timing of appropriate COVID -19 vaccine doses recommended for and received by an individual, accordin g to their age and other factors. See defining 'up -to-date' status for COVID -19 vaccination | Australian Government Department of Health Eligibility Severe COVID -19 in fully vaccinated individuals is very rare. There have been reports of breakthrough infections with COVID -19 in severely immunocompromised individuals who have received a full course of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines, and these individuals have b een found to have absent or low antibody titres despite completing their vaccination. 240 ATAGI considers it important to offer a third primary dose to provide a higher level of protection for these individuals to attain a level as close as possible to that s een in healthy individuals. A third primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine is recommended for all severely immunocompromised individuals as outlined in Table 2, from the age of 5 years. Table 2 - A summary of the eight severely immunocompromised conditions Immunocompromising conditions Active haematological malignancy Non-haematological malignancy with current active treatment including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, but excluding immunotherapy with immune chec kpoint inhibitors Solid organ transplant with immunosuppressive therapy Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients or chimeric antigen receptor T -cell (CAR -T) therapy within 2 years of transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapies Primary immunodeficiency including combined immunodeficiency and syndromes, major an tibody deficiency (e.g., common variable immune deficiency (CVID) or agammaglobulinemia), defects of innate immunity (including phagocytic cells), defects of immune regulation, complement deficiencies and phenocopies of primary immunodeficiencies. Advance d or untreated HIV with CD4 counts <250/L or those with a higher CD4 count unable to be established on effective anti -retroviral therapy Long term haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis For details on the eligibility and specific indications for a third prima ry dose refer to ATAGI recommendations on the use of a third primary dose of COV ID-19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - COVID -19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health ATAGI - Provider guide to COVID -19 vaccination of people with immunocompromise | Australian Government Department of Health Timing of third primary dose Third primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine can be administered to eligible severely immunocompromised individuals (see table 2 above) 2 months after their 2nd dose, as per current ATAGI guidance (noting in previous versions of this advice there was a range of 2 -6 months). 241 In exceptional circumstances where rapid pro tection is required (e.g., an outbreak setting or a significant increase in immunosuppression related to an urgent addition of an additional immunosuppressant agent), ATAGI considers a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the second and third primary dose t o be acceptable. ATAGI advises that it takes at least 2 weeks to generate an adequate immune response to the COVID -19 vaccines. Vaccination should ideally occur at least 2 weeks prior to the addition of a new immunosuppressive agent. Individuals should be advised by their usual treating specialist on timing of the vaccine and usual/new treatment. ATAGI - COVID -19 vaccination - Shared decision making guide for people with immunocompromise Additional considerations mRNA Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccines are preferred for the third primary dose. Novavax COVID -19 vaccine can also be used, for those 12 years, noting there is limited data of its immunogenicity or efficacy in people with immunocompromise Paediatric formulation of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine must be used for children aged 5 to 11 years (0.2ml (10\u00b5g) per dose) and adolescent/adult f ormulation used for those 12 years (0.3ml (30\u00b5g) per dose) Moderna COVID -19 vaccine may be used as a third primary dose for children aged 6 to 11 years, (0.25ml (50\u00b5g) per dose) and those 12 years (0.5ml (100\u00b5g) per dose) Where individuals have rec eived 1st and 2nd doses of AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine , it is acceptable for AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine to be used for the third primary dose if there are no contraindications or precautions for receiving it since the last dose. The AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine is not preferred but can be used for the third dose if there are contraindications to mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. Mixed (heterologous) schedules Mixed (heterologous) schedules using two different vaccines to complete the primary vaccination course are only recommended in special circumstances such as for those with serious vaccine -attributed adverse events after the first dose and in those who were partially vaccinated overseas with a brand not available in Australia. See also the ATAGI Clinical guidance on COVID vaccine - Mixed (heterologous) schedules for further informat ion on mixed (heterologous) schedules Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) The profile of adverse events after the third primary dose is similar to that of previous doses, and studies have not reported additional vaccine -related serious adverse events. However, these studies were conducted in small numbers of patients, and rare s ide effects may not have been detected. Monitoring of AEFIs post -third primary dose will continue. Information on possible adverse events after receiving a COVID -19 vaccine should be provided to the patient and carers. Resources for patients receiving a CO VID-19 vaccination are available from the Commonwealth COVID -19 vaccination website Patients and carers should be made aware of how to manage of common, minor, expected adverse events, such as the use of simple analgesics for injection site pain, fever, headaches, or body aches, and advised to seek further medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. For further information about rep orting adverse events please refer to SAEFVIC 242 243 Appendix 19: Mental Health Toolkit - COVID -19 Vaccination 15 June 2022 Version 2 Purpose This is a toolkit to assist clinicians, community health and mental health care providers, SAEFVIC and VicSIS staff in responding to patients and/or clients who are experiencing an exacerbation of mental illness or psychological distress related to COVID -19 vaccinations. The aim is to help overcome barriers to vaccination by increasing access to COVID -19 vaccines and awareness of existing support services. This toolkit aims to guide clinicians to provide support for those experiencing an exacerbation of e xisting mental health issues in relation to COVID -19 vaccinations and COVID -19 vaccination mandates. those experiencing new onset of psychological distress in relation to COVID -19 vaccinations and COVID -19 vaccination mandates. Distribution Plan This toolk it is intended to support clinicians, community health and mental health staff; the list of channels through which it will be distributed includes, but is not limited to: VicSIS Clinician Network SAEFVIC RACGP Health Vict oria This toolkit may be distributed to a broader audience of health services and organisations if it is deemed to be of value to those organisations. It is not intended for non -clinical members of the public. 244 Overview The Department of Health (DH), SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Immunisation in the Community) and VICSIS (Victorian Specialist Immunisation Service) are receiving increased reports and referrals of exacerbation of mental illness or new onset psychological distress around COVID -19 vaccination and associated mandates . Background VicSIS purpose is to provide specialist immunisation consultations to those who have experienced adverse reactions following a COVID -19 vaccination or are deemed to be at risk of exp eriencing an adverse reaction to a COVID -19 vaccine. VicSIS is not intended to provide specialised mental health services to respond to referrals made for mental illness or psychological distress. This necessitates the provision of clear advice to communi ty health clinicians to appropriately manage and refer those experiencing mental illness or psychological distress related to vaccines to the appropriate services. Vaccine exemptions On 26 November 2021, ATAGI published expanded guidance on conditions re garding temporary medical exemptions to include individuals who are a risk to themselves or others during the vaccination process. This may include a range of individuals with underlying developmental or mental health disorders. However, it is of note that non-pharmacological interventions can safely facilitate vaccination in many individuals with behavioural disturbances and that specialist services may be available to facilitate the safe administration of vaccines in this population. Enablers and Barriers When organising COVID -19 vaccination for those with mental illness or those experiencing psychological distress relating to the vaccinations, it is important to acknowledge the barriers these individuals face. These barriers may result in their delayed up take of COVID -19 vaccination, however, can be overcome with tools and techniques at the time of vaccination, to ensure a comfortable process. Examples of barriers Examples of enablers A history of mandatory treatment administration can result in long term fear of needles and clinical settings Acknowledge the medical or treatment history of the individual and facilitate a setting for vaccination which alleviates concerns Medical concerns around the vaccine Plain English and CALD community languages for vaccine information Sense of coercion into vaccination Longer appointments can facilitate a supportive environment Misinformation around the vaccines Consider incidental vaccinations and conversation regard ing vaccines in a non -threatening environment Mistrust of the government Practical assistance to access vaccination sites 245 Feeling judged by others for not being vaccinated, when reasons for this are beyond individual control Do not treat individuals as a burden Concerns relating to the vaccine have not been addressed Act in a way that responds to people's concerns Fear of medical or clinical settings Provide a comfortable vaccination environment Needle phobia Encourage vaccination in venues which are less overwhelming Making a vaccination booking online or over phone can be challenging for some Practical assistance to make vaccination appointments Families and carers facing challenges in assisting individuals obtaining a COVID -19 vaccination Empower family, carers, and support persons and allow them to accompany vaccinees through the process. Mental Health Services Crisis Support If an individual is at risk of imminent harm to themselves or others, the following services should be engaged. Ambulance: respond in psychiatric emergencies, for transfer to hospital if the situation cannot be managed safely in a community setting. o Call 000 Crisis Assessment and Treatment Teams (CATT): this is a psychiatric triage service that operates 24 hours a day.

Vaccination Support Services Safe Spaces for Vaccination General Practice General practitioners are ideally placed to offer individualised care to their patients and provide a calmer environment for vaccination than large vaccine hub site s. General Practitioners can develop patient specific vaccination plans, ahead of the vaccination appointment to minimise distress and optimise the safe provision of this case. Key strategies that can be utilised in primary care are: An individualised pati ent-centred vaccination plan, developed ahead of the vaccine appointment Not forcing children via physical restraint (which can cause long -term harm) Distraction techniques for children: bubbles, musical toys, phones, vibration/cold sensations Utilising re sources available for both children and adults: RCH TV: A child's guide to hospital Meg Foundation (megfoundationforpain.org) Kids Health Information: Podcast (rch.org.au) Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Use clear and simple language Provide support and reassurance Remove distracting stimuli 249 Try not to stop stimulating behaviours (helps alleviate distress) Low threshold to refer to specialist immunisation provider for sedation (especially teenagers) Psychologist support for patients and families In some cases, it may be necessary to refer a patient with severe needle phobia for psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy or exposure therapy. The Australian Psychological Society (APS ) website can assist with finding a psychologist with an interest in phobias. Pharmacy Similar to the General Practice setting, pharmacies may provide a calmer, quieter environment fo r vaccination. For those who experience distress in crowds or long lines, this may be a more preferrable setting for vaccination. Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) Pathway The Disability Liaison Office (DLO) Program, can facilitate a vaccination in a manner that is appropriate for the individual. Those with a disability, a mental illness or a severe needle phobia can access this service to discuss organising vaccination in a way that is most comfortable for them. This can include in -home vaccination. Sedatio n for vaccination may be considered if more conservative measures have been exhausted or are not appropriate. For general information regarding the DLO Program, see the following website: Vaccination information for people with a disability, carers, volunteers and disability support workers | Coronavirus Victoria This includes a link to the referral form: Request for Disability Liaison Officer Support (Page 1 of 3) DLOs can: Assist with booking a COVID -19 vaccination Assist to organise group bookings for service provi ders or groups of people with disability Provide advice to vaccine and testing sites on how to improve access for people with a disability or special requirements Assist in facilitating vaccination if a patient is not able to attend a vaccination centre.

In-home Vaccination For patients and/or clients who may find it easier to access vaccination at home, please see the information on in -home vaccination at the following link: Vaccine at home for people with special requirements | Coronavirus Victoria 250 Community and Neighbourhood Pop Ups Community and Neighbourhood Pop Ups have been established as an alternative for people not accessing vaccination through high throughput centres, primary health or clinical locations. The pop ups operate in local facilities that are familiar and accessible including places of worship, community centres, cafes, libraries and even shopping centres and markets. They can also be provided as in reach for specific services such as disability, homelessness, mental health, youth, refugee or other services. Each po p up is designed specifically to meet the needs of the target community. The clinical space can be adapted to respond to cultural or other requirements; and can include supports such as bicultural workers and translators and nursing and support staff with relevant experience, language and cultural connections. Prior to the pop up, targeted engagement and confidence building programs can be offered to address hesitancy and concerns. For more information, please contact COVIDvaccination@health.vic.gov.au . Peer support What constitutes a safe space for each individual will vary. However, one way to help create safe spaces for people to receive a vaccine is to allow them to have a support person, and consider peer supports. Below you will find information on organisations that can provide access peer supports, as well as resources specifically for support persons who may accompany vaccine recipients.

This setting provides an opportunity to encourage COVID -19 vaccination to a cohort who are willing and otherwise would have limited access to vac cination. Local Public Health Units (LPHUs) are working with hospitals to ensure some form of vaccination service is available for inpatient in -reach vaccination requests to be sent. For general enquiries about inpatient options, please see the below list at each LPHU. LPHU name Email WHPU outreachcovidvax@wh.org.au VicSIS Paediatrics - under 16 years old Children and adolescents under 16 with severe needle phobia, anxiety, intellectual disabilities, or neurodevelopmental conditions are advised to avoid attending large scale vaccination sites for immunisation. These sites are loud and busy and can increase distress. Smaller settings such as a GP clinic or pharmacy may be preferred. Further information and strategies to assist with needle phobia can be found at MVEC: Needle phobia . This resource includes strategies and techniques which can be adopted by families and carers, as well as healthcare providers. Paediatric referrals to VicSIS can still be completed through the eReferral portal. However the service is reducing its footprin t and therefore there may be longer wait times than previously experienced for these referrals. Adults - 16 years and over VicSIS is not accepting referrals for vaccination under sedation for adults (those aged 16 years and over). Disability Liaison Offic ers are providing support to adults with a disability as well as those with severe needle phobia or mental illness to get vaccinated, including under sedation.

Overview Most children with SARS -CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or experience a mild illness. Those who are symptomatic typically have a short illness and are least likely of all age groups to requi re hospitalisation or ICU admission for COVID -19. There is an emergence of a rare association of SARS -CoV-2 in children and post infective Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (1 in 2,469 cases) and the post COVID -19 condition called 'long COVID' . International data shows children, adolescents and young adults with underlying medical conditions have an increased risk of developing severe disease and complications w hen infected with SARS -CoV-2 23. 23 Graff K, Smith C, Silveira L, et al. Risk factors for severe COVID 19 in children. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2021; 40: e137 -e145. 254 The Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommends vaccinating childr en aged 5 - 11 years following their evaluation of available data to support its safety and efficacy among this age group. This evaluation considers the direct benefits of vaccination for the child in preventing illness and the contribution vaccination makes to the broader community through reduced transmission levels to family members, in schools, reduction in school and workplace absenteeism and greater protection for older and more vulnerable Australians. Current vaccine policy for children On 5 December 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer COVID - 19 vaccine, for use in individuals 5 years and older. In making this regulatory decision, the TGA carefully considered data from clinical trials conducted in the United States, Finland, Poland and Spain which included participants 5 -11 years of age. The study demonstrated effectiveness by showing that the immune response to the vaccine in children was similar to that seen in older age groups. On 9 December 202 1 ATAGI recommended the paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine be administered to all children 5 -11 years old. The recommended schedule for vaccination in this age group is 2 doses, 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened in special circumstances to a min imum of 3 weeks, such as in an outbreak response, prior to the initiation of significant immunosuppression or international travel. It is important to ensure preparedness for the specific considerations that children aged 5 -11 years will require to be safe ly vaccinated. On 12 January 2022 ATAGI stated the dose interval for children at higher risk of COVID -19 (e.g. some underlying medical conditions) may be shortened from 8 to 3 weeks in the context of ongoing community transmission. A list of underlying me dical conditions associated with a higher risk of severe COVID -19 are available in ATAGI Clinical guidance on t he use of COVID -19 vaccines and ATAGI recomm endations on the use of the paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11 years in Australia (health.gov.au). On 17 February 2022, the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine was provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for a tw o-dose schedule of 50g per dose in 6 - to 11 -year-old children. On 23 February 2022, ATAGI recommended Moderna COVID -19 vaccine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6 -11 years. The recommended schedule for vaccination in this age group is 2 doses, 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened to a minimum of 4 weeks, for children at risk of moderate to severe COVID -19 in special circumstances as outlined in ATAGI Clinical guidance on the use of COVID -19 vaccines and ATAGI recommendations on the use of Spikevax (Moderna) COVID -19 vaccine in children aged 6 to 11 years. On 11 February 2022 , ATAGI recommended severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11 years receive a 3rd primary dose of a mCOVID -19 vac cine, from 2 months after their second dose, in line with other severely immunocompromised age cohorts (noting in previous versions of this advice there was a range of 2 to 6 months). More information may be found at Recommendations on the use of a 3rd primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine in individua ls who are severely immunocompromised (health.gov.au) There are approximately 578,499 children between the ages of 5 -11 years old in Victoria. Clinical Governance The site specifications outlined in this document are the requirements to deliver a child -friendly 5 -11-year-old vaccination program in Victoria. All clinical governance around vaccination remains the responsibility of the 255 vaccination provider as outlined in the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines and the Victorian COVID - 19 Vaccination Program Service Specifications. 256 Models of Service Children will have different support needs based on their previous experiences and medical history, however, there i s a minimum support requirement for all children being vaccinated. The different models of service that are recommended to be available for this age group, b ased on the level of care needed and possible patient cohorts, can be seen below (Figure 1 and Tabl e 2), as well as a guide to decision making about what level of care a child may need (Figure 2). These models of service are applicable across vaccination delivery models (e.g., drive through, pop -up, in -home vaccination), however they may need to be adap ted depending on the setting and resources available e.g., alternative distraction techniques may be required for a drive -through model. Figure 1 - Models of service for COVID -19 vaccination for children aged 5 -11 257 Level Possible cohorts Recommended Requirements Level 0: Foundation Minimum requirements for all children Children with no anticipated additional support needs Safe child -friendly environment (inclusive, healthy, friendly, and protective): Pre assessment to identify care level required Experienced nurse immuniser with adequate paediatric training Availability of COVID -safe activities e.g. stickers, play area, digital devices e.g., tablets Availability of music - white noise apps, parents encouraged to bring devices to play music, speakers Floor and wall decals for directional signage and observation area Parents encouraged to bring toys and distraction fr om home for child Big screen to display animations and child entertainment material Parent or guardian to always remain with child Children's band aids Activity pack to be given to child as well as fidget toy and stress ball Level 1: Basic As above plus minor additional assistance required Minor behavioural issues Developmental disability or autism normally needing minimal support Previous negative experience with procedures Anticipated anxiety Additional nurse immuniser to provide additional support Extended appointment time Availability of distraction methods Buzzy bee (a bee -shaped distraction device) Cool sense Viewer devices 258 Table 1 - Care pathway for COVID -19 vaccination for children aged 5 -11 Resources: Needle phobi a and sedation guidelines and Safe immunisation holding practices for children with disabilities Virtual Reality headsets (Smiley Scope) Level 2: Intermediate As above plus further support for tailored sites with increased resources (e.g., Children with special needs) If the vaccination team is unable to vaccinate the child using the previous techniques or: History of autism with sensory issues Easily overwhelmed in crowded spaces Moderate anxiety or needle phobia Intellectual disability, developmental disorders or significant physical disability (e.g., cerebral palsy GMFCS V) Additional pre -planning of the vaccination consult Low stimulus \"quiet\" environment Low volume hubs OR sessions Appropriate holding techniques must be used Do not have more than 2 unsuccessful attempts at vaccinating this cohort before aborting and refer ring to the patient's GP or a DLO (see decision tree). Level 3: Specialist service As above plus tailored support for children who have high needs or may require referral for sedation If the vaccination team is unable to vaccinate the child using the previous techniques or: severe needle phobia developmental disorders with high needs Alternate models: In-home vaccination Drive through vaccination Specialist services: Referral to the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Services ( VicSiS ) should be considered for possible sedation 259 Figure 2 - Decision tree for COVID -19 vaccination for children aged 5 -11 260 Vaccinating children with neurodevelopmental conditi ons Below is a list of important adjustments, supports and strategies that vaccine providers can make to ensure children with a disability and/or autism, as well as their families/carers, can have positive experiences and outcomes when attending the vaccin ation site. Dedicated \"quiet\" and low stimulus sessions at vaccination centres to cater for children with a disability Sites should be disability accessible Clearly marked priority queue or entrance for children with disability Involving staff trained in d isability support e.g., Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and immunisers who have experience vaccinating this specific cohort. An extended appointment time and single additional nurse immuniser should be provided, as too many people assisting with the procedure may increase anxiety. Minimising the number of staff in the room to only those necessary is important. Appropriate holdi ng techniques can be considered to provide comfort and stability to the child. Forceful holding should never be used. These Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) guidelines provide useful advice in relation to holding techniques and outlines when they are appropriate and when they are not permissible. If immunisation attempts are unsuccessful or the child is flagged as high risk, a referral for to an immunisation specialist may be considered. Refer to MVEC website for further information on options such as sedation and specialist needle phobia clinics. Several resources specific to COVID -19 vaccination for people with autism are available through Amaze. This includes training tools, checklists and social scripts that explain the COVID -19 vaccination process. It is importan t to recognise when the vaccination shouldn't go ahead . Such indicators include: 1. If the child attempts to leave the room 2. If a child is unable to be settled using the child's usual comfort measures 3. If the child requires holding that requires more than one p erson or any degree of force 4. If the resources required to complete safe vaccination are unable to be provided 5. If the parent/guardian requests to abandon attempt 1. Vaccination should be aborted after two unsuccessful attempts and the individual should be referred to a DLO for consideration of alternate vaccination models o r referral to the Victorian Specialist Immunisation Services (VicSIS) . 261 Service specifications All state vaccination sites should be able to deliver Level 0 and 1 service offerings by 6 January 2022, regardless of delivery modality e.g., fixed site, pop -up, drive through. One site per LPHU must be able to deliver a Level 2 service offering by 10 January 2022 (see Table 1). Service specifications to support the establishment of these services can be seen in the LPHU site readiness checklist. Selected LPHUs will also serve as flagship sites. These include Melton Vaccination Hub (indoors and drive - through), Frankston Community Vaccination Hub - Bayside Centre, Campbellfield Ford Complex Indoor Vaccination Site, Geelong - Former Ford Factory, Cranbourne Turf Club, Traralgon Racecourse, Shepparton Showgrounds - McIntosh Centre and Sandown Racecourse. Targeted engagement and communications will be prioritised for selected Local Government Areas. Priority LGAs include Casey, that lagged in vaccination rates in September 2021 prior to the vaccination blitz. Procurement Distraction equipment can be purchased from the following providers: 1. Buzzy Bee - https://www.buzzy4shots.com.au/ 2. Coolsense - https://balancemedical.com.au/ , orders to ordering@balancemedical.com.au 3. Viewfinders - or other 4. Virtual Reality Headsets - SmileyScope Note that there is a 1 -2-week delay from ordering to arrival of the SmileyScope Virtual Reality headsets. Each headset can be programmed with the most common languages and virtual training on the use of these devices will be provided. Workforce and Regulations Workforce Requirements Vaccination sites must ensure that an experienced authorised immuniser is present on -site, who has completed all required COVID -19 vaccinati on training and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. Vaccination site leads should consider the competence and experience of their workforce to determine their suitability to vaccinate children. Experienced emergency authoris ed vaccination staff may be considered suitable to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to children aged 5 -11. These staff should demonstrate competency in administering the vaccine to this age group. A competency assessment will be provided by the department f or all emergency authorised immunisers. It is recommended that a health professional who has qualifications in basic paediatric life support be present in any setting where children aged 5 -11 are being vaccinated. For the purposes of working in the COVID -19 vaccination program, a Working with Children Check (WWCC) is recommended regardless of role. Some organisations may have their own policies that require workers to 262 have a WWCC and it may also be a requirement in some settings, for example schools. Empl oyers are responsible for ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. Training for immunisation staff Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) have been engaged to provide training to staff working at state clinics. Sites will nominate nurse immunisers to act as 'hub champions.' The hub champions can contribute to the training of other vaccination staff without experience in vaccinating children. There are two training eleme nts: an online 'Immunising children and infants' webinar, and practical training sessions at council immunisation clinics. The webinar is accessible through MVEC's Education Portal: https://education -mvec.mcri.edu.au / The webinar is a mandatory requirement for all staff working with 5 -11-year-olds at state -run vaccination sites. The practical training sessions will only be completed by hub champions. The training requirements for hub champions and existing vaccination staff is outlined in Table 2 - MVEC training workplan. Sites are responsible for identifying staff who they assess to have the relevant skills and experience to vaccinate 5 -11-year-olds without further practical training. For example, nurse immunisers that have previously worked in council or paediatric immunisation settings may not require any additional practical training. The MVEC practical training will provide a standardised training package for hub champions. Staff undertaking this training can then support further training at sites to expand workforce capacity. Deciding who needs further practical training at each site will be up to the respective sites. To give flexibility, on -site training at va ccination services will not be limited to delivery by hub champions, and sites may use suitably skilled staff with paediatric immunisation experience to train others. MVEC practical training will be complemented by guidance materials which will be made ava ilable to the hub champions to consolidate their learning. Further training to other suitable staff and any associated 'accreditation' or competency assessment is the responsibility of the relevant LPHUs / sites. A competency assessment will be provided by the department for emergency authorised immunisers and may also be used at the discretion of sites for nurse immunisers. Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) Vaccine Uptake Group 1. Delivery of 20 training sessions over t he first few months by Murdoch Children's Research Institute focussed on CALD, disability and Aboriginal and Torres strait Islander populations run in partnership with Victorian Multicultural Commission and Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations. Supported with resources, the training is designed to upskill people working in healthcare, education and with priority children on COVID -19 vaccination and its benefits including 263 having conversations with vaccine hesitant parents, guardians , and carers in addition to having conversations about vaccination with children. 264 Table 2 - MVEC training workplan Hub Champion Senior nurse immuniser (2 per site) Other Vaccination Staff Has completed existing training and has experience in Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Program Commonwealth COVID -19 vaccine course incorporating additional modules specific to paediatric vaccine Commonwealth COVID -19 vaccine course incorporating additional modules specific to paediatric vaccine MVEC immunising children and infants webinar (from week of 13 December 2021) MVEC immunising children and infants webinar (from week of 13 December 2021) Orientation session (Zoom) with MVEC (from week of 13 December 2021) Optional: MVEC Vaccination Procedures learning package Council session (practical) facilitated by MVEC (from week beginning 13 December 2021 and throughout January 2022) Practical training, competency assessment and supervision by Hub Champions Note: practical training requirements for existing and new workforce members can be determined on a case -by-case basis depending on prior experience, training and individual assessment. Emergency authorised immunisers are required to undertake a competency assessment. Eligibility confirmation Before administering the vaccine, an immuniser must verify the minimum eligible age (5 years and above) with identification (ID) or any proof of age document, such as a birth certifica te, passport or school card. Cross -referencing Medicare card details with the Australian Immunisation Register or a letter from the child's general practitioner or school is also acceptable if there is no other 'proof of age' documents available at the rel evant time. A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider The child should be clinically assessed, and their details confirmed before administering the va ccine. Review consent forms Undertake pre -vaccination assessment Provide an opportunity for the child and parent/guardian to raise any questions Complete consent and pre -immunisation assessment checklists. Instruct the child and parent/guardian to wait for at least 15 minutes, as a safety requirement, while they are observed for signs of adverse reaction. Provide information on post -vaccination self -care and direct the parent/guardian to read this (Available in a range of community languages if applicable). Informed consent A parent or guardian will be required to provide consent to vaccinate a child (aged 5 -11), as the child will not be competent to consent for themselves as per the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) . A medical treatment decision -maker for a child will be the child's parent, guardian, or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is availabl e and willing to provide informed consent for the child's COVID -19 vaccination. Appropriate reading level English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources should also be provided to the children and carers - if resources permit. The he alth professional administering the vaccination is responsible for obtaining and recording consent for the child to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Other staff including administrative staff, teachers and/or support workers can help to coordinate this proc ess (by contacting the decision maker) but cannot record consent. Schools, disability services and in -reach programs should have systems in place to support this process, if required. For more information refer to the additional resources on consent Appendix 15: Consent for COVID -19 vaccination administration in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years . Operational planning and preparedness Creating a child -friendly and safe vaccination site The design a nd layout of sites must ensure that vaccination spaces are child -friendly and welcoming. Site planning should also be informed by existing guidance on delivering culturally safe vaccination services. Key considerations should include easy to read information in multiple languages, rapid and on -site access to interpreter se rvices and workforce diversity to support delivery of culturally appropriate care. Consultation with parents of children with disability and from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities informed these recommendations. Pre-immunisation preparatio n Where possible, parents should be provided with an immunisation plan (will be available prior to start of program) to guide the immunisation experience for the child. This can be completed ahead of time to provide the child with a level of control over t he process, in terms of selecting who will accompany them, time of day, toys, music or other distractions that the parent/carer brings to the appointment. The parent can record any previous negative immunisation experiences or anticipated anxiety and selec t the most appropriate immunisation pathway that may suit their child (see Figure 2). The plan will help to reduce anxiety and needle distress. A child -friendly concierge to greet people at vaccination centres and direct to priority queues for children wi th disability or special needs, as well as active queue management to recognise signs of distress in children, is required to ensure a positive experience. Awareness of Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) services prior to and at the point of booking aims to provide the most appropriate immunisation experience first time for children with disability, special needs, needle phobia and/or anxiety. Site design Create a child friendly environment using colour and collateral to make them feel safe. This will include the use of pictorial decal (for example, images of small feet or bricks) as a wayfinding device to the vaccination booths. Place posters and directi ons at children's height to allow them to read (note: Department of Health will supply a base themed pack). Availability of COVID -safe activities (e.g., stickers, storybooks, toys, and play therapy, outdoor play area, if possible, will ensure adequate dist raction for children both waiting in line and during vaccination, particularly children with special needs. Please see Diagram 1 under models of service and CDC Paediatric Planning Guide for further guidance. All COVID -safe activities and distraction techniques should be single use or wipeable in line with IPC advice. Refer to vaccine guidelines for further information on environmental cleaning Availability of music is recommended, either through encouraging parents to bring their own devices or through speakers at select vaccination sites that are intended for children with special requirements. Availability of Wi -Fi for families (either hospital Wi -Fi or portable Wi -Fi) could be considered to assist with streaming music or videos to distract children. Noise should be minimised where possible by ensuring empty bays betw een children to ensure a calming environment and reduce the levels of anxiety and needle distress. If resources allow, consider music to distract from distressing ambient noise for example white noise apps with calming sounds such as the ocean (see Table 1 under Models of Service). Children under distress can trigger stress response in other children who are in the vicinity, and so it is recommended to have a designated partition (preferably with a door to minimize sound transmission) that ensures privacy for children that experience acute stress episodes for their recovery. Offer dedicated \"quiet\" sessions at vaccination centres to cater for children living with a disability, which include smaller enclosed spaces, low lighting/sensory surroundings and staf f trained in disability support Where possible, minimise harsh lighting. Site layout and flow There should be dedicated lanes and observation areas reserved for children aged 5 -11 and their parent/guardian. The parent/guardian should always remain with the child. Consider changes to the layout of the waiting area to allow for small groups of families to be together and distraction opportunities for children (e.g., colouring books). A large clock can be helpful to allow children to track time and as a le arning opportunity. Consideration could be given to separate waiting lines and check -in areas from adults to reduce children's anxiety and wait times. Active queue management to identify children with special needs or in distress and an express queue to accommodate such needs. Ample \"easy read\" clear signage should be available to help parents and children with disabilities identify this express lane. All staff should wear a name badge with their name and photo to make them appear more approachable when w earing PPE Consider extended appointment times and increased intervals between appointments to reduce risks of over -crowding Preference for after school and evenings as well as longer hours of operation on weekends in addition to regular hours. Additional time should be allocated for discussion of parents' questions and concerns and to ensure valid consent Consideration could be given to specific days or half days dedicated to vaccinating only in this cohort Vaccination centres will be soft Australian nature themed as per these examples.

Vaccine logistics Paediatric dosage of COVID -19 vaccine Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine (5-11 years; Orange capped vial) On 5 December 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer COVID - 19 vaccine, for use in individuals 5 years and older. In children aged 5 -11 years the paediatric Pfizer COVID - 19 vacci ne vaccine should be given in a two dose regimen at 8 weeks apart. The interval can be shortened in special circumstances to a minimum of 3 weeks, such as in an outbreak response, prior to the initiation of significant immunosuppression or international travel. A lower dose (10 micrograms or 0.2 ml) will be given to children aged 5 -11 years, compared to that used for individuals 12 years and older (30 micrograms). A child should be vaccinated with the recommended dose based on their age at t ime of vaccination (e.g., if they turn 12 between dose 1 and 2 they would be vaccinated with an adult dose for dose 2). On 12 January 2022 ATAGI stated the dose interval for children at higher risk of COVID -19 (e.g. some underlying medical conditions) may be shortened from 8 to 3 weeks in the context of ongoing community transmission. A list of underlying medical conditions associated with a higher risk of severe COVID -19 are available in ATAGI Clinical guidance on the use of COVID -19 vaccines To deliver the smaller dose, an orange -capped vial will be used to vaccinate children. It will be clearly differentiated fr om the vial currently used to vaccinate those 12 years and older (purple top). Expected differences in dosing, storage and preparation for adult and paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine can be seen in Table 3. To reduce the risk of vaccine errors the followi ng should be considered: Paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine (orange capped vial) can only be used for children 5 -11 years Where practicable, paediatric and adult Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine vials should be stored separately in vaccine fridges/freezers. Paedia tric and adult Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine doses should not be drawn up together or the filled syringes stored together. Paediatric and adult doses should be clearly labelled to reduce the risk of errors. Other vaccines should not be stored with the paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine. Implementation should ensure that the risk of vaccine errors are minimised by specific awareness and training around multi -dose vials for this age group i.e., orange caps. Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine On 17 February 2022, the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine was provisionally approved by the TGA for a two -dose schedule of 50g per dose in 6 - to 11 -year-old children. ATAGI recommends Moderna COVID -19 vaccine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6 -11 years. A clinical trial conducted by Moderna demonstrated that the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine produces a strong immune response in children and reduced the likelihood of children developing COVID -19. However, ATAGI notes that evidence outside of clinical trials reg arding the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine in children in this age group is not yet available. The Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine continues to be available and recommended for 5 -11-year-old children. The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine is an alternative option for children aged 6 -11 years. Pfizer COVID - 19 vaccine remains the only vaccin e available for children who are 5 years old. There are currently no vaccines licensed for children aged 4 years and under. Side effects reported following the Moderna COVID -19 va ccine have been mild to moderate and transient but may be more common than those following the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine. Schedule: The recommended schedule for Moderna COVID -19 vaccination in children 6 -11 years is 2 doses (50g per dose; 0.25mL), 8 weeks a part. The interval can be shortened to a minimum of 4 weeks, for children at risk of moderate to severe COVID -19 in special circumstances (as outlined in ATAGI Clinical guidance on the use of COVID -19 vaccines ). There are currently no published data regarding mixed primary vaccination schedules for children aged <12 years. ATAGI do not recommend the use of mixed pr imary schedules in this age group. ATAGI will monitor and update this recommendation as evidence evolves. Children who turn 12 years of age after their first dose should receive the adolescent/adult dose (0.5mL; 100g) of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine to c omplete their primary vaccine course. A third COVID -19 vaccine dose is recommended for children aged 5 and older who are severely immunocompromised. An mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (either Mo derna or Pfizer) is recommended for this third dose (either Pfizer for children 5 years and older or Moderna for children 6 years and older). This dose is recommended to be administered from 2 months after the second dose.

Booster doses are not currently recommended for those aged below 16 years. Table 4 - Differences between adult and paediatric dosage and preparation of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine (Source: US CDC, 202124) Further guidance on paediatric storage, preparation, and dosage of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine to be provided by -19/downloads/Pfizer -Pediatric -Reference -Planning.pdf Preparin g for vaccination Equipment Access to emergency medical equipment such as Automated External Defibrillator (AED) with paediatric pad/key option, portable emergency oxygen kits, first aid kit, and anaphylaxis response kit should be available on site. Equipment should be regularly checked and maintained in line with the organisation's policy on resuscitation equipment use. Please note that a defibrillator is rarely required in children. Most paediatric life support initially focuses on airway and respiratory management. Recommended injection site and needle length Needle length and injection site are the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid muscle injection site and Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. The solo sitting position is recommended for this age group; however, the cuddle or straddle position may also be considered. Refer to Recommended positioning for children The anterolateral thigh and ventrogluteal area can be used as alternative site s if the deltoid muscle is difficult to access due to distress or injury. Immunisation providers should be familiar with the landmarks used to identify these injection sites and only administer to these sites if they have been suitably trained. Refer to th e links below to see the alternative injection sites: Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection site on the anterolateral thigh. Anatomical markers used to identify the ventrogluteal injection site Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Before each vaccination session, ensure that protocols, equipment, and medicine to manage anaphylaxis are available by keeping an anaphylaxisresponse kit handy. Ensure that a printed table with age-based adrenaline dosing is readily available. SeePreparing an anaphylaxis response kit and Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Anaphylaxis e -Learning for Health Professionals. Vaccine safety considerations Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Information on possible adverse events after receiving a COVID -19 vaccine should be provided to the child (depending on age and maturity) and parent/guardian. They should be made aware of how to manage common minor and expected adverse events, such as the use of simple analgesics for injection site pain, fever, headaches, or body aches, and advised to seek further medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. Fainting and syncopal seizures There may be variations in the frequency and type of adverse events following immuni sation for children aged 5 years compared to children aged 11 years. Anxiety/pain related reactions to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. An Australian study25 showed the occurrence of syncope and seizures followin g vaccination administration is higher in children and adolescents compared to adults. While most cases of fainting and syncopal seizures are not serious, some children may sustain injury from high impact falls, so it is important to have a safe vaccinating environment and an awareness of the clinical signs of a faint/syncope. Allergic reactions Allergic reactions to COVID -19 vaccines are rare but need to be closely monitored for. The signs/symptoms of mild to moderate allergic reaction include: rapid onset swelling to face, lips and/or eyes tingling of the mouth hives (urticaria) or welts abdominal pain/vomiting. A mild to moderate allergic reaction may sometimes progress to a severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis. Signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis may include difficult or noisy breathing, swelling of the tongue or throat tightness, wheeze or persistent cough, hoarse voice, pallor, and floppiness (in a young child), or collapse. All immediate (within 4 hours) and generalised symptoms of a possible allergic reaction to a previous dose of COVID -19 vaccine should be reported to SAEFVIC and the vaccinee referred to a VicSIS clinic See ASCIA Guide: Allergy and COVID -19 Vaccination for more information. Myocarditis and pericarditis Myocarditis and/or pericarditis occur very rarely in younger people, including adolescents and children. Myocarditis and pericarditis typically occur within 10 days of mRNA vaccines. The classic symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis can include chest pain, pressure, or discomfort palpitations (irregular heartbeat, skipped beats or 'fluttering'), syncope (fainting), shortn ess of breath, pain with breathing. Younger individuals with myocarditis and pericarditis may present with symptoms that are more non -specific. Most myocarditis and pericarditis cases linked to mRNA vaccination have been mild and patients have recovered qu ickly. Longer -term follow -up of these cases is ongoing. The risk of myocarditis appears highest in the 12 -29 years age group. There is not yet sufficient data to predict rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in the 5 -11 years age group26. 25 Syncope and seizures following human papillomavirus vaccination: a retrospective case series | The Medical Journal of Australia (mja.com.au) 26 Daniels CJ, Rajpal S, Greenshields JT, et al.

Appendix 21: Safety considerations for in -home COVID -19 Vaccination Version 2. 7- 7 July 2022 OFFICIAL Purpose This document highlights operational and clinical safety considerations to support in -home COVID -19 vaccination models. Overview In Victoria, the COVID -19 vaccine primary course coverage is high , however there remains unvaccinated individuals and over 40% of the total population are yet to receive a first booster dose. For any person aged 16 and older who has not received their first booste r yet, ATAGI recommends they receive it as soon as possible. ATAGI recommends an additional booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine to increase vaccine protection before winter for selected population groups who are at greatest risk of severe illness from COVID -19 and who have received their primary vaccination and first booster dose. For eligibility and interval recommendation please see ATAGI updated statement on recommendations on a winter booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine A pre -requested in -home vaccination service is an additional pathway to reach this under -vaccinated cohort and minimise the risk of COVID -19 posed to some of the most vulnerable people in the community. The service enables people to receive a COVID -19 vacc ination in their home or close by. The service was established to provide those who have not accessed existing voluntary COVID -19 vaccination initiatives due to reasons which may include: inability to attend a vaccination centre e.g., people living with d isability lack of confidence and knowledge, including vaccine hesitancy vulnerable individuals with no documentation The goal of the in -home vaccination model is to remove barriers and provide easy access to vaccination so that no one is left behind. What is the Vaccinations at home service? The Vaccinations at home service enables people to receive a COVID -19 vaccination at their home for those who are unable to attend a vaccination centre due to injury, mobility or disability. The purpose of this servi ce is to provide an additional pathway for vaccination to minimise the risk of COVID - 19 being acquired by some of the most vulnerable people in the community, who are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Primary course doses, including dose 3 for im munocompromised and first dose booster vaccination will be available for the patient groups listed below. ATAGI recommendations on COVID -19 vaccines, including considerations for interval, age, severely immunocompromised and those eligible for the additional winter booster vaccine should inform planning and delivery. See ATAGI statement on recommendations on a winter booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine What patient groups are in scope? The Vaccinations at home service is intended for people who are predominantly housebound and are unable to attend a GP clinic for their usual medical needs. Eligibility criteria for this service include but is not limited to: people with an injury, chronic health issue, or frailty affecting mobility people with moder ate to severe physical or psychosocial disability people with moderate to severe mental health or behavioural issues not otherwise classified as a psychosocial disability. 5-11-year-olds who are not able to visit a vaccination service for the any of the re asons listed above People over 60 who cannot readily get to a GP or State vaccination service People in Public Sector Residential Aged Care or Private Sector Residential Aged Care Settings where a group vaccination service may have previously visited, and an individual needs a primary course or booster vaccination. The Vaccinations at home service is intended to be accessed by an individual when all other existing support services to access a vaccination centre are not appropriate. Such support ing services include the Disability Liaison Officer case management function and transport support. The Vaccinations at home service is available to people residing in single in -dwelling settings which includes public and private residential aged care serv ices. For people residing in congregate care settings or other high-density accommodation settings where multiple people are to be vaccinated, other vaccination pathways (including C -19 and LPHU mobile clinic services) are available. People who have previo usly experienced anaphylaxis to any vaccine or to any excipient of a COVID -19 vaccine are not suited to the Vaccinations at home service and should be referred to VicSIS for further support. 5 -11 year olds who need additional suppo rt for vaccination such as sedation should also be referred to VicSIS for further support. Other patient groups which may be considered in the future include close contacts of a COVID -19 positive individu al who are quarantining at home. Considerations for operational planning and logistics The in -home vaccination service is available in coordination with existing providers already operating in - home vaccination services to individuals residing in other res idential settings such as congregate care or high-density accommodation settings where multiple people are to be vaccinated. Individuals or their carers may make a request for the in -home vaccination service. A central intake service enables all requests f or vaccination support to be assessed and allocated to the appropriate support service. A single vaccine model (e.g., Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccine ) should be considered to simplify logistics and minimise vaccine errors. First booster dose may be pro vided for individuals at least 3 months after the completion of a COVID -19 vaccine primary course. On 29 April 2022, ATAGI recommended that all people should defer COVID -19 vaccination for 3 months after a confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection, to optimise prote ction for that person. The next dose should then be given as soon as possible after 3 months according to schedule and eligibility. All recommended doses should still be received, and no doses should be omitted from the schedule. ATAGI recommends an additional winter booster dose for specific cohorts and can be given from 3 months or longer after the person has received their first booster dose, or from 3 months after a confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection, if infection occurred since the person's first COVID -19 booster dose The nature of the population being targeted by this intervention means that some individuals approached may not support vacc ination and there is a risk of aggression and/or occupation violence in the setting. All possible mitigating strategies should be put into place to assure the safety of staff. Workforce and training Teams should consist of a minimum of two people where at least one staff member is an authorised immuniser with at least six months experience. The immuniser should, where practicable, have experience working in a community setting. A dedicated team lead should consider the competence and experience of their wo rkforce to determine their suitability to vaccinate children. It is recommended that a health professional who has qualifications in basic paediatric life support (proficiency in cardiopulmonary resuscitation including a Paediatric component) and has under gone anaphylaxis training (e.g. Managing Immunisation Emergencies of First Aid) be present in any setting where children aged 5 -11 are being vaccinated. All mandatory COVID -19 vaccination training must be completed as outlined in the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines. De-escalation training should be considered for staff that are required to enter households within the community. The department offers free on line Occupational Violence and Aggression training that includes risk assessment and de -escalation techniques. All staff are encouraged but not required to have a Working with Children Check. Workforce safety considerations The following table summarises the risks and mitigation strategies recommended to ensure staff safety when implement an in -home vaccination policy. Table 1 - Staff safety risks and mitigation strategies. Associated safety risks Potential mitigation strategies Physical or verbal aggression by community members It is recommended that staff work in teams (including one security personnel). Teams should consist of two or more people and someone external to the group should be aware of their location at all times. Prior in -reach screening of households should be co nducted by coordinating with either the council nurses, building concierge or health educators to avoid confrontations, if possible. For individual households, it is also recommended to have a house screening. An example of an in -reach checklist can be fou nd here. In the case of an incident, staff should have an escalation point to emergency services if required and should be provided with employee wellbeing and support post incident whether requiring emergency assistance or not . To mitigate communication issues in case of emergency, measures such as two-way radios, mobile phones or emergency e -PODs could be considered, if resources permit. Details of the home visit should be recorded in a shared digital calendar. This should record the client's name; the address of the home being visited and clearly list all travel time (to and from visits). Calendars should be shared with all team members and supervisors to ensure details can be viewed if additional support is required. Safety hazards in the home (e.g., pets, firearms, site risks, access) A home safety risk assessment checklist (hazardous test) prior to providing an in-home vaccine service or entering the client's home is recommended. Designated staff should conduct screening prior to a home visit to assess whether there are any risks involved wi th undertaking a home visit, such as: history of the presence of violence within a home, or excessive alcohol or other substance abuse) who is present (or likely to be) within the home Disposition of household members to initiative e.g., identifying individuals who would not want vaccination Locality issues which may hamper safe access and egress External factor such as catastrophic weather or bushfire warnings. Unrestrained animals or reptiles kept inside or outside the home For more information on home visit safety considerations, refer to the Home Visit Guidelines. Vulnerable population safety considerations There are issues posed for individuals who may require additional assistance e.g., disability or culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Table 2 - Safety risks for minority populations and mitigation strategies. Associated safe ty risks Potential mitigation strategies Consent and advocacy issues Consider offering access to Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and an alternative pathway to vaccination in the home. Resources that are inaccessible Accessible resources that are presented in clear easy to understand language that cater for a range of languages and disabilities e.g., large print, Auslan, brail, \"easy read\" and sensory friendly options readily available. Translator Interpreter Service (TIS) 1300 655 820 and AUS LAN interpreter 1300 287 526 Risk associated with reporting of adverse reactions and follow up care Ensure the individual or their guardian has the capacity/tools/insight to seek care and/or report adverse reactions. As above, post vaccination information that is accessible to the individual. Documentation Access to IT equipment should be made available for staff to document medical information and record doses, including portable wi -fi, a pen and paper to record man ually in case of connectivity issues. Vaccine safety considerations Additional safety considerations for vaccination in the home can be seen in table 3. Table 3 - Safety considerations for vaccination at home Pre- vaccination During Vaccination Post -vaccination Experienced immunisers Informed consent: Easy English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources should also be provided to patients and carers during the home visit. Individuals who require in - home vaccination may have chronic health conditions that require additional support Pre-prepared labelled syringes must be carefully monitored for expiry and stored in conditions according to the relevant vaccine handling documents. Confirm the client is not a positive case or household close contact. On arrival, confirm that no positive cases or household close contacts are present on - site. Contact time between vaccinators and clients should be minimised to reduce the possible risk of COVID -19 transmission, and any processes that can be safely completed in advance or remotely be considered e.g., consent. There should be access to an emergenc y kit containing adrenaline injection 1:1000, and a written protocol for the treatment of anaphylaxis, including adrenaline use. Immunisers must be authorised to administer adrenaline, undertaken in accordance with the procedures specified in the current e dition of The Australian Immunisation Handbook . Additional equipment such as mouth shield and Automated External Debfibrillator (AED) with paediatric pads/key option for is desirable. Vaccinators should monitor the patient on -site for a minimum of 15 minutes following vaccination to assess for serious adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) e.g., anaphylaxis. Physical distancing should be maintained during observation period. Where appropriate, carers may be encouraged to support post - vaccination monitoring of clients and should be educated of AEFI's and escalating pathways. If clients are living alone, ensure any doors to rooms are unlocked in case medical attention is necessary. Any subsequent dose should be booked for the client at the time of vaccination according to recommended intervals to prevent loss to follow up. Note: Individuals with contraindications to a COVID -19 vaccine should not be vaccinated at home and should be referred to their treating practitioner for further assessment and m anagement. Cold chain management Transporting doses for home visits When transporting Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID -19 vaccines for a home visit, there are 2 options: Where possible, transport the vial at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 6 hours, and draw up the dose at th e site of administration. A pre -drawn dose in a syringe can be transported if it can be appropriately stored (protecting from light and maintaining the cold chain) and can be administered as soon as practicable and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 1 hour if at room temperature, and within 6 hours if at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Please refer to the Commonwealth Government website and Victorian COVID -19 vaccination guidelines for further information on transporting, storing and handling COVID -19 vaccine s. Transporting doses for home visits - Victorian COVID -19 vaccination guidelines National Vaccine Storage Guidelines 'Strive for 5' Informed consent Where appropriate, the process to obtain informed consent may be undertak en remotely and in advance. Key considerations when obtaining informed consent for the Vaccinations at home service include: Supports from GP/clinicians should be made available to individuals to discuss any specific health concerns prior to providing inf ormed consent. For children under the age of 18 years, who are presenting for home vaccination without a parent, guardian or other medical treatment decision maker, capacity to consent will be assessed based on the principles outlined in Gillick v West Nor folk and Wisbech Area Health Authority . Children assessed as being 'Gillick competent' can consent to the COVID -19 vaccination. A parent or guardian will be required to provide consent to vaccination of a child (aged 5 -11), as the child will not be compet ent to consent for themselves as per the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act). Further information regarding consent for COVID -19 vaccination in children and adolescents under 18 years is available in Appendix 15 - Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines. Before administering the vaccine, a n immuniser must verify the minimum eligible age (5 years and above) with identification (ID) or any proof of age document, such as a birth certificate, passport or school card. Cross -referencing Medicare card details with the Australian Immunisation Regis ter or a letter from the child's general practitioner or school is also acceptable if there is no other 'proof of age' documents available at the relevant time. A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider Personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by vaccinators and clients may have an impact on informed consent and the overall vaccine experience particularly for people from certain cultural or linguistic g roups or people with a disability. The requirement for PPE may need to be discussed with the individual or carer and any concerns addressed prior to vaccinating staff attending the home. Further information on informed consent is available in the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines - Obtaining consent for vaccination. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) In addition to the standard department's COVID -19 infection control guidelines , the following general IPC recommendations are advised for door -knock vaccination services: Direct contact time between vaccinators an d clients should be minimised to reduce the possible risk of COVID -19 transmission, and any processes that can be safely completed in advance or remotely be considered. Social distancing requirements must be adhered in the home. Biohazard bags and sharp needle containers must be provided for medical waste disposal. Attestations for staff and clients prior to in -home vaccine to confirm that they are symptom free and not a household close contact or case of COVID -19. Staff working across multiple sites and mobile teams should adhere to the current public health directions. Designated staff for the Vaccination at Home service must be fully vaccinated as per current health directions. There should be appropriate precautions for donning and doffing of required PPE. For further information refer to Department's COVID -19 infection control guidelines theAustralian Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Infection in Healthcare (2019) Medical emergencies In the case of medical emergency, providers should call for support by dialing 000 and notify of an immunisation related emergency. Emergency escalation pr otocols should be developed in liaison with the Local Public Health Unit's (LPHU.) It is also recommended that a designated COVID -19 vaccination medical lead is assigned. Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) Information on possibleadverse events after receiving a COVID -19 vaccineshould be provided . Resources for patients receiving a COVID -19 vaccination are available from the Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination website . Clients should be handed a reader friendly flyer on how to manage of common, minor, expected adverse events, such as the use of simple analgesics for injection site pain, fever, headaches, or body aches, and advised to seek further medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. For further information refer to SAEFVIC vaccine safety information and reporting. Reporting of adverse events following imm unisation (AEFI) Safety considerations for vaccinating children aged 5 -11 Paediatric dosage of COVID -19 vaccine Paediatric Pfizer (Orange Cap) COVID -19 Vaccine Paediatric Pfizer (Orange Cap) COVID -19 Vaccine is given as a two -dose schedule for children aged 5 -11 years. ATAGI recommends an interval between the two Pfizer doses of 8 weeks. This can be reduced to a minimum of 3 weeks, under special circumstances or for international travel or in the context of ongoing community transmission. The paediatric formulation of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine must be used for children aged 5 to 1 1 years (0.2ml (10\u00b5g) per dose). A child should be vaccinated with the recommended dose based on their age at time of vaccination (e.g., if they turn 12 between dose 1 and 2, they would be vaccinated with an adolescent/adult formulation for dose 2). There are no additional handling and transportation requirements for the paediatric Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine . For further guidance see Transporting doses for home visits - Victorian COVID -19 vaccination guidelines Moderna COVID -19 vaccine Moderna COVID -19 vaccine is given as a two -dose schedule for children aged 6 -11 years. ATAGI recommends an interval between the two Moderna doses of 8 weeks. The interval can be shortened to a minimum of 4 weeks, for children at risk of moderate to severe COVID -19 in special circumstances . Please note there is not a specific paediatric Moderna COVID -19 vaccine formulation and providers must be aware of the dosage difference for children aged 6 -11 years (50g (0.25mL per dose). There are currently no published data regarding mixed primary vaccination schedules for children aged <12 years. ATAGI do not recommend the use of mixed primary schedules in this age group. ATAGI will monitor and update this recommendation as evidence evolves. Severely Immunocompromised ATAGI recommend severely immunocompromised children aged 5 to 11 years receive a 3rd primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine, 2 months after their second dose, in line with other severely immunocompromised age cohorts (noting in previous versions of this advice there was a range of 2 to 6 months). More information may be found at Recommendations on the use of a 3rd primary dose of COVID -19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised (health.gov.au) To reduce the risk of vaccine errors the following should be considered: Paediatric Pfizer (Orang e Cap) COVID -19 Vaccine can only be used for children 5 -11 years old. Where practicable, paediatric and adult Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine vials should be stored separately in vaccine fridges/freezers. Paediatric and adult Pfizer doses should not be drawn up together or the filled syringes stored together. Paediatric and adult doses of COVID -19 vaccines should be clearly labelled to reduce the risk of errors. Be aware of th e required lower Moderna COVID -19 vaccine dose of 50g (0.25mL per dose) for children aged 6 -11 years. Other COVID -19 vaccine brands, not registered for use in children aged 5 to 11 years (eg AstraZeneca and Novavax) should be stored separately. Specific awareness and training around the different vaccines and multi -dose vials for this age group, will minimise risk of errors. Fainting and syncopal seizure There may be variations in the frequency and type of adverse events following immunisation for children aged 5 years compared to children aged 11 years. Anxiety/pain related reactio ns to any vaccine is likely to be higher for children and adolescents than adults. While most cases of fainting and syncopal seizures are not serious, some children may sustain injury from high impact falls, so it is important to have a safe vaccinating en vironment and an awareness of the clinical signs of a faint/syncope. For more information, refer to the COVID -19 vaccinations for children aged 5 -11. How can the service be requested? Individuals or their carers can make a request for the Vaccinations at home service, by the following pathways: Enquire with their regular GP if they offer home visit COVID -19 vaccinations for their patients Contact your local public health unit Book an at -home appointment, via the COVID -19 hotline on 1800 675 398 .

Adheres to relevant hospital policy/procedures. Other duties as directed by line manager or Supervisin g Authorised Immuniser within the limitations of the position descrip Purpose This document provides safety and operational considerations for vaccine providers on the co -administration of COVID -19 vaccines and the influenza vaccine during the same visit. Background On 25 March 2022, The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Imm unisation (ATAGI) updated the current influenza vaccine advice: ATAGI advice on seasonal influenza vaccines in 2022 . Maintaining high rates of vaccination will be essential to protecting the Victorian population against influenza, particularly considering the ongoing pandemic. Current ATAGI advice states COVID -19 vaccines can be co-administered (that is, given on the same visit) with an influenza vaccine. There is no interval required between COVID -19 and influenza vaccines if given on separate days. This will provide an opportunity for the community to receive both vaccines on the same day and would encourage uptake of both vaccines . There will be a limited number of COVID -19 hubs providing both COVID -19 and influenza vaccines to eligible National Immunisation Program (NIP) funded cohorts. Individuals who are not due for their COVID -19 vaccine can still receive their influenza vaccine through the hubs. What is co -administration of vaccines? Co-administration of vaccines is defined as the administration of more than one vaccine on the same day at different anatomical injection sites (preferably in opposite limbs) and n ot combined in the same syringe. This differs from a combined vaccine which is a vaccine containing two or more antigens in a single injection e.g., measles -mumps -rubella (MMR). There are public health benefits associated with co -administration of vaccines. Benefits include reducing the number of vaccination visits an individual needs to attend and vaccine protection against multiple diseases is provided without delay. A recent study investigated co -administration vaccination with Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine and an age - appropriate influenza vaccine. No safety concerns were identified and antibody responses to both vaccines were preserved. The study also suggests that co -administration over the next immunisation season should reduce the burden on healthcare services for vaccine delivery, allowing for timely vaccine administration and protection from COVID -19 and influenza. For further information on the co -administration of influenza and COVID -19 vaccines, refer to ATAGI advice on seasonal influenza vaccines in 2022 2022 Seasonal Influenza vaccines registered in Australia Table 1 - Seasonal influenza vaccines registered and available for use in Australia in 2022, by age Appendix 23 - Guidance on Co -administration of COVID -19 and Influenza Vaccines Version 1. 4 - 7 July 2022 Table 2 - Influenza strains included in the 2022 Southern Hem isphere seasonal Influenza vaccines For further information see ATAGI Statement on the Administration of seasonal influenza vaccines in 2022 Eligible cohort for free flu vaccination under NIP Annual influenza vaccination is recommended and funded for children aged 6 months to <5 years, and adults aged 65 years. all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people people who have certain medical conditions (see Table 3) pregnant women (during any stage of pregnancy) Table 3 - Medical conditions associated with an increased risk of influenza disease complications and for which individuals are eligible for publicly funded vaccination under the NIP Timing of co -administration of other vaccines COVID -19 vaccines can also be co -administered with other vaccines if required. This includes routine childhood and adolescent vaccines for children 5 years and above. The benefits of ensuring timely vaccination and maintaining high vaccine uptake outweigh any potential risks associated with immunogenicity, local adverse reactions, or fever. Providers need to balance the opportunistic need for co -administration with the benefits of giving the vaccines on separate visits. There is the potential for an increase in mild to moderate adverse events when more than one vaccine is given at the same time. Co -administration or near administration (e.g., within days) with another vaccine may also make it challenging to attribute potential adverse events. Providers should ensure that parents/guardians of young children receiving COVID -19 vaccines are aware of the increased potential for local reactions. The additional winter booster dose of COVID -19 vaccines for specific cohorts commenced from April 2022, coinciding with the rollout of the 2022 influenza vaccination program. Influenza vaccine can be co - administered with any COVID -19 vaccine in cluding the additional booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine. However, if a person is not yet eligible for their additional booster dose, influenza vaccine can be given ahead of the additional booster dose. For further information, See ATAGI Clinical recommendations for COVID -19 vaccines - Timing of administration of ot her vaccines Operational Safety Considerations Models of Care Primary care providers and pharmacist immunisers: can provide both vaccines at the same appointment can supply and administer NIP eligible & private Influenza vaccines. have established procurement processes and software for provision of data to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). pharmacist immunisers are currently only eligible to deliver th e influenza vaccine to children aged 5+. Local Public Health Units (LPHUs): can coordinate coadministration of COVID -19 and Influenza vaccines. nurse immunisers are authorised to carry and administer both vaccines. LPHUs will provide Influenza vacc ines supplied under the National Immunisation Program (NIP). CVMS is unable to take bookings and record Influenza vaccines. Hubs will record influenza vaccines using their usual software. Hubs can access AIR through HPOS using a PRODA account. Workforce considerations Table 4 - The differences in workforce authorisation for COVID -19 vaccines and influenz a vaccines COVID -19 vaccines Influenza vaccines Workforce authorisation Medical practitioners, nurse practitioners (within their scope of practice), nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers are authorised to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to all age groups as approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Several other professional and student cohorts have been authorised via time limited Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) and trained to prepare and administer the COVID -19 vaccine .. All workforces administering the COVID -19 vaccine are required to complete mandated COVID -19 vaccination training. Workforces authorised via the PHEOs are also required to complete a competency assessment. Medical practitioners, nurse practitioners (within the ir scope of practice) and nurse immunisers are authorised to administer the influenza vaccine to all eligible age groups. Registered nurses can also administer influenza to all eligible age groups on a doctor's order. Pharmacist immunisers are authorised to administer the influenza vaccine to people aged 5 years and older. Nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers are required to complete an 'Immuniser Program of Study' and continuing professional devel opment in immunisation (including current skills in cardiopulmonary resuscitation/anaphylaxis response). The 'Immuniser Program of Study' includes best practice and safety information about all scheduled vaccines, including the seasonal influenza vaccine. No additional training is required. Several other professional and student cohorts have been authorised via time limited Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) and trained to prepare and administer the 2022 influenza vaccine to approved age groups. This au thorisation is until 9 September 2022. Additional training is required . Medical and professional indemnity All vaccine providers should continue to exercise reasonable care to ensure that all individuals employed and/or engaged by them are suitably trained, credentialed, supervised, and adhere to all government and healthcare guidelines as they relate to the vaccination program. Service providers and authorised vaccination workforces are required to hold appropriate medical and professional indemnity and public liability insurances for administration of vaccines and provision of a vaccination service. Vaccinators employed or engaged by State -run vaccination sites will be covered by the service providers' medical indemnity insurance. Other vac cinators, for example, in general practice or other primary care settings, should confirm their own medical indemnity insurance arrangements. Vaccine Safety Considerations Table 5 - Summary of the safety considerations for co -administration of COVID -19 and influenza vaccines Pre- vaccination During Vaccination Post -vaccination Informed consent: Easy English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources should also be provided to patients and carers during the consent process in the co - administration of the vaccines Pre-prepared labelled syringes must be carefully monitored for expiry and stored in conditions according to the relevant vaccine handling requirements. Immuniser should complete the Influenza pre -vaccination screening checklist and the COVID -19 consent This helps ensure that the person does not have a condition that increases the risk of an AEFI or is a contraindication to vaccination. The immuniser must ensur e the correct brand and age - appropriate vaccines are prepared and administered. The two different vaccines must be stored separately and clearly marked to avoid confusion. The immuniser must be clear if one or two vaccines are being administered to the individual when gaining their consent. Ensure a record of the site of vaccination (i.e., right deltoid/left deltoid) and the type of vaccine is communicated to the patient and clearly documented. The vastus lateralis muscle in the anter olateral thigh is the recommended site for intramuscular Influenza vaccination in infants 6 months to <12 months of age. For details on m ultiple injections sites refer to the Australian Immunisation Handbook It is recommended COVID -19 and influenza vaccines should be given in different limbs. If this is not possible, separate the injections by 2.5cm. Vaccinators should monitor the patient on -site for a minimum of 15 minutes following vaccination to assess for serious adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) e.g., anaphylaxis. It is preferable to give people written advice, such as Table. Common side effects following immunisation for vaccines used in the National Immunisation Program schedule . Parents and carers are encouraged to support post - vaccination monitoring (AEFI) and should be educated and provided with Easy English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources If there are subsequent doses/vaccines to be given, consider booking this for the patient at the time of vaccination in line with recommended intervals to prevent loss to follow up. For Infection Protection and Control (IPC) considerations refer to the standard Department of Health COVID - 19 infection control guidelines. There should be ready access to emergency medical equipment as outlined in the Australian Immunisation Handbook and The Victorian COVID -19 vaccination guidelines Table 6 - The precautions and contraindications associated with influenza and COVID -19 vaccines COVID -19 vaccine Influenza vaccine Contradictions to all COVID -19 vaccines are: Anaphylaxis after a previous dose of the same vaccine applies to all vaccines Other serious adverse events attributed to a previous dose that has been reported to a state adverse event reporting program and/or TGA and a determination made by a relevant specialist that a repeat dose would be associated with a risk of recurrence of the serious adverse event. Some of the specific contradictions include: Pfizer or Moderna COVID -19 vaccine s anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) myocarditis and/or pericarditis attributed to a previous dose of either of these vaccines Specific to AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polys orbate 80 history of capillary leak syndrome thrombosis with thrombocytopenia occurring after a previous dose Specific to Novavax COVID -19 vaccine anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, including polysorbate 80 For more information refer to: ATAGI clinical guidance on COVID -19 vaccine in Australia in 2021 Precautions for each vaccine is outlined in the ATAGI clinical guidance: COVID -19 vaccine contraindications and precautions The only absolute contraindications to influenza vaccines are: anaphylaxis after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine anaphylaxis after any component of an influenza vaccine Precautions include: people with a known egg allergy People with known anaphylaxis egg allergy People with known non -anaphylax is egg allergy People with latex allergy People with a history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome People receiving immuno -oncology therapy For more information on influenza contradictions and precautions refer to the Australian Immunisation Handbook People with egg allergy, including a history of anaphylaxis , can be safely vaccinated with egg-based influenza vaccines. For further information refer to - ASCIA Guidelines: Vaccination of the egg -allergic individual - Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) Cold chain management There are different cold chain management and reporting requirements for the COVID -19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that need to be considered when planning to co -administer these vaccines, including transportation and handling of vaccines. For more information on COVID -19 vaccine cold chain management and requirements, see Victorian COVID - 19 Vaccination Guidelines . Influenza vaccines must be kept and transported within the safe temperature range of +2C to +8C. For further information please refer to The National Storage Guidelines\" Strive for 5 . and Australian Immunisation Handbook (Influenza) and Information for consumers and health professionals 2022 Seasonal Influenza vaccines (TGA). Cold chain breaches for COVID -19 vaccines should be reported to the Commonwealth Vaccine Operations Centre (VOC) on 1800 318 208. The VOC will provide advice on how cold chain breaches must be managed. The Victorian Department of Health outlines the actions that are required in Victoria when there is a cold chain breach. Transporting doses for home visits When transporting Pfizer, Mode rna, AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID -19 vaccines for a home visit, there are 2 options: Where possible, transport the vial at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 6 hours, and draw up the dose at the site of administration. A pre -drawn dose in a syringe can be transported if it can be appropriately stored (protecting from light and maintaining the cold chain) and can be administered as soon as practicable and not exceeding the total maximum storage period of 1 hour if at room temperature, and within 6 hours if at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Please refer to the Commonwealth Government website for further information on transporting, storing and handling COVID -19 vaccines . For influenza vaccines refer to product information in The Australian Immunisation Handbook and The National Vaccine Storage Guidelines 'Strive for 5' For further guidance see Appendix 32 Safety considerations for in -home COVID -19 Vaccination. Additional influenza vaccine information Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all people 6 months of age to prevent influenza and its complications. Providers must ensure that the correct age -appropriate brand of the influenza vaccine is administered as per The Australian Immunisation Handbook . Providers must also check to see if an individual is eligible for a free influenza vaccine funded by the National Immunisation Program (NI P) which is available for special risk groups, outlined previously. For further information about influenza vaccines see the Therapeutic Goods Adminis tration Table 7 - Recommended doses of influenza vaccine available through the NIP by age group Age Single use pre-filled syringe dose Number of doses needed in 1st year of influenza vaccination Number of doses needed if person received 1 or more doses of influenza vaccine in a previous season 6 months to <9 years* 0.5 mL 2 (given 4 weeks apart) 1 9 years 0.5 mL 1 1 People of any age w ho have recently had a haematopoietic stem cell transplant or solid organ transplant 0.5 mL 2 (given 4 weeks apart) in 1st year after transplant 2 (given 4 weeks apart) in 1st year after transplant * There are no in fluenza vaccines registered for use in any infant under 6 months of age. For more information on the recommended doses of influenza by age group refer to the Australian Immunisation Handbook. For more information please refer to the ATAGI advice on seasonal influenza vaccines in 2022 and The Victorian Department of Health seasonal influenza vaccine information page Storage of multiple vaccine types in a shared location For comprehensive information on caring for vaccines at clinics and the storage of multiple vaccine types in the fridge re fer to National vaccine storage guidelines - Strive for 5, 3rd edition Risk of vaccine errors Authorised vaccinators should continue to mitigate errors with usual process of medication management and report any vaccine errors. For further information on reporting see Adverse events following immunis ation (AEFI) . The influenza vaccines specific brands/formulation of influenza vaccine are available for different age groups, and it is important that providers are familiar with the age -appropriate doses. Influenza vaccines do not require reconstitution and there is a clear difference in naming and branding across COVID -19 vaccines. There are numerous seasonal influenza vaccine brands recommended for use in different ages. Documentation Immunisation providers must document all vaccinations. This includes documenting in: A person's medical record including the site of vaccination (e.g., Left leg, right deltoid) COVID -19 vaccine into CVMS and; Notifying the vaccination to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) For more information, please refer to the Austral ian Immunisation Handbook. Ordering influenza vaccine Influenza vaccine is available for 2022. Registered immunisation providers in Victoria can order government funded vaccines via the online ordering facility. Other safety considerations Consent An authorised vaccinator must obtain valid consent from the individual being vaccinated or their parent or guardian. Authorised vaccinators must undertake pre -vaccination screening prior to vaccine administration to identify any contraindications or precautions see The Australian Immunisation Handbook - Influe nza pre - vaccination screening checklist and the Commonwealth COVID -19 consent form . The person being vaccinated should be provided with information (preferably written), including the risks an d benefits relating to the vaccines and the immunisation procedure and what to do in the event of side effects following vaccination. Consent and the vaccination administration record must be documented, and their privacy and confidentiality always upheld. If a child or adolescent under the age of 18 years presents without a parent or guardian, an experienced health professional may assess whether the child or adolescent has decision -making capacity to provide informed consent to receive the vaccinations. Administration of Influenza vaccines to infants from 6 months and children There are different injection sites recommended for children compared to infants under 12 months. Guidance for vaccination injection techniques for different ages is detailed in The Australian Immunisation Handbook. Administration of vaccines in infants aged from 6 months to under 12 mont hs (Source: Image taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook) The Vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in infants under 12 months of age. This is because it is a large muscle and is free of neurovascular structures that could be harmed by vaccine adm inistration. See Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection site Recommended positioning Infants 6 months to < 12 months Cuddle position for infants (Influenza only) A video outlining this technique can be found on the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) website Figure 1 - Differences in administration (injection site) for i nfants under 12 months Source: Image taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook Position the infant in a semi -recumbent cuddle position on the parent's/carer's lap (see figure 1. Positioning a child <12 months of age in the cuddle position ). The parent/carer should: Tuck the infant's inside arm against the parent's/carer's chest Secure ly hold the infant's outside arm and outside leg Flex the infant's outside knee to relax the vastus lateralis for intramuscular injections. Administration of vaccines in children 12 months and adults (Source: Image taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in children 12 mon ths of age. The deltoid is a large rounded triangular shape on the outside of the upper arm, on top of the humerus, the clavicle and the scapula. The brachial artery and the radial nerve sit behind the deltoid and come down from the muscle. The injection s ite is a smaller triangle -shaped area, in the middle of the deltoid, above the deltoid tuberosity. See Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid injection site Recommended positioning for children from 12 months Figure 2 - Positioning an older child in the cuddle position (Source: Image taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook Sit child sideways on their carer's lap with their legs in between the carer's thighs. The carer's outside (left) arm is wrapped around the back of the child and holding the child's left arm snuggly against the child's side. The carer is holding the child's left hand snuggly against the child's stomach with their right hand. The child's inside (right) arm is tucked under the carer's left armpit. This reveals the injection side in the child's left deltoid muscle. Another position for older children is the straddle position sho wn in figure 3. Figure 3 - Positioning a child in the straddle position (Source: Image taken from the Administration of vaccines | The Australian Immunisation Handbook (health.gov.au) Austra lian Immunisation Hanbook An older child may face the parent/carer with their legs straddled over the parent's/carer's lap. The child's arms should be folded in front, and the parent/carer should hug the child's body to their chest. Alternatively, the child can 'hug' the parent/c arer, with the parent's/carer's arms holding the child's arms in a reciprocal hug . For further information on positioning refer to The Austra lian Immunisation Handbook Recommended injection site and needle length Needle length and injection site are the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. Influenza vaccination Consent form What is influenza? Influenza (commonly referred to as the flu) is a highly contagious virus that usually occurs from April to September. It affects people of all ages. Influenza can cause severe illness and life -threatening complications. For vulnerable Victorians, like young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system or chronic medical condition, influenza can have serious and devastating outcomes. Influenza is easily spread by droplets wh en an infected individual coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by people with flu. Symptoms appear a few days after infection and may take up to a week to resolve. The most common symptoms of influenza are: 1. sudden app earance of a high fever (38\u00b0C or more) 2. a dry cough 3. body aches (especially in the head, lower back and legs) 4. feeling weak and tired (and not wanting to get out of bed). How is influenza treated? The symptoms of influenza are usually managed by bed rest and taking simple analgesia for muscle aches and pain. Vaccination is key to protecting yourself and those around you from influenza. Influenza vaccine An annual influenza vaccination is recommended each autumn as the influenza viruses change frequently and therefore a new vaccine is developed every year. Influenza vaccine does not contain any live virus, so you cannot get the flu from receiving the vaccine. Influenza vaccines can also be co -administered (given on the same day) with a COVID -19 vaccine. Who should have the influenza vaccine? Influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 6 months and over. Some people are more at risk of complications from influenza and are eligible for free vaccination as part of the National Immunisation Program including: anyone aged 65 years and older pregnant women (at any stage of pregnancy ) all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Isla nder people aged from 6 months and over people 6 months or older with heart disease , chronic lung disease (including people with severe asthma who require frequent hospit al visits), chronic neurological conditions, impaired immunity, haemoglobinopathies (blood disorders caused by genetic changes), diabetes , or kidney disease children aged from 6 months to under 5 years. On the day you have your vaccine Before you are vaccinated, tell the person giving you the vaccine if you: have had an a llergic reaction, particularly a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), to: a previous dose of an influenza vaccine other vaccines, medications, or foods are immunocompromised. This means that you have a weakened immune system that makes it harder for you to fight disease. Influenza vaccine - Common reactions The influenza vaccine can cause side effects. Most side effects are minor and quickly disappear. If the following reactions do occur, it will most likely be soon after vaccination and may last for 1 -2 days. Common side effects Managing side effects after immunisation Drowsiness or tiredness Localised pain, redness and swelling at the injection site Occasionally, an injection -site lump (nodule) that may last many weeks but needs no treatment Low-grade temperature ( fever ). Drinking extra fluids Wearing light clothing if there is a fever. Although routine use of paracetamol after vaccination is not recommended, if pain and fever are present, paracetamol can be given - check the label for the correct dose or speak with your pharmacist (especially when giving paracetamol to children). Extremely rare side effect There is a very small risk of a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any vaccine.

Important information A number of healthcare professionals, students and Limited Scope Vaccinators are authorised to administer the 2022 influenza vaccine under Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) issued under Section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic), with specific restrictions and requirements. Free training is available online and has been mandated for all emergency authorised workforces participating in the delivery of 2022 influenza vaccinatio n services. The information in this document is not intended to serve as legal advice. Vaccination service providers are advised to seek independent advice from legal professionals. Authorisation of workforce In February 2021, the Secretary, Department of Health, authorised a number of healthcare professional, student and other workforces to participate in the delivery of the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Program in a range of roles to support safe and timely vaccinations for all Victorians. The impact of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, combined with increasing influenza infections in the Victorian community, has resulted in increased demand for healthcare and continues to exacerbate workforce and other pressures in the health system. In June 2 022, following consideration of measures necessary to respond to, or prevent, a serious risk to public health, the Secretary, Department of Health made two PHEOs authorising the workforces already authorised to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to also admin ister the 2022 influenza vaccine in Victoria . These PHEOs are time -limited for a duration of three months. Workforces authorised to participate in 2022 seasonal influenza vaccination are classified as: Supervising authorised immunisers (also referred to as authorised immunisers). Emergency authorised workforces - including healthcare professionals, students and Limited Scope Vaccinators (see Table 1 below). Supervising authorised immunisers practitioner or nurse practitioner. Supervising authorised immunisers should have the relevant skills and experience to provide supervision to less experienced, and emergency authorised immunisation staff. Medical practitioners and nurse practitioners (within scope) are authorised via Victorian drugs and poisons legislation to administer the influenza vaccine without the need for additional authorisation. Nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers have provisions for administration of the influenza vaccine (without an administration order) enabled through Secretary Approvals made under the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Regulations 2017 (Vic). The Secretary Approvals for nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers are available through at: https://www.health.vic.gov.au /immunisation/immunisers -in- victoria . For further details, including definitions of nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers, please see the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines under section ' Supervising authorised immunisers and vaccine preparation supervisors '. Emergency authorised workforces Emergency authorised workforces administering the influenza vaccine have been authorised through PHEOs issued under Section 22D of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 . The emergency orders include specific restrictions and requirements relating to each authorised workforce. Please note that the PHEOs for emergency authorised workforces commence from the date of publication in the Victoria n Government Gazette ( 10 February 2022 ) and are in force for a period of three months , unless revoked earlier. Healthcare professionals and students Under the PHEO: Authorisation for administration - influenza vaccine (surge and student workforces) , the following workforces included in Table 1 are authorised to participate in 2022 influenza vaccination programs. These workforces must have a supervising authorised immuniser in place. Further details about the supervision of emergency authorised workforces can be found in the section below ' Supervision requirements '. Table 1: Eligible healthcare professionals a nd students Healthcare professionals Healthcare students (year eligible) Registered nurses, midwives, enrolled nurses (without notification), paramedics, Aboriginal health practitioners*, dentists, dental therapists, dental hygienists and oral health therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, podiatrists, optometrists, medical radiation practitioners, pharmacists, intern pharmacists, speech pathologists, orthoptists, orthotists and prosthetists, and pathology collectors ( Cert. III min). Tertiary students registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) who are training and/or studying: Medicine (third year or second year Master's), nursing and/or midwifery (second year), paramedicine (second yea r), pharmacy (fourth year), dentistry (fourth year or third year Master's), oral health (third year), physiotherapy and occupational therapy (fourth year or second year Master's), and podiatry (fourth year). * Must only administer the influenza vaccine un der an administration order from a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner. Limited Scope Vaccinators In January 2022, Limited Scope (COVID -19) Vaccinators were authorised to administer the COVID -19 vaccine as a class of persons meeting critical Victori an COVID -19 Vaccination Program requirements described within an authorised position description. The Secretary has authorised Limited Scope Vaccinators to additionally administer the 2022 influenza vaccine under strict training, competency and ratio -based supervision requirements to bolster the available vaccination workforce. The expansion of their scope is intended to leverage their experience of participating in the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Under the PHEO: Authorisation for administration - influenza vaccine (Limited Scope Vaccinators) , Limited Scope Vaccinators, once trained and deemed competent, are authorised to participate in 2022 influenza vaccination programs, subject to the below restrictions and requirements of the PHEO authorisation. The 2022 influenza vaccination program requirements for Limited Scope Vaccinators are as described in Appendix 22 - Victorian Limited Scope [COVID -19] Vaccinator Position Descriptions . Limited Scope Vaccinators are required to successfully complete additional training that will provide them with the specific clinical knowledge and practical skills required to safely ad minister the 2022 influenza vaccine. These workforces must have a supervising authorised immuniser in place. Further details about the supervision of emergency authorised workforces can be found in the section below ' Supervision requirements '. Scope of PHEO authorisations Authorised workforces and their employers must ensure they understand the scope of their authorisation, the restrictions and requirements that apply, and limit their practice to the extent of their training. Emergency authorised workforces are authorised to perform specific vaccination activities, following completion of essential education and training. These include possessing and administering the 2022 influenza vaccine, obtaining valid consent (where authorised), record keeping and disposing of clinical waste. The PHEOs relevant to the influenza vaccine in Victoria can be accessed from: Compliance with the current version of these guidelines at the time of vaccine administration is a condition of the PHEOs. Healthcare professionals and students Select healthcare professionals and s elect year students are authorised to administer the 2022 influenza vaccine to people aged five years and older in health services, primary care and community pharmacy settings, including the designated premises of outreach services they provide. Vaccinati on may be undertaken in pre -arranged vaccination sites that differ from the primary premises of the vaccination service provider. For example, a health service provides a pre -arranged mobile vaccination service in a specially equipped bus to a vulnerable c ommunity group as part of outreach service provision. Please note that under the Commonwealth's Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS), the workforces eligible for Commonwealth program funding to perform influenza vaccination activities within general practice/pri mary care settings may differ from those described within Victoria's Secretary Approvals and PHEOs. It is the responsibility of the vaccination service provider to ensure compliance with Commonwealth program rules. Vaccination service providers in these se ttings should also confirm appropriate clinical governance and medical indemnity insurance arrangements are in place. See relevant sections below for further details. Limited Scope Vaccinators Limited Scope Vaccinators are authorised to administer the 2022 influenza vaccine to people aged 18 years and older in state -run vaccination services , including the designated premises of outreach services they provide. The designated premises for vaccination services are as per the example above and is the responsibi lity of the vaccination service provider to determine the appropriateness of the setting for vaccination and whether this workforce is appropriate to use in the delivery of outreach service provision. Limited Scope Vaccinators cannot : undertake vaccinati on of children aged under 18 years; or manage or support response to adverse events. In addition, the Position Description for Limited Scope Vaccinators does not allow them obtain consent for vaccination. See section below on ' Obtaining consent for vaccination ' as to the model of care when consent is obtained by a supervising authorised immuniser or trained emergency authorised workforce, but the vaccine is administered by a Limited Scope Vaccinator. Workforce requirements Under the time -limited emergency orders, emergency authorised workforces are eligible to participate in the 2022 influenza vaccination programs where they: hold appropriate registration with their professional regulating body (e.g. Ahpra) or Australian industry or professional association (where specified); have successfully completed all mandatory training and assessments comply with all supervision ratios and requirements outlined below comply with the version of Appendix 24 of the Victoria n COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines (this document) current at the time of vaccine administration. Emergency authorised workforces must ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Australian Immunisation Handbook , the National Vaccine Storage Guidelines: Strive for 5 , and any g uidance issued by the department relating to influenza vaccination. Vaccination service providers must be clear about the authorisation scope and status of their vaccination team members, including the restrictions and requirements under which they are au thorised to administer the vaccine. The influenza vaccination provider must ensure that any emergency authorised workforce meets and maintains the requirements for professional registration for the full period of their engagement, where applicable. It's strongly recommended that the influenza vaccination provider develops and institutes policies/procedures to confirm all emergency authorised workforces' registration status on initial engagement. Training requirements It is the responsibility of the v accination service provider to: identify members of the workforce who need to complete pre -requisite training modules structure a training plan accordingly confirm and document that training has been completed, manage the associated records of training completion, and notify the workforce of any updates to training packages ensure staff have the appropriate experience or have demonstrated the skills and competencies to fulfill their role safely within their individual scope of practice. Training requirement s for all emergency authorised workforces Emergency authorised workforces administering the 2022 influenza vaccine must complete the following training included in Table 2 . Table 2: Training for emergency authorised workforces Training activity Topics covered Certification Victorian COVID -19 eLearning Competency Training Package https://education - mvec.mcri.edu.au/courses/dh - covid19/ eLearning modules (approximately 3 hours) The immune system and immunisation Preparation for vaccination Administering vaccines Adverse events following immunisation User issued with a certificate of completion through Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC). Influenza vaccination online training module https://vic -immunisation - learning.com/ ) eLearning module (approximately 15 minutes) Information about influenza Pre-vaccination screening, contraindications, precautions Post-vaccination care User issued a certificate of completion through department's Learning Management System. Practical competency assessment A practical competency assessment is requir ed to verify that every emergency authorised worker is deemed clinically skilled and competent to administer influenza vaccines, including pre - screening and the provision of after -care advice. The department recognises that a large portion of the \"newly\" a uthorised workforce will have already completed a COVID -19 Vaccination Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment (see Appendix 5 of the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines for details). Vaccination service providers are recommended to assess the need for additional training and assessment to ensure emergency authorised workforces can appropriately address queries relating to 2022 influenza vaccination. If an emergency authorised worker has not completed the COVID -19 Vaccination Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment, it is recommended that the vaccination service provider undertake a competency assessment that includes a minimum of five influenza vaccinations performed under the direct supervision of a supervising authorised immuniser. Certification is completed in the workplace by an experienced supervising authorised immuniser. Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre: Immunising children and infants' webina r Only applies to workforce who are authorised and vaccinating children aged 5 -11 years. eLearning webinar (approximately 60 minutes) Age-appropriate positioning for safe vaccination Distraction tools for different age groups Communication and consent Identifying correct injection sites for injection of children How to manage difficult immunisations encoun ters and adverse reactions. User issued with a certificate of completion through MVEC. Vaccination service providers should have processes in place to ensure that all records of influenza vaccine administration are reported in a timely manner to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR). This may require that emergency authorised workforces are additionally trained to support this mandatory reporting requirement. Please refer to the section below 'Keeping and accessing records related to vaccination' for further details. Training requirements for Limited Scope Vaccinators In addition to the abovementioned training in Table 2 Limited Scope Vaccinators are also required to complete the Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination Training Program modules . It is envisaged that Limited Scope Vaccinators already engaged by public health services to undertake COVID -19 vaccination activities can be upskilled and assessed as competent to also administer the 2022 influenza vaccine. Limited Scope (COVID -19) Vaccinators administering t he COVID -19 vaccine must do so in accordance cessary training (including the mandatory Commonwealth COVID -19 vaccination training package), competency assessments and other requirements. Evidence of mandatory training completion (i.e. MVEC certification and Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination Trainin g Program certificate) can be provided to employers for their records for both authorisations, without having to repeat the training. Limited Scope Vaccinators must remain current with all updates to vaccination training when administering either the influ enza vaccine, or the COVID -19 vaccine under PHEO #16. Completion of this specified training will ensure that all Limited Scope Vaccinators can continue to contribute to the COVID -19 vaccine program should circumstances change and additional workforces are required to support the program. Workforce requirements for vaccination of children aged 5 -11 years Emergency authorised workforces (excluding Limited Scope Vaccinators) are eligible to administer the influenza vaccine to persons aged 5 years and older. If this includes children aged 5 -11 years, the suitability of emergency authorised workforce should be considered, including their experience as a vaccinator, communication skills, and previous experience working with children. All emergency authori sed workforces involved in the administration of the 2022 influenza vaccine to a person aged 5 -11 years of age must complete the eLearning webinar ' Immunising children and infants' by Melbourne Vaccine Centre (MVEC). The webinar is available from: MVEC immunising children and The tion Centre (mcri.edu.au) . All emergency authorised workforces undertaking vaccination of children aged 5 -11 years should have undertaken practical training and be able to demonstrate the clinical skills and competencies (as applicable to the 2022 influe nza vaccine) set out in Appendix 5, Part 2 of the COVID -19 Clinical Skills and Competencies Assessment. A Working with Children's Check is recommended but not required for those involved in the vaccination of children a nd adolescents. Please note that Limited Scope Vaccinators are not authorised to undertake vaccination of children aged under 18 years. Additional training and resources for vaccinating children aged 5 -11 years can be found in the Victorian COVID -19 Vacci nation Guidelines at section ' Workforce requirements for vaccination of children aged 5 -11 years '. Supervision requirements All workforces eligible to administer the 2022 influenza vaccine must be under the supervision of an immuniser . Authorised immunisers include nurse immunisers, pharmacist and nurse practitioners (within scope). Supervising authorised immunisers should have additional knowledge and experience in the technical aspects of vaccination which enables them to respond to clinical questions and issues escalated to them by the emergency authorised workforce, including the management of an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) and the administration of adrenaline, if required. Supervising authorised immunisers should have the relevant skills and experience (preferably approximately 6 months experience and current/recently completed anaphylaxis management and basic first aid) to provide supervision to those less experienced, and emergency authorised workforces. When the emergency authorised workforce (whether healthcare professional, student or Limited Scope Vaccinator) has completed all training and assessments, and are deemed clinically competent in all vaccination activities, supervising authorised immunisers can provide clinical supervision of up to 15 emergency authorised workforce personnel (i.e. a ratio of 1:15) . They must ensure that the vaccination clinic can continue to operate i n parallel to any responses to an AEFI. This supervision ratio aligns with the current Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Program guidance. Supervision must occur as per Indirect Supervision I: Supervisee must consult with the nominated supervisor, with the nominated supervisor required to always be physically present in the workplace during opening hours and available during those times to observe and discuss the management of clients and/or the performance of the supervisee when necessary. Where the emer gency authorised worker has not previously demonstrated practical competence in all authorised vaccination activities, the supervisor should demonstrate, teach and supervise all authorised vaccination activities, until such time as the worker's supervisor is confident the worker demonstrates practical competence prior to undertaking the authorised vaccination activities. Please note that enrolled nurses (without notation) and nursing and midwifery students must be supervised by a nurse immuniser or nurse pr actitioner as per Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia requirements. For more information on supervision requirements equally applicable to emergency authorised workforces administering the influenza vaccine, please refer to the 'Workforce requirements ' section of the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines. Obtaining consent for vaccination Pre-vaccination screening and obtaining consent is an essential part of the vaccination process. Any person who administers a vaccine must obtain valid consent prior to administering the vaccine. It is expected that processes will be established to ensure that a member of the authorised workforce (other than a Limited Scope Vaccinator) will obtain consent prior t o the administration of a vaccine, and especially if the vaccine is to be administered by a Limited Scope Vaccinator. The common law requires that consent must be informed, that is, the vaccine recipient (or their decision maker) must have been given adequ ate information to enable them to make an informed decision about vaccination. In order to provide informed consent, the vaccine recipient (or their decision maker) requires specific information about the vaccine, its side effects and the disease it is pro tecting against by someone who has the skills and knowledge to provide this information and to answer questions that might arise during this process. The Position Description for Limited Scope Vaccinators does not allow them to obtain consent, so processes must be in place to ensure that informed consent is obtained by an authorised vaccinator prior to the Limited Scope Vaccinator administering the influenza vaccine. A pre-screening checklist for these processes is included in the Australian Immunisation Handbook . For more information on obtaining consent for specific patient cohorts (including those in aged care, disability, mental health settings and for children under the age of 18 years) please refer to the section ' Obtaining consent for vaccination ' within t he Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines. Keeping and accessing records related to vaccination It is the responsibility of the vaccination service provider to ensure that the administration of all vaccination records complies with relevant legislation. Reporting data to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) As of 1 July 2021, all vaccination service providers are required to report the influenza and other National Immunisation Program vaccinations administered to the AIR. The following manner and p eriod of reporting will apply: Manner of reporting: electronic or if this is not reasonably practical then in written form Reporting period: within 24 hours, and no more than 10 working days after the vaccination Personal information: Medicare number (if applicable), name, date of birth, gender Vaccine information: brand name, dose number and batch number, date of administration Provider information: provider number, name and contact details. More information is available from the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines and the AIR website . Medical and professional indemnity insurances Vaccination service providers, education providers and authorised workforces are required to hold appropriate insurance for the administration o f vaccines and provision of a vaccination service. Emergency authorised workforces administering vaccines while employed, contracted or otherwise engaged by a publicly funded health service will be covered by the service providers' medical indemnity insura nce. Staff working outside a publicly funded health service, for example in primary care settings or a private hospital, should confirm medical indemnity insurance arrangements with their employer before engaging in any vaccination activities. Influenza v accine information, cold chain management, reporting adverse events and other program requirements Vaccination service providers are strongly advised to regularly check the department's Immunisation webpage at: https://www.health.vic.gov.au/public -health/immunisation . This page is updated regularly and includes the latest recommendations from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), cold chain management proced ures including how to manage and maintain cold chain including during power outages and how to report a breach of temperature, and reporting adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) including what, when and where to report an AEFI. Governance All vacci nation service providers will be responsible for organising the governance and leadership of their vaccination program. This includes services delivered on -site, at dedicated vaccination hubs or clinics, and outreach locations. All vaccination service prov iders must ensure that all staff involved in the vaccination service are aware of escalation processes for clinical and operational incidents, including reporting of suspected adverse events. Vaccination service providers and emergency authorised workforce s should be aware of the medico -legal regulations associated with vaccinators administering influenza vaccines to themselves and family members as well as recording their own vaccination and family member's vaccination. Please refer to guidance within the Victorian COVID -19 Vaccination Guidelines, section ' Code of Conduct: Self and family vaccinations '. This guidance applies equally to influenza vaccinations delivered by vaccination providers and emergency authorised wor kforces.

Moderna COVID -19 vaccine for ages 6 months - under 5 years ATAGI recommends Moderna COVID -19 vaccine can be used for primary vaccination in children aged 6 months to <5 years with severe immunocompromise, disability and those who have complex and/or multiple health conditions which increase risk of severe COVID -19. These includ e children with the following or similar conditions: - Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments as listed in the ATAGI advice on 3rd primary doses of COVID -19 vaccine in individuals who are severely immunocompromised (see Box 1) - Bone marrow or stem cell transplant or chimeric antigen T -cell (CAR -T) therapy' - Complex congenital cardiac disease; - Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease; - Type 1 diabetes mellitus; - Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions; or - A disa bility that require frequent assistance with activities of daily living, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). The recommendation is for 2 primary doses , except for those with severe immunocompromise who require 3 primary doses. The recommended interval between each dose is 8 weeks . ATAGI does not currently recommend vaccination for children aged 6 months to <5 years who are NOT in the above risk categories for severe COVID -19. The recommended dose for this age group is 25 microgra ms compared with 50 micrograms in children aged 6-11 and 100 micrograms for those aged 12 years and over. Where possible, it is preferable to separate administration of Moderna paediatric COVID -19 vaccine and other vaccines by 7 -14 days to minimise risk of adverse events such as fever. Prophylactic paracetamol to reduce risk of fever is not routinely recommended prior to or immediately after vaccination, however, can be given as required for any discomfort or fever after vaccination. COVID -19 vaccinati on is recommended to be deferred for 3 months after a confirmed SARS delivery Given the special needs of this group and the small size of the cohort to be vaccinated, only a small number of vaccination sites have been selected to deliver the vaccine. These sites include: state and territory paediatric hospital clinics some ge neral practices some Commonwealth Vaccination Clinics some Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services. Appointments will be available from 5 September 2022. Please visit the COVID -19 Vaccine Clinic Finder (covid -vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/boo king/) to secure an appointment. Check back regularly, as appointments will continue to be added by immunisation providers. The Easy Vaccine Access (EVA) service is also available to book a COVID -19 vaccination. Simply message the EVA call back service on 0481 611 382 between 7 am and 10 pm (AEST), 7 days per week. The National Coronavirus Helpline provides information about COVID -19 and vaccinations. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and reached by calling 1800 020 080. Safety Considerations Risk of Vaccine Errors A new formulation of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine has been developed for use in children under 5 years of age (6 months to 4 years). With the introduction of a new formula and dose, there is potential for errors in vaccine handling, pres cribing and administration. Potential risks of vaccine errors for this age group include : Incorrect formulation which may result in overdosing Incorrect volume (dose) administered resulting in over - or underdosing Errors in the number of doses administered and/or dosing intervals Potential for partial doses (children moving arm out of way/inexperienced workforce) and therefore also a risk of needlestick injury Mitigation strategies include : Adequate training of staff for correct selection and preparation of vaccine and review of product information before administering vaccine. The use of systematic pre -vaccination screening to ensure the right person is getting the correct formulation and dosage of vaccine via the right route and injection sit e at the right time. Additional training for providers to ensure age-appropriate immunisation delivery including correct route of administration and injection site of administration. The use of colourful pos ters in the vaccination preparation area which clearly demonstrate the different formulations and how they need to be prepared. The provision of clear written and verbal information to parents and/or guardians so that they have a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of vaccination and the required number and timing of doses. Provision of these materials in various transla ted versions would also be helpful. Vaccine storage and handling procedures that ensure the correct vaccine is being selected for administration. There is also a risk that COVID -19 vaccination in this age cohort may interfere with the administration of o ther important childhood vaccines on the National Immunisation Program (NIP) and/or result in confusion between which vaccine is responsible for an adverse event following immunisation AEFI). Authorised vaccinators should continue to mitigate errors with u sual process of medication management and report any vaccine errors. For further information on vaccine errors see ATAGI Vac cine Errors and on reporting see Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) Risk of Needlestick Injury A needlestick injury can happen when the needle from a syringe used for injection accidentally pricks or cuts the skin and can affect both the immuniser or the child/parent/guardian. Infants and children in this age group are at increased risk of injury as they are highly mobile, easily distracted and have varying capacity to follow instructions. Mitigati on strategies include, but are not limited to: Vaccine providers must ensure all needles are safely disposed of in a sharps container, and needles should not be recapped. Sharps containers should comply with the Australian Standards, should have a wide nec k to avoid the need to push objects into the container, and must never be overfilled Positioning the approved sharps container at the point -of-use, away from the infant of child Use of Distraction techniques to provide a calm environment for the child so that they will stay still for the procedure. The child should be positioned safely in the cuddle/straddle p osition and the immunisation provider should be confident that the parent is able to hold the child appropriately or seek additional support from another immuniser. For further information, see Difference i n administration technique for infants under 12 months Preparing for vaccination Eligibility Confirmation Before administering the vaccine, an immuniser must confirm the child's details and verify the minimum eligible age (6 months to 4 years) with identification (ID) such as the General Practitioner software, My Health, Learning and Development Record (green book) or an equivalent interstate record or confirm the child's details with the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) if this record is not available. For those without Medicare details such as newly arrived migrants, refugees or asylum seekers, other proof of age documents can be used, such as: Birth certificate Passport A letter from the child's general practitioner (if no other form of identification is available) A statutory declaration from the child's parent or guardian is not recommended as proof of age but can be used on discretion of the health provider. The child should be clinically assessed, and their details confirmed before administering the vaccine; Review consent forms Undertake pre -vaccination assessment Provide an opportunity for the child and parent/guardian to raise any questions Instruct the child and parent/guardian to wait for at least 15 minutes, as a safety requirement, while the child is observed for signs of adverse reaction. Provide information on post -vaccination self -care and direct the parent/guardian to read this (Available in a range of languages if applicable ). Informed consent A parent or guardian will be required to provide consent to vaccinate an infant/child, as the infant/child will not be competent to consent for themselves as per the Medical Treatment Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) (MTPD Act) . A medical treatment decision -maker for a child will be the child's parent, guardian, or other person with parental responsibility for the child who is available and willing to provide informed consent for the child's COVID -19 vaccination. Appropriate reading level English and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) resources should also be provided to the carers if resources permit. The health professional administering the vaccination is responsible for obtaining and recording consent for the child to be vaccinated against COVID -19. Other staff including administrative staff, and/or support workers can help to coordinate this proces s (by contacting the decision maker) but cannot record consent. Disability services and in -reach programs should have systems in place to support this process, if required. For more information refer to the additional resources on consent Appendix 24: Consent for COVID -19 vaccination administration in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. The Commonwealth have developed an information and consent form for parents and guardians of children aged 6 months to 5 years Pre-immunisation preparation Where possible, parents/guardians/carers should be provided with an immunisation plan (will be available prior to start of program) to guide the immunisation experience for the child and the parent. This can be completed ahead of ti me to provide the child and parent/guardian/carer with a level of control over the process, in terms of selecting who will accompany the child, time of day, toys, music or other distractions that the parent/carer/carer brings to the appointment. The parent /guardian/carer can record any previous negative immunisation experiences or anticipated anxiety and select the most appropriate immunisation pathway that may suit their child. Awareness of Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) services prior to and at the poin t of booking aims to provide the most appropriate immunisation experience first time for children with disability, special needs, needle phobia and/or anxiety. Equipment Access to portable emergency oxygen kits, a first aid kit, and an anaphylaxis respons e kit should be available on site. Equipment should be regularly checked and maintained in line with the organisation's policy on resuscitation equipment use. Please note that a defibrillator is rarely required for children. Most paediatric life support in itially focuses on airway and respiratory management. Preparing an anaphylaxis response kit Before each vaccination session, ensure that protocols, equipment, and medicine to manage anaphylaxis are available by keeping an anaphylaxisresponse kit on site. Ensure that a printed table with age-based adrenaline dosing is readily available.

See section on additional winter booster doses Not approved Not approved Not approved Children aged 5 years of age As per ATAGI , all children aged 5 years and above are recommended for COVID -19 vaccination as per advice for children 5 -11 years . Five year old children can receive either Moderna 25 micrograms or Pfizer 10 micrograms COVID -19 vaccine. It is preferred to complete a primary vacci nation schedule in children aged 5 years or older with the same brand of vaccine for both doses. Children who turn 6 years old between doses should receive the dose that is applicable to them on the day of vaccination. Providers should note that the dose of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine is the same for children aged 5 years and those aged 6 to 11 years. However, the Moderna dose increases from 25 micrograms in 5 year old children (0.25ml of 100mcg/ml BLUE cap vial) to 50 micr ograms for those aged 6 to 11 (0.25ml of 200mcg/ml RED cap vial) Product information The TGA has provided product information on Moderna. Preparation of vaccine The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine is supplied in two multidose vials: 3) 0.10mg/ml multi -dose vial WITH A BLUE cap (vial contains 2.5ml) a. 10 doses for use in children aged 6mths - under 5 years for a dose of 25g (0.25ml per dose) 4) For other preparation of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine, see product information. Only use BLUE cap multi -dose vials for vaccine administration to children younger than 6 years of age The vial should not be diluted. For further information on vaccine preparation, see product information. Please note a booster dose of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine has not been app roved for those under 18 years. The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine prefilled syringe (0.1mglml) should NOT be used in children younger than 6 years of age. 324 Administration of vaccines in children under 5 There are different injection sites recommended for children under the age of 5 compared to those under 12 months. Note: An infant refers to a baby under the age of 12 months , a child is over 12 months. The Vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in infants under 12 months of age . See Anatomical markers used to identify the vastus lateralis injection s ite on the anterolateral thigh This is because it is a large muscle and is free of neurovascular structures that could be harmed by vaccine administration. The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for intramuscular vaccination in children 12 months of age. See Anatomical markers used to identify the deltoid injection site Cuddle position for infants A video outlining this technique can be found on the Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) website Figure 1 - Differences in administration (injection site) for infants under 12 months Source: Images taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook Position the infant in a semi -recumbent cuddle position on the parent's/carer's lap (see figure 1. Positioning a child <12 months of age in the cuddle position ). The parent/carer should: Tuck the infant's inside arm against the parent's/carer's chest Securely hold the infant's outside arm and outside leg Flex the infant's outside knee to relax the vastus lateralis for intramuscular injections. Positions for older children Figure 2 - Positioning an older child in the cuddle position (Source: Images taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook ) 325 Sit child sideways on their carer's lap with their legs in between the carers thighs. The carer's outside (left) arm is wrapped around the back of the child and holding the child's left arm snuggly against the child's side. The carer is holding the child's left hand snuggly against the child's stomach with their right hand. The child's inside (right) arm is tucked under the carer's left armpit. This reveals the injection side in the child's left deltoid muscle. Another position for older children is the straddle position shown in figure 3. Figure 3 - Positioning an older child in the straddle position (Source: Imag es taken from the Australian Immunisation Handbook ) An older child may face the parent/carer with their legs straddled over the parent's/carer 's lap. The child's arms should be folded in front, and the parent/carer should hug the child's body to their chest. Alternatively, the child can 'hug' the parent/carer, with the parent's/carer's arms holding the child's arms in a reciprocal hug (see Figure.3 Positioning a child in the straddle position ). For further information on positioning of infants and children, please refer to The Australian Immunisation Handbook Recommended injection site and needle length for children Needle length and injection site are the same for this cohort as adults. Refer to Australian Immunisation Handbook for more information. 326 Managing AEFI in in infants and children under 5 years Diagram 2 - Managing AEFI in infants and children 6 months through 4 years (Source: Image fr om The Victorian Department of Health resource on vaccine side effects ) Common side effects for children and infants following immunisation can include: Mild fever (<38.5C) that doesn't last long Grizzly, unsettled, unhappy or sleepy Injection site discomfort where the needle was given: sore, red, burning, itching, or swelling for 1 -2 days and/or small hard lump for a few weeks For more information on AEFI in children under 5 years refer to the Australian Immunisation Handbook. Managing fever after immunisation Give extra fluids to drink and/or breastfeed more frequently. Do not overdress the infant/child if hot and do not have too many blankets on. Although routine use of paracetamol after vaccination is not recommended, it can be given if the infant/child has a fever for comfort . The dose of paracetamol for a child up to 12 years of age is 15 mg/kg/dose, every 4 -6 hours, up to 4 times a day. not give paracetamol for more than 48 hours without seeking medical advice. Managing injection site discomfort Many vaccine injections can c ause soreness, redness, itching, swelling, or burning at the injection site for 1 -2 days. Putting a wet cold cloth on the injection site can ease discomfort. Paracetamol and/or Ibuprofen may be needed to ease the discomfort (check the label for correct use ). Resources for parents/guardians/carers Resources on COVID -19 vaccination, including information on minor, common and expected side effects following COVID -19 vaccines are available from the Commonwealth COVID -19 Vaccination website. 327 Vaccine providers should provide information to the parent/guardian on how to manage common, minor, expected adverse events, and advise the parent/guardian to seek fur ther medical attention if more serious adverse events are experienced. Very rare vaccine side effects requiring immediate medical attention If the AEFI is unexpected, persistent, or severe, or if a parent/guardian is concerned about the child's condition, they must be encouraged to seek medical review from their doctor or immunisation nurse as soon as possible or go directly to a hospital. Par ent's/guardians should seek medical advice if an infant or child is unwell, as this may be due to another illness, not because of the vaccination. Reporting Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) Vaccine providers do not need to report minor, common , or expected side effects . Serious or unexpected AEFI All medically attended AEFI should be reported to SAEFVIC via online reporting at www.saefvic.org.au or by using the QR code. Medically attended events are defined as a visit to general practitioner, emergency department, or a hospital admission. A serious or unexpected adverse event following a COVID -19 vaccine requires IMMEDIATE notification addition to routine reporting via online SAEFVIC form . See red box (below). When reporting an adverse event following vaccination, providers should include in their report the details of the vaccine that was administered. 328 The Victorian Specialist Immunisation Services (VicSIS) The VicSIS team includes a broad range of vaccine experts, including infectious diseases specialists, immunologists, allergists, paediatricians, and nurse practitioners. It provides specialist vaccination services for adults and children who have experienced a signi ficant adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) with a COVID -19 vaccine, or for those who are identified as at-risk of experiencing an AEFI. An AEFI is considered significant if it is life -threatening, requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, deemed clinically significant, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. VicSIS clinicians provide comprehensive consultations and individua lised advice, both pre - and post - vaccination either face -to-face or via telehealth appointments. Vaccination under supervision or sedation can be facilitated where deemed necessary. A SAEFIVC report must be made if the referral relates to an adverse event following a COVID -19 immunisation. For more information on how to refer and criteria for referral, see the VicSIS Website Workforce Readiness and Training Workforce Requirements No amendments are required to the Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) or Secretary Approvals. Note: all COVID -19 vaccination workforces have been authorised to prepare and administer the COVID - 19 vaccine to persons as approved by the TGA (with the exception of the Limite d Scope COVID -19 Vaccinator role which is only authorised to administer to persons over 18 years). The Commonwealth COVID -19 (online) training package and (on -site) competency assessment have been updated to ensure the workforce has the knowledge, skills, and competence to administer to this younger age group. Experienced emergency authorised vaccination staff may be considered suitable to administer the COVID -19 vaccine to children aged under 5 years. These staff should demonstrate competency in administ ering the vaccine to this age group. A competency assessment will be provided by the department for all emergency authorised immunisers. Vaccination sites must ensure that an experienced authorised immuniser is present on -site, who has completed all requi red COVID -19 vaccination training and has completed anaphylaxis training within the past twelve months. It is also recommended that a health professional who has qualifications in basic paediatric life support be present in any setting where children aged under 5 are being vaccinated. Vaccination site leads should consider the competence and experience of their workforce to determine their suitability to vaccinate infants and young children. For the purposes of working in the COVID -19 vaccination program , a Working with Children Check (WWCC) is recommended regardless of role. Some organisations may have their own policies that require workers to have a WWCC and it may also be a requirement in some settings, for example schools. Employers are responsible f or ensuring that workers (including volunteers) have a WWCC where required. It is recommended that health services consider that all staff working with children receive training in mandatory recognising and reporting signs of a child at risk of harm, viole nce, or neglect. Additional Training for Authorised Workforce The Melbourne Vaccine Education Centre (MVEC) have an online webinar, Immunising Childr en and Infants that was developed when vaccination roll out extended to the 5 -11 years cohort. This training video takes into consideration the vaccination technique and advice for the under 5 cohort including the recommended 329 vaccination injection site for children under 12 months of age (vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh) and the technique for administering this injection. A further update to this webinar may be developed in the future and the MVEC site has additional resources, including COVID -19 vaccine FAQs l. Paediatric CPR and emergency management of AEFI in this age group is a requirement. Other Considerations Mandates for infants and children The National Immunisation Program (NIP) vaccines are not mandated in this preschool age group. However, to attend Early learning centres/childcare ( No Jab No Play legislation) the child must be up to date with their NIP vaccines according to the Australian Immunisation Register, immunisation history statement at the time of enrolment or be eligible for the 16 week support (grace) period provision . The COVID -19 vaccine is not mandatory for children and has not been included in the NIP so it is therefore not applicable to the 'No Jab' policies. Documentation Immunisation providers must document all vaccinations. It is mandatory to notify the Australian Immunisation Register . Providers can also document vaccination on their local clinical software/database and infant/child health book including the site of vaccination (e.g., right deltoid/left thigh) For more information on documentation, please refer to "}
