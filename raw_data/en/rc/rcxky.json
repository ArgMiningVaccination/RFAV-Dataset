The classic method uses acupuncture needles to stimulate acupuncture points, points located on the 12 main energy meridians. This ensures a bioenergetic balance of the human body, dominated by the duality of the two complementary elements Yin and Yang. In traditional Chinese medicine, known in English as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupuncture plays a major role, along with other complementary therapeutic methods, such as medicinal plants from China, where around 5000 are currently used species, many of them still unknown for scientific phytotherapy. Classical acupuncture with needles has undergone a permanent evolution and following research undertaken worldwide, nowadays we can benefit from modern variants, such as: electroacupuncture, acupuncture with soft laser, acupressure, etc., which are non-invasive, well-tolerated methods by certain groups of patients, especially children, and which are of great therapeutic efficacy. Acupuncture, in its various forms, finds its use in the therapy of all ailments, having special results in: rheumatic ailments, allergic diseases, sexual impotence, frigidity, insomnia, revitalization of the body, etc. A fascinating field is homeosyniatry, developed by the German doctor Weiche, a therapeutic method that harmoniously combines acupuncture with homeopathy.
