Dr. Saper recommended and performed surgery in July of 2020. This led to a complete recovery and returned our daughter to full participation in competitive sports. Dr. Saper always took time with us to explain each step and had a wonderful bedside manner with our daughter. We are so grateful that the injury is healed and our daughter can return to her normal life. We highly recommend Dr. Saper. - Dr. Saper sliced my knee open and turned part of my quad into a new ACL which amazes me to this day. He answered every question I had with a casual certainty and he always gave me concise advice which I greatly appreciated.
