Self-doubt, panic attacks, anxiety disorders, and personal fears of all kinds present major challenges to contemporary medical science. Rudolf Steiner's spiritual research offers a startlingly original and complementary contribution to this problem. True insight into psychological issues requires knowledge of the influences of spiritual beings, he suggests. In everyday life we are all confronted with metaphysical entities that can hinder or aid our development. Many forms of anxiety and self-doubt derive from such meetings on the border (or threshold) of consciousness. Furthermore, these \"threshold experiences\" are exacerbated today by a general loosening of the subtle bodies and components of the human soul. As these constitutional changes persist, according to Rudolf Steiner a condition of \"dissociation\" becomes increasingly common. A healthy emotional life will never be possible unless individuals engage in a conscious practice of personal self-development, strengthening their constitution through the action of one's \"I\"\u2014one's core self. The expertly selected and collated texts in Self-Doubt offer numerous cognitive and practical ideas for the improvement of everyday mental and emotional health. C O N T E N T S: 1.
