Yet there are other, lesser-known categories of treasure that also came out of Tutankhamun's tomb. This lecture will take a look at one such category in the form of botanical remains discovered within the tomb. These botanical treasures include dried-up botanical specimens (like flowers, wreaths, etc.), remains of food, drink and medicine, as well as botanical depictions decorating the artifacts from the tomb. The lecture will also explain where these specimens are stored today, including the world-famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and what research is being done with regard to ancient Egyptian botany. ELIXIR: Nature's Healing Herbs 2017 \u00c9tudes et Travaux 31 2018 On the inner north wall of the Southern Room of Amun in the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari there is a depiction of the so-called frieze of objects, arranged in two rows. In the upper one vessels with oils containing four out of the so-called seven sacred oils and ntjw were located. It can be observed that in the sequence of the oils from the 'seven sacred oils', the third one - sf - has been replaced by ntjw and the two last oils are not depicted at all. In this paper the possible reasons for such a replacement as well as the role of both aromatic substances in the temple ritual in the early Eighteenth Dynasty are examined. This paper discusses the significance of cinnamon in the specific contexts it is mentioned in the Bible (Ex 32:28; Pr 4:14; SS 7:17; Re 18:2). Taking into account recent research on ancient maritime trade, the article also raises the theological implications of biblical references to exotic trade commodities (of which cinnamon is a prime example) for a wider perspective of God's dealings with the Nations, beyond the conventionally imagined 'World of the Bible'. The study brings together two disparate components, in the context of Scripture and Patristics, in a critical and creative examination in order to cultivate a critical reading of text, life narrative, or sociological experience. The first component is Chrism Oil or Myron (myrrh) which is the scented and consecrated oil used in Orthodox Church rituals and considered to be a Holy Oil. The second is the life and ministry of twenty and twenty-first French Orthodox lay Theologian Elisabeth Behr-Sigel. The purpose of this examination is to develop a novel hermeneutical interpretive approach constructed from constituents essential to historic Orthodox church belief and practice: Holy Chrism Oil and spiritual gifts or charisms. The study outlines an argument for the examination of charisms in the context of gender and spirituality (the fruit of the Spirit) and then continues to examine charisms of nurture as demonstrated (by faith) in the life of Elisabeth Behr-Sigel. In the study a small selection of the fragrant material confected into the Holy Myron (i.e. Rose oil, Balsam, Frankincense, Clove, Myron, and Cinnamon Oils) are examined to imaginatively and correlatively connect them metaphorically, by Biblical, Patristic, and history of material culture to the charisms of the Holy Spirit. The Myron and the charisms of nurture are connected in a creative metaphoric analogical construction to suggest a new hermeneutical critique which the study will term a chrismic critique and apply that critique to the particular life of Elisabeth Behr Sigel. Therefore, the study argues that Elisabeth Behr-Sigel, by the work of the Holy Spirit, manifested chrismic charisms of nurture and demonstrate her charisms of nurture to be a sweet-fragranced chrismic legacy gift of the Holy Spirit to the Church.
