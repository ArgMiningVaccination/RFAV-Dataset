There are many different meditation techniques and most of them are a passive process involving being still and emptying your mind and consciousness of all thought and feeling. In actuality, this is next to impossible to do. The thoughts and emotions of the human consciousness are nearly always present in some degree and will continually intrude upon almost any attempt to shut them out or quiet them completely. Within MSIA we teach another dimension to the meditative process which changes it from a passive technique of \"emptying the mind\" to an active technique of directing the mind and emotions.

It is ALIVE in the truest, most pure sense of the word. It is that part of you that never dies, always exists, always IS. It is an extension of God and a spark of the divine. It is your reality. The body, mind, and emotions are your illusions. Because the soul is active and dynamically alive, you must become active and alive in order to know this essence of yourself and awaken yourself to the reality of the dynamic beingness that is the soul. You cannot awaken to that which is active by being passive. You must become active to reach soul consciousness and that is why spiritual exercises are a key to Soul Transcendence.
