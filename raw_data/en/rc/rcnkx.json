Open Access Sarah Pakzad, Paul Bourque, Lise Gallant, Denise Donovan and Amir A Sepehry Article Type: Original Article | First Published: September 15, 2016 Aging is a major risk factor for dementia and evidence shows that community-dwelling elderly are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Family physicians (FP), as gatekeepers, play a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of dementia; hence an understanding of their perspective during this process is important. Currently, few studies have examined the Canadian FPs perspective towards dementia diagnosis using a validated questionnaire. Thus, a questionnaire to appraise FPs practices in the diagno... Open Access Lewis Mehl-Madrona Article Type: Case Series | First Published: September 12, 2016 Background and purpose: Post-stroke mania is thought to be rare, and has been described after lesions in the territory of the left medial cerebral artery, biparietal cortex, and the left putamen.

Open Access David Bradley and Willa Hsueh Article Type: Review Article | First Published: September 08, 2016 In the older patient population, rates of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and obesity are reaching epidemic proportions. In fact, older patients will soon constitute the majority of patients with T2D in most developed countries. The higher prevalence of T2D in older individuals is seen in both men and women and across racial and ethnic groups. However, certain ethnic groups are disproportionately affected and successful strategies must account for these fundamental differences....

Previous studies have shown that TAVR results in substantial reductions in symptoms and mortality. Despite these health benefits, the assessment of quality of life (QOL) remains critical in these patients who often express quality of life over quantity of life.... Open Access Paula Martinez Santos, Elena Batlle Lopez, Isidre Vilacosta, Beatriz Ruiz, Ma Article Article | First Published: levels and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT proBNP) have shown to be useful in predicting outcome in patients with heart failure (HF) and systolic dysfunction. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125) has also been associated to a higher risk of mortality and rehospitalization in patients with HF and impaired left ventricular systolic function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic role of these biomarkers among acute decompensated HF with preserved ejection fra... Open Access Pi-Ming Yeh Article Type: Review Literature | First Published: February 27, 2016 In 2014, an estimated 5.3 million people in the United States were diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a degenerative form of dementia generally associated with aging process which begins with memory loss and leads to disorientation, impaired judgment, behavioral changes, and difficulties in speaking, walking, and swallowing in later stages. As Americans age, the number of persons with this condition is anticipated to rise to 16 million by 2050.... Open Access Golnar Alamdari and Luciana Lagana Article Type: Research Article | First Published: December 31, 2015 In a high quality research study conducted earlier this year, Outcalt, Kroenke, Krebs, et al. emphasized that depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are often present in individuals living with chronic pain and typically have negative consequences on both the experience of pain and health outcomes, yet, the specific nature of the pain-depression-PTSD link remains unclear. This is especially applicable to older adults, a population that has seldom been studied on this topic....

Yung Article Type: Research Article | First Published: September 02, 2015 Balance impairment is common among older adults and estimates of its prevalence range between 20 and 50%. In basic terms, loss of balance occurs when the center of mass (CoM) falls out of alignment with the base of support (BoS). With about two-thirds of body mass about two-thirds of body height above a relatively narrow BoS, human bipedal stance and gait are inherently low in stability. Further, the BoS is about halved when standing on one leg, adding to the potential instability. It is therefo... Open Access Annelies Cools, Delphine Vaneechoutte, Mirko Petrovic and Ruth Piers Article Type: Research Article | First Published: August 26, 2015 During the last decades, there has been growing interest in high quality end-of-life care for the geriatric patient. This can be explained by the aging of the population, which leads to an increased number of frail, older patients who die in hospitals as a result of one or more chronic condition(s). The quality of end-of-life care for the geriatric patient is not optimal, characterized by inadequately treated symptoms and poor communication between health care professionals, patients and their f...
