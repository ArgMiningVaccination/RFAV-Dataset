[ ](https://emojipedia.org/white-medium-star/) \"My wife and I enjoyed both the hike and the yoga experience. My wife actually said it was one of the best days of her life, as it helped us connect with nature and energize our souls...\" - Anthony T. Featured In: I was burnt out from a successful yet stressful corporate career, ended a toxic long-term relationship and was struggling with an autoimmune disease when I quit my job in 2015. That same year, I lived out of a backpack while: completing my yoga teacher training in India, meditating with Buddhist monks in Thailand/Myanmar and hiking through the Himalayas, Alps and Andes mountains. After that, I felt drawn to Asheville, NC; which is about an hour from where I grew up. Because I personally experienced so much health, healing and happiness through yoga, meditation and nature, I decided to create a similar experience for others to enjoy. In 2017, I started experimenting by myself with one trail and a handful of adventurous guests. I am so grateful that we have grown to become a team of incredible local yoga teachers that guide hundreds of guests each year to connect with their bodies, minds and with these ancient Appalachian mountains.
