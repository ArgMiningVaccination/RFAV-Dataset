Have you looked in your medicine cabinet lately? You might findunused prescription medicines, expired over-the-counter productslike aspirin, cold remedies, vitamins and supplements, even petmedications. Do you think that flushing them down the toilet or the sink is the best way to get rid of them? STOP! You may have been told, even by a by a healthcare provider, that this is the preferred way to dispose of unwanted medications. Flushingunwanted drugs down the toilet or sink does prevent someone fromaccidentally or intentionally taking the medicine. But, disposing ofthem in this way causes water pollution because they pass throughseptic systems and sewage treatment plants untreated. Drugs in the water, even in highly diluted concentrations, can have adverse effects on fish and other aquatic wildlife . For example, estrogen and estrogen-mimicking compounds have been shown to cause a \"feminization\" of some kinds of fish. There may be human affects as well \u2014 therelease of antibiotics in the environment may account for an increased resistance of certain bacteria tothese antibiotics. Health care facilities and businesses are regulated and have systems in place to safely dispose of pharmaceuticals and hazardous wastes. But individuals have fewer options since consumer generatedpharmaceutical waste is not considered household hazardous waste (HHW) and cannot be brought to aHHW collection (primarily because controlled substances require special handling). However, we can do our part to prevent environmental damage by disposing of these products in the bestway possible \u2014 by safelyputting them in the trash . In Connecticut, most of our garbageis burned at Resource RecoveryFacilities at very high tempera-tures that will destroy theseproducts and prevent them fromgetting into our land and water. ( continued page 2 . . . ) What's in Your Medicine Cabinet What's New In P2? \u2014 from the Connecticut DEP Organic Land Care Pilot Project Purchasing Cooperative for Organic Fertilizers Smart Energy Game Naming and Taming the Toxics Recycling Roundup in Your The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) recommends that you carefully follow these steps before you put any medicines in the trash: 1.Keep the medication in its original container. To protect privacy and discourage misuse of the prescription, cross out the patient's name with a permanent maker or duct tape the label. 2. Modify the medications to discourage consumption. For solid medications, such as pills or capsules: add a small amount of water to at least partially dissolve them.For liquid medications: add enough table salt, flour, charcoal, or nontoxic powdered spice, suchas turmeric or mustard to make a pungent, unsightly mixture that discourages anyone fromeating it.For blister packs: wrap the blister packages containing pills in multiple layers of duct or otheropaque tape. 3. Seal and conceal . Tape the medication container lid shut with packing or duct tape.Place it inside a non-transparent bag or container such as an empty yogurt or margarine tub toensure that the contents cannot be seen. Do not conceal medicines in food products because animals could inadvertently consume them. 4.Discard the container in your garbage can. Do not place in your recycling bin!( continued from page 1) Of course, there are times when we need to take prescriptions or over the counter drugs, but we can also try to minimize the need for disposal. Here are some pollutionprevention practices to consider: If possible, ask your doctor to give you a smaller amount of a prescription or a sample of a drug that you are taking for the first time to see if it works for you. This may save you money and will also eliminate the need for throwing the drug away if it doesn't work for you. Do the same for animal prescriptions. Look at the expiration date on over-the-counter products. Will you be able to use all of it before the product expires? If not, maybe a smaller amount will do. Look into mail-back programs for sharps: See the Sustainable Hospitals website for a list of companies that provide containers at http://www.sustainablehospitals.org/cgi-bin/DB_Index.cgi (Sharps Containers - Mail Back Programs) or check with your local hospital. Note: DEP does not endorse any products. Contact vendors directly to purchase a product or to obtain moreinformation.Medicine Cabinet?

The selection process included a point ratingsystem for the application's questions followed up by on-site interviews with the three top-ratedmunicipalities. Over 30 municipalities throughout the state applied to participate. The Town of Manchester was selected due to its application's many strong points \u2014 the pilot field is located within a potential high-yield aquifer area and the town produces compost that may be used to top dress the field. The project will provide technical assistance to their town crew intransitioning from conventional turf management, including soil tests, site analysis and on-site trainingin organic methods from an accredited organic land care professional (see www.organiclandcare.net).Throughout the project, costs will be documented and outcomes measured. We are hopeful that this project will help us figure out ways to make organic land care more affordable for municipalities. For more information or if you want your e-mail address to be included in an electronic mailing list that we have created especially for this project, please contact Judy Prill, DEP Office of Pollution Prevention at (860) 424-3694 or e-mailto: judith.prill@po.state.ct.us . This will enable us to let you know about training opportunities and at the earliest opportunity we will share the results of the pilot project with you. Connecticut municipalities and non-profits cannow take advantage of the Capitol Region Pur-chasing Council's (CRPC) Grass Seed and Fertilizer Bid to purchase organic fertilizers . Several towns interested in organic land care requested that these fertilizers be added to the bid. CRPC usedOMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) standards tostandardize the specification for the fertilizers, which include Sustane 5-2-4 Fine Grade, 10-2-10 Fine 4-6-4 Turf GradeOrganic. The CRPC is a voluntary purchasing cooperative serving 66 communities, government agencies, andPurchasing Cooperative for Organic Fertilizers non-profits within the Capitol Region and beyond. Operating under the auspices of the Capitol RegionCouncil of Governments, the CRPC functions as both a supplemental procurement office for its member municipalities and as a central clearinghouse for thecollection and distribution of purchasing-relatedinformation and expertise. Membership is open to any government entity or non-profit.

The Game, basedon an exhibit at the Smart Living Center inOrange, helps students and adults understandthe benefits of going with Energy Starappliances. The colorful backdrop explainshow to play as well as pointing out the dollarssaved and carbon dioxide emissions reducedwith the 7 Energy Star appliances in thegame\u2014refrigerators, TVs, computers,dishwashers, lights, dehumidifiers and roomair conditioners. Teams of fifth-graders at the conference put game pieces representing standard efficiencyappliances in one tube and then put theEnergy Star equivalent of the same appliances in a second tube. Kilowatt-hours are markedon the tube so the students took the twoannual kWh totals and calculated the savingsfor their families if they were to switch out the7 appliances. Students played a second game, \"Pay Me\" focused on simple energy conservationmeasures, like turning off appliances. Whenasked what they would pledge to do to \"Besmart about energy\", 15 of the 23 checked off\"Talk to my parents about Energy Starappliances.\" All pledged to turn off or reduceusing something\u2014a light, the TV, therefrigerator. And ten pledged anincandescent bulb to an energy-savingcompact fluorescent light! DEP received assistance from the staff of the United Illuminating Company'sSmart Living Center and funding from the federal EPA to produce the game.If you are interested in borrowing the Smart Energy Game, contact Mary Sherwinat (860) 424-3246 or mary.sherwin@po.state.ct.us 5 P2VIEW | SPRING 2007Almost every day we hear about some new study that has concluded \"some-thing\" is good or bad for our health and/orthe environment. It's all very confusing.Where can you get reliable informationwithout spending hours on the Internet ortrying to find the right person to call?DEP staff found out about one resourceright in our own backyard \u2014 at the CTDepartment of Public Health (DPH). DPH's toxicologist Gary Ginsberg and epidemiologist Brian Toal presented \"Is it ToxicOr Not?\" at the March DEP Pollution PreventionLecture. Ginsberg and Toal informed theaudience employees about toxic chemicalingredients commonly found in the home,school and workplace, in the foods we consumeand in the air we breathe indoors and outsideand how these ingredients can affect yourhealth and impact the environment. Ginsberg explained that toxic ingredients are not just in cleaners and home maintenanceproducts\u2014they're in all kinds of consumerproducts, including make-up and personal careproducts and even in some toys. He alsowarned that we cannot assume that just because a product is on the store shelf,that it has been tested \"safe\" by somestate or federal agency .Naming and Taming The Toxics Although the message can sometimes seem to be all \"gloom and doom,\" they were quickto point out that exposure to many toxic chemicals can be lessened or avoidedcompletely . For example, we can eliminate the use of ammonia and bleach, (skin andlung irritants, asthma triggers) in our homesby using non-toxic cleaning products. Thesecleaning products are becoming easier tofind, even in regular supermarkets. (If youare so inclined, you can even make your own\u2014see below.) We can avoid exposure to phthalates, a chemical implicated inimpaired male fetal development, by neverstoring or microwaving food in #3 code (PVCplastic) containers, by not purchasing softvinyl toys, and avoiding bath and bodyproducts containing phthalates, especiallyduring pregnancy. By staying informed, you can make better choices for your health and theenvironment.

We turn on the evening news and hear reports of spills at schools, loading docks and, most recently, a couple of hundred pounds werediscovered on a Connecticut local road. Statewide, there has been a tremendous effortover the past five years to educate residents aboutthe dangers of mercury, and laws have been put inplace to ban the sale of many products thatcontain mercury. Mercury thermostats, bloodpressure cuffs and fever thermometers are amongthose products that are no longer available inConnecticut, since non-mercury alternatives exist.While most people know that thermometers and thermostats have mercury, many may not realizethat compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) alsocontain a small amount too, about 5 mg, and needto be disposed of properly. However, since CFLsare much more energy efficient than regular(incandescent) bulbs, and last almost 10 timeslonger, using them actually reduces mercuryemissions. This is so because burning fossil fuelsto produce electricity releases mercury into theenvironment, and incandescent bulbs use moreelectricity. When CFLs burn out they should be recycled at a household hazardous waste (HHW)collection and not just thrown in the trash. Most towns hold HHW collections each yearbetween April and October. To find out when your town will have a collection visithttp://www.ct.gov/dep/cwp/view.asp?a=2718&q=325448&depNav_GID=1646 . Remember to dispose of all of your HHW, including chemicals, pesticides, toxic cleaning products, and any other items, at a HHW collection. By now, most P2 View readers know that DEP has a new plan in place to manage the state's trash through the year 2024. However, what you may not know is that you can play a big role in helping accomplish the goals set out in the State's Solid Waste Management Plan by being part of a new Advisory Committee . We all create garbage \u2014 so we all need find ways to reduce, reuse and recycle everything we can. DEP needs your creative ideas to meet some very challenging goals that have been set, like doubling the current rate of recycling, dealing with issues such as electronic wastes, getting the toxics out,reducing the amount of packaging, and organics recycling (composting), to name a few. So, come join the new Advisory Committee that is being formed; membership is open to anyone that is interested. The first meeting of the Solid Waste Advisory Committee was held in March, but it is nottoo late to participate. Meetings will held each month on the fourth Tuesday.

Doyou have any tips on howto reduce my energy useand electric bill? I have afamily of four and I do aload of wash almost everyday and my dryer is over 10years old. Thanks! \u2014 Janice D., Waterbury, CT You're right. An electric dryer is the second biggest energyhog in the house after therefrigerator. Connecticut Lightand Power (CL & P) estimatesthat a typical electric dryer, operating 24 hours amonth, will cost $18-20/month ! There are some ways you can use your dryer moreefficiently. Don't overload the dryer. Items will dry better if theyhave room to tumble. Agood rule of thumb is onewasher load = one dryerload. Don't over-dry . Taking clothes out slightly dampwill eliminate wrinkles andthe need for ironing. Dry items of similar weight together - i.e., do towels, jeans, heavy flannelshirts in one load andlighter things, like sheets,shirts in another. Keep inmind that synthetics drymore quickly than cotton.Eartha Piggy back loads to take advantage of the heat of theprevious load or use thepermanent press cycle toallow items to dry using theresidual heat in the dryer Consider eliminating those dryer sheets . The dryer sheets can build up acoating on the dyer's lintscreen and moisture sensor,making the dryer lessefficient. If you can't giveup the dryer sheets, at leastclean the lint screen and themoisture sensor occasion-ally. Clean the lint filter after every load ! Make sure the outside dryer exhaust is notblocked . If you are in the market for a new dryer: New dryers arebetter insulated and are moreefficient. Consider buying onewith a moisture sensor. Amoisture sensor will turn offthe machine when the clothesare dry. If you have the gashook-up, you might consider \u2014 Eartha\u2014 Eartha\u2014 Eartha\u2014 Eartha\u2014 Earthabuying a gas dryer; it will cost about half as much to operateas an electric one. By the way,you won't find any energy star-rated dryers because all dryerswork about the same. Of course, the way you can save 100% over what you arespending on drying time is tonot use the dryer at all. Hang your clothes outside FOR FREE ! If you have seasonal allergies, this maynot be an option. If youdon't like how your towelsor jeans feel when they areline-dried, consider usingthe clothesline for sheetsand other items. If line drying is out of the question, considerbuying a clothes rack forinside .
