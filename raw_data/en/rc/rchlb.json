With several (active and passive) vaccine candidates in clinical trials currently, it is possible a S. aureus vaccine may be available for individuals at risk by the end of the next decade. The prevalence of MRSA in the hospital and community setting will most likely continue to rise, which will increase the need for real-time diagnostics to inform the clinician of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of specific superantigens or cytolysins so optimal therapy can be utilized. Owing to continued increase in resistance and availability of newer antibiotics with less toxicity, vancomycin will most likely no longer be the antimicrobial of choice for MRSA infections in the hospital setting. Therapeutics Targeted at the Effects of Exotoxins on Mucosal & Skin Surfaces Despite these advances, the study of the pathogenesis of S. aureus will continue to evolve with an overall focus on the role of exotoxins and their effects on mucosal and skin surfaces, that is, the site of infection. Recently, a study described the role of metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) on host cells, which interacts with -toxin and is required to initiate the cytolytic pore and inflammatory effects of -toxin on mammalian cells.[ [99](javascript:void(0);)] This is the first study identifying a host receptor for -toxin, despite decades of research describing the effects of this toxin on mammalian cells, and this finding will most likely lead to new therapeutic anti-staphylococcal agents. Likewise, superantigens have been reported to induce changes in epithelial cellular morphology and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines from vaginal, [100-103](javascript:void(0);)] Although the host receptor(s) for superantigens has yet to be determined, the ability of a topical agent, GML, to reduce exotoxin production and overall proinflammatory cytokines at the site of infection and increase survival in a rabbit model of TSS,[ [85](javascript:void(0);)] suggests anti-inflammatory effects on mucosal surfaces are an important consideration in the development of therapeutics. An overall understanding of the exoproteins most important in the ability of S. aureus to cause infection and the corresponding host immunological responses (i.e., mucosal response) is critical and will open new areas of research. New therapeutic agents are being developed currently to support this area of research, including anti-toxin production and neutralizing agents, and/or receptor antagonists, mucosal anti-inflammatory agents and vaccines derived from toxoids.
