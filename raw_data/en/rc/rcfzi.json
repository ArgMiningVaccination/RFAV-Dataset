This is where the final assembly of the short- and medium-range A320 takes place - using components brought in from all over Europe. It's also where the huge A380 gets a coat of high-performance varnish in the world's largest painting hangar. New plastic components reinforced with carbon fiber are being developed to make the aircraft of the future lighter and more stable. Technicians and flight crews conduct virtual tests on each and every plane. The high-tech future is taking off. 15 T he Port of the Future Container ships have always been big and they are getting even bigger. More and more cargo has to be transported and handled as speedily as possible. But how will the world's ports cope with these higher volumes in the coming decades? While Dubai's Jebel Ali Port has focused on expanding its footprint, the port of Hamburg, where more real estate is not available, has focused on automation and rationalization, and Rotterdam has built the world's first fully-automated terminals. What do these developments and trends mean for the ports of the future? 16 Off shore Heroes Out on the high seas, the wind and waves rule - a fact that is respected by the builders of offshore wind farms, as they erect gigantic structures out at sea. One large German wind farm is 140 kilometers from the coast. Manufacturing the huge turbines on land is only the first challenge facing constructors. Living and working out at sea requires courage, strength and skill in a daily battle with the forces of nature. 17 Hi gh-tech Trucks on the Autobahn In goods traffic on Germany's highways, nothing is left to chance. The trucks are part of a high-precision logistics system. Customer deliveries are timed to the minute. To ensure the system works, trucks are monitored via satellite. Sensors in the asphalt count the vehicles: if there are too many on the roads, the speed limit on the digital road signs is reduced. Congestion managers provide real-time information to radio stations and navi - gation systems. The priorities are to prevent traffic jams and ensure maximum safety. 18 M an's Dream of Flight \"I fly, therefore I am\" - that is the idea driving inventors and engineers to fly ever higher and further using as few resources as possible. Their innovations, such as paragliders and wingsuits, are not only exciting for extreme sportsmen and women. Latest developments in ultra-light aircraft and solar aircraft are paving the way for a more flexible and environ-mentally-friendly future.VERSIONS Arabic, English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide.

For example, the dis- covery of fiber optics has made it possible to take a close look at the stomach or intestine and identify problem zones. Computer tomography creates three-dimensional images without using harmful X-rays. Intensive care medicine, transplantation medicine and genetic engineer - ing are now making it possible to tackle diseases previously regarded as incurable. But there is still much uncharted scientific territory, for example with regard to diseases that have only emerged with our civilization. 81 T he Human Microbiome - Maintaining Good Health With Useful Bacteria The skin, intestine and numerous other human organs are home to a multitude of micro- organisms. Not only are these harmless, they actually make vital processes such as diges-tion possible. But these microbe communities are often damaged by an unbalanced diet, antibiotics or excessive hygiene, resulting in serious illness. 82 Elimina tion Using Microparticles - The Gentle Alternative to Surgery Many women are diagnosed with benign uterine tumours. When they cause severe symp - toms, gynaecologists can recommend removal of the uterus. But there is a less drastic alternative: Blocking the flow of blood to the tumours with small particles. A similar method is used to treat benign prostate enlargment in male patients. 83 T he Doctor as Detective - Tracking Down Unknown Diseases There are cases in which doctors simply cannot identify an ailment. Some patients con - sult numerous specialists over the years without ever getting a diagnosis or therapy. A German cardiologist has set himself an ambitious goal: to find the correct treatment for patients whose symptoms challenge the standard diagnostic scheme. 84 Bl ocked Arteries - Identified Early, Treated Carefully It's usually older people who suffer from blocked leg arteries. That almost always causes severe calf pain and can result in a heart attack or stroke. But if the problem is spotted early enough, there are gentle ways to restore blood flow. 85 F ood Intolerance - Not Just a Fad Diagnosis For some, avoiding foods that contain gluten, lactose or fructose is a lifestyle choice. For others, it is a medical necessity. But the fact that some people are intolerant of these sub-stances does not mean that pasta products, dairy products or certain fruits are basically harmful. Those with sustained digestion problems should see their doctor, as intolerances and allergies can pose serious health risks.VERSIONS Arabic, English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide.

Without scientific dis - coveries, humanity would not have evolved at such a rapid pace. Life as we know it today would be unthinkable without the knowledge we gain through science and scholarship. Innovations and new insights are integrated into our lives in ever quicker succession. We watch scientists, technicians and inventors as they look for ways to increase human knowledge. These fascinat- ing films accompany them in their Quest for Knowledge. 66 Li ght Pollution - The Disappearing Darkness The Earth is becoming ever brighter. But too much artificial light at night can negatively affect the wellbeing of people and animals. Scientists are concerned at what they say are rising levels of light pollution. Is there anything that can be done, without plunging us into darkness? What steps can be taken to make our artificial lighting more sustainable and kinder to our health? 67 Mining on the Ocean Fl oor On the floor of the Pacific Ocean, at a depth of four kilometers, there are vast reserves of manganese nodules. These contain many rare metals used in the manufacture of elec - tronic devices. There are fears that extracting these metals could disrupt natural marine rhythms and threaten an ecosystem that we still don't really understand. Scientists are hoping that their research will ease the impact of deep-sea mining on the environment. 68 Lea ving Nothing to Chance? Researchers base a whole variety of prognoses on the tide of data generated by advancing digitalization. Predictive analytics uses data mining to create algorithms to predict trends in society and individual preferences. Such algorithms are of great interest both to the business world and to governments and their intelligence agencies. 69 Trus t Your Gut Our intestine is like a second brain: What's known as the enteric nervous system sur - rounds the entire organ, permanently sending information to the brain and influencing our emotions. Now researchers have discovered that humans fall into three different intestinal groups or enterotypes. Like blood groups, these are not linked to gender, age or ethnicity. The discovery has led to promising developments in the treatment of intestinal disorders and in nutrition research. 70 T he Decline of Alpine Glaciers Glaciers are places where the effects of climate change can be seen and measured on a daily basis. The retreat of glaciers in the Alps has been far more rapid than scientists had predicted. This is due to the exacerbation of global warming by local factors. The changes not only impact the Alpine ecosystem. Permafrost holds rocks and scree in place. If it melts, the results could be devastating.VERSIONS Arabic, English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide. Please contact your regional distribution partner.

As nature reserves, they promote the natural and long-term development of extensive habitats and their species and ecosystems. National parks provide people with the scope and space for scientific research and education, as well as for leisure and tourism. This series takes a fascinating look at national parks all over the world. Using breathtaking footage, we show the unique character of these biospheres. 14 Rebui lding a Reserve - Bouba Ndjida National Park, Cameroon The national park in northern Cameroon was established in 1968. After many years of neglect, it is once again being actively managed, thanks to close cooperation between the park authority and people living there. Bouba Ndjida is a refuge for eland antelopes, primates, wild cats, elephants and many other species. 15 Na ture Conservation Out at Sea - The Strait of Bonifacio International Marine Park, Fr ance and Italy This international marine park comprises a nature reserve on the French island of Corsica, a national park on the Italian island of Sardinia and the stretch of sea in-between, the Strait of Bonifacio. It is both a busy waterway and a protected ecosystem, frequented by supertankers and by rare animal and bird species. That presents conservationists with ecological and economic challenges. 16 Ne wfoundland's Raw Beauty - Gros Morne National Park, Canada Canadians simply refer to the island of Newfoundland, situated to the east of the main - land, as \"The Rock\" . The harsh climate of the North Atlantic defines the isolated rocky island and its fauna, with several species unique to the area. The national park plays a key role in the protection of the natural environment and the cultural legacy of the New - foundlanders, preserving them for future generations. 17 Und erwater World in Need of Protection - Western Pomerania Lagoon Area Na tional Park, Germany The park serves to protect a unique landscape both beside and in the Baltic Sea in north - eastern Germany. Research divers are documenting the little-known underwater world, thereby drawing attention to both the beauty of and the threat facing the fragile ecosys - tem there. A night dive provides marine biologists and photographers with new insights. 18 S pectacular Mountainscapes - Rocky Mountain National Park, USA Visitors to the state of Colorado in the heart of the United States are greeted by a pristine environment of mountains and animal habitats with breathtaking views. There are more than 60 peaks over 4,000 meters here, in one of the highest national parks in the country. Adventurers can explore the wilderness on horseback. 19 H abitat for People and Animals - National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molis e, Italy There are only a few dozen Marsican brown bears left in the wild. They are native to the rugged mountains and forests in and around the national park in the Apennines east of Rome.

The diversity of life on our planet is declining at an alarming rate. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threat-ened Species shows that not enough is being done to save them. The number of species on it has increased dramatically. Immediate, drastic action is required to preserve valuable habitats and halt the extinction of species. 27 Back on the P rairie: The Black-Footed Ferret The black-footed ferret was once just as common on the North American prairie as its most important prey, the prairie dog. The slender ferrets live in vacant prairie dog bur- rows. It appeared as though depleted prairie dog populations had led to the extinction of the ferret. But small populations were discovered in 1981 and are now flourishing again in the US and Canada, thanks to breeding programs. 28 Bazaru to, the Dugong Archipelago The Bazaruto Archipelago National Park in Mozambique is home to the only remaining viable population of dugongs on the eastern coast of Africa. Dugongs, a kind of sea cow, live in sea grass meadows in shallow coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific. The South African activist Karen Allen and her team at the national park are com - mitted to protecting this gentle species. 29 Ne w Home for the Tree Frog European tree frogs are small and green and can be heard for miles during mating season. They need pools free of fish to spawn, hedges and trees to hunt, and burrows to hibernate. Agriculture and river re-routing have destroyed many such landscapes. But the tree frog is now being introduced to a new habitat in western Germany. 30 T he Dolphin Farm Dolphins such as the bottlenose are becoming increasingly rare: they are finding less food, and fishermen view them as competition. To the north of the Italian island of Sar - dinia, a group of these animals is displaying astonishing behavioral changes. Interacting with a fish farm, they have found a new habitat and source of food. The changes have no detrimental effect on the aquaculture. 31 T asmanian Devils Under Threat The Tasmanian Devil is the world's largest carnivorous marsupial and a symbol of the islands of southern Australia. The animal is facing two challenges to its existence: 90 per cent of its population has been killed off by an aggressive, infectious type of cancer, and cars are a significiant threat to the rest. Animal activists and environmentalists are doing all they can to safeguard the species from extinction. 32 Rhinos f or the Serengeti The Serengeti in Tanzania is famous for its huge herds of herbivorous animals and the large feline predators that hunt them. Rhinos are the only animals that have almost completely disappeared from the national park, hunted almost to extinction by poach-ers. While heavily armed rangers try to protect the animals that are left, black rhinos from South Africa are being flown into the Serengeti to boost numbers.VERSIONS Arabic, English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide.

SAMPLE EPISODE 30 MINUTE VERSION Rwanda - Saving Marshland The Rugezi marsh in northern Rwanda is a headwater of the River Nile. But local agriculture is upsetting the balance of this pristine ecosphere. A conservation group is working to prohibit the wetlands from drying out any further. Kazakhstan - Saiga Antelope The vast grasslands of the Kazakh steppe are home to the saiga antelope. When the Soviet Union collapsed, local hunting regulations were no longer enforced. People killed the saiga for their meat and sold their horns. But now a disease is threatening to wipe out the animals entirely. Colombia - Creative Conservation A ravine in Bogot\u00e1 once used as an illegal dumping site now attracts tourists. And it's thanks to the hard work of people who live along the restored waterway. Nature once again flourishes in an area formerly associated with drugs and crime. Morocco - Drinking Water from Fog Water is a scarce and precious resource in the communities around Mount Boutmezguida in Morocco's Anti-Atlas mountain range. The region is one of the driest in the country - a situa - tion exacerbated by climate change. But one thing the area does have plenty of is fog.

And it has undergone dramatic developments in this regard over the last 100 years. But increasing industrialization of the sector has negative consequences: it burdens the environment and replaces manpower with technology, providing fewer people with a livelihood. If these developments continue unchecked, then before long the food we eat will be controlled by large corporations, and food markets will be geared towards short-term profit - at the expense of biodiversity and non- renewable resources such as land and water and at the expense of rural populations. But this is not the only way forward. Sustainable agriculture and an efficient smallholding economy can in the long term create equilibrium between food security and the utilization of natural resources. There are examples of this all over the world, pursued by people who are Farming for the Planet. 07 T he Quest for Food Security The future of food production is more uncertain than it has been in recent decades, and in light of the growing global population it has become an urgent issue. Due to rising meat consumption, the use of energy crops, pest infestations as well as crop and transport los-ses, less than half of the world's crop yield is available for human consumption. Projects in Tanzania, Brazil, the US, Germany and Switzerland show how food production can be made more sustainable, more environmentally friendly and less damaging to the health of the rural population. 08 Def ending Agriculture Against Drought Some 40 percent of the world's land surface is now classified as dry land. Scientists expect climate change to continue to exacerbate extreme heat in many parts of the world. How should agriculture respond to this? Technology provides many possibilities, but these are only within the reach of large-scale concerns in developed nations. But there are also simple, affordable solutions that are proving to be effective in poorer countries such as Burkina Faso. Here, education is the key. 09 T he Fight for Future Food Systems There are many different answers to the question of how to feed the world's growing human population. Dutch agronomist Peter Smeets favors high-tech, intensive crop cultivation and livestock farming in industrial zones around cities. German farmer and agronomist Felix zu L\u00f6wenstein wants to see decentralized, ecologically sustainable food production, which offers rural populations a long-term livelihood so they no longer move to urban centers. 10 W ine - The Future is Organic More pesticides and other chemicals are used to treat grapevines than any other food crop. But an increasing number of winegrowers are switching to more sustainable cul-tivation methods. Examples from Austria, Switzerland and Italy show that ecology and business can go hand in hand. 11 Lif e on a Biodynamic Farm The Pageot family runs a farm with dairy cattle and pigs, arable crops and a dairy in Brittany in northern France. They adhere to the principles of biodynamics, something initially regarded with great skepticism by their neighbors. But the method isn't mumbo jumbo, and the Pageots aren't dogmatic about it. They are simply doing what they believe works best in agriculture. VERSIONS Arabic, English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide. Please contact your regional distribution partner.

At least 150 million people worldwide are living as migrants in a country that is not their nation of origin, but many more are leaving behind all that is dear to them for a destination within their home country. The reasons are just as diverse as the ways and means: from labor migration and joining other family members, to escape from persecution and war. While some are only away for a short time, others know they will be relocating for several years, perhaps even for the rest of their lives. Most nations only welcome highly-qualified economic migrants. In our globalized world, more and more people are on the move. And they are having an increasing influence on political, societal and economic processes in both their nations of origin and their destination regions. The Migration Millennium highlights the difficulties and the consequences of flight and migration movements - but also the opportunities they present to our global community. 01 The Hellish Journey to Tijuana Every day, thousands of people from South and Central America head to the US. The main reason for their flight is violence by gangs and drug dealers in their homeland. But most of the refugees never reach their intended destination - they are threatened with prison, deportation and even death. 02 Villages of Abandoned Children in China In China, boomtowns are attracting millions of migrant workers. They pay a high price: their children are brought up by relatives, because only in their home villages do they have a right to education. An entire generation is missing from rural areas. 03 Money in Minutes Every year, migrant workers transfer many hundreds of billions of dollars to their families back home. These cash transfers have given rise to a whole industry, which utilizes migra-tion as its business model while at the same time forming its financial infrastructure. 04 Tahrib - The Endless Journey Tahrib is the name given in many African nations to the dangerous journey to Europe un - dertaken by refugees. Their one and only goal: to arrive safely. But even in many purport-edly safe countries, many refugees are exposed to dangers and repression. 05 On the Run - Children Disappearing Without Trace According to unofficial estimates, up to 30,000 child refugees in Europe can no longer be accounted for. Many are living in a parallel world that remains hidden to most. It is all too easy for them to fall into the hands of criminals who force them into prostitution or the drugs trade. 06 Latinos, the Changing Face of America Immigration is the very foundation of the US. Whereas most immigrants used to come from Europe, these days they come from South and Central American nations. It is esti - mated that by the year 2035, Latinos will make up 35 percent of the US population. This demographic change is already having an impact on American society. 07 Beirut Parc - Breaking Down Barriers Through Sport 'Soccer Camp Lebanon' is a project for kids in the capital Beirut and three other cities in Lebanon to play soccer. The teams are mixed in two respects: Boys and girls play together; Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian kids play together.

And where is this wonderful place? In the Lebanese capital Beirut. And the kids are taking part in 'Soccer Camp Lebanon' . Lebanon has more refugees relative to the size of its population than any other country. Here Syrian refugees live alongside Lebanese locals and Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave their homes decades ago - sometimes in close proximity. This has created a volatile situ - ation that requires a variety of strategies to build tolerance and mutual trust if social conflict is to be avoided. 'Soccer Camp Lebanon' , a nationwide tournament for children and young people, is an initia - tive of Germany's Goethe Institute and coaches at a local soccer school. Based on faith in the conciliatory power of soccer, it gives 900 youngsters from Beirut and three other Lebanese cities the chance to play soccer together, to escape from their everyday lives and gain new per - spectives in the process. At training sessions in mixed teams - boys and girls from Lebanese, Palestinian and Syrian families - and a closing tournament, the children have the opportunity to explore their cultural and social commonalities and differences. Beirut Parc - Kids Seeking Refuge in Football observes the young people and explores the impact of the soccer camp on their daily lives. The program provides an insight into how the youngsters and their families live in Lebanon - either as locals or refugees - and what role soc - cer can play in developing new perspectives and the foundation for a peaceful coexistence.VERSIONS Arabic, English, German, Spanish RIGHTS Worldwide ORDER NUMBER 88 4886WORLD ISSUES DOCUMENTARY 60 MIN.For further information please contact: Deutsche Welle Sales and Distribution 53110 Bonn, Germany Lenz T 429-2719 sales@dw.comFull Report Full Report spotlights key and current social developments that affect us all.

The investigative reports expose problems, provide explanations and offer visions of life in the future. 96 Ghetto Children - Marseille's Neglected Outskirts La Savine, a high-rise project on the outskirts of the French port city of Marseille, is for the most part home to socially marginalized people living in poverty. Ahmed Madi runs a youth soccer club there and makes every effort to ensure that his boys don't end up on the wrong tracks. 97 9/11 - Nothing Like It Was The US has been left deeply traumatized by the 9/11 terror attacks and the military con - flicts that began in their aftermath. The responses of individual Americans to this could not be more different, and show a country split down the middle. 98 China's Lonesome Sons - The Impact of the One-Child Policy China's one-child policy has had some unforeseen consequences. Because the male popu - lation outnumbers the female by 34 million, many young Chinese men feel they have no other choice but to travel to Laos or Vietnam to search for a partner. Traffickers also kidnap young women there and sell them as brides in China. 99 Shark-Finning in the Pacific - Palau's Fight Against Illegal Fishing The island state of Palau in the western Pacific Ocean imposed a ban on shark fishing years ago, in recognition of how important the animal is to healthy marine environments. The marine police tries to stop illegal shark hunting in the waters around Palau, but it only has one boat at its disposal. 100 Hell on Earth - The Suffering of Female Refugees Refugees often report that their flight entailed terrible and deeply traumatic experiences. Women are the worst affected, with incidences of physical and sexual violence running like a thread through their accounts. But few witnesses are courageous enough to talk about their experiences in front of a camera. 101 Ana Rosa's Campaign - The Right to Child Labor in Bolivia In Bolivia, it is legal for children aged 10 or older to work, even though that violates inter - national conventions on child labor. 11-year-old Ana Rosa is not, however, contesting the law. On the contrary, she goes to school and she goes to work every day; she is also on the board of the children's trade union. In her view, children have to help themselves. 102 Millions for Nothing - What Has Happened to Aid for Kenya's Largest Slum? For decades, donor countries have channeled billions of euros into development aid programs. But recipient nations have only felt the benefits in selected areas. The radio pre-senter Boy Dallas is known as 'the voice of Kibera' , the largest slum in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He wonders why, despite all the money and the involvement of public figures and more than 200 NGOs, Kibera is still in such a terrible state. 103 Housemaids in Singapore - Second-Class Migrants The housemaid market in Singapore is booming - young women employed by high-earn - ing families, most of them from foreign countries themselves, for a very low wage. They often have no rights, because there are no labor laws protecting housemaids. VERSIONS English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide. Please contact your regional distribution partner.

They are places to find shade and to rest, places for families and friends to gather. But the typical features of such gardens were developed much earlier: 2,500 years ago, the kings of Persia commissioned magnificent palace gardens, bursting with fragrant flowers and shrubs, cooled by watercourses, pools and fountains, and surrounded by high walls. Pavilions and trellises provided shade and dappled sunlight. The kings' engineers created underground channels to bring water from faraway sources. These palace gardens stood in stark contrast to the arid and inhospitable landscape that sur - rounded them. With their symmetry and opulent vegetation, they were seen as ideal images of nature. It is no coincidence that ideas of paradise in Judaism, Christianity and Islam were informed by such gardens. Whether on a grand scale, as the imposing park of a ruler's palace, or on a more modest scale as the courtyard of a merchant's house - this kind of garden spread, along with Islam, to the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, North Africa, Spain and the Indian subcontinent. While remaining true to its basic principles, it developed in different ways in each region. The gardens in Morocco's oases and coastal towns are often embellished with splendid archi - tectural elements, colorful ceramics and decorative metalwork. In India, under the Muslim Mughal emperors, many impressive parks were laid out, with huge ornamental pools. One famous example is at the Taj Mahal in Agra. In medieval Spain, horticulture flourished during the era of Moorish rule: For centuries, the opulent palace gardens of the Alhambra in Granada were also an inspiration to architects of Christian rulers. And in Arabia, the planners of public parks adhere to ancient tradition to this day: Fountains and streams with rippling water, trees that provide shade, and aromatic herbs are seen as indispensable features in spaces that offer the inhabitants of densely built-up cities relief from the heat and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. 01 P ersia - The Fount of Paradise 02 Mor occo - Artful Beauty 03 India - H armony and Magnificence 04 And alusia - The Moorish Garden as Leitmotif 05 Ar abia - Parks and Gardens for the 21st CenturyVERSIONS Arabic, English, Spanish RIGHTS Not available worldwide.

He was able to leave in 2015 and now lives in Berlin. In his recent work, he takes Europe to task for what he considers its disastrous refugee policy. He turns his despair and anger into art and protest. A solitary rubber dinghy floats in the Aegean between Turkey and Greece. Ai Weiwei cowers inside the boat. He cannot swim. What is the message? \"We are all refugees,\" the artist says. He has created memorials in museums and public spaces out of boats, lifejackets and clothes abandoned on Europe's beaches. The film gets close to Ai Weiwei, illuminates his work, and also gives a rare glimpse into his private life - with his mother in Beijing, with his son and partner in Berlin.

Peter Lindbergh has taken pictures of countless supermodels and stars, and has become a star in his own right for his artistry and boldness as a photographer. His approach to fashion pho - tography is very individual - and has been hugely influential. He establishes a very personalrelationship during photo shoots. His talent at getting people to open up and at capturing them at a single, particular moment, is what makes his pictures so special. Vogue magazine selected his iconic photo of supermodels in white shirts as the most memorable image of the 1990s. Lindbergh has a particular fondness for black-and-white photography, which he feels often conveys a particular kind of melancholy. His photos blend an avantgarde aesthetic with the un - pretentious style of the down-to-earth person that is Lindbergh.

They preserve the remains of the past for the future, and explore the wide range of human activity over many millennia. 27 Ice Age M asterpieces Ice Age people were perhaps not as different from us as we might think, given the spectacular archeological finds made in a group of caves in southwest Germany. The ornaments, statuettes and musical instruments are among the world's very oldest known works of art. They are testament to the skills, intelligence and creativity of people living 40,000 years ago. 28 T he Secret of the Spanish Ship Despite its name, the career of the \"Triunfante\" was far from glorious. In 1795, the Spanish battleship ran aground in the Bay of Roses on the northern Spanish Mediterra - nean coast and was abandoned.

But throughout the ages, recipes have been taken out of their context by travelers as a kind of culinary souvenir, as well as by migrants as a nostalgic reminder of their homeland. Over the years, these dishes have evolved through exposure to new cultural influences and eating habits. In this way, what starts out as unusual becomes a familiar item on our plates. Some of these dishes have known no limits to their success and absolved a remarkable global career in the process. Come with us on a culinary voyage of discovery. Bon app\u00e9tit! 14 Pizza - T he Global Fast Food Hit The first big waves of migrants from southern Italy reached the US in the 19th century. The Neapolitans arrived with the recipe for their national dish - pizza. It wasn't long before the new dish had captivated the taste buds of the New World. Today, it's not just a case of the Americanized version returning to Europe and competing with the original Italian fare. Pizza is also the most popular fast food in the world. 15 Barb ecue - Meat Cooked to Perfection It was invented by the French, perfected by the Americans and introduced to the rest of the world - the barbecue. But we're not talking about a few sausages and burgers out in the garden. A real barbecue involves cooking the meat for hours in the hot smoke of a wooden fire, then serving it with a variety of sauces to suit all tastes. Barbecue fever has now spread to the inhabitants of other continents. Like the typical oven, known as a smoker, the strictly regulated barbecue competitions from the US are also catching on. 16 T ofu, Miso and Soya Sauce - The Magic of the Soya Bean Centuries ago, Buddhist monks in China allowed soya milk to curdle, and named the re - sulting \"cheese\" tofu. The Japanese continued to develop it into its present soft form. Soya products are intrinsic to Asian cuisine. Tofu, miso soup and soya sauce are now regarded as key components of a healthy diet all over the world. And beyond the borders of Asia too, tofu is increasingly being regarded as a foodstuff in its own right, rather than just a substitute for meat. 17 P asta - Simple and Versatile Spaghetti, tortellini, ravioli - a success story initiated by the Arabs. The idea of drying pasta products was theirs, and they brought it to Italy during the Middle Ages. This meant that pasta was no longer just for the domestic kitchen. It became an industrial product that could be preserved and transported, in a variety of forms to appeal to all tastes. From that point on, the success of pasta knew no bounds. 18 T he Sausage - A Story with Two Endings The humble sausage handmade by Viennese butchers is steeped in legend, anecdotes and a multitude of questions. Why do the Viennese call the wiener a frankfurter? How did it evolve into today's hot dog? And what do an emperor, a countess and even a pope have to do with the sausage from Vienna? Although the wiener is a common snack food pretty much everywhere these days, its story is far from over.

But design involves more than just shaping and styling: good design is a complex process in which different and often contradictory require-ments have to be met to ensure that objects function in the desired way. Design is only good when aesthetic, ergonomic and ecological aspects, durability, function and comfort harmonize and complement one another.

The striking buildings of the modern era are characterized sometimes by structural achievements or the innovative use of materials, sometimes by a special language of form. In view of such architectural variety, it is impossible to talk in terms of a pan-European style. Yet constants and popular stylistic devices can be identified. In postmodern architecture everything seems pos- sible: from geometric cubes to organic domes, from neo-classical stylistic creations to futuristic constructions. To a certain extent, the latest examples of postmodern European architecture pay homage to the old rule \"form follows function\" , which dominated all schools of architecture and design in the early 20th century. We proudly present Euromaxx Architecture showcasing the most important and exciting and also the most controversial European buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Striker Franz Roth recalls: \"The ball came so high over me, the goalkeeper came towards me and at the moment when the defender almost brought me down, I tried to lift the ball over the goalie. He couldn't get to it and the ball went in under the bar. That was the goal. Fantastic! I kept the trophy over - night on my bedside table and stared at it. All night long...\" In the years that followed, Bayern Munich rapidly grew from erstwhile regional club to one of the most successful and best-known global soccer brands. Not least due to some 60 national and international titles and international star players, Bayern Munich's current membership stands at almost 300,000. Then there are about 4,300 fanclubs and millions of fans all over the world. \"What makes this club so special, isn't winning the Champions League, it's not the titles, it's the inclusive team concept with the fans,\" says Raffael, a fan from Puerto Rico. But at the same time, few clubs manage to polarize opinion in the soccer world like Bayern, a club you either hate or love. Real Madrid once branded it \"La Bestia Negra\" , a black beast that cannot be vanquished. Jaime Carrasco, a sports reporter for El Mundo says: \"There are in the world only two or three teams that have maintained such a continuous will to win over the years. Perhaps Barcelona and Madrid - and definitely FC Bayern.\" Philipp Lahm spent more than two decades \"asserting myself in the FC Bayern shark pool\" , an effort that eventually earned him the captain's shirt. Why can so few players resist the call from Munich? And how was a club with such strong southern German roots able to develop such global appeal? Club President Uli Hoeness says FC Bayern is \"for many people something akin to a homeland, a substitute family\" . Players, coaches and fans from all over the globe explain the global \"Bayern Munich Phenomenon\" .

It transcends boundaries, attracts people and unites them.\" This is the view of Horst Kriete, and it is shared by Bernd Storck and Michael Kr\u00fcger. The three German soccer coaches have worked abroad: Kriete in South Africa, Storck in Hungary, Kr\u00fcger in Sudan. One of the fascinating aspects of their work, they say, is being with people who have a different cultural background and mentality. \"It promotes tolerance,\" says Horst Kriete. \"It's not just a question of passing on what you know, you also learn things yourself.\" For example, the coaches have learned the importance of strik - ing the right tone with players and officials. \"You have to approach them. You have to engage them. You have to be firm. But you also have to be able to overlook certain shortcomings.\" Then, they will be happy and you'll also feel comfortable in this community, he says. They have learned to be more relaxed. A sentence Horst Kriete has heard time and time again during his many years in Africa is: \"You have the watch. But we have the time.\" They have learned not to view and judge everything from the perspective of rich European nations. Dur- ing their postings in Africa, Kriete and Kr\u00fcger often met people \"who are happier and enjoy life more than some who come from wealthy western countries.\" The three coaches are proud of their achievements. Some players trained by Kriete now occupy key positions in the South African Football Association. Storck has done so much to change the face of Hungarian soccer that players are again keen to play in the national squad. As for Kr\u00fcger, although he's since stopped working in Sudan, many there still hope he will one day return and coach the national squad.

Even though the concept of \"hits\" did not yet exist in the Baroque, Classical or Romantic era when they were composed. And often, they are just as popular today - if not more popular. What is it about these works that has made them so famous? What makes them so fascinating? When, where and how were they created? Who composed them? What motivated the composer to write this particular piece? How difficult or easy are they to sing or play? Where were they usually played in the past, and where are you most likely to hear them today? We shine a Spotlight On incomparable pieces of music. As well as playing excerpts of the music in question, we visit key locations in the creation process and provide an insight into the life and work of the composer. 01 L udwig van Beethoven's \"F\u00fcr Elise\" \"F\u00fcr Elise\" by Ludwig van Beethoven is one of the best-known pieces of piano music ever written. A catchy tune attempted by most students of the instrument, it's also one that virtuoso pianists like to perform as an encore. Beethoven started to work on the piece in 1808 but the score was not published until four decades after his death in 1827. It soon became very popular as more and more pianos were sold all over the world. A pop version by the French pianist Richard Clayderman became an international hit in the 1970s. The identity of the mysterious Elise named in the title has eluded scholars for two centuries. 02 Ed ward Elgar's \"Land of Hope and Glory\" \"Land of Hope and Glory\" is the most popular British hymn and the best-known work of the British composer Edward Elgar. Whether played in the concert hall or the soccer stadium, the music is recognizable to everyone after just a few notes. To this day, the piece serves as England's unofficial national anthem - a song used to celebrate a nation, but also to take it into war. When Elgar realized just how much his work had become associated with death and suffering, he withdrew from public life and ceased composing, devoting himself solely to observation of the natural world. Nevertheless, he will always be remem - bered for this hymn above all else. 03 S ergei Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\" \"Peter and the Wolf\" is the best-known work by Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev. But without the Moscow theater director Natalya Sats, he would never have written it at all. It was her idea to commission a piece that would tell children an en - gaging story while introducing them to the sounds of different instruments. It premiered in 1936.

Another factor is that in this symphony, Mahler attempts to answer one of humankind's most pressing existential questions: What is the point of life?
