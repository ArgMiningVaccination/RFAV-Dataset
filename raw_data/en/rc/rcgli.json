Learn more about our methodology and business model [here](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/methodology/). Our secret to getting deep sleep? Organic pillows. Unlike your traditional box store pillow, organic pillows are crafted from nontoxic materials, like pesticide-free cotton or chemical-free natural latex, so you'll never have to worry about your health (or the health of the planet) while sleeping. Organic pillows will last you longer too, given the fibers' superior quality. I.e., Don't let the price tags scare you; these pillows are a worthwhile investment. We've rounded up 9 brands offering varying sizes and plushness for the stomach sleeper, avid napper, and everyone in between. So stock up on your faves and rest without worry, friends. And while you're giving your bedroom an eco-friendly boost, check out our guides to [affordable organic mattresses](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/natural-and-eco-friendly-mattresses/), [organic mattress toppers](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/organic-mattress-toppers), and [organic mattress protectors](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/organic-mattress-protectors). 1. Avocado Organic Materials | GOLS Certified organic latex & cotton, GOTS Certified organic kapok fill Size & Firmness | Standard to King, Medium Plush Price of Standard Pillow | $109 [Avocado](https://avocadomattress.n5ka.net/OjRZA)'s organic pillows complement the brand's natural, nontoxic mattresses. Handmade in Los Angeles, these GREENGUARD Gold Certified pillows use GOLS Certified organic latex, organic jersey cotton liner, and organic kapok fill for a medium-plush feel to rest your tired head on. The B Corp also gives back to environmental causes, proving its dedication to sustainability time and time again. This pillow is best for sleepers who want medium support with the ability to add extra stuffing as needed. We love that Avocado includes a hefty bag of organic kapok so you can achieve the plushness you're after (we only used about half of ours). A quick word of advice: Be careful with the inner zipper so the stuffing doesn't get caught on the kapok! Overall, we adore this organic pillow and the super soft (machine washable!) quilted cover. We're definitely getting extra zzz's with this addition to our bed. *SAVE AN ADDITIONAL 10% WITH CODE [GOODTRADE](https://avocadomattress.n5ka.net/OjRZA) AT CHECKOUT 2. Birch Organic Materials | GOTS Certified organic cotton, wool, and natural latex Size & Firmness | Standard and King; Plush Support Price of Standard Pillow | $119 [Birch](https://birch.fziv.net/DPzN5) pillows are made with cruelty-free wool directly from New Zealand farmers and with natural latex sourced from Southeast Asia. Handmade in the USA, these GREENGUARD Gold and GOTS Certified pillows are cool and moisture-wicking, so you won't have any night sweats. As an added bonus, Birch donates one percent of sales to the National Forest Foundation. We tried the organic pillow in King-size and found it to be the perfect plushness for our preference (not too hard, not too soft). It was also one of the cooler pillow options on our list thanks to the organic wool. The cover is soft and cozy, and we love that it matches the organic cotton on our [Birch mattress](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/natural-and-eco-friendly-mattresses). Twinning! 3. Under the Canopy Organic Materials | Organic cotton & recycled polyfill Size & Firmness | Standard, King, & Euro; Medium or Firm Support Price of Standard Pillow | $38 For affordable down alternative pillows, [Under the Canopy](https://underthecanopy.com/collections/pillows?rfsn=5736094.c4d3b6&subid=mat-web-pg) is our go-to. Using an organic cotton shell and filled with recycled polyfill, these pillows are both hypoallergenic and OEKO-TEX Certified. Working with ethical and environmentally certified factories in India and Bahrain, the team also gives back to causes like women's empowerment and education. We tried both the firm and medium support pillows in King size and found we preferred the firmer option for the most supportive rest. Additionally, while Under the Canopy's pillows can be thrown in the washer, they don't come with a removable insert option (if that's important to you). At this price point, we're not complaining though. In fact, we've ordered a few more to fill out our bed. 4. Saatva Organic Materials | Organic cotton and American Talalay latex Size & Firmness | Queen and King; Medium-Plush Support Price of Queen Pillow | $165 [Saatva](https://prf.hn/l/7gepza3) wins for the most luxurious pillow on the list. And if you suffer from spine or neck pain, a few nights on this pillow may be a game-changer. We tried the Queen size, which comes with two (yes two!) removable covers and an inner pillow. It's soft yet supportive, and the brand isn't bluffing when it says \"hotel-quality comfort\". Talk about a good night's sleep. As for materials, the organic and eco-friendly pillow is crafted with 100 percent organic cotton and 100 percent sustainable American Talalay latex. And if you learn it's not for you, you can leverage Saatva's 45-day return policy. 5. Naturepedic Organic Materials | Organic cotton & shredded latex Size & Firmness | Standard to King; medium firmness (adjustable) Price of Standard Pillow | $99 Do you toss and turn while you sleep? Do you struggle to find the right position? [Naturepedic](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=DkqcY%2Fd68c0&mid=35427&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naturepedic.com%2Forganic-2-in-1-adjustable-latex-pillow&u1=mat-web-pg)'s organic adjustable pillow may be just what you need. This pillow also has adjustable latex fill, so you can easily adjust how firm it is. (It can get messy! So be cautious when you unzip it for the first time.) What we love most about Naturepedic's pillow is the luxurious washable cover with one quilted side and the other side a cool and soft organic cotton. And the brand's ethics are as versatile as the pillow itself: Organic materials, MADE SAFE certification, US ethical production, and support for 1% for the Planet. All in all, this was one of our favorite pillows on the list for the price point. 6. Coyuchi Organic Materials | GOLS Certified organic Dunlop latex, GOTS Certified organic cotton Size & Firmness | Standard to King; Medium-Firm Support Price of Standard Pillow | $128 [Coyuchi](https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRkZNTUJGSUxLR0VCRklLSUpN?sid=df-web-pg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coyuchi.com%2Forganic-latex-molded-pillow.html&website=248024)'s Molded Organic Latex Pillow, one of many Coyuchi offers, uses GOLS Certified organic Dunlop latex for a fresh night's sleep. Best for back and side sleepers, this material is breathable, resistant to mold and mildew, and biodegradable. This is also one of the only pillows on the list to come without any plastic packaging (yay!). Instead, it arrived in a canvas bag, perfect for storage and protection when we're not using it. We weren't initially sure how we'd sleep on this one with its unconventional shape\u2014the side with the large hole is the bottom of the pillow and the two smaller holes are for your ears (perfect for that cartilage piercing or to reduce sleepy wrinkles!). All of the smaller holes help with airflow throughout the night. Here's [a video](https://vimeo.com/497074775) for visual reference. Our verdict? We had one of our best night's rest. While it can take a few nights to mold to your body (give it time!), this pillow is an excellent option if you're a back sleeper or looking for additional neck support throughout the night. 7. Sol Organics Made In | CanadaOrganic Materials | GOTS Certified cotton and natural fibers Size & Firmness | Standard and King; choice of Soft, Medium, Firm Support Price of Standard Pillow | $129+ Proudly based out of Canada, [Sol Organics](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?afftrack=df-web-pg&b=999&m=67892&u=1147855&urllink=solorganix.com%2Fproducts%2Forganic-cotton-down-pillow) wants to make ethical luxury accessible. The brand uses responsibly grown and harvested white down with 100 percent GOTS Certified cotton down proof to create a hypoallergenic filling that is both light and breathable. Our Sol Organics pillow arrived in a plastic carry bag, which we appreciated for the added protection (but of course would have preferred no plastic). We ordered the firm for side sleepers and found it to be a bit too soft for our preference\u2014though it has a nice plushness. We recommend this option for stomach sleepers or if you are seeking a pillow you can really sink into. 8. Boll & Branch Organic Materials | Organic cotton Size & Firmness | Standard & King; choice of Soft, Medium, Firm Support Price of Standard Pillow | $88 Like all [Boll & Branch](https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRkxHRkJGSUxLR0VCRktHSUdI?sid=df-web-pg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bollandbranch.com%2Fproducts%2Fdown-alternative-pillow-insert&website=248024) bedding and bath goods, the brand's pillow collection is ethically and sustainably made under fair trade conditions. The luxury down alternative pillow is OEKO-TEX Certified, replacing feathers and other animal by-products by using allergy-friendly PrimaLoft fibers and 100 percent organic cotton covers. We tried the down alternative pillow insert in medium density and found it to be incredibly soft and luxurious. That said, we recommend ordering the firm density if you're looking for any type of support as this pillow is very soft. We also suggest adding the pillow protector to your order for easy laundering since this one doesn't come with a removable cover. 9. NaturalMat Organic Materials | Organic wool and cotton Size & Firmness | Standard and Superking; Firm Support Price of Standard Pillow | \u00a365 UK-based [NaturalMat](https://www.naturalmat.co.uk/the-wool-pillow) offers home and nursery goods, including a range of pillows, all made by hand in Devon using wool from local organic farms. Its organic wool pillow is perfect for those who like firmer feels while enjoying a safe, chemical-free night's sleep. NaturalMat also ships to the USA via the brand's [US site](https://www.naturalmatusa.com/), so we were excited to try the Organic Wool Pillow (twin), which is equivalent in size to the standard wool pillow on the UK site. It arrived in paper packaging (protected by plastic) and came with a canvas bag for additional storage and protection. This pillow is firm, and temperature-regulating. We loved our night's sleep with it. "}
