Carer: Where this term is used within this document it is intended to be inclusive of family members oranypersonthatissignificanttotheindividualwithachroniccondition. Individual: person living with a chronic condition. Self-management : Self-management is the process where individuals with chronic conditions take control of their health and actively manage their chronic condition/s. Chronic conditions can resultinconsiderabledifficultiesforindividualsphysically,psychologically,andsocially.So,self- management is a process whereby individuals develop knowledge and skills in how to manage the consequences of their chronic conditions in their everyday lives. Self-management Support2: \"The systematic provision of education and supportive interventions, toincreasepatients'skillsandconfidenceinmanagingtheirhealthproblems,includingregular assessment of progress and problems, goal setting, and problem-solving support\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 12). Self-management support may be viewed in two ways: as a portfolio of techniques and tools that help individuals choose healthy behaviours; and as a fundamental transformation of the relationship between the individual with a chronic condition and their healthcare professional, to a collaborative partnership. The overall purpose of self-management support is to aid and inspire individuals to become informed about their chronic condition and take an active role in their treatment and management of the impact of a condition on their lives (Bodenheimer et al. , 2002). Person-centred care : \"Person centred co-ordinated care provides me with access to and continuity in the services I need when and where I need them. It is underpinned by a comprehensive assessment of my life and my world combined with the information and support I need. It demonstrates respect for my preferences, building care around me and those involved in my care\" (Irish Platform for Patient Organisations Science & Industry (IPPOSI), 2019). 1 At all times we acknowledge that, while certain chronic conditions are preventable through lifestyle change, some chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes, and many cases of asthma, are not preventable. 2

Advisor and Group Lead Chronic Disease Chair of National HEI/HSE Steering Group - Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Every day people with long term conditions such as diabetes, COPD and heart failure, and their family members and carers, make decisions and take actions to manage their health. People are living longer, but many people particularly in older age groups have one or more chronic conditions. One million people in Ireland have long-term respiratory or cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Supporting people with these and other long term conditions to self-manage means helping people todeveloptheknowledge,skillsandconfidencetheyneedtomakeoptimaldecisionsandtake the best actions for their health. This improves outcomes for patients, while also helping to reduce healthcare utilisation, including hospital admissions. Helping people to live well with chronic conditions is therefore key to provision of sustainable health services. Facilitating and training of current and future healthcare professionals to support self- management, is part of the whole system approach to self-management support, set out in ' Living Well with a Chronic Condition: Framework for Self-management Support ', published by the HSE in 2017. Thisisreflectedinthegovernment'sSlaintecarereportandactionplan,withitsfocusonintegrated care and person centred services. The extension of the GP contract for chronic disease care which will come into effect in 2020 also includes explicit support for self-management. There are many different types of self-management support; ranging from provision of high quality informationandpeersupport,tomultifacetedinterventionstailoredtospecificconditions,suchas pulmonary or cardiac rehabilitation. Effective self-management support, however, is underpinned by a collaborative relationship with a healthcare professional, within an organisation that actively promotes self-management. While many healthcare professionals feel they already work in this way, evidence shows that patients actually need more support to self-manage. This involves a fundamental change in the relationship between patient and healthcare professional. Providing support to self-manage empowers patients, and enables them to move from being passive recipients of care, to being active partners in their healthcare. Self-management support is now regarded as inseparable from high quality care for people with long term conditions. This curriculum is Part 2 of the National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management, and builds on the skills learned in Part 1: 'Making Every Contact Count for Health Behaviour Change'. It introduces students to the concept of self-management support for people with chronic conditions and provides them with the competencies required to deliver it. The curriculum is a timely resource for educators as they seek to prepare students for the changing landscape of healthcare as it transforms to meet the needs of our population. All healthcare professionals need to support patients to self manage, training our young professionals in these skills is essential for a sustainable service and building a team partnership with patients.Forewords National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 11Professor Eileen Savage Chair of the National Working Group, Professor of Nursing, Catherine McAuley School of Nursing and Midwifery, and Vice Dean of Graduate Studies and Interprofessional Learning College of Medicine and Health, Brookfield Health Sciences Complex, University College Cork. Thepreparationoffuturehealthcareprofessionalsthroughhighereducationofferssignificant potential towards realising the potential of graduates to tackle the many challenges faced within the health system. The burden of chronic diseases is currently one of the most pressing challenges facing the healthcare system in Ireland and globally. The national curriculum on Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions presented in this manual represents a collaboration between all healthcare disciplines across all Higher EducationInstitutesinIreland(HEIs)andtheHealthServiceExecutive(HSE),specifically,the Health and Wellbeing Division. The manual provides an educational resource to facilitate future healthcare professionals develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes towards a person-centred approach to supporting individuals and families in the management of chronic conditions. These future healthcare professionals include graduates from dentistry, nursing, medicine, midwifery, occupational therapy, pharmacy, physiotherapy, public health, social work, and speech and language therapy. This critical mass of graduates will enter the workforce equipped with competencies and a sense of purpose to work in partnership with individuals and families in the self-management of their chronic conditions. The collaborative alignment between the HSE and the HEIs in developing this curriculum is an exciting feature of the development of this national curriculum because it has brought educationalists and policy makers together with a shared goal for better healthcare in the management of chronic conditions. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 12The Curriculum Manual on Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions is a comprehensive facilitator guide, providing educators with a set of resources, to assist in teaching self-management support for chronic conditions to undergraduate/graduate entry healthcare students in Ireland. The curriculum is designed to facilitate integration into existing undergraduate/graduate entry curricula within individual healthcare schools across the higher education sector; medicine, nursing, midwifery, dentistry, dietetics, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry, public health, psychology, speech and language sciences, occupational science/occupational therapy and social care. While providing a recommended framework and educational resources, we encourage individual Schools to adapt the Curriculum to meet local or disciplinary needs. Therefore, the Curriculum, althoughstandardisedintermsofcompetenciesandlearningoutcomes,hasflexibilityregarding implementation. Each individual School has scope to integrate components of the Curriculum into relevant existing modules where it is suited. In response to the requirements set out by the Irish Government's Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025 (Department of Health, 2013), the HSE set an agenda to support self-management support for chronic conditions across the health services. The Health Service Executive (HSE) (2015) set out how the HSE would implement Healthy Ireland , the government Framework for improved Health and Wellbeing. As a result, 'Living Well with a Chronic Condition' , the national framework for self-management support for chronic conditions was launched in 2017 by the HSE. The national undergraduate/graduate entry curriculum for self- managementsupport,fulfilsakeypriorityofthisframework.ThemainfocusoftheHSEframeworkis on four major chronic conditions; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the development of this curriculum we have taken a broader view, inclusive of other long term health conditions and of the increase in mental health problems associated with physical conditions. A collaborative statement was developed and agreed by all parties involved in curriculum development and four guiding principles were approved. The guiding principles to support collaborative relations are as follows: Box 1: Guiding Principles to Support Collaborative Relations 1. Working together involves valuing a collective and national approach to curriculum development for a common purpose. 2. Meaningful collaboration is facilitated through a coordinated and cooperative exchange of ideas, information, knowledge, experiences, and teaching/learning resource materials relevant to developing a National Curriculum. 3. Mutual trust between all collaborators fosters a climate of reciprocity and greater opportunities for shared achievements. 4. Effective collaboration involves working together on all aspects of planning, implementing and evaluation of the National Curriculum. This Curriculum Manual is divided into two sections; Section 1: Lecturer/Facilitators Guide In Section 1 we present details on all aspects of the Curriculum inclusive of the aims of the Curriculum and Curriculum Manual, the underlying philosophy, and development processes, including exploratory work to guide curriculum development; systematic review, professional competency review, national survey and consultation workshops. Sub-sections are presented dealing with implementing and integrating the Curriculum, assessment of learning, and curriculum evaluation.Introduction National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 13Section 2: Curriculum Content In Section 2 we present the learning content for self-management support for chronic conditions. TherearefiveUnitsofStudy: \u0097 Unit 1: Foundations for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions \u0097 Unit 2: Holistic Approach to Self-management Support \u0097 Unit 3: Communication for Self-management Support \u0097 Unit 4: Skills Building for Self-management \u0097 Unit 5: Service Delivery and Organisation for Self-management Support For each unit we provide the learning content permitting easy interpretation and application across HEIs irrespective of local resources. A variety of teaching strategies including case studies, discussions andreflective exercises, readings andskillsbasedlearning arepresented together with links to PowerPoint presentations. Each school can work with the learning materials as face-to-face lectures, upload the content online or adopt blended approaches to delivery. Communication with Professional Bodies The development of this Curriculum has been communicated to the following Regulatory Bodies to gain their support: \u0097 Association of Occupational Therapists Ireland \u0097 Dental Council of Ireland-Irish Dentist Associations \u0097 Regulating Health and Social Care Professionals (CORU) \u0097 Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy \u0097 Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists \u0097 Irish Association of Social Workers \u0097 Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute \u0097 Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists \u0097 Medical Council of Ireland \u0097 Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland \u0097 Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland \u0097 Psychological Society of Ireland \u0097 Society for Chiropodists and Podiatrists of Ireland Health Context: Background and Rationale Every day, people with long-term health conditions, and their carers, make decisions, take actions and manage a broad range of activities and associated factors that contribute to their health. Self-management support acknowledges this and supports people to develop the knowledge,confidenceandskillstheyneedtomakedecisionsandtakeactionstomanage their health conditions. People with chronic conditions are more likely to attend their GP, to present at Emergency Departments, to be admitted as inpatients and to spend more time in hospital, than people without such conditions, and utilise about 70% of health service resources (Department of Health, 2012). Approximately one million people in Ireland have heart disease, diabetes or respiratory disease (HealthServiceExecutive,2016).Forallchronicconditionstheprevalenceissignificantlyhigherin people with lower levels of education and in lower socio-economic groups (Jennings,2014).Those livinginmoredeprivedareasaremorelikelythanthoseinmoreaffluentareastohavealong-term health problem (33% and 24% respectively) (Department of Health, 2018) . The numbers of people living with diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory disease will continue to rise in the coming years, due to our increasing older population and prevalence of risk factors (Health Service Executive, 2016). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 14Supporting people to self-manage improves outcomes for individuals - ranging from quality of life and clinical outcomes, to reduced healthcare utilisation including hospitalisation (Health Information and Quality Authority, 2015). The most effective self-management support interventions are multifaceted;tailoredtotheindividual(theircultureandbeliefs)andtailoredtospecificconditions. Effective self-management interventions are underpinned by a collaborative relationship with a healthcare professional within a healthcare organisation that actively promotes self-management (Taylor et al. , 2014). Reported costs vary according to the intensity of the intervention, but are typically low relative to the overall cost of care for the chronic condition in question and in some instances, can result in cost savings through reductions or shifts in healthcare utilisation (Panagioti et al. , 2014; Health Information and Quality Authority, 2015). Self-managementsupportisconsideredcriticalbytheWorldHealthOrganization(WHO)for countries where ageing populations and the growing burden of non-communicable disease means that there is ever greater demand for health services (WorldHealthOrganization,2015). The Chronic Care Model makes clear the role of self-management support in the management of chronic conditions (Wagner et al. , 2001). This model has broad international acceptance as a framework to provide guidance on shifting from our current model of care which is predominantly acute and episodic care, to a lifelong model of health promotion, prevention, early intervention and chronic care. Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025 (Department of Health, 2013), recognised the need to implement a model for the prevention and management of chronic conditions, empowering people and communities, with an emphasis on partnership and cross- sectoral work to increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life. Healthy Ireland in the Health Services - National Implementation Plan 2015-2017 (Health Service Executive, 2015) included, as a strategic priority, 'reducing the burden of chronic disease' and addressed thisthroughspecificactions.Suchactionsincludeddevelopmentandimplementationofservices to support a national framework for self-care for the major cardiovascular conditions, respiratory diseases and diabetes; and to increase the proportion of individuals utilising self-care and self- management supports. \"Living Well with a Chronic Condition\" (Health Service Executive, 2017), the national framework for self-management support for chronic conditions, which arose from the Healthy Ireland Implementation Plan ,waslaunchedin2017andspecificallyaddressesCOPD,asthma,diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It recommends the development of a curriculum for undergraduate/ graduate entry healthcare professionals as part of overall training for healthcare professionals to support self-management of chronic conditions. Self-management and self-management support are now recognised as core elements of high quality, evidence based care for people with chronic health conditions (Taylor et al. , 2014). The self-management support approach is considered key to delivering person-centred care, in which individuals are empowered to actively participate in the management of their condition (Health Service Executive, 2018). The Department of Health has recently published a National framework and principles for the design of models of care as a deliverable under the Slaintecare Action plan 2019. Self-care and self-management is one of the nine key principles, further embedding support for self-management in future development of health services (Department of Health, 2019). Underpinning the self-management support approach are informed and skilled healthcare professionals. This informed and skilled workforce are core to implementing the national framework for self-management support and provide motivation for this undergraduate/graduate entry curriculum. Graduates with self-management support competencies will enable the healthcare professionals of the future to play their part in what has been described as a fundamental transformation of the traditional individual and health professional/carer relationship into a collaborative ongoing partnership (Bodenheimer et al. , 2005). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 15Education Context: Background and Rationale The adoption, promotion and overall recognition for the role of self-management support for chronic conditions is advocated for internationally [Ireland (2017), Australia (2005; 2011; 2012), Canada (2012), and Scotland(2007)]. This approach to chronic condition management is not new and people with chronic conditions manage their illness on a day-to-day basis. However, the extent to which healthcare professionals support this is an area that needs to be addressed. Alternative approaches to managing long term conditions require increased healthcare attention now, with a necessary shift in focus from responsive acute care provision, including community services and self-management support of chronic conditions. Educating and supporting practicing healthcare professionals so that they incorporate the principles of self-management support in the care of individuals with chronic conditions is necessary. In order to sustain a culture of self-management support for chronic conditions it is necessary to target healthcare professional students. Creating an educational and clinical ethos, which embraces the principles of self-management support for chronic conditions, is a practical means of embedding the principles of self-management support in everyday care provision. This idea has been embraced in Australia where Flinders University received funding to develop a curriculum framework for chronic condition self-management support (CCSMS) for undergraduate nursing, medicine and allied healthcare students (Flinders Human Behaviour and Health Research Unit, 2007a). The overall aim was to develop a framework to guide CCSMS education in the Australian health education system. Of note, the project team recommended a three-year plan for integrating the CCSMS curriculum framework in Australian universities inclusive of curriculum development and implementation. A three-stage approach was adopted in the development and integration plan for the curriculum framework; 1) Scoping and Consultation, 2) Stakeholder Workshop and 3) Curriculum Framework and Integration Plan- validation and publication (Flinders Human Behaviour and Health Research Unit, 2007b). Pols et al. (2009) presented an account of a national workshop consisting of representatives from eight medical schools convened to explore content for both chronic condition management (CCM) andchronicconditionself-management(CCSM)resultingintheidentificationofcorecompetencies for CCSM for medical education. A recommendation followed to incorporate learning of self- management for chronic conditions for all medical students and these competencies supported the development of Flinder's framework (Pols et al. , 2009). Recommendations exist to develop and incorporate self-management support competencies at undergraduate level advocated for by the Institute of Medicine (2003) and supported by policy documents in Ireland (2017), Australia (2011) and Scotland (2007).

The review provides key information on current trends in self-management support for chronic conditions education. Somekeyfindings,whichwereinstrumentalinthedevelopmentofthiscurriculum,includedthe following information. A total of thirteen papers reviewed integrated self-management support courses into pharmacy curricula (n=6), nursing curricula (n=3), medical curricula (n=3) or graduate entry physiotherapy and medical curriculum (n=1). The courses introduced in the studies were developed not with the context of a national curriculum, but by faculty alone, faculty with supporting people or project teams. The majority of interventions targeted individuals with diabetes (n=8). Four studies reported competencies and the main focus were 'patient education/care' and 'service delivery and organisation.' Examples of competencies included effective delivery of patient-centred care, to provide self-management support to individuals in partnership with them, to communicate and collaborate with individuals and carers, to demonstrate problem-solving skills through active learning, to collaborate with other healthcare professionals, etc. The core learning areas of the curricula were reviewed in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes. All thirteen studies addressed knowledge content, mostly related to management and treatment of a chronic condition and foundations for self-management support. For skills, communication skills were predominant in most of the studies. Developing of skills for goal setting, action planning, care plan reviews and problem-solving was also reported in seven studies. Attitudes towards self-management support were reported the least (n=9). Appreciation, understanding and empathy for individuals with chronic conditions and their challenges were mainly included. The teaching and learning strategies were reported in all studies. The most common approach to knowledge was lectures and discussion in class room settings, followed by multi-media and online learning. Most teaching and learning of skills were facilitated through simulation exercises and role-play activities either in laboratory or in everyday life. Service learning with allocated patients was also used for training skills. The approach to attitudes component showed similar pattern to facilitating skills as simulating a patient' experience and service learning were used the most.Studentassessmentwasaddressedinfivepapers.Thestrategiesincludedmultiplechoice questions,quizzes,grouppresentation,logbooksonself-caretasks,reflectivepapers,competency assessment and completion of care plan.

Professional Competency Review Process (Appendix 1) Nineteen regulatory body frameworks were reviewed for any elements of content or competencies that related to the principles of self-management support for chronic conditions. Accreditation standards were reviewed from several healthcare disciplines including nursing and midwifery, medicine,occupationaltherapy,dentistry,pharmacy,socialcare,andphysiotherapy,withinfive countries, encapsulating healthcare programmes in the UK, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and Ireland. Additionally, a number of healthcare policies from the World Health Organisation were also reviewed.

Of note while self-management support has strongly featured in regulatory frameworks as a critical competency, in most instances it has not been explicitly cited in relation to chronic condition management (Health Service Executive, 2008; General Medical Council, 2009; Occupational Therapists Registration Board, 2014; Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, 2016). The 'Future Pharmacy Practice in Ireland: Meeting Patients' Needs' framework (The Pharmaceutical Society ofIreland,2016)clearlyidentifies'theneedtosupportself-care,particularlyinthepreventionand management of chronic diseases' (p. 27), and this competency proliferates in the framework, where self-managementsupportforchronicconditionsfeaturesasignificantroleinthefutureeducationof pharmacy healthcare professionals. Coincidentally, it has been argued that healthcare 'curricular content should keep pace with the strategic health policy move towards the management of chronic ill health and life-limiting conditions' (Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, 2016, p. 11); however, this fundamental philosophy has yet to be realised in curriculum development, and regulatory standards and requirements. See Appendix 1 for more detailed information on self-management support for chronic conditions in regulatory body guideline documents. National Survey (Appendix 2) A survey developed and piloted by members of the NWG was carried out to explore what self- management support education for chronic conditions is currently addressed in undergraduate/ graduate entry healthcare programmes across HEIs in Ireland. There is currently a lack of baseline data on the provision, practice and variation of self-management support for chronic conditions education in healthcare programmes in HEIs in Ireland. The collation and analysis of the data generated was a preliminary step to informing the development of this standardised national curriculum on self-management support for chronic conditions while providing a situational analysis on the current educational provision of self-management support for chronic conditions. The guiding question of the survey was \"what is the current practice and provision of self-management support for chronic conditions in curricula of undergraduate/graduate entry healthcare students attending HEIs in Ireland?\" Ethical approval was granted from the Social Research Ethics CommitteeinUniversityCollegeCork.Emailswithinvitation,informationleafletandweblinkto the online survey were circulated to the heads of schools and programme leads for each UG/GE healthcare discipline requesting module leads/academics involved in teaching self-management support for chronic conditions related content complete the survey within the Republic of Ireland. The results of this survey indicate that elements of self-management support for chronic conditions are taught to future healthcare professional students with over half of respondents indicating so. However, there were no explicit competencies on self-management support for chronic conditions provided for any of the programmes reported on. Content that is taught is delivered within the context of other related modules in a disparate manner. For the most part traditional approaches to both teaching and assessment of self-management support for chronic conditions are adopted which occurs predominantly in years 3 and 4. The numbers reporting were small overall and unevenly distributed across programmes therefore no inferential analyses were carried out. However, for the purpose of discussion the variations in results between programmes are acknowledged. While the overall survey response rate was 65, not all respondents completed Section 2, which dealt with content. Consistently, allied health programmes (n=17) followed by nursing and midwifery programmes (n=20) demonstrated overall highest level of agreement that elements from the eightlearningareasidentifiedaretaught.Thiswasfollowedtoalesserextentwithagreementby those reporting for medicine (n=4) and dentistry (n=1). Overall respondents reporting on behalf of pharmacy (n=3-4) indicated the least level of agreement that the elements provided were taught in their programmes. See Appendix 2 for more information on this survey. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 19Workshop A workshop on self-management support was scheduled as part of the 2017 International Conference of the Diabetes Self-management & Prevention Alliance (10th November), hosted by National University of Ireland, Galway. The facilitators were Professor Eileen Savage and Dr Peter Cantillon, both of whom are on the National Working Group in relation to the national curriculum for self-management support for chronic conditions. Participants attending the workshop were conference delegates comprising mostly of researchers and clinicians and to a lesser extent academics involved in teaching undergraduate healthcare students. The workshop was 1.5 hours in duration. The learning outcomes set for the workshop are presented in Box 2. Box 2: Workshop Learning Outcomes By the end of this workshop, the participants will be able to: \u0097 Outline a set of competencies for self-management support required of graduates of health professional programmes specific to chronic condition management \u0097 Describe appropriate teaching and learning strategies to facilitate undergraduate students apply self-management support chronic condition management in clinical practice \u0097 Identify appropriate approaches to assessment regarding self-management support \u0097 Describe common enablers and barriers to integrating self-management support into undergraduate education for future health professionals The workshop was interactive involving small group work and with each purposely mixed to include a combination of researchers, clinicians and educators in as far as was possible. Each group was asked to identify what they perceived to be the principal competencies, learning areas, teaching strategies, and assessment strategies needed within an undergraduate curriculum to prepare future healthcare professionals for self-management support in clinical practice. Collectively, atotalof10competencies wereidentified bythegroupsandwhichcanbecategorised partnership \u0097 Self-managementspecificskills:collaborativegoalsetting;interdisciplinarygoalsetting with individuals; supporting decision-making; motivational interviewing. Key areas of learning for self-management support practice among undergraduate students related to communication skills, knowledge and skills relating to self-management support including barriers and enablers, and appreciation of living with a chronic condition. Communication for self-management support included skills such as listening, empowering and motivating as well ashandlingconflict.Somegroupsnotedtheneedformotivationalinterviewingasabasisfor self-management support practice. Developing the skill of communicating professional and technical knowledge into everyday lay language was also noted, as was the skill of interacting with individuals who have 'literacy problems'. Knowledge and skills relating to self-management support wereidentifiedasrelatingtounderstandingtheroleofself-managementineffectivelymanaging a chronic condition and integrating its impact into one's everyday life. The groups indicated that students should acquire knowledge on lifestyle issues and develop competence in supporting behaviouralchange.Specificskillsidentifiedincludedgoalsettingandproblem-solving,verbal persuasion, and supporting individuals to manage the emotional aspects of living with a chronic condition. Person-centredness was viewed as a core aspect of self-management support. There was a strong emphasis on the need for undergraduate students to appreciate what it might be like to live with a chronic condition. To this end, they placed particular emphasis on experiential learning activities as detailed further below. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 20A range of teaching and learning strategies were proposed across the groups but experiential learning dominated as the most important strategy. Simulation was seen as a way of facilitating learning about living with a chronic condition with reference to students taking on individuals' roles over a period of time or role playing with actors. Clinical learning experiences considered important were home visits so that students can meet individuals with chronic conditions in their own environments, listen to them, and record their stories. Shadowing experienced staff as well as high quality supervision that incorporated feedback to students was reported as integral to students' clinical learning. Individuals with chronic conditions were seen to have an active role in facilitating student learning such as being 'teachers' providing feedback to students and being involved in assessingtheirlearning.Otherteachingandlearningstrategiesidentifiedduringtheworkshop included small group work, case study analysis, analysis of blogs and wikis, and videos with positive and negative examples of self-management support. Throughout the learning experience, itwasnotedthatstudentsneedtobefacilitatedtobereflectiveandcognisantoftheirownbeliefs, values, and attitudes concerning self-management support and the role of individuals with chronic conditions in actively managing their conditions. A diverse range of assessment of learning strategies were articulated, most of which related to demonstrating competence in self-management support practice. These included videoing of student-individualwithachroniccondition,encounterswithself-reflectionsbuiltin,reflectivelogs/ essays/diaries, photo voice, and oral assessments. Some groups indicated the need to assess student self-management support performance against pre-determined criteria of behaviours which could include peer assessment, self-assessment, and healthcare user assessment in addition to assessment by clinicians. Other assessment strategies included online e-tivities, MCQs, written essays, and written projects. Overall, workshop participants were positive about introducing self-management support education into the undergraduate curricula. The potential of this initiative was seen as important to developing a critical mass of future healthcare professionals with competence to engage in self-management support in their practice. Furthermore, they viewed it as an opportunity to foster an interdisciplinary approach to self-management support but noted that undergraduate education needs to strengthen interdisciplinary learning. Another points of caution based on perceived barriers to self- management support education included negative attitudes of students and clinicians in terms of seeing self-management and motivational interviewing as 'soft' knowledge and skills in healthcare and therefore less important to objective clinical knowledge concerning health outcomes. Participants also expressed concerns about overcrowded curricula in accommodating new content in relation to self-management support. Self-management Support-Chronic Conditions - Curriculum Consultation Workshops A number of consultation workshops on the competencies and learning outcomes to be addressed in the curriculum, were held nationwide in Cork, Dublin and Limerick. The workshops were open to all academics in health science disciplines of HEIs, and we were particularly interested to speak with those involved in teaching on chronic conditions, programme leads and chairs of teaching and curriculum committees. The workshops were led by Professor Eileen Savage with the support of Dr Carmel Mullaney, Dawn Sinclair and Eunjin Selena Han. We presented a draft competencyframeworkwithabroadoutlineoftheproposedcontentandaskedattendeestoreflect on the competencies and content in terms of; 1. Relevance for self-management support, 2. Any Omissions3.ValidityofLearningOutcomesand4.InwhatyearofUGprogrammesarelearning outcomes best placed. The core editing group reviewed the notes from the workshops and extracted key points and themes and made amendments where possible based on review of the feedback sourced and consultation with NWG members. All sources of evidence and contributions were considered. Someareasidentifiedarealreadycoveredinthe Making Every Contact Count curriculum, and as such were not considered for inclusion in the Self-Management Support for Chronic Conditions curriculum, however we have directed to the relevant sections of Making Every Contact Count curriculum in those instances. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 21Aims of the Curriculum and Curriculum Manual This standard National Undergraduate/Graduate Entry Curriculum on Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions was introduced in recognition of, and response to, the growing burden of chronic conditions in our society and the increasing need for people living with chronic conditions to be supported in their self-management. In Ireland, the development of the Framework for Self-management Support (Health Service Executive, 2017) highlights a number of key actions to promote and provide self-management support for four major chronic conditions - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One of the actions set out in the Framework is to; \"Collaborate with Higher Education Institutions in Ireland to include self-management support education and skills training in the Standard Curriculum for Chronic disease prevention and management for relevant undergraduate and training and development for Health and Social Care Professionals\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 35). The introduction of self-management support for chronic conditions to undergraduate/graduate entry curricula, which incorporates the learning and skills necessary for self-management support for chronic conditions, is a way of instilling the principles and culture of self-management support in the early stages of healthcare careers. The Aims of the Curriculum are: \u0097 To introduce self-management support for chronic conditions education and training in all healthcare professional education settings nationwide as part of the implementation of the 'Living Well with a Chronic Condition' the National Framework for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions: COPD, Asthma, Diabetes and Cardiovascular disease (Health Service Executive, 2017). \u0097 To provide a national standardised approach to teaching self-management support for chronic conditions. \u0097 To provide undergraduate/graduate entry healthcare students with basic self-management support skills, knowledge and attitudes in preparation for clinical practice. \u0097 To foster national collaboration on self-management support for chronic conditions training and education across the Higher Education Sector. This manual provides healthcare educators with a comprehensive resource to facilitate the teaching and learning of self-management support for chronic conditions. The manual is designed to provide guidance to educators on the provision of the curriculum, including underpinning philosophies, course content, teaching strategies, assessments and evaluation. A key aim of this manual is to inform HEI educators of the topics and learner content for self- management support for chronic conditions .Thecurriculumcontainsfiveunitsofstudyand each unit contains the lessons with learning content required for integration into existing curricula across HEIs. A variety of teaching strategies are presented including case studies, discussions, learneractivitiesandreflectiveexercises.Thereisanoptionofdevelopingonlinematerialand delivering the content online, other options include delivering the curriculum face-to-face, through interprofessional teaching, online or in blended format. The context in which the curriculum was developed is presented incorporating the background rationale and competency framework.Section 1: Lecturer/Facilitator Guide National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 22The aim of the Curriculum Manual is to provide educators with a national standardised educational resource on self-management support for chronic conditions targeting all undergraduate healthcare students. Curriculum Philosophy and Design Thisisacompetencybasedcurriculumdesignedaroundfiveverticalandtwohorizontalstrands (Figure 1.0). The curriculum framework was developed following in-depth scoping exercises including literature reviews, professional competency review, a national survey, a stakeholder workshop, consultation workshops and national working group review and consultation. Drafting of the initial framework was followed by review and amendment by the project team including national and local workings groups. The framework offers theoretical underpinnings and philosophical assumptions to create a common understanding of the principles of self-management support for chronic conditions. It also provides an educational structure for integration and delivery of standardised curriculum content on self-management support for chronic conditions.

Adopting the same philosophy for this Curriculum, subject-centred learning involves interactive learning \"where space is created for the students to enter into their own engagement with the subject in a shared pursuit with the teacher, resulting in more effective teaching and learning\" (Morrison-Saunders and Hobson, 2013, p. 212). The subject unites the educator and student, where the educator engages with the subject in ways that inspire students to enter into a relationship with that subject.

Ultimately, chronic conditions have the capacity to limit an individual's ability to live well (Institute of Medicine, 2015). Living well with chronic conditions incorporates preventive strategies and services recommended for those without chronic conditions in addition to management of the chronic condition (Harris and Wallace, 2012). For most individuals living well is about achieving one's optimal physical, psychological and social level of functioning. Living well is dependent on a multitude of interacting factors therefore including families, friends and societies workinginuniontopositivelyinfluencequalityoflifeforindividualswithchronicconditions(Institute of Medicine, 2003). Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to explore and become responsive to a person's wishes and values in an effort to promote living well (Entwistle et al. , 2018). Promoting the concept of living well requires an enabling approach to self-management support from healthcare professionals (Entwistle et al. , 2018). There are many fundamental underpinnings to self-management support including collaborative working and partnership building (Thom et al., 2015; al. , 2016; Figueiredo et al. , 2017). All of which, when embraced by healthcare professionals, support a living well philosophy. Person-centredcareinfiltratesallaspectsofself-managementsupportlearningpresentedhere, and is recognised as a core attribute of successful chronic condition care in general (Pulvirenti et al. , 2011). Itisaconceptthatwasalsopresentedasahorizontalstrandinthe National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 1: Making Every Contact Count for Health Behaviour Change (National Undergraduate Curriculum Working Group, 2017). Acomprehensivecollectionofperson-centredcaredefinitionswerepreparedpreviously and are replicated here (Appendix 3). \"Person-centred care and, in particular, approaches such as collaborative care and support planning and self-management support can also help services respond to the needs of the growing number of people living with long-term conditions\" (The Health Foundation (UK), 2014, p. 12). In Ireland, patients have indicated that \"person centred co-ordinated care provides me with access to and continuity in the services I need when and where I need them. It is underpinned by a comprehensive assessment of my life and my world combined with the information and support I need. It demonstrates respect for my preferences, building care around me and those involved in my care\" (Irish Platform for Patient Organisations Science & Industry (IPPOSI), 2019). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 24A person-centred approach is an important aspect of self-management support, one which endorses consideration of preference in conjunction with capabilities, resources and circumstances. Equally, a person-centred approach acknowledges the varying levels of eagerness to engage with self-management and what individuals perceive to be important supports (Havas et al., 2017). Like self-management support, the concept of person-centred care is widely endorsed by healthcare professionals in general. For the most part healthcare professionals also agree that chronic condition care requires a self-management support component and that person-centred care is instrumental to successful self-management. The challenge that presents is embedding this approach in healthcare provision. Within the framework of this curriculum, we embrace the concepts of Living Well with Chronic Conditions and Person Centred Care and recognise their pivotal role across self-management support for chronic conditions learning in undergraduate healthcare education. Competency Framework Theterm\"competency\"hasbecomesignificantinundergraduate/graduateentryhealthcare courses, it is required that on completion of healthcare courses, students are competent healthcare professionals. Identifying competencies to frame curricula fosters knowledge, attitudes, values and skills which are considered to be core curricular requirements (Madsen and Bell, 2012). Competencies are overarching requirements from where a number of measurable or observable learning outcomes/behaviours stem. Competency-based education is described as \"a framework for designing and implementing education that focuses on the desired performance characteristics of healthcare professionals\" (Gruppen et al. , 2012, p. 1).

Service Delivery and Organisation for Self-management Support Curriculum Implementation and Integration In this part of the Manual, guidance is offered on the implementation and integration of self-management support for chronic conditions in programmes. Although this is a national, standardised curriculum in terms of competencies and learning outcomes, we encourage the use offlexibilityindeliveryoptionsandencourageprofessionalspecificliteraturetoproviderelevance andapplicationtosupportstudentlearning.Wealsoencouragemodifyingofcasestudiestoreflect the professional curriculum under study. We promote innovative methods to deliver the curriculum, or components of it, for example, interdisciplinary learning may be an option in some HEIs. A new national curriculum for all undergraduate/graduate entry healthcare programmes generates questions from educators such as; \u0097 Who will deliver the curriculum? \u0097 How will we deliver it? \u0097 Is there support for educators? \u0097 How will it be assessed? \u0097 How can it be integrated into existing curricula? Undergraduate/graduate healthcare curricula are already reaching content capacity and we are mindful of the challenges of integrating new material into existing programmes. This section of the manual looks at some of the possible ways of integrating the curriculum for self-management support for chronic conditions into established healthcare programmes. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 27Many of the theories and skills embedded in the curriculum for self-management support for chronic conditions are not new and are already delivered in existing teaching. It is likely that there will be many opportunities in your programmes to incorporate content for self-management support for chronic conditions into existing modules. However, some components of the curriculum may benewandthesetopicsmayrequirespecificcurriculumtime.Thedurationofthecurriculumis 12 hours, distributed across 5 units. The recommended timeframe for each unit is provided in Section 2. The content of the curriculum may be delivered over the entire programme or in block times at the discretion of each school. In order to integrate the national curriculum in schools and courses in HEIs nationally the competency framework of the curriculum on self-management support for chronic conditions should bemappedatcourselevelandexistingcurriculumcontentidentifiedtoestablishwhatisalready being covered in a given curriculum. There is scope to integrate the topics that are to be covered in this curriculum into a number of existing subject areas. Preparing for Implementation We suggest that one member of academic staff, in each institution/school where possible, isidentifiedtoleadtheimplementationofthiscurriculum.Thefollowingquestionsshouldbe considered in preparation for this: \u0097 What content from this new curriculum is already taught as part of the existing undergraduate curriculum? \u0097 Who teaches it? \u0097 Who could potentially teach content of this new curriculum for self-management support for chronic conditions? \u0097 Where in the programme can we implement self-management support for chronic conditions? \u0097 What resources do we have? \u0097 What support or training is needed to implement this curriculum for self-management support for chronic conditions? Implementation Exercise It is necessary to map the competencies of this curriculum with each Regulatory Body's requirements to demonstrate alignment of the self-management support for chronic conditions curriculum with existing frameworks. We recommend that a mapping exercise is also carried out at course level to identify where the learning outcomes and competencies of this curriculum are already addressed within existing curricula. Once it is evident where content already exists it is important to consider the timing or placement of this curriculum content in the overall undergraduate/graduate entry curriculum. We offer recommendations on content location within undergraduate curricula (Section 2). However,weadvisethatfinaldecisionsregardingcontentlocationbereachedatlocallevel. This is of particular relevance in graduate entry programmes, which are often delivered in a more intensive manner than undergraduate curricula. For self-management support for chronic conditions, once it is known what components of this curriculum are already in place it must then be decided whether any changes are required to ensure that content meets self-management support for chronic conditions learning outcome requirements. Also, consideration must be given to whether or not the new material should replace any existing content. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 28Building Capacity This is a new curriculum and therefore it is necessary to raise awareness and ensure that lecturers are familiar with it and have insight into its potential impact on service delivery. Gaining the support of lecturers and students is paramount to its successful implementation. Supporting staff to ensure that they are prepared to successfully deliver the curriculum is also important. It is worth identifying available resources/personnel who already have a vested interest in the area of self-management support for chronic conditions to help raise awareness and support for the curriculum. Assessing Student Learning There are a number of competencies and learning outcomes in this curriculum with a number of suggested student assessment methods possible. Options for assessment include assessing each unit independently or assessing units in a combined way. In addition an online assessment strategy, such as developing multiple choice questions, is another option for assessment. For some schools the competencies and learning outcomes of the curriculum could be placed in a clinical log book for signoff in the clinical setting. Another assessment suggestion for this curriculum is to adopt an interprofessional approach to assessment. This could be regarded as a group type assessment. A case study could be provided to the various healthcare discipline students. The leading assessment question asking each discipline what they feel their role would be in supporting that individual to self-manage their condition. An opportunity would be provided for each group to return and present their work. Evaluation It is beyond the scope of the current project and collaborative to evaluate the overall development and implementation of the curriculum. We make a recommendation to the HSE for a future national evaluationoftheprojectspecificallylookingat,yetnotlimitedto,thefollowingelements; \u0097 Structure; including group membership, terms of reference, collaborative. \u0097 Curriculum; development, content, delivery methods, assessments, resources. \u0097 Curriculum implementation. Once the curriculum is implemented and integrated into HEIs, we suggest that evaluation of the learning content is carried out within schools in keeping with local evaluation methods at unit level and whole curriculum level within programmes. We also recommend sustaining a collaboration across HEIs to provide a forum for ongoing support around implementation.

Each unit is evidence based and written to facilitate face-to-face or to facilitate further development as part of an online blended learning initiative. Accompanying each unit is a PowerPoint slide pack where the key discussion areas are outlined. Lessons include three key approaches to assist you as a lecturer to facilitate students to contextualise the material within each of the lessons. The three components include assimilative activity which requires you to read and understand the learning material presented; productive activities which require you to create material to demonstrate and link core conceptswhichyouhaveassimilated;andfinally,interactiveandadaptiveapproacheswhichwill enable you to acquire core competencies in recognising self-management support requirements in your practice domain. Unit 1: Foundations for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions The core purpose of Unit 1 is to introduce students to the concept of self-management and self- managementsupport.Theunitisconcernedwiththeexplorationofthedefinitions,foundations and principles underpinning both self-management and self-management support. Here, students are introduced to the core tasks and skills which individuals with chronic conditions require to be effectiveself-managers.Inaddition,studentsareencouragedtoreflectandexploretheskillsthat are required of the healthcare professional in supporting individuals to develop the skills which they need to self-manage their chronic condition. Unit 2: Holistic Approach to Self-management Support In Unit 2, the concept of person-centred holistic care in the context of self-management support is addressed. In this unit there is opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how to support individuals in the medical, role and emotional self-management of their chronic condition. There will be discussions on the ways in which healthcare professionals, communities and families can support self-management in a holistic way. There is a lesson on health literacy, again highlighting the importance of individual preferences and abilities in keeping with person- centred holistic care. Case studies are presented to facilitate learning. Unit 3: Communication for Self-management Support In Unit 3 students will have an opportunity to learn about the importance of effective collaborative- partnership communication for self-management support. They will explore the engagement between healthcare professionals and individuals to support self-management of chronic conditions. Key learning outcomes in this unit focus on gaining an individual's perspective on the impact of a chronic condition on their daily life through appropriate listening and questioning. Understanding the importance of trust and collaboration in relationships and the importance of discussing treatment options with individuals as well as the concept of shared decision-making are addressed in this unit.Section 2: Curriculum Content National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 34Unit 4: Skills Building for Self-management In Unit 4 the emphasis is on assisting individuals to build skills to effectively manage a chronic condition in their daily lives: problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation, forming partnershipsandactionplanning.Discussionswillfocusonbuildingindividuals'confidenceby supporting the development of problem-solving and decision-making skills. In addition, students will explore how to support the development of an individual's self-monitoring skills and their ability to interpret changes in their health status indicating improvement, maintenance or deterioration. Unit 5: Service Delivery and Organisation for Self- management Support In Unit 5 students will develop a knowledge and understanding of co-ordinating and managing care delivery relevant in the context of health service delivery and organisation. A critical perspective on current health service organisation and delivery for self-management support will be considered. The relevance of broadening perspectives on self-management support beyond health services to include social services and community support groups will be examined. Students will explore the role of inter-professional team approaches to self-management support including critical examination of current practices. They will also have opportunity to review the impact of self- management support on service provision and delivery, and on patient outcomes.

Some Background The Department of Health and Children (2008) in Ireland, in the policy Tackling Chronic Disease , indicate that chronic conditions are \"long-term conditions, lasting more than six months, are non-communicable and involve some functional impairment or disability and are usually incurable\" (p. 9). Multimorbidity is described as \"The coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same individual\" (World Health Organisation, 2016, p. 3). Living well with Chronic Conditions \"Theconceptoflivingwellreflectsthebestachievablestateofhealththatencompassesall dimensions of physical, mental, and social well-being\" (Institute of Medicine, 2015, p. 486). However, there may be some differences between individuals about what 'living well' means, this may be more evident in individuals with a chronic condition. Pause for Reflection and Discussion What does living well mean to you? What do you think living well means to a person with a chronic condition? Do you think it is any different to how a person without a chronic condition feels?

Some Background Healthy Ireland in the Health Services - National Implementation Plan (Health Service Executive, 2015) included as a strategic priority, 'reducing the burden ofchronicdisease'andaddressesthisthroughspecificactions.Suchactions include development and implementation of services to support a national framework for self-management for the major cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and diabetes; and to increase the proportion of individuals utilising self- management supports. \"Living Well with a Chronic Condition\" (Health Service Executive, 2017), the national framework for self-management support for chronic conditions, which arose from the Healthy Ireland Implementation plan, was launched in 2017 and specificallyaddressesCOPD,asthma,diabetesandcardiovasculardisease (https://www.hse.ie/eng /health/hl/selfmanagement/hse-self-management- support-final-document1.pdf ). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 38Read \"Healthy Ireland in the Health Services - National Implementation Plan\" (Health Service Executive, 2015) and \"Living Well with a Chronic Condition\" (Health Service Executive, 2017) for background context. We will now explore the concept of self-management for chronic conditions. Pause for Reflection and Discussion What are your thoughts on self-management? What do you think self-management involves? Letusstartbyfocusingontheprinciplesanddefinitionsofself-management. What is Self-management? Self-management is the process where individuals with chronic conditions take control of their health and actively manage their chronic condition/s to the best of their ability. Chronic conditions canresultinconsiderabledifficultiesforindividualsphysically,psychologically,andsocially.So, self-management is a process whereby individuals develop knowledge and skills in how to manage the impact of their chronic conditions in their everyday lives. Activity 1.1: Self-management definitions Takealookatthefollowingtwodefinitions. \"The day-to-day tasks an individual must undertake to control or reduce the impact of disease on physical health status. At-home management tasks and strategies are undertaken with the collaboration and guidance of the individual's physician and health care providers\" (Clark et al ., 1991, p. 5). \"The ability of the individual, in conjunction with family, community and healthcare providers to manage symptoms, treatments, lifestyle changes, and psychosocial, cultural, and spiritual consequences of health conditions\" (Richard and Shea, 2011, p. 261). How do they compare and contrast? Whichofthetwodefinitionsdoyouthinkbestcaptureswhatisrequiredof individuals in order to 'live well' in managing their chronic condition? Howhavethesedefinitionschangedovertime? What do they mean for you as a healthcare professional? Discuss in groups National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 39What is Self-management Support? Self-management Support is... Holistic interventions aimed at maximising physical and psychosocial functioning by providing individuals with skills to manage symptoms, treatments and the psychosocial consequences of living with a chronic condition (Lorig and Holman, 2003). \"The systematic provision of education and supportive interventions, to increase patients' skills and confidence in managing their health problems, including regular assessment of progress and problems, goal setting, and problem-solving support\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 12) Activity 1.2: Self-management support definitions Howhavethesedefinitionschangedovertime? What do they mean for you as a healthcare professional? Discuss in groups Self-management support is the assistance health professionals and others give to individuals with chronic conditions to maintain active management of their condition and to encourage daily decisions that improve health-related behaviours and clinical outcomes. Self-management support may be viewed in two ways: as a portfolio of techniques and tools that help individuals choose healthy behaviours; and as a fundamental transformation of the relationship between the individual with a chronic condition and their healthcare professional, to a collaborative partnership. The overall purpose of self-management support is to aid and inspire individuals to become informed about their chronic condition and take an active role in their treatment and management of the impact of a condition on their lives (Bodenheimer et al. , 2005). Self-management support is an intervention at the individual level with potential for positive impacts on health and health behaviours. Self-management support, tailored to various chronic conditions including diabetes, asthma, COPD and cardiovascular disease, has potential to be effective across the preventative spectrum of primary, secondary and tertiary disease prevention (Grady and Gough, 2014). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 40The person who is able to self-manage their long term condition: 1) Knows about their condition. 2) Follows a treatment plan (care plan) agreed upon with shared decision making with their healthcare professionals. 3) Monitors and manages signs and symptoms of their conditions. 4) Knows how to respond to a deterioration in their condition. 5) Manages the impact of the condition on their physical, emotional and social life. 6) Adopts lifestyles that promote health. 7)Hasaccesstosupportservicesandhastheconfidenceandabilitytousethem (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 12, adapted from Flinders University, 2017). Figure 1.2 demonstrates the actions recommended in the 'Living Well with a Chronic Condition' framework at four levels, to support the person in their management of their long-term condition: Individual level, Healthcare professionals, Organisation, and Wider system. The actions recommended are at the levels of the individual, the healthcare professional, the organisation and the wider system. Individual level - Individualsshouldhaveaccesstodiseasespecificinterventionswhich support their self-management e.g. cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation, diabetes structured patient education, provision of asthma action plans. Generic interventions should also be provided including regular clinical review, care and support planning, provision of information, health behaviour change support, peer and social support, generic self- management education, and carer support. Healthcare professionals - Healthcare professionals should be provided with the skills and information they need in supporting self-management, including adopting a person-centred approach and encouraging individuals' engagement. Organisation - Thehealthcareorganisationshouldprovidediseasespecificandgeneric interventionswhichsupportself-management;policysupport;financialsupportand resources; coordination of delivery; technology supports; quality assurance and evaluation.

A person-centred approach is fundamental to both self-management and self-management support. For centuries, the medical model largely ignored the expertise of the individuals being treated. Individuals were positioned as passive clients whose role was to be investigated, diagnosed and to take their treatment as prescribed. However, healthcare professionals need to recognise that it is the individual who decides to attend the healthcare professional, it is the individual who understands how the illness is affecting his or her life and it is the individual whose motivation, National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 43self-efficacyandsocialcircumstanceswilldictateconsiderablytheoutcomesofanytherapeutic plan or strategy. Thus, if the healthcare professional, comes to regard every encounter with the individual as a meeting with another expert, they are unlikely to undervalue the individual's perspective, their know-how, and their insights. View this web link to access a \"toolbox\" on Person-centred Care and Support: https://www .hse.ie/eng/about/who/qid/resourcespublications/ patientsafetytoolboxtalks.html Taking person-centred approach when providing self-management support, facilitates a collaborative relationship and shared decision-making between healthcare professionals and individuals with chronic conditions. This approach recognises that the healthcare professional and the individual both bring different types of expertise to the management of the individual's chronic condition. This collaborative approach facilitates effective self-management support. \"Person centred co-ordinated care provides me with access to and continuity in the services I need when and where I need them.

There are four different ways in which a healthcare professional can help individuals to be moreconfidentinself-managementofchronicconditions:1)Performancemastery,2)Vicarious experience, 3) Social and verbal persuasion, and 4) Physiological and emotional responses.

Healthcare professionals must provide individuals with opportunities to maximise the impact ofthesefourinfluencesonself-efficacyinordertodevelopindividuals'confidenceforself- management. Examples of this include: Performance mastery : \u0097 Ask the individual to discuss past positive accomplishments in undertaking self-management tasks and to identify factors that led to success in these tasks. \u0097 Facilitate opportunities for the individual to acquire and practice successful self-management skills by setting achievable goals. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 45Vicarious Experience : \u0097 Provide opportunities for individuals to compare their abilities to cope with the emotional and physical impacts of their chronic condition with others with similar chronic conditions. Social and verbal persuasion : \u0097 Provide encouragement, coaching and feedback. Physiological and emotional responses : \u0097 When reviewing self-management goals ask the individual how they felt when approaching and working on their goals. \u0097 Provide individuals with strategies to manage any anxieties when working on their goals.

What does effective self-management involve? Components of Self-management Effective self-management involves successfully managing three components of living with a chronic condition: medical, role and emotional self-management. Medical management: The tasks an individual needs to carry out in relation to managing the medical aspects of their chronic condition. This includes taking medications; using appropriate medical devices, and following a recommended diet and prescribed exercise programmes (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Examples of self-management tasks required for medical management include: \u0097 Monitoring of symptoms and signs associated with the condition. Examples of these might include daily weighing for a person with heart failure, monitoring of blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes and knowing when to seek help and healthcare professional input. \u0097 Agreeing a care plan with healthcare professional. \u0097 Working on changing health behaviours such as exercise, healthy eating, etc. Role management: The activities and tasks involved in carrying out their usual roles for example as a student, worker, parent, friend, etc., while accommodating their chronic condition and any restrictions they experience a result of their chronic condition (Lorig and Holman, 2003). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 46Examples of self-management tasks required for role management include: Recognising and addressing the effects of particular symptoms of the chronic condition on aspects of daily living. For example, fatigue is a common symptom experienced by individuals with many different types of chronic conditions. So, individuals need to understand fatigue and use effective fatigue management strategies to enable them to participate effectively in daily activities. A person with heart disease might substitute swimming for hillwalking. Can you think of any other examples? Emotional management: Living with a chronic condition can result in a wide range of emotional issues for individuals such as feeling frustrated, worried, depressed or angry. These emotions can impact on daily activities and can also influence the severity of symptoms associated with chronic conditions. Therefore emotional self- management of chronic conditions involves recognising and addressing the social and emotional effects of the chronic condition on oneself, one's carers and community (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Examples of the tasks required for emotional self-management include: Recognising and addressing the emotional effects of chronic conditions on ones life and exploring ways to manage emotions. Communicating effectively with carers and a wider social network to maintain effective relationships; identifying and learning how to use stress management strategies and knowing when to seek healthcare professional help when needed. Of note people with chronic physical illness have a higher risk of depression and anxiety (see Unit 2 for more details). Self-management Skills There are core interpersonal skills that are required to carry out the tasks of medical, role and emotional self-management including; problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation, forming partnerships and action planning (Lorig and Holman, 2003). These skills will be explored in detail in Unit 4.

Lastly, you will be asked to read some relevant papers and respond to guided questions on self-management support criteria. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 48Factsheet 1: Chronic Conditions in Ireland What is a Chronic Condition? Definitionsofchronic conditionsvary.TheUSCentreforNationalstatisticsdefines a chronic condition as a condition that lasts for three months ormore.Thisratherinclusivedefinitioncouldarguablyinclude a presentation of infectious mononucleosis followed by a prolonged period of post viral fatigue. The Irish Department of Health and Children (2008), in the policy Tackling Chronic Disease,definechronicconditionsas\"long-termconditions, lasting more than six months, are non-communicable and involve some functional impairment or disability and are usually incurable\" (p. 9). What are the Components of Chronic Conditions? Chronic conditions are long-term, and often lifelong. They are non-communicable (albeit they may have communicable antecedents and aetiological factors). They always involve some degree of functional impairment, social impairment or disability and, given that they are chronic, they are not curable. Thus you need to think about a chronic condition as something established that you are attempting to mitigate and manage rather than cure. Typical chronic conditions include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive airways disease, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Many chronic conditions have a genetic and or familial component. However, lifestyle factors may contribute to the onset of chronic conditions, its severity and its prognosis. The well-known lifestyle factors include smoking, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, inadequate physical activity, and obesity.IRISH CHRONIC CONDITION FACTS \u0097 38% of Irish people over the age of 50 years have one chronic condition. \u0097 By the age of 65, 65% of adults have two or more chronic conditions. \u0097 Ireland has a population of 4.6 million people; 1 million adults in this country have either cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease or diabetes. \u0097 People with chronic conditions utilise about 70% of health service resources. They are much more likely to require general practice services, they are more likely to present to an emergency department and they are more likely to be admitted than sent home. \u0097 It has been estimated that up to 80% of general practice consultations and 76% of hospital bed days relate to chronic condition and its complications. CHRONIC CONDITION MANAGEMENT The management of chronic conditions and multi-mobility is complex and challenging. Clinical care is often fragmented between primary and secondary care and between state-run health services and the voluntary sector. Tackling chronic conditions requires integration between government, health services, service providers, non-government organisations, community organisations and individuals. At a government level the focus is on creating policy documents, setting targets, agreeing how to distribute resources and monitoring outcomes. At a regional and local level, the focus is on the integration of formal and non-government organisational activities and the implementation of best evidence practice at secondary and primary care levels. At sites of healthcare provision such as primary care or specialist clinics and hospitals, the focus is on applying the best possible care customised to the needs of each individual. In Ireland, there have been several policy initiatives that inform how Ireland intends to address its growing chronic condition problem: \u0097 Tackling Chronic Disease (2009) (2013) As an action from the \"healthy Ireland in the health services\" implementation plan, two important framework documents were developed: \u0097 Making Every Contact Count (2016) https://www.hs e.ie/eng/about/who/healthwellbeing/ making-every-contact-count/making-every-contact- count-framework.pdf\u0097 Living Well with a Chronic Condition (Health Service Executive, 2017) https://www.hse.ie/eng/ health/hl/selfmanagement/hse-self-management- support-final-document1.pdf Common themes emerging from these policies consider: \u0097 That chronic conditions needs to be prevented, where possible (not all chronic conditions are preventable e.g. type 1 diabetes), as well as managed, and that individuals can play a large part in preventing or mitigating the effects of disease by taking responsibility for their own lifestyle choices, eating properly, stopping smoking and other addictive substances, reducing alcohol intake, taking exercise and keeping weight under control. \u0097 The importance of self-management as a concept in managing established a chronic condition.

Health is much more strongly associated with adequate housing and access to clean water than it is with the availability of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications. Thus, as healthcare professionals, we must recognise the relatively small part that we play in contributing to the overall health of the population. An individual's health is more likely to be determined by his/her socio-economic status, for example, than it is by the quality of his healthcare. Critical social determinants of health include: \u0097 Income \u0097 Educational attainment \u0097 Employment status and job security \u0097 Working conditions \u0097 Early childhood development \u0097 Food security \u0097 Housing \u0097 Social exclusion \u0097 Social networks and social capital \u0097 Sex \u0097 Race \u0097 DisabilityThe rising burden of chronic conditions is due mainly to behavioural factors.Manychronicconditionssuchascancer,CVD,COPDand diabetes are amenable to prevention. The main risk factors are tobacco and alcohol use, overweight and obesity, and low levels of physical activity. Associated risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are also major contributors. However, the aetiology of chronic conditions is complex. Whilst lifestyle and risk factorsaremodifiablethroughchangesindiet,behaviourandmedication, manyfactorsareevenmoredifficulttoaddress.Poorerpeoplearemore likely to smoke, to be overweight or obese as children and adults, and be less physically active. Notably, smoking is the greatest contributor to health inequalities between the richest and poorest sections of society. Smokingisalsoasignificantfactoringender-basedmortalitydifferences. Members of the travelling community, both men and women, have especially high smoking rates. Raised blood pressure shows a social class differential, with the poorer sections having higher levels of raised blood pressure.Nodifferentialisshownforraisedcholesterol(Jennings,2014). WHAT DETERMINES YOUR HEALTH? Whatdeterminesyourhealth?Thefirstthingthatmightspring to mind is the quality of your diet, whether you take exercise or perhaps your stress levels. However, these factors are only a very small part of the picture. There are many factors that impact upon health and wellbeing. These include the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age. These factors are not usually the direct causes of illness but are described as \"the causes of the causes\". While smoking is the cause of illnesses such as COPD, heart disease and lung cancer, it is the social factors, including cultural and environmental factors, which largely determine whether an individual is more or less likely to smoke, and if they do start whether they are likely to quit successfully. Factors such as where we live (e.g. damp, poorly insulated accommodation), the state of our environment (e.g. working in a noisy or toxic environment), genetics, our income and education level, and our relationships with friends and family all have considerable impacts on health, whereas the more commonly considered factors such as access and use of health care services often have less of an impact.

You will discuss the skills that a healthcare professional requires to support self-management. You will review a fact-sheet, which offers information on approaches to self-management and on self-management support programmes including the Flinders Chronic Condition Management Programme and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management Programme . This is followed by discussions around facilitating individuals to become effective self-managers. You will take time to consider some of the methods used to assess the effectiveness of self-management support. Lastly, you will be asked to read some relevant papers and respond to guided questions on self-management support criteria.

Self-management Skills and Tasks InUnit1weidentifiedthreecomponentsofself-management,medical,roleandemotionalself- management. In order to self-manage, the person needs to undertake several tasks, and attain a number of skills. The components, tasks and core skills that an individual needs for effective self-management are presented in Figure 1.6.

What skills do you think a healthcare professional requires to support self-management? Healthcare Professional Skills to Support Self-management The healthcare professional needs to possess core skills in order to collaborate with individuals with chronic conditions, these include the ability to: \u0097 Assess the individual's level of knowledge and existing engagement. \u0097 Assess readiness to change (Unit 1 and Making Every Contact Count Curriculum). \u0097 Promote healthy lifestyles and educating people about their chronic condition (Unit 1 and Making Every Contact Count Curriculum). \u0097 Facilitate development of core self-management skills in individuals with chronic conditions: problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation, forming partnerships and action planning (Unit 4 and Unit 5). \u0097 Provide individuals with information on their chronic condition to enable them to monitor their symptoms and know when and how to take appropriate action (Unit 2 and Unit 4). \u0097 Identify and utilise relevant state, community and voluntary/charitable support services. Provide or signpost to opportunities to share and learn from other individuals with similar chronic conditions (such as peer support groups Unit 2, 4 and 5). \u0097 Communication and negotiation skills required to support and work in partnership with individuals with chronic conditions (Unit 3). \u0097 Motivational interviewing skills (Brief intervention skills, based on motivational interviewing, are addressed in the Making Every Contact Count curriculum. Motivational interviewing is not dealt with further here. It is not dealt with here as more specialised training would be required). Thus, effective self-management requires a lot of commitment from the persons experiencing the conditions as well as the health professionals involved. Approaches to Self-management Support There are two commonly used approaches to providing self-management support: individually delivered self-management support and group-based self-management support. Factsheet 3 provides an overview of the approaches to self-management support. Activity 1.4: Approaches to self-management support Why do you think someone might be more suited to an individual or group approach to self-management support? Discuss in groups National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 52Individual approach to self-management support \"Supporting self-management is inseparable from high-quality care for people with long term conditions\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 14). An individual approach to self-management support involves development of a self-management care plan negotiated between healthcare professionals, the person, and their carer. The aims of a self-management care plan are: \u0097 To facilitate the person's engagement in assuming responsibility for their own healthcare. \u0097 To enhance the relationship between the person and the healthcare professional. \u0097 Toenhancetheperson'sself-efficacyformanagingtheirhealthandachieving optimal health outcomes. \u0097 To support the person to make and maintain health behaviour change relevant to their chronic condition/s. \u0097 Tofacilitatedisease-specificskillacquisition. \u0097 To create an opportunity for healthcare professionals to provide feedback on self- management outcomes. Two internationally recognised self-management support programmes are the Flinders Chronic Condition Management Programme (Battersby et al ., 2007) and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management Program (Lorig et al ., 2001). Both are licensed programmes and require specialised training by registered trainers in order to be licensed to deliver either programme. Before deciding on which approach to use, the ability of an individual to assume responsibility for managing their chronic condition needs to be assessed in order to identify the most appropriate approach to take to provide self-management support. Some individuals may require minimal support while others with more complex health issues may require more intensive support (Lawn and Schoo, 2010). Group-based self-management support Group-based self-management approaches are typically delivered over a 6-week period and usually consist of between 6-12 individuals. They are often supplemented with written materials so that participants have a resource after completion of the programme to which they can refer as a reminder of self-management strategies. The weekly sessions consist of presentation of disease related information by a healthcare professional followed by group discussion where individuals have an opportunity to share their experiences and to ask questions related to disease management (Barlow et al. , 2002). Due to the group nature of this approach, it is not possible to tailor the content to each individual's needs. Therefore, many group programmes cover generic issues related to living with a chronic condition including: \u0097 healthy eating \u0097 the role of physical activity on chronic condition management \u0097 pain management \u0097 strategies for managing the psychosocial impact of living with a chronic condition \u0097 communication strategies for developing an effective partnership with healthcare professionals National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 53Facilitating individuals to become effective self-managers Tobecomeaneffectiveself-manageranindividualhastofirstlybemotivatedtowanttochangehow s/he manages his/her health and secondly, have the self-belief that they are capable of managing the day to day aspects of their chronic condition. The ' Making Every Contact Count' module discussed theories that are used to understand what motivates individuals to make changes to their health behaviours. Health Behaviour Change Theories Underpinning Self-management of Chronic Conditions Behaviour change models help to understand why people behave the way that they do so that they can be encouraged and supported to make and maintain healthy lifestyle choices. Behaviour change can be very complex, particularly encouraging individuals to adopt healthy behaviours. Did You Know? Health behaviour change theories are covered in Making Every Contact Count curriculum (Unit 2, lesson 4). \u0097 Trans-theoretical Model of Health Behaviour \u0097 The Health Belief Model \u0097 The Behaviour Change Wheel (COM-B) Activity 1.5: Health Behaviour Change Revise the Trans-theoretical Model of Health Behaviour, The Health Belief Model and The Behaviour Change Wheel (COM-B), especially the principles of each model (Revision from Making Every Contact Count curriculum). Pause for Reflection and Discussion How do you think \"health behaviour change theories\" apply to self-management? Discuss in groups For behaviour change to take place the individual must want to make changes to how they are currently managing their chronic condition (be motivated) and secondly feel capable of making necessarychanges(beconfidentintheirabilitytomakechanges:i.e.self-efficacy). Therefore, the process begins by assessing an individual's self-management behaviours, identifying anybarrierstoself-managementand/orpyscho-socialdifficultiesthatcouldinterferewithself- management ability. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 54Two simple questions can guide healthcare professionals in identifying this 1. \"On a scale of 1-10 how important do you think it is for you to change how you currently manage your chronic condition?\" 2. \"On a scale of 1-10 how confident are you that you can make changes to how you currently manage your chronic condition?\" Figure 1.7: Trans-theoretical Stages of Change Model (adapted from Prochaska and DiClemente, 1992) Pre- contemplation Not yet considering change or unwilling or unable to changeContemplation Sees the possibilty of change Preparation Committed to change but still considering what to do Action Taking denite steps toward changeMaintenance Has made change and working to maintain changeRecurrance Stopped implementing change Pause for Reflection and Discussion At what stage in the Trans-theoretical stages of change model do you think a healthcare professional can provide self-management support? Measuring the Effectiveness of Self-management Support It is hoped that by providing support to individuals to self-manage that we will, in the longer term, be able to observe changes for the better, for individuals, healthcare professionals and health service providers. Here is a short activity to explore this idea further; National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 55 Activity 1.6: Self-management support outcomes Indicate the outcomes you would hope to see, as a result of self-management support, in relation to individuals with diabetes, healthcare professionals and health service providers' outcomes. One option for this activity is to use a platform such as Mentimeter to log feedback. Individuals Focused OutcomesTEXT Healthcare professional Focused OutcomesTEXT Health Service Provider Focused OutcomesTEXT Typical outcome measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of self-management support include: Category Outcomes for evaluation Physical health Blood pressure, weight, physical activity, physical endurance, peak expiratoryflowrate,fatigue,pain,functionalabilities Self-management behavioursIncreased physical activity, improved diet, smoking and alcohol use, adherence to medication and treatment, attendance at appointments. Patient activation measures Psychological health Self-efficacy,anxiety,depression,problem-solvingability Social health Accessing support services, participation in social activities, quality of life Laboratory tests HbA1c, cholesterol Medication Medication management (including technique such as inhalers) Cost Cost of delivery of intervention (direct and indirect) to include facilitators time (healthcare professional and/or lay leaders); resources required to deliver self-management support such as space, refreshments, design and printing of manual, resources for participants such as relaxation tapes; costs offset due to fewer complications; successful prevention Healthcare utilisation Change in frequency of GP or practice nurse visits; ED visits; number of hospital admissions and length of stay; days lost from work or education, appropriateness of healthcare utilisation (e.g. regular GP review visits v. emergency presentations) Process evaluation Acceptability of self-management support to service users and healthcare professionals, health education questionnaire (HEIQ) National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 56 Activity 1.7: Read and Reflect Read these papers on involving individuals with chronic conditions in chronic condition self-management: Entwistle,V.A.,Cribb,A.,andOwens,J.(2018).WhyHealthandSocialCare Support for People with Long-Term Conditions Should Be Oriented Towards Enabling Them to Live Well.

Supporting patients to self-manage chronic disease: clinicians' perspectives and current practices. Australian Journal of Primary Health, 20 (3): 257-265. After reading the papers on self-management support for individuals with chronic conditions, consider the following questions; \u0097 What is meant by the term self-management support, and what is its purpose? \u0097 What are some of the key components of self-management support for individuals with a chronic condition? \u0097 How important is the individual with a chronic condition in self-managing theircondition,andwhatfactorscaninfluenceaperson'sadoptionof more effective self-management behaviour? \u0097 How can healthcare professionals support individuals with a chronic condition to self-manage? \u0097 What supports are needed to enable healthcare professionals to allow individuals with a chronic condition to 'Live Well'? Summary of the Lesson In Lesson 2 you explored tasks and skills needed for effective self-management and also the skills that a healthcare professional requires to support self-management. You were provided with fact-sheets which offer information on approaches to self-management and on self-management support programmes including the Flinders Chronic Condition Management Programme and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management Programme. You also highlighted the outcomes, which you would expect to see as a result of self-management support. Lastly, you were asked to review relevant papers and to respond to questions on self-management support criteria. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 57Factsheet 3: Approaches to Self-management Support Individual approach to self-management An individual approach to self-management involves development of a self-management care plan negotiated between healthcare professionals, the individual/carer.

The weekly sessions consist of presentation of disease related information by a health professional followed by group discussion where individuals have an opportunity to share their experiences and to ask questions related to disease management (Barlow et al., 2002). Due to the group nature of this approach, it is not possible to tailor the content to each individual's needs. Therefore, many group programmes cover generic issues related to living with a chronic condition including: \u0097 healthy eating \u0097 the role of physical activity on chronic condition management \u0097 pain management \u0097 strategies for managing the psychosocial impact of living with a chronic condition \u0097 communication strategies for developing an effective partnership with healthcare professionals Self-management Support for Multimorbidity As individuals age, there is an increasing likelihood that they will develop more than one chronic condition. This is known as multimorbidity and now we will take a moment to discuss multimorbidity in the context of self-management support. Multimorbidityisdefinedastheco-existenceoftwoormorechronicconditions(VandenAkker,1996). Risk factors for multimorbidity are similar to those for single chronic condition and as people are now living longer, the incidence of multimorbidity is increasing globally. Multimorbidity is associated with reduced functional abilities, psychological distress and poorer quality of life. People with multimorbidity havereportedthattheyhavegreaterdifficultymanagingtheimpactofmultimorbidityontheirdaily activities than managing their various chronic conditions. A Cochrane review of effective interventions for multimorbidity recommended providing support for individuals to maintain their functional abilities. Self- management support therefore focuses on developing broad-based knowledge and skills for individuals to manage their daily activities. OPTIMAL, is a group-based self-management programme for individuals with multimorbidity (O'Toole et al. , 2013, Garvey et al. , 2015). It is delivered by a multi-disciplinary team over a 6-week period. The content of OPTIMAL includes fatigue and stress management, diet and physical activity, medication management and effective communication with carers, healthcare professionals and employers. Goal setting and problem-solving skills are embedded into each weekly session. Studies on the effectiveness ofOPTIMALdemonstratesignificantimprovementsinactivityparticipation,self-efficacyandqualityoflife (Garvey et al. , 2015). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 58Self-management Support Programmes Two internationally recognised self-management support programmes are the Flinders Chronic Condition Management Programme (Battersby et al., 2007) and the Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management Program (Lorig et al., 2001). Both are licensed programmes and require specialised training by registered trainers to in order to be licensed to deliver either programme. The Flinders Chronic Condition Management Programme The Flinders Chronic Condition Management Programme (Battersby et al ., 2007) is probably the most widely-known individual approach for providing self-management support. It is based on health behaviour change theory and provides structured opportunities for developing positive health behaviours to improve self-management abilities. The Flinders programme was developed following a considerable investment from the Australian government to promote self-management in individuals with chronic conditions. This was in recognition of the increasing burden of chronic conditions for individuals, their families and Australian health services. The Flinders programme uses a person-centred care planning process to set lifestyle-related goals for the management of an individual's chronic condition. It consists of a generic set of tools from which health professionals can choose in order to provide tailored self-management support based on individual's needs and readiness to engage in self-management. The Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management Programme (CDSMP) The Stanford Chronic Disease Self-management Program (CDSMP) is a group-based self-management programme developed by Kate Lorig and colleagues in Stanford University (Lorig et al ., 2001). The CDSMP was initially designed for people with arthritis to develop knowledge and skills to manage the medical, physical and psychological impact of their arthritis. It provides diseasespecificinformation,medicationmanagement, symptom management, strategies for dealing with the emotional aspects of living with chronic conditions and communicating effectively with healthcare professionals.Internet-based self-management support Variousinternet-basedself- management support programmes have been developed over the past decade. The impetus for this development is related to a number of factors including: \u0097 Less resource intensive to deliver \u0097 Suits those who are unable to travel to receive self- management support \u0097 Is more appealing to those who do not wish to participate in group-based self-management support \u0097 More relevant to younger peoplewhogenerallyfulfiltheir information needs through online resources References Barlow, J., Wright, C., Sheasby, J., Turner, A. and Hainsworth, J.

Accompanying Slide Pack for Unit 2https://www.hse.ie/sms-undergradcurriculum/ National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 62Unit 2: Holistic Approach to Self-management Support Introduction to Unit 2 In Unit 2, you will study the concept of holistic care in the context of self-management support. There will be opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how to support individuals in the medical, role and emotional self-management of their chronic condition. There will be discussions on the ways in which healthcare professionals, communities and families can support self- management in a holistic way. There is a lesson on health literacy, again highlighting the importance of individual preferences and abilities in keeping with person-centred holistic care. Case studies are presented to facilitate learning. Recap Unit 1 In Unit 1 you were introduced to the concept of self-management support through exploration ofthedefinitions,foundationsandprinciplesunderpinningbothself-managementandself- management support. You explored the core tasks and skills which individuals with chronic conditions require to be effective self-managers. In addition, you were encouraged to explore the skills that are required of the healthcare professional in supporting individuals to develop the skills that they need to self-manage their chronic condition. Lesson 1: Good days Bad days Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 2 Lesson 1: Good days Bad days Introduction to Lesson 1 InLesson1youwillbeaskedtoreflectonwhatgooddaysandbaddaysmightfeellikewhenliving with a chronic condition. The interrelationship between physical and psychological health problems will be addressed. You will take time to consider how healthcare professionals can provide holistic care to individuals with chronic conditions, which supports self-management. Holistic care incorporatescommunityandfamilysupport.InthisLesson,youwillhaveanopportunitytoreflect on a number of case studies and read about a home simulation exercise which describes how students may \"live a week\" as a person with diabetes. Good Days Bad Days: A Holistic Approach Living with a chronic condition entails managing the effects on physical, psychological and social functioning. As addressed in Unit 1, self- managementincludeshavingtheconfidencetodealwiththemedical, role and emotional self-management of long-term health conditions. All are elements that play a unique yet interrelated role. Everyone experiences good days and bad days, this is no different from living with a chronic condition. Have you ever thought about what it is that makes you feel well or healthy? Have you considered why you are having a good day or a bad day?Haveyouthoughtabouthowoneaspectofyourlifecaninfluence another? Let's take some time to think about these simple yet extremely significantfactors. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 63Pause for Reflection and Discussion What does having a good day mean to you? What do you consider a bad day? Would having a chronic condition alter your perception on having good or bad days? It is possible to agree that living well with chronic conditions is reliant on managing a combination of inter-related holistic factors; including medical, role and emotional elements. In Unit 1, we identifiedthatadoptingaholisticperson-centredapproachinhealthcareprovisioniskeyto successful self-management. The literature on chronic condition management frequently refers to a holistic approach as an integral part of optimal care. Pause for Reflection and Discussion What do you understand about the term 'holistic' in the context of chronic condition self-management? The interrelationship between physical and psychological health problems People with chronic physical illness have a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Both are very common co-morbidities for people with chronic physical illness (Naylor et al. , 2012). Depression and anxiety are also amongst the most common recurrent or long-term conditions people now face (World Health Organisation, 2017). It is important to recognise that mental disorders of all kinds are associated with an increased risk of onset of a wide range of chronic physical conditions (Scott et al. , 2016). Activity 2.1: Mental and physical health Write down 3 ways in which poor mental health might impact on physical health. Write down 3 ways in which poor physical health might impact on mental health. Discuss your responses in groups.

Did You Know? Individualswithseriousmentalillnessmayfaceaseriesofbarriersfirstlyinaccessinghealthcare provided self-management support; and secondly in effectively engaging in self-management of their illness. Persons with serious mental illness experience greater social challenges that may includeunemployment,homelessness,incarcerations,victimization/trauma,poverty,andsocial exclusion. Consequently, it is particularly important for these persons to acquire the skills to self- manage both their chronic medical conditions and their mental illness. Pause for Reflection and Discussion Can you think of other instances where self-management is more challenging for individuals? Activity 2.2: Triggers for discussion Do you think that being deaf or blind would challenge a person's ability to self-manage? Do you think being homeless would challenge self-management?

Date: 27th April. Weather: Sunny I woke up at 8 a.m. and thought 'Thank goodness, last night was such a (rare) good night because my nights are usually filled with insomnia, pains and sometimes an asthma attack. First thing in the morning, I checked the weather and it seemed not that bad today. So, I omitted my nasal spray, opened the windows in my apartment and I went shopping. As I left the shop, there was a man smoking outside near the exit. I tried to hold my breath until I got far enough away from him and the smoke. This was short but made me very tired physically. When I got home, I went up the stairs very slowly as I struggled with the stairs and felt like I was climbing a mountain. I closed all the windows and turned on the air conditioning system to help control my breathing. After having dinner with John (husband), we watched a TV comedy to enjoy the rest of our evening. I've always laughed deeply and loudly, but unfortunately it sometimes upsets my asthma. Tonight, I couldn't catch my breath while laughing. I sat up and John rubbed my back. I took out my inhaler and administrated a double dose. I felt scared because I started thinking that one of my former colleagues lost her son due to an Asthma attack. I drank some water and nothing worse happened to me tonight. John fell asleep at around 10:40 p.m. but I found it too difficult to sleep. I tried to read a book or play some mobile games, but it was no use at all. At around midnight, I moved out to our couch in the living room to try to get some sleep. Pause for Reflection and Discussion Is there evidence of medical, role and emotional elements influencingAnna'sday? What aspect of Anna's day stands out for you and why? Providing Holistic Support for Self-management We are starting to get a sense of the multiple factors involved in living with a chronic condition andofhowtheycaninfluenceaperson'sabilitytoself-manage.Itisalsoclearthatchronic condition management is dependent on a number of key players. Pause for Reflection and Discussion Who do you think the key players are in supporting self-management of chronic conditions? Take a few minutes to read some of the ways that carers, communities and healthcare professionals contribute to supporting individuals and to self-manage theirchroniccondition,andtolivefulfillinglives. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 68Family and community support to individuals with chronic conditions \"I was amazingly surprised to see my husband on the same diet as me! He said that this is also his part sacrifice to have a healthy baby. Since I am enduring so much pain and health complications, he can do this small effort for me.\" A pregnant diabetes patient (Nishaat, 2017, p. 28) \"At school there's a nurse and I find school very helpful with him, they keep an eye on it, they're very aware of it. You know, there's obviously several other children with inhalers and they're very up to date, give it back to you if it's out of date, they listen to him if he asks for it, there's never a problem like that. I feel he's safe in their hands...I do think the school are quite reassuring, to know that they keep an eye on him for me, even if it was a false alarm, I do think the school are very good.\" An asthma patient's parent (Kendall et al., 2010, p. 91) \"The greatest source of happiness in our lives was everything we did together. Like being out in the forests picking wild mushrooms and travelling with our caravan. But I finally had to stop him from driving the car and caravan. 'But maybe we can buy a camper?' So I organized this and now we have bought a camper... so now we have been out with it.\" A spouse (Eriksson and Svedlund, 2006, p. 329)\"I am always late as I just explained. So it's usually my husband who tells me 'If you don't go now, I will take care of it'. You know, like, then I will make the call.\" A COPD patient (Korpershoek et al., 2018, p. 6) \"[When I learned I had diabetes] I was worried that I would die, and my father would tell me that I was not going to die. \"Look at me, I've had diabetes for so long and I haven't died yet.\" So now I have my psychologist, my children, my husband telling me to stay calm.\" A diabetes patient (Pesantes et al., 2018, p. 1874) \"If I didn't wake her up, I think that she could sleep all through, without taking medication and that. I have to wake her up to give her medication.\" A family carer of a COPD patient (Schafheutle et al., 2018, p. 1024) National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 69How can healthcare professionals provide holistic care to promote and support self- management? \"Sometimes I contacted the company physician at the patients' workplace. If a patient is shift working, I asked, for example, to change the workplace because the meal time of this patient is irregular or something like that.\" A GP (Goetz et al., 2012, p. 4) \"Yes to the dietician, because she explained everything to us and she asked me what we were eating and to cut out certain things and with cholesterol as well.\" A stroke patients' wife (Kendall et al., 2010, p. 114) \"Good self-management support is only possible if you look at the holistic person, if you open up all your senses and look at what this person needs.\" A nurse (van Hooft et al., 2015, p. 162)\"You want the patient to do it himself. You practice together if it is necessary and you then inform him once again.\" A nurse (van Hooft et al., 2015, p. 163) \"I will try to establish a sports group particular for multimorbid patients not just for diabetes or coronary patients.\" A GP (Goetz et al., 2012, p. 6) \"Sometimes, ignorance plays a part. As a health professional it is my duty to support patients and especially to give information, even when the patient does not ask for it.\" A nurse (van Hooft et al., 2015, p. 163) National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 70There is broad consensus that to realistically promote optimal engagement and self-management in chronic condition management, healthcare professionals must take a person-centered, holistic approach. But what does this mean? Do all individuals with diabetes; or cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease not receive the same standard of guideline-driven care; the same clinical tests; the same medications? Pause for Reflection and Discussion What is meant by person-centred care? Think of an example of how two persons, the same age, both with stage 2 COPD, on the same medications might require different supports. Now think of an example of how two persons, the same age, both with type 1 diabetes might require different supports. Readthisdefinitionperson-centredcare. \"Person centred co-ordinated care provides me with access to and continuity in the services I need when and where I need them. It is underpinned by a comprehensive assessment of my life and my world combined with the information and support I need. It demonstrates respect for my preferences, building care around me and those involved in my care\" (Adapted from Irish Platform for Patient Organisations Science & Industry (IPPOSI), 2019). With algorithms', 'care pathways', 'policies', 'clinical guidelines', etc., that must be considered in clinical practice, it is easy for novice healthcare professionals to lose sight of the individuality of the person with a chronic condition. Expansion of care and support beyond the medical management, and to include community and social resources and networks, is an important element of person-centred holistic care provision. This leads to the important topic of social prescribing. Social prescribing is a non-clinical, community-based service that supports individuals with chronic mental and/or physical health conditions to participate in activities in their local communities that interest them and that can improve their health (Moffatt et al. , 2017). This topic is further addressed in Unit 4. Having explored the myriad of factors involved in the day-to-day self-management of chronic conditions and the importance of adopting a holistic approach in supporting individuals to self- manage,wewilltaketimetoreflectonsomecasestudiestostrengthenyourappreciationofliving with a chronic condition. Activity 2.4: Case studies In groups read one of the following case studies and respond to the questions provided. Feedback to the class on the case study and on your responses. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 71Case Study 1 Living with diabetes: Seeking support to live life to the full Eliza is a 90-year-old women, who enjoys life and always wants to live it to the full. A typical day for Eliza is that she rises at 8 a.m., has a shower, and then breakfast. She drives to church every morning which is an important spiritual and social event in her life. She has lunch at 1 p.m. and dinner at 6 p.m. In between meals and weather permitting, she likes to get outdoors, and enjoys to spend time gardening, especially growing and tending to her vegetables, fruit trees and shrubs, and lots of flowering plants. In the afternoon, she almost always has a visitor calling on her for a cup of tea and a chat. Being 90, Eliza has many stories to share. As the evening closes, Eliza likes to read and she has a wide range of interests in both fiction and non-fiction. On Thursday mornings she drives to her local town for her weekly appointment at the hairdressers, then goes to the bank, then does her shopping, and is usually home by 1pm for her lunch. Occasionally, she might arrive home later if shopping takes longer than usual or if she bumps into people she knows in which case she spends time chatting with them or might go for a coffee with them. On Friday morning, Eliza goes to the 'Young at Heart' club which is a social event for older adults in her community. In order to live life to the full, Eliza is keen to manage her diabetes which she has for the past 6 years. She has latent autoimmune diabetes requiring insulin injections (short and long acting) in the morning and evenings. In addition, she has a suprapubic catheter and knows that if she 'breaks out' on sweet foods, her urine bag will become fuller more often in the day. Eliza's daughter-in-law who lives close by likes to keep an eye of Eliza's diabetes and feels she needs to slow down in her life and be strict with herself in taking the prescribed amount of insulin so that her blood sugars stay stable and do not drop because of being too active. With a twinkle in her eye, Eliza pretends to agree with her but she has figured out how best to manage her insulin. For example, on Thursday, because she is going to town and more active than a typical day, she takes 2 units less of the fast acting insulin at breakfast time. She has found that this works well for the most part (although not always) such that her blood sugar does not drop to the point of having a 'hypo'. Eliza believes that managing her insulin dosage around her activities means she can continue to live her life to the full. However, at times, she does wonder if she should be more rigid about her insulin even if it does mean being less active and withdrawing from some of her hobbies. This is something she plans to raise with the diabetes team the next time she goes to the clinic. Questions for Reflection and Discussion Note for instructors: Consider the extent to which students pick up on the fullness of health and well-being - physically active, enjoyment at a psychological level, and social interactions. Daily activities and living life to the full are at the foreground whereas diabetes and living with a suprapubic catheter are at the background. Note that Eliza was not introduced as a diabetic at the outset, and so diabetes does not define who she is and how she wants to live her life. 1.WhatstrikesyouaboutthiscasestudyonElizaintermsofhavingaholisticperspective on life and where is diabetes situated within this? 2.WhatareyourviewsaboutthedisparitiesbetweenEliza'sapproachtomanagingherinsulin and her daughter-in-law's desire that she be compliant with prescribed insulin dosages? 3.IfElizaraisesherapproachtomanagingherinsulinwithyouasamemberofthediabetic team,whatwouldyourprioritiesbeforElizainherlifeandwhy? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 72Case Study 2 New Diagnosis of Heart Failure Claire is 72 and lives with her husband Jim to whom she is married to for 46 years. Claire and Jim have 3 daughters, Clodagh (42), Amy (40) and Claire (36) and 8 grandchildren. They all live within 10 miles of the family home. They visit her frequently and are a great support to herself and Jim. Jim is 75 and in excellent health. Claire does not drive but Jim does and he is always happy and available to drive her anywhere. Typically Claire walks to meet her friend for coffee daily. The walk is just about 800 meters. She enjoys her game of 25s cards every Sunday night and goes to bingo every Thursday night. She finds these events great fun and she particularly enjoys the social aspect of it. She is an avid reader, always has a novel on the go and reads the 3 regional newspapers weekly. She minds Amy's two children after school on Mondays and Fridays. She cooks their dinners and helps them with their reading. She really looks forward to these days with her grandchildren. Claire was diagnosed with left ventricular systolic dysfunction heart failure 3 months ago. Apart from when she delivered her children, it was her first ever time in hospital as a patient. Prior to that, she was only on one little tablet (calcium channel blocker) for 12 years to treat her blood pressure. She is now on three tablets (loop diuretic, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor). From a clinical perspective, since her diagnosis, Claire has been doing very well. Her daily weights and symptoms have been very stable. She eats healthily, has a healthy BMI and a reasonable physical activity level. Claire's hospitalisation and diagnosis really came out of the blue and have given quite a knock to both herself and Jim. Jim has noticed a significant drop in her energy and motivation levels, particularly in the mornings. In fact some days she has even asked Jim to drive up to the church for mass. She has also skipped a few of the Wednesday morning catch-ups with her friends. Clare herself has also noticed that her concentration levels are not quite as good as they used to be. This has particularly affected her enjoyment of reading. Staff at the heart failure clinic have advised her that the low energy levels she is experiencing are to be expected and that over time and on the right medication her energy levels should improve. However, Claire is not convinced. In fact she believes the new medication regimen is making her worse rather than better. Amy has noticed and commented on the fact that Claire is a little down in herself. Deep down, Claire's greatest concern is that Amy will consider alternative childcare arrangements to the Monday and Friday visits to her house. It would upset Claire greatly if the children did not come over on those days. They are her greatest motivation and the highlight of her and Jim's week. Questions for Reflection and Discussion 1. In taking a holistic approach to Claire's situation, consider what may be contributing to Claire's low energy and low motivation levels? Consider this from a medical, role and emotional perspective. 2. Consider what are the potential consequences of Claire's inclination to withdraw from her social groups? 3. Claire is concerned about not being able to look after her grandchildren. Consider how realistic these concerns are? How might these concerns be addressed? 4. Upon reading Claire's story, what elements if any may indicate a challenge in terms of her ability to self-manage her condition? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 73Case Study 3 Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease Mark is 49 and works as a senior partner for a leading international accountancy firm. He is very dedicated to his work. It is a very fast-paced and competitive environment and this is what he loves about it - 'it is his life' by his own admission. He works very long hours including being in the office most Saturdays and sometimes Sundays as deadlines approach. He travels on short international trips at least three times per month. He has an annual gym membership and is a member of the local yacht club. He does not go out socialising with friends frequently because he is so busy. He experiences a lot of stress in his work but he believes this is par for the course and once deadlines pass things settle down for a while again. Mark was a chronic smoker for 25 years - smoking 20-30 cigarettes a day. He was diagnosed with hypertension in his early 40s and was diagnosed with moderate COPD two years ago. He gave up smoking after being diagnosed with COPD and in his mind, he has dealt with it. He is prescribed inhalers but regularly forgets to take them. Despite having gym membership he has only been once this year and the yacht club activity is no different. He is just too busy and by the end of the week he is exhausted. Although he does not socialise with his friends much, he has a very hectic social life through his work with office dinners and client dinners as many of his most important client dealings are conducted in these environments. Although he does not identify with having a high alcohol intake, on many weeks his alcohol intake significantly exceeds the recommended maximum of 21 units. He is not inclined to have breakfast and eats out on a daily basis or grabs a roll for lunch on the go. Since ceasing to smoke he has gained almost 11 kg over the past two years. He works late into the night on email and gets a maximum of 5 hours sleep per night. He has noticed his energy levels have reduced significantly and plans to discuss this with the COPD team at his next health visit - although he must reschedule that again and push it out for another month or two until after his next deadline at work. He has already had to take a few extra days out of work at Christmas because of a severe chest infection and cannot afford take another day out just to attend an appointment. Questions for Reflection and Discussion 1. In taking a holistic approach to Marks' situation, consider what may be contributing to Mark's low energy levels? Consider this from a medical, role and emotional perspective. 2. Consider and discuss how Mark has addressed his diagnosis of COPD? Is Mark optimising his capacity to self-manage his condition? 3. When Mark next attends the COPD clinic, what are the priorities that need to be addressed? How should these be approached from a holistic perspective?

How much does the paper bring out the medical, role and emotional aspects of living with a chronic condition? 3. Is there any discussion in the papers around key supports for the individual? Note for instructors: There is opportunity here for students to discuss their own personal experiences of living with a chronic condition or living with a family member with a chronic condition. Also, these papers are options and may be substituted. Simulation Exercise Note for instructors: The following exercise is provided as an example, and facilitators may wish to incorporate or develop a similar exercise As a healthcare professional, gaining a better understanding of what it is like to live with a chronic condition may help you in providing holistic self-management support. In some programmes, educators have developed simulation exercises to help achieve this deeper understanding. The following descriptor is a sample of a 'simulation' assignment from a module on 'Diabetes Self- management' in the School of Medicine at NUI Galway. The aims of the module are outlined below but can summarised in the module tagline: \"You can't judge a man until you walk a mile in his shoes\". The module was developed by Prof S\u00e9an Dinneen (School of Medicine, NUI Galway) with colleagues in the Diabetes Day Centre at University College Hospital Galway. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 75Sample 'Simulation' Assignment: Learnings from a Specialist Study Module Diabetes Self-management4 Module Title: Self-management of diabetes mellitus: what does it really mean? Module Learning Objectives: By the end of this module, students are expected to be able to: 1. Describe the main differences (including the lived experience) between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 2. Describe the principles underlying self-management education. 3. Appreciate the impact that living with diabetes has on a person's life through experiential learning. 4. Describe the components of a Structured Education Programme such as 'Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE)' or 'Diabetes Education and Self-management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed (DESMOND)' for people living with Diabetes. 5. Discuss the term Patient Empowerment and what it means. 6. Describe what is meant by goal setting and personalized care planning. Module Content (relevant to the above assignments): 1. Introduction to qualitative methodology, including PhotoVoice. Students are introduced to qualitative research and in particular, PhotoVoice. PhotoVoice is a research methodology that provides participants an opportunity to take photographs that address a salient concern (Wang and Burris, 1997). Students are then asked to use PhotoVoice methods for the duration of the module to capture their experience of 'Living with' type 1 and 2 Diabetes (discussed below). 2. Living with type 2 Diabetes In this module, students are given the opportunity to meet someone living with type 2 Diabetes, ask questions and reflect on the same. In addition, students experience a 'Supermarket Tour' facilitated by a Diabetes Specialist Dietician which enables them to reflect on packaging/marketing of foods, reading food labels, meal planning, healthy 'on-the-go' options and interpret health claims. A lecture on physical activity and behaviour change is also provided by an expert in that field. Key reading is provided throughout the module. Students are then asked to complete the following simulation exercise for a 1 week period: \u0097 Complete a food diary \u0097 Log their physical activity \u0097 (e.g. step count using an accessible device or self-report activity log) 4 1.

Living with Type 1 Diabetes Similar to the 'living with type 2 Diabetes' content of this module, students are given the opportunity to meet someone living with type 1 Diabetes, ask questions and reflect. They meet a pump wearer and also a parent and child (who lives with type 1). A Diabetes Specialist nurse facilitates sessions on the background and management of type 1 Diabetes and provides key reading in the area. Students are then asked to complete the following simulation exercise for a 1 week period: \u0097 Wear an insulin pump \u0097 Carbohydrate counting \u0097 Monitor blood glucose \u0097 Complete a blood glucose diary \u0097 Reflect on how to adjust insulin dose \u0097 Reflect on how to manage, anticipate and prevent episodes of hypo- and hyper-glycaemia \u0097 Reflect on how to manage ketones and sick days Assignment Details: Students are given the following two assignments in relation to the 'living with Diabetes' part of the module. These include a written reflective piece and an oral presentation as follows : Reflective Assignment (80%): \u0097 Based on your experiences of participating in this Special Study Module and 'living' as someone with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, reflect on the burden of diabetes self-management. You are required to use PhotoVoice to aid reflection. (500 words) Oral Presentation (20%): \u0097 Students must prepare a 5-minute PowerPoint presentation addressing the title below. As a guide, you should have between 5 and 10 slides maximum and use your experience of PhotoVoice. \"Self-management of diabetes: what does it really mean?

You also explored some of the ways in which healthcare professionals can provide holistic care to individuals with chronic conditions, facilitating self-management support. Holistic care incorporates community, family and carer support in addition to direct healthcare provision. In Lesson 2, you will learn that health literacy is an important aspect in holistically supporting individuals to self-manage. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 77Lesson 2: Health Literacy Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 2 Lesson 2: Health Literacy Introduction to Lesson 2 In Lesson 2 you have opportunity to explore health literacy in the context of holistically supporting individuals to self-manage to the best of their ability. This lesson emphasises the importance of each individuals' capabilities in terms of accessing and interpreting health information while acknowledging the implications of how health literacy impacts on the way in which individuals ultimately manage their condition. Recap Unit 2 Lesson 1 In Lesson 1 you explored the interrelationship between medical, role and emotional elements. You also discussed some of the ways in which healthcare professionals can provide holistic care to individuals with chronic conditions, facilitating self-management support while acknowledging that holistic care includes community, family and carer support in addition to direct healthcare provision. You were also introduced to social prescribing in the context of self-management. Provision of Information to Support Self-management Being able to effectively obtain and use health information is an essential element of empowering and supporting patients to self-manage their chronic conditions. People with chronic conditions, and their carers, need a variety of information at different times, depending on their personal situation and the stage of their condition. However, there are a number of key stages where people needspecifichealthinformationandadvice: \u0097 Diagnosis: understanding the condition (impact and prognosis), medication and treatment options, and contact details of relevant support services and networks. \u0097 Living with the condition : adapting to the impact of the condition on social roles and daily activities, learning how to manage the condition, using their medication, accessing appropriate vaccination and understanding when and how to access further help and support. \u0097 Progression of the condition and changes in life circumstances. \u0097 Transitions in the condition and care: moving between care settings. \u0097 End of life. Informationcanbeeitherdiseasespecific,orgeneric(e.g.howtomosteffectivelyliaisewith healthcare professionals, or information on relaxation techniques). Since people with chronic conditions, and their carers, learn in different ways, information should be available in a variety of formats that can be personalised to meet individual's needs and understanding. The impact of information provided is greater when written information is targeted, personalised and reinforced by verbal communication from healthcare staff . It is important to identify patients and carers with poor levels of health literacy and this needs to be taken into account when designing and imparting information and care planning for best use of resources. Healthcare professionals, and organisations, should promote the development and co-ordination of consistent information resources, informed by patients and carers needs and preferences, across care settings - See Unit 5: Service Delivery and Organisation for Self-management Support - (Health Service Executive, 2017). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 78 Activity 2.5: Patient's information needs Consider what the information needs of a person at the different stages above would be? How might you help the person to access the information they need? What is Health Literacy? Thereisnooneuniversaldefinitionofhealthliteracy.Multipledefinitionshaveevolvedovertime (S\u00f8rensen Pleasant, 2014; Batterham et al. , 2016). Health literacy concerns the capacities of people to meet the complex demands of health in modern society. It is viewed as an increasingly important component in the self-management of illness and the ability to effectively engage in health promotion activities (S\u00f8rensen et al ., 2015). Institute of Medicine Committee on Health Literacy (2004) have defined health literacy as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Health literacy is understood to be linked to literacy and encompasses people's knowledge, motivation and competences to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make judgements and take decisions in everyday life concerning healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion to maintain or improve quality of life during the life course (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012). S\u00f8rensen et al.(2012)undertookasystematicreviewtodevelopanintegrateddefinitionand conceptualmodelofhealthliteracy.Theyidentifiedthreedomainsandfourdimensionsofhealth literacy set out below which illustrates the breadth of the health literacy concept: Table 2.1: Three Domains of Health and Four Dimensions of Health Literacy (S\u00f8rensen et al. , 2012, p. 10) Access/obtain information relevant to healthUnderstand information relevant to healthProcess/appraise information relevant to healthApply/use information relevant to health Healthcare Ability to access information on medical or clinical issuesAbility to understand medical information and derive meaningAbility to interpret and evaluate medical informationAbility to make informed decisions on medical issue Disease PreventionAbility to access information on risk factors for health Ability to understand information on risk factors and derive meaning Ability to interpret and evaluate information on risk factors for healthAbility to make informed decisions on risk factors for health Health PromotionAbility to update oneself on determinants of health in the social and physical environmentAbility to understand information on determinants of health in the social and physical environment and derive meaningAbility to interpret and evaluate information on health determinants in the social and physical environmentAbility to make informed decisions on health determinants in the social and physical environment National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 79These aspects of the health literacy concept informed the development of a model of health literacy which is set out below: Figure 2.2: Conceptual Model of Health Literacy (adapted from S\u00f8rensen et al. , 2012) Situational determinants Health promotionHealth service user Health behavior Participation EquityHealth costs outcomes Empowerment SustainabilityDisease preventionHealth -careSocietal and determinantsLife course Individual Level Population LevelKnowledge Competence MotivationACCESSUNDER STAND APPRAISE APPLY HEALTH INFORMATION Read For more information on this model please read the article by S\u00f8rensen et al. (2012), which can be found at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471- 2458/12/80 . It is important to recognise that health literacy has two elements as illustrated by National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) Health services communicate clearly and take account of possible health literacy and numeracy needs.People understand health and information correctly and can make an informed decision Health literacy is about the discrepancy between an individual's health literacy skills and the demands and expectations placed on them by the increasingly complex environments of health and socialserviceprovision(Rudd,2016).Thisisdepictedinfigure2.3below: National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 80Figure 2.3: Health Literacy (adapted from Institute of Medicine, 2009) Skills and Abilities Demands and ComplexitiesHealth Literacy The level of skills and abilities an individual needs to successfully make informed decisions and take and sustain actions that promote their health, prevent ill health and manage chronic conditions, are dependent on the way information is made available and presented. It is also dependant on an environment in which individuals health actions are supported. Health literacy skills can be classifiedintothreecategoriesoffunctional,interactiveandcriticalhealthliteracy(Nutbeam,2000) and these are described below: \u0097 Functional health literacy: which is the basic skills of reading, writing and numeracy necessary to function effectively in a health context. \u0097 Interactive health literacy: which refers to more advanced cognitive literacy skills that with social skills, can be used to actively participate in everyday situations, extract information and derive meaning from different forms of communication, and apply this to changing circumstance. \u0097 Critical health literacy : is the ability to critically analyse information and use this to exert greater control over life events and situations. Why is it relevant? The work of S\u00f8rensen et al. (2012) outlined above informed the development of the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU Consortium, 2012) which was conducted during the summer of 2011 across eight European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, and Spain) in a total sample of approximately 8000 respondents. Scores were divided into 4categories:'inadequate','problematic','sufficient'and'excellent'healthliteracy.Inthegeneral sample about 12% of respondents were found to have inadequate general health literacy, and more than one third (35%) problematic health literacy. This means that nearly one out of two respondents in this survey has limited health literacy. While this is the overall result this pattern differs by country whichcanbeseeninfigure2.4below(S\u00f8rensen et al. , 2015). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 81Figure 2.4: General Health Index (adapted from S\u00f8rensen et al. , 2015) Austria Bulgaria Germany HL When we look at the distribution of health literacy levels across the European countries we see that thesedifferedsubstantiallyacrosscountries(29-62%).Thesurveyfindingsalsoindicatedthatthere were a higher proportion of people with limited health literacy in subgroups within the population. This suggests a social gradient and inequality (S\u00f8rensen et al. , 2015). These subgroups included those with: \u0097 financialdeprivation \u0097 lower social status \u0097 older age.

In groups discuss the implications for people in Ireland. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 82Why Health Literacy Matters (adapted from Mitic and Rootman, 2012) Health Literacy affects a lot of people Every one experiences situations that require accessing, understanding, appraising and applying information to make informed appropriate health-related decisions. However, nearly 50% of people surveyed across eight European countries lack the capacity to do just that (HLS-EU Consortium, 2012). Limited health literacy negatively impacts on health Research has consistently found that individuals with low health literacy experience poorer health outcomes across a wide range of areas and poorer use of the health services. Berkman et al. (2011)undertookasystematicreviewthatidentifiedthatthiswasthecaseacrossthethreedomains of health with regard to; the use of preventive services, the self-management of illness such as adherence to medication and increased admission to hospital and longer hospital stays for those with limited health literacy. Reducing the burden of chronic conditions There are increasing rates of chronic condition across the EU which will place ever increasing demands on health systems (Busse et al. , 2010). One way to ameliorate the effects of this is to engage patients in more effective self-management (Heneghan et al. , 2009). Health Literacy is central to this approach. Equity and the promotion of fairness Equity in health implies that the needs of people guide the availability of opportunities for well-being (World Health Organisation, 1996). Improving the health literacy of those with the poorest health outcomes is an important way to reduce health inequalities (Department of Health, 2009). Read the paper: Health literacy and cardiovascular disease: fundamental relevance to primary and secondary prevention by Magnani et al. (2018), available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380187/pdf/ nihms-983939.pdf What does this mean for healthcare professionals? Health literacy is central to effective health promotion, disease prevention and healthcare. Healthcare professionals need to have a knowledge and understanding of health literacy and its importance in relation to patient/clients health and health outcomes. Healthcare professionals often underestimate patients/clients health literacy abilities (Kelly and Haidet, 2007) and at the same time patients/clients often over report their level of ability in relation to health literacy (Kirsch et al. , 2005). It has been found that many people with limited health literacy have a sense of shame and/ or embarrassment of their lack of ability and as a result hide it (Parikh et al. , 1996). As limited health literacy has such an impact on health outcomes it is important that healthcare professionals are able to identify people with limited health literacy. In addition healthcare professionals need the communication skills to mitigate the increasing health literacy demands placed on patients/clients, particularly those with limited health literacy. Health literacy is crucial to enable people to manage their health. Much of the self-management of chronic conditions is performed by individual patients outside of the medical or healthcare setting. Often this care is quite complex. For example if we consider an individual with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes we can identify a number of different activities that people are responsible for when self-managing that can be particularly challenging, especially when limited health literacy is an issue. These activities may include: \u0097 Taking medication. \u0097 Eating a healthy diet. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 83\u0097 Reduction of risks. \u0097 Managing weight if relevant. \u0097 Organising medical appointments. Persons with diabetes who have multiple complications or experience repeated hospitalisations might have some of these problems because of unrecognised low health literacy (Boren, 2009). Activity 2.7: Health Literacy Demands In groups brainstorm the health literacy demands for an individual with a chronic condition(COPD/asthma/CVD).Thinkthroughallaspectsoftheirengagement with the health system and the lifestyle adjustment that need to be made. How to recognise persons with low health literacy? (adapted from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2015) There are no perfect indicators of low health literacy. The following are warning signs for low health literacy. \u0097 Frequently missed appointments. \u0097 Incomplete registration forms. \u0097 Non-compliance with medication. \u0097 Unable to name medications, explain purpose or dosing. \u0097 Identifiespillsbylookingatthem,notreadinglabel. \u0097 Unable to give coherent, sequential history. \u0097 Ask fewer questions. \u0097 Lack of follow-through on tests or referrals . A systematic review by Sheridan et al. (2011) of health literacy interventions for people with low health literacy found evidence that intensive self-management interventionsreducedemergencydepartmentvisitsandhospitalizations;and intensive self- and disease-management interventions reduced disease severity. Thefindingsofthissystematicreviewdemonstratesthatpoorhealthoutcomes for people with low health literacy can be mitigated. This is supported in relation to health literacy interventions promoting adherence with medical treatment in patients with cardiovascular disease (Miller, 2016) and demonstrated in interventionsshowntoincreasemedicationadherencebypeoplelivingwithHIV (Perazzo et al. , 2017). In relation to older people, Brainard et al. (2016) found that health literacy interventions can increase patient satisfaction and improve chronic condition management. Communication Skills to Mitigate Health Literacy Demands The universal precautions approach advocates for standardised communication accessible at any level of healthcare. In the United States The Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) has promoted the Universal Precautions Toolkit to improve communication and implementation of healthcare (Brega et al. , 2015). The objective of the toolkit is to develop and maintain a best practices approach (universal precautions) in the provision of practical approaches for clear oral and written communication to help patients better understand their health information. See www.ahrq.gov/qual/literacy/healthliteracytoolkit.pdf for more information on this. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 84What health literacy techniques can be used in practice? \u0097 Use pictures \u0097 Identify people with low health literacy \u0097 Chunk and check ('Reinforcing information is key for retention. Stop after giving each key point to solicit questions and have patients repeat the material back to you. This technique is called 'chunk and check'' (Cornett, 2009, p. 5) \u0097 Use simple language (adapted from: The Health Place, available at: http://www.healthliteracyplace.org.uk/tools- and-techniques/techniques/ ) Use simple language/plain English Example of simple language: Instead of Use Cellulitis Skin Infection Acute Sudden/severe Catheter Tube Intravenous Through a vein For more examples see pages 11-13 of 'Guidelines for Communicating Clearly using plain English with our Patients and Service Users: A resource to improve the quality and consistency of our communications ' (HSE Communications Division, 2017). Available at: https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/ understood by getting people to 'teach-back' what has been discussed and what instruction has been given. This is more than saying 'do you understand?' and is more a check of how you have explained things than a test of how well the patient has understood you. A similar tool can be used when showing people how to carry out actions, such as how to use an inhaler. This is called 'show me'. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 85The responsibility for effective communication is on you as the person giving the information. Some example of how to use teach-back are below: \u0097 'We have talked about a lot of things today, I want to check I have been clear. Can you tell me what is going to happen next and what you are going to do?' \u0097 'I want to check I have been clear. What are you going to tell your family when you get home?' \u0097 'JusttobesureIhaven'tmissedsomething,canyoutellmewhatIhavetoldyouabout this x-ray.' \u0097 'I want to check I have been clear, so can you tell me what you have to do and I will listen to make sure I explained it properly.' If the person can't explain or demonstrate what they need to do then you have to start again by checking what the person does understand, re-explaining the missing information again in a different way and then using Teach-back again. This is illustrated in the diagram below: Figure 2.5: Teach-back Closing the Loop (adapted from Schillinger et al. , 2003) New Concept: Health Information Advice, or Change in Management Adherence Clinician Assesses Patient Recall and ComprehensionClinician Assesses Patient Recall and Comprehension Clinician Claries and Tailors ExplanationClinician Explains New Concept Patient recalls and Comprehends Activity 2.8: Teach-back Watch the YouTube clip on the teach-back method: https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=bzpJJYF_tKY (Permission to use for educational purposes received from IHI Open School ( info@ihi.org )) In groups of two practice the technique with one person acting as the patient and the other acting as the healthcare professional. Some more tips for the teach-back method: Don't say \" Have you got any questions?\" or \"Do you understand?\" Most people will not tell you they don't understand. Instead use ' We have talked about a lot of things today. Most people have questions. What are your questions?' For more information, see Tool 5, page 28 and pages 138 to 160 of the Universal Precautions Toolkit: www.ahrq.gov/qual/literacy/healthliteracytoolkit.pdf The Health Quality and Safety Commission New Zealand (2015) has developed useful three-step model for better health literacy which incorporates these techniques and which is depicted below: National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 86Figure 2.6: The Three-step Model (adapted from Health Quality and Safety Commission New Zealand, 2015) Step 1 Find out what people knowStep 2 Build health literacy skills and knowledge Step 3 Check you were clear (if not, go back to step 2) Step 1: Find out what people know This step is important as everyone who comes into the healthcare setting has existing knowledge even if it is incorrect. This step helps \u0097 you uncover what people already know \u0097 you plan how much information you will give people and in what order (step 2) \u0097 people recall what they already know so they can make connections to the new information you give them Tips for finding out what people know: Ask these questions at the beginning in a conversational, friendly tone. The tone you use is important. Try putting the words \"Tell me\" in front of any questions you ask, e.g., \"Tell me what you know about what could happen next\". \"Tell me what you know about your diabetes\". Step 2: Build people's health literacy (knowledge and skills) to meet their needs \u0097 Link all new information back to what the person knows (Step 1). \u0097 Use the words the person used and build on these words. \u0097 Give information in logical steps as people are more likely to understand and remember information if you give it in a logical sequence and explain why someone has to do something. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 87Tips for giving information in logical steps: 1. Condition (this is your condition) 2. Action (this is what needs to be done about it) 3. Rationale (this is the reason why) For example: \"You know aspirin can upset the stomach. So take aspirin in the morning with breakfast and then wait one hour before you take your indigestion medicine. You need to wait one hour because your indigestion medicine works best on an empty stomach\" People can only take in so much information before their short-term memory is overloaded. So, be careful not to overwhelm the person with too much information. If you think the person needs more information at a later stage, agree with them how you will do this - a follow-up phone call, another appointment, text message, email, a website link and so on. Tips for giving information in manageable chunks: (similar to chunk and check) \u0097 Make sure you link new information to what people already know. \u0097 Try and limit the information you are giving to 3-5 pieces of information. \u0097 If the information is complex, check you have been clear after each chunk (step 3) before going on to the next chunk. \u0097 Use visuals and diagrams to reinforce new information. \u0097 Make sure you don't speak too quickly, especially if people don't have English as their first language. \u0097 Explain technical words \u0097 Use visuals \u0097 Use written materials People are often given a lot of written information to read 'when they get home'. Discussing the materials with the person beforehand means they are more likely to read the information. \u0097 Help people anticipate the next steps Explaining the next steps helps people better navigate the system, ask and answer questions, understand how long it could take for their condition or disability to improve and be better prepared for any changes they could experience. Example: 'Now you have started your warfarin you will need to have regular blood tests in case we need to adjust your dose. So I need you to come back for another blood test in two weeks.' \u0097 Medicine reviews \u0097 Reinforce and emphasise National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 88Step 3: Check you were clear If you do not check you have been clear, the only indication that the person did not understand may be a medicine error or failure to follow up. Relying on spoken, non-spoken and non-verbal cues such as the person saying 'yes' or nodding is not accurate. Check understanding using the teach-back method Studies show that when done effectively, Teach-back doesn't take any longer and actually improves understanding and outcomes. The results of a systematic review conducted by Dinh et al. (2016) found evidence to support the use of the teach-back method in educating people with chronic conditiontomaximizetheirdiseaseunderstandingandpromoteknowledge,adherence,self- efficacyandself-careskills. Read the 'Three steps to better health literacy-a guide for healthcare professionals' available at: http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/Consumer- Engagement/Resources/health-literacy-booklet-3-steps-Dec-2014.pdf Interpersonal communication can be supported by written material. However written information on its own is not very useful. Written information It is important that written information is clear. You can ensure this by regularly reviewing written information and by following certain steps if you are developing materials. The Health Literacy committee of Galway University Hospital has developed a guide for the format and layout of patient information material which is a useful resource. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 89Table 2.2: Format and Layout Guide - Dos and Don'ts (reproduced with permission from Saolta, 2017) Do Don't Use the Active Voice - use personal pronouns - 'we' and ' you'- this helps to build a relationship of trust. For example: 'We will call you'Don't use the Passive Voice - For example: 'You will be called'. Don't be afraid to use 'we' for your organisation and 'you' for the reader. Limit Jargon - Use everyday words if possible. For example: require > need administer > give facilitate > helpDon't use too many words that could confuse the reader. If you cannot avoid specialised terms then explain them in plain English immediately afterwards and use the same term consistently. Use headings that are statements or questions. Questions and answers are a great way to get information across.Avoid using one-word headings such as 'Introduction'. Instead use Arial or Calibri - Calibri is useful when there is more text content.Avoid using fonts like Times New Roman - they are difficulttoread Use bold when you want to emphasise a heading orparagraphortext.Useabiggersizeforemphasis.Don't use italics or underlining to create emphasis. It makes them harder to read. Keep CAPITAL letters to a minimum : when words are in capitals, THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME. Spell out/explain acronyms thefirsttimeyouuse them, for example: ED (Emergency Department)Avoid using symbols such as ' &', '/'and ';' Avoid using abbreviations such as e.g., i.e., etc., dept. These can confuse the reader Left align and create a path for the eye to follow: most readers start at the top left hand corner, use this to your advantage, placing important information in that quadrant.Avoid using 'justified text'. It changes the spacing between words which can be hard to read. Paragraphs - Headings and lists are a good way to break up paragraphs and add white space. Leave space between sections.Don't be afraid of 'white space'- don't clutter your PIL with lots of writing. Blank areas create balance, attract the eye to important messages and make it easier to read. Sentence length - Use short sentences - 15 to 20 words maximum. A paragraph should never be longer than its width! Include images that support the text and facilitate understanding. People are more likely to retain and understand content when it is reinforced with a picture.Avoid background images and watermarks - Images behind text can make text hard to read. Bullet points - Bulleted or numbered lists are easier to scan and break up text.Don't put more than 7 points/items in a list. Numbers should be presented as digits rather than spelt out.Don'texpressfiguresasapercentage %, use a simpler format, for example: 1 in 20 people, instead of 5% National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 90The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2015) have developed a clear communication index which is based on the research evidence (available at: https://www.cdc.gov/ccindex/index. html# ). It promotes the principles of plain English and also goes beyond the words that are written to include aspects of presentation and layout. The health literacy committee at University College Hospital Galway have adapted this to develop a checklist to assist healthcare staff to produce clear, accessible patient information in practice. An adaption of the checklist can be found in the 'Guidelines for Communicating Clearly using plain English with our Patients and Service Users: A resource to improve the quality and consistency of our communications (HSE Communications Division, 2017)' and available at: https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/communications/ communicatingclearly/guidelines-for-communicating-clearly-using-plain-english.pdf Activity 2.9: Written information In groups use the CDC Clear communication index and the dos and don'ts list toexamineapatientinformationleafletorbrochure.Whatimprovementsdoyou think could be made?

You will explore the engagement between healthcare professionals and individuals to support self-management of chronic conditions. Key learning outcomes in this Unit focus on gaining an individual's perspective on the impact of a chronic condition on their daily life through the use of appropriate listening and questioning. Understanding the importance of trust and collaboration and being non-judgemental in relationships, discussing treatment options with individuals as well as the concept of shared decision-making are addressed in this unit. Recap Unit 1 and 2 In Unit 1 you were introduced to the concept of self-management support through exploration of the definitions,foundationsandprinciplesunderpinningbothself-managementandself-management support. You explored the core tasks and skills which individuals with chronic conditions require to be effective self-managers. In addition, you were encouraged to explore the skills that are required of the healthcare professional in supporting individuals to develop the skills that they need to self- manage their chronic condition. In Unit 2, you studied the concept of holistic care in the context of self-management support. You had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how to support individuals in the medical, role and emotional self-management of their chronic condition. You discussed the ways in which healthcare providers, communities and families can support self- management in a holistic way. You had opportunity to gain an understanding of health literacy and how important it is in supporting self-management, again highlighting the importance of individual preferences and abilities in keeping with person-centred holistic care. Lesson 1: Communication Skills for a Person-centred Approach Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 3 Lesson 1: Communication skills for a person-centred approach Introduction to Lesson 1 In Lesson 1 you will be introduced to the communication skills required in adopting a person- centred approach to supporting self-management. These skills are important as they will help you in understanding an individual's perspective on the impact of chronic conditions on their daily life. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 96Communication Skills for a Person-centred Approach Person-centred care is the practice of caring for individuals (and their families) in ways that are meaningful and valuable to the individual. Helping individuals with chronic conditions to be more active in consultations and training healthcare professionals to be more mindful, informative, and empathic leads to more partnership, solidarity, empathy, and collaboration in the management of chronic conditions (Epstein and Street, 2011). Person-centred care in chronic condition management is very important; see the link below to this World Health Organisation video on person-centred care; ) (Permission purposes received from WHO ( permissions@who.int )) Key communication skills to help you develop a person-centred approach are: a)Useofreflectivelistening b) Clarifying and summarising c) Listening and encouraging with verbal and non -verbal prompts d) Asking simple open questions Figure 3.1: Communication Skills for a Person-centred Approach (Reproduced with permission from National Undergraduate Curriculum Working Group, 2017, p. 87, adapted from Rollnick et al ., 1999) (a) Use of reflective learning(b) Clarifying and summarising (d) Asking simple open questions(c) Listening and encouraging with verbal and non-verbal prompts Person-centred approach a) Reflective Listening TheuseofReflectivelisteningfocusesontheemotionalovertonesofamessage(lookingfor relationship between content and emotional aspect of the message). Consciously pick up on some key words/phrases the individual used and introduce them into your own side of conversation 'You sound really frustrated that you are having difficulties dressing yourself in the morning' National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 97b) Clarifying and summarising Clarifying and Summarising: every so often sum up in a few succinct sentences what has been discussed. Clarification:seekingtounderstandthemessagebyaskingformoreinformation 'I'm not sure I understand what you mean; can you give me an example? Summaries can help to bring focus to a session (drawing the strands together) 'Before moving on I would like to go over with you what I think we have accomplished so far...' c) Active Listening and encouraging with verbal and non-verbal prompts Figure 3.2: Active Listening (Reproduced with permission from National Undergraduate Curriculum Working Group, 2017, p. 89) We may hear what someone is saying to us but that doesn't mean that we are actively listening To listen to another person involves silencing not only our mouth but also our mindIt is possible to hear a message without really listening to itActive Listening Youneedtobesincerelyattentiveandfindwaystodemonstratethatyouhavetakeninwhathas been said to you and show that you value the speaker and their opinion e.g. nod of the head, sitting forward and interested. VerbalandNon-verbalprompts:Listeninginvolvesnotonlyhearingbutalsounderstanding linguistic, paralinguistic (e.g. tone of voice) and nonverbal aspects of the message (remember non- verbal makes up most of an interaction). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 98 Activity 3.1: Just Listen Note for instructors: This is an activity that encourages participants to communicate how they feel about a subject. People get into pairs and one member talks about their opinions. Each partner listens without speaking, and then, without rebuttal, recaps on what has been said. Uses This activity strengthens your students' listening skills. Listening is an incredibly important part of good communication, and it's a skill that people often ignore in team activities. This activity also shows you how to listen with an open mind. People and Materials \u0097 An even number of students, ideally. \u0097 Eight index cards for each team of two. Each card should list one topic. The topics should be interesting, but not too controversial. You don't want the listeners disliking the speakers just because they disagree with their viewpoint. \u0097 A private room. Instructions 1. Have your students sit down in pairs. 2. Give each pair eight index cards. 3. One partner will blindly choose a card and then speak for three minutes on how she feels about the topic. As she talks, the other person cannot speak - his goal is to listen. 4. After three minutes, the listener has one minute to recap on what his partner has said. He cannot debate, agree or disagree - only summarise. 5. Next, the roles switch, and the process starts again. Advice for facilitator Talk with your students about how they felt about this exercise. Discuss these questions: \u0097 How did speakers feel about their partners' ability to listen with an open mind? Did their partners' body language communicate how they felt about what was being said? \u0097 How did listeners feel about not being able to speak about their own views on the topic? How well were they able to keep an open mind? How well did they listen? \u0097 Howwelldidthelisteningpartnerssummarizethespeakers'opinions? Did they get better as the exercise progressed? \u0097 How can they use the lessons from this exercise at work? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 99d) Asking simple open-ended questions Questions should be kept simple and encourage the individual to tell more of their story rather than elicit yes/no responses 'How does your condition affect you now?''Tell me about how your condition presented?' 'How did you feel when you got your diagnosis?' 'Looking back, what do you think would have helped you when you got your diagnosis?' A quick note on the importance of the awareness of the concept of multimorbidity. Multimorbidityiscommonlydefinedasthepresenceoftwoormorechronic medical conditions in an individual. Individuals with multimorbidity have a high treatment burden in terms of understanding and self -managing the conditions, attending multiple appointments, and managing complex drug regimens (Gallacher et al. , 2011). There is an increasing prevalence of multimorbidity, particularly in the over 65s. From a communication point of view, asking individuals with several chronic conditions at the outset of a consultation \"What is bothering you the most today'?\" or \"What would you like to focus on today ?\" can help prioritise management to those aspects of care that will have the most impact on individuals (Wallace et al. , 2015). \"What is bothering you the most today'? \"What would you like to focus on today?\" National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 100Figure 3.3: Communicating Effectively for Health Behaviour Change (Reproduced with permission from National Undergraduate Curriculum Working Group, 2017, p. 101, adapted from Rollnick et al. , 1999, p. 34) You are guiding the patient to reach their own choices and decisions The patient is speaking more than you areYou are speaking at a slow paceYou are actively listening, and gently directing the conversation appropriately The patient is talking about HBCThe patient is actively involved in planning and exploring and seeking information and adviceCommunicating Effectively for HBC Activity 3.2: Role-play for communication skills Note for instructors: Students to role play talking to an individual about their chronic conditions focussing on the impact of the chronic conditions on the individual's life from the onset of symptoms, to diagnosis and finally to how they are managing now. Options for role play include: 1. Groups of 2 Breaking into pairs with one student role playing being an individual with chronic fatigue associated with heart failure and the other student role playing being the healthcare professional. Students then reverse roles. This time the student playing the healthcare professional is to explore with the student playing the individual's role, the impact of how living with chronic fatigue affects their life. 2. Groups of 3 As per 'groups of 2', but this time each student alternates taking on the role of being an observer. The observer role is to watch the interaction between the 'individual' and 'the healthcare professional' focussing on the 4 key communication skills listed below. The observer then gives constructive feedback to the other two students. Use the four key communication skills for person-centred care that you have been learning about. a)Useofreflectivelistening b) Clarifying and summarising c) Listening and encouraging with verbal and non-verbal prompts d) Asking simple open questions (consider using the 4 examples of open questions as a guide in the 'coloured bubbles' in the 'asking simple open questions section' above) Do you think being homeless would challenge self-management? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 101Non-judgemental approach Adopting a non-judgemental approach is a key factor in person-centred communication. Carry out the following activities to help you develop an awareness around non-judgemental behaviour. Pause for Reflection and Discussion Take a minute to think about the following: Are you aware of ways in which you make judgments about others? Do you think that making judgements impact on partnership formation? Activity 3.3: Non-judgmental Communication Experiential Exercise on Non-judgmental communication Note for instructors Purpose: to objectively make observations, state those observations based on fact and without judgement/making interpretations. Structure: Triads i.e. three people. Individual #1 observes Individual #2 and the 3rd individual observes what is said by Individual #1. Then rotate the individuals so that all take on the role of (i) factual observing, (ii) being observed, (ii) observing what is said by Individual #1 in stating factual observation. Exercise Individual 1: State what is seen in describing Individual #2 - factual and without judgement/interpretation Individual 2: Be observed without making any comments Individual 3: Take note of what is said by Individual #1 about Individual #2 in terms of factual observation and also judgemental observation. Give feedback on what is heard about factual/judgemental observations of Individual #1 Then Rerate the 3 individuals and continue with the same exercise so that each plays Individual #1, #2 and #3. Example of difference between judgemental and non-judgemental Judgemental Non-judgemental I see a lady I see a woman He is bad at taking his inhaler regularly He is not taking his inhaler regularly She is really good for attending her follow-up clinic appointmentsShe attends her follow-up clinic appointments. etc... Note: 'lady', 'bad', 'really good' are judgements. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 102 Activity 3.4: Making Judgements Note for instructors: Ask students to close their eyes and listen to the following short story. Once you have finished reading, ask the students to open their eyes and ask them to offer any feedback, prompt them to think about whether they had made any judgements as you read the story. Billie ran to the front gate clutching a lunchbox in one hand and a toy bear in the other just as the school bus turned out of sight. She looked back to the house, sighed and started to walk along the footpath, holding tightly to the lunchbox and bear. If she hurried she might make it before school started. Cars sped along the busy road next to the narrow footpath. With a few minutes to spare, Billie entered the school doors and walked up to the reception where she asked if it would be okay to go to Ms O'Flynn's junior class because her son Adam had forgotten his lunch. Note for instructors: After students have provided feedback ask them to reflect once more on how easy and natural it can be to make judgments. Then ask the students to think about the ways in which healthcare professionals might make judgements about individuals with chronic conditions Pause for Reflection and Discussion Do you know anyone in your family or neighbourhood with a chronic condition? Are you aware of any lifestyle factors that might have contributed to that person's chronic condition? If so, how does the fact that that person's health behaviour may have contributed to the development of a chronic condition make you feel about that person? Itisworthreflectingonthis,becausethereisadangerthathealthcareprofessionals,(particularly younger healthcare professionals who do not have chronic conditions), might bear some negative stereotypes or prejudices about individuals with chronic conditions. It is necessary to become aware of those prejudices, which we are all prone to at this early stage of your training. Summary of the Lesson In Lesson 1, you discussed and practised core communication skills to assist you in supporting individuals in the self-management of their chronic condition. In particular the importance of listening, the use of simple open questions and non-judgemental person-centred approaches were highlighted. In Lesson 2 you will have an opportunity to discuss building trust and collaboration and the importance of shared decision-making in effective partnerships. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 103Lesson 2: Communication for Trust, Collaboration and Shared Decision-making Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 3 Lesson 2: Communication for Trust, Collaboration and Shared Decision-making Introduction to Lesson 2 In Lesson 2, you will be introduced to the importance of building trust and collaboration and shared decision-making in developing effective partnerships with individuals with chronic conditions. There are a number of videos and activities to assist you. Recap Unit 3 Lesson 1 In Lesson 1, you discussed and practised core communication skills to assist you in supporting individuals in the self-management of their chronic condition. In particular the importance of listening and the use of simple open questions were highlighted. Becoming aware of ways in which we make judgements about others was also addressed in Lesson 1. Recognising Individuals/Families as Partners Individuals with chronic conditions make day-to-day decisions about self-managing their conditions. Each day, individuals decide what they are going to eat, whether they will exercise, and to what extent they will consume prescribed medications. The partnership paradigm credits individuals with an expertise similar in importance to the expertise of professionals. This paradigm implies that while professionals are experts about diseases, individuals are experts about their own lives (further addressed in Unit 4). Sometimes called \"patient empowerment,\" this concept holds that individuals accept responsibility to manage their own conditions and are encouraged to solve their own problems with information, but not orders, from professionals. The ideas of individuals and physicians interact, building upon each other to create a better outcome (Bodenheimer et al. , 2002). Family involvement The concept of family is highly relevant to self-care, and a framework published by Grey and colleagues outlines the relationships among family factors, individual, and family self-management of chronic conditions (Grey et al. , 2006). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 104Figure 3.4: Self and Family Management Framework (adapted from Grey et al. , 2006, p. 282) Health Status Severity of condition Regimen Trajectory Genetics Individual Factors Age Gender Psychosocial Characteristics Diversity/Culture Family Factors Socioeconomic Status (SES) Structure Function Environmental Context Social Networks Community Health Care SystemHealth Status Control Morbidity Mortality Individual Factors Quality of Life Adherence Family Outcomes Function Lifestyle Environmental Context Access Utilisation Provider RelationshipsRisk and Protective FactorsOutcomesSelf and Family Management Behaviors Family Management Individual Self-management It is important to remember that individuals without family and those who live alone may be more socially isolated and vulnerable for poor self-care and should receive focused attention if appropriate (Dunbar et al. , 2008). Building trust and collaboration with individuals Theory Trust As discussed earlier in this unit, aspects of the individuals and healthcare professional relationship such as communication and empathy have been shown to be important to individuals' adherence and ability to complete self-care tasks (Bonds et al. , 2004). Individuals trust is another component essential to the individual-healthcare worker relationship (Pearson and Raeke, 2000). Collaboration As indicated in Lesson 1 and also in Unit 1 the partnership paradigm acknowledges individual's expertise of their chronic condition experience similar in importance to the expertise of professionals. This \"patient empowerment,\" holds that individuals accept responsibility to self-manage their own conditions and are encouraged to problem-solve with information, but not orders, from professionals (Bodenheimer et al. , 2002). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 105 Activity 3.5: Trust and collaboration Class Activity 1 What ways do you think trust can be developed in relationships? Discuss in groups Class Activity 2 Role Play A classmate of yours who you do not know well comes to you for advice about how to manage some exam stress they are having. How will you manage this? Note to Instructors: Remind the class about the active listening skills/open questions they learnt about in Lesson 1 (i.e. ask about how exam stress is affecting the classmate's life?) \u0097 Get the class to consider what advice options they could give their classmate \u0097 How can they work on building trust/collaboration with the classmate? Shared Decision-making Theory Shared decision-making A very important part of person-centred care is the active engagement of individuals in healthcare decision-making. The following excerpts from a paper by Barry et al , outline some of the important features of shared decision-making (Barry and Edgman-Levitan, 2012). For some decisions, there is one clearly superior path, and individual preferences play little or no role - a fractured hip needs repair, acute appendicitis necessitates surgery, and bacterial meningitis requires antibiotics. For most medical decisions, however, more than one reasonable path forward exists (including the option of doing nothing, when appropriate), and different paths entail different combinations of possible therapeutic effects and side effects. The process by which the optimal decision may be reached for an individual is called shared decision-making and involves, at minimum, a healthcare professional and the individual, although other members of the healthcare team or friends and carers may be invited to participate. In shared decision- making, both parties share information: the healthcare professional offers optionsanddescribestheirrisksandbenefits,andtheindividualexpresses his or her preferences and values. Each participant is thus armed with a better understanding of the relevant factors and shares responsibility in the decision about how to proceed. You mentioned you would like to discuss Nicotine Replacement Therapy options to help you stop smoking. Nicotine replacement can come in chewing gum, patch, spray or inhaler formats. Would you like me to tell you more about each of the options?

Here is a good example of how you, as a healthcare professional, can ensure that you are enabling choice in decision-making processes. In Unit 4 you will have opportunity to explore how to support individuals in developing decision-making skills.

Did You Know? \"Self-management support can be viewed in two ways: as a portfolio of techniques and tools that help patients choose healthy behaviours; and a fundamental transformation of the patient-caregiver relationship into a collaborative partnership\" (Bodenheimer et al. , 2005, p. 4). Note to Instructors regarding learning outcome 3.5: Effective communication and partnership formation for self- management support requires a fundamental culture shift which takes Bodenheimer's definition into account. Ask students to critically evaluate communication between healthcare professionals and individuals for collaborative-partnership and relationships. It is recommended to stress here the importance of transforming from a paternalistic approach to an equal partnership and recognition for expertise in the individual's experience of their chronic condition.

Can you think of three key communication skills that are needed for effective partnership building? Partnership facilitates personalised care planning in the context of regular clinical review. \"Personalised care planning encourages healthcare professionals and people with chronic conditions, and their carers, to work together to clarify and understand what is important to that individual. They agree goals, identify support needs, develop and implement action plans, and monitor progress. This is a planned and continuous process, not a one-off event. The plan should identify the patient's particular self- management support needs - for instance, these may include help with health behaviour change; need for social support or peer support or support for (or from) a family member; or with disease specific education or training... The self-management plan should be reviewed regularly in a structured way along with the patient's overall care plan as their need for support changes. It should be integrated into the patient's care over time and across care settings. Training and support for frontline health professionals to provide self-management support is essential\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 19). As part of self-management care, it may be appropriate to plan for deterioration, such as using the asthma action plan. The following will demonstrate an example of this: Example: Asthma Action Plan Effective asthma management requires the development of a partnership between the individual who has asthma and a healthcare professional. This partnership can enable to the individual togaintheknowledge,confidenceandskillstoself-managetheircondition(GlobalInitiative for Asthma, 2017). Self-management support plan for a person with asthma should include the development with the individual of an Asthma Action Plan. This is based on the individual's own experience (e.g. the individual's asthma triggers and other history) together with disease education, and inhaler technique training (Health Service Executive, 2017). It is designed to support individuals who have asthma to monitor their symptoms and signs (self-monitoring) and to make decisions based on these signs. It also supports them to plan for deterioration of their condition and provides them with the information they need on when and where to seek medical attention. The Asthma Action Plan is a prime example of self-management, encapsulating and supporting the core skills of problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation, forming of an individual/healthcare professional partnership, and taking action. These skills will be addressed further in Unit 4. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 109 Activity 3.8: Role-play: Asthma Readthecasestudy.OnepersontobeJaneandonetobethehealthcare professional.ImaginethatJaneisattendingyourclinicforareview.Complete theAsthmaActionPlanwithJane.Thismayincludeseekingoutadditional information fromJanetocomplete theActionPlan. After role play and completion of Action Plan - Group discussion on role play, developing the partnership and forming the action plan. Note for instructors: In the case study, the healthcare professional is a practice nurse. This may be altered to suit your professional area of study. This example would best be used with students who already have basic knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and the use of preventer and reliever inhalers. You may decide to develop an alternative case study to meet your requirements. Case Study: Asthma Action Plan Jane is a 27 year old female. Jane was diagnosed with asthma when she was 10 years old. Her asthma triggers are smoke and dust. Jane works in a sedentary job in an office five days per week. Jane goes for a walk three times a week for 20 minutes. Jane considers her eating habits to be healthy but does treat herself to a takeaway every Saturday and Sunday night. Sometimes if Jane has to work late she gets fast food for her dinner. Jane is a non-smoker, she has an active social life and enjoys meeting friends at the weekend to attend concerts or to meet in the local pub. Jane lives with three housemates, whom she only met when she moved in with them four months ago. Jane describes herself as a disorganised person and frequently forgets to bring her inhaler with her on nights out. Jane uses a Beclomethasone controller inhaler and a Salbutamol reliever inhaler. Jane doesn't worry when she forgets her inhaler. At a concert a few months ago Jane got an asthma attack. The attack was managed with the help of paramedics at the concert however she was transferred to hospital, monitored for 24 hours and discharged. She was advised to attend her GP for a follow-up review within the next few days. Jane attended her GP and her inhaler technique was observed and her medications were reviewed. Jane then met with her practice nurse and once it was established that Jane's asthma was controlled they worked through and completed the asthma action plan together. To Jane's surprise, sitting down with the nurse, and working in partnership to create a plan, that was just about her and her needs, felt very reassuring. She felt prepared, confident and equipped to deal with whatever might come her way with regards to her asthma. She also felt that she had been a bit dismissive and if she were being honest a little irresponsible in the past. Jane did not sense any judgment about this from the nurse, instead she felt understood, reassured and supported to be able to manage her asthma going forward. Summary of the lesson In Lesson 2, you had the opportunity to explore the concepts of trust and collaboration and shared decision-making in partnership between healthcare professionals and individuals with chronic conditions and how you as a healthcare professional develop the skills you need to communicate effectively to support self-management. In the next unit you will explore ways in which you can support individuals to develop these skills also.

In addition you will explore how to support the development of individuals' self-monitoring skills and their ability to interpret changes in their health status indicating improvement, maintenance or deterioration. Recap Unit 1, 2 and 3 In Unit 1 you were introduced to the concept of self-management support through exploration ofthedefinitions,foundationsandprinciplesunderpinningbothself-managementandself- management support. You explored the core tasks and skills which individuals with chronic conditions require to be effective self-managers. In addition, you were encouraged to explore the skills which are required of the healthcare professional in supporting individuals to develop the skills that they need to self-manage their chronic condition. In Unit 2, you studied the concept of holistic care in the context of self-management support. You had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how to support individuals in the medical, role and emotional self-management of their chronic condition. You discussed the ways in which healthcare professionals, communities and families can support self-management in a holistic way. Health literacy was introduced, again highlighting the importance of individual preferences and abilities in keeping with person-centred holistic care. In Unit 3 you had the opportunity to learn about the importance of effective collaborative-partnership communication for self-management support. You explored the engagement between healthcare professionals and individuals to support self-management of chronic conditions. Key learning outcomes in Unit 3 focused on gaining an individual's perspective on the impact of a chronic condition on their daily life. Understanding the importance of trust and collaboration in relationships and the importance of discussing treatment options with individuals and the concept of shared decision-making were also addressed in Unit 3.

Case studies are provided to demonstrate the importance of both problem-solving and decision-making in the day-to-day self-management of chronic conditions. Your role, as a future healthcare professional, in supporting skill acquisition in individuals with a chronic condition, is a core consideration throughout the lesson. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 114Core Self-management Skills There are many frameworks and theories related to self-management, including that proposed byLorigandHolman(2003).LorigandHolman(2003)describedfivecoreself-management skills - problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation, forming of an individual/healthcare professional partnership, and taking action. The skills described are foundational to assisting individuals to self-manage their chronic condition. Self-management skills and knowledge need to be individually tailored and broader consideration of factors is essential in supporting individuals, including wider determinants of health, such as those described in the \"Social Determinants of Health Model\" (Dahlgren and Whitehead, 1991) in the Making Every Contact Count for Health Behaviour Change Curriculum Manual Part 1; Unit 2 Lesson 1 . Table 4.1: Core Self-management Skills (Lorig and Holman, 2003) Skill Description Problem-solving Skillsincludingproblemdefinition,generationofpossiblesolutionsincludingthe solicitation of suggestions from friends and healthcare professionals, solution implementation, and evaluation of results Decision-making Making day-to-day decisions in response to changes in conditions, and may be part of problem-solving. Decision-making is based on having enough and appropriate information. Resource utilisationDeveloping ability to seek out and utilise resources which may help in managing their health conditions. Forming partnershipsHelping people to form partnerships with their healthcare professionals, including ability to report accurately the trends and tempo of the disease, make informed choices about treatment, and discuss these with the healthcare professional. Action planning Developing skills to plan action and to implement self-management plans. Problem-solving and Decision-making This lesson focuses on exploring and understanding the importance of problem-solving and decision-making skills as fundamental elements of self-management, and also on assisting individuals to develop these skills, as a key element of self-management support. In chronic conditions this often occurs in self-monitoring of the person's own health status. Interpreting changes in health status is a vital element of problem-solving and decision-making as this is an indication of improvement, maintenance or deterioration. Both problem-solving and decision-making therefore require appropriate knowledge regarding the chronic condition. Self-management support involves offering assistance in developing problem-solving and decision-making skills to individuals with a chronic condition and providing education and training, to enable individuals to self-monitor and makedecisionsbasedontheirinterpretations.Therearediseasespecificprogrammeswhich providediseasespecificeducation,suchastheDESMOND(DiabetesEducationandSelf- management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed) and DAFNE (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating) programme for diabetes. There are also certain programmes which enable individuals to develop generic self-management skills, for example; the Chronic Disease Self-management Programme (CDSMP) (Lorig et al. , 2001). Before looking closer at problem-solving and decision-making we will focus on the concept of self-efficacy. InUnit1wementioned self-efficacy. Self-efficacy isseenasindividuals' confidence that they can effectively manage their health and has been recognised as a powerful factor in inducing new coping behaviour will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences.

These include: 1. Practice 2. Feedback 3. Reattribution of the perceived causes of failure when the individual has negative experiences 4. Sharing experience (role model) (Bourbeau et al. , 2004) Bourbeau et al.(2004)describedhowself-efficacycanbeenhancedinpeoplewhohaveCOPD. Table 4.2: Self-efficacy Strategies Strategy Description Practice Self-management skills must be practiced by the person who has a chronic condition. Coaching from their healthcare professional is an important element of this as is the opportunity to practice skills in different environments. Feedback Feedbackonself-managementskillsisimportanttoallowforrefinementofskills. This feedback can be provided in numerous forms, e.g. verbal/non-verbal, in person, via phone, or web-based. Regular clinical review facilitates this. Reattribution of the perceived causes of failure when the individual has negative experiencesPrior (negative) experiences of individuals in carrying out the behaviours need to be addressed as failures experienced in the past may need to reattribute the perceived causes of this failure. Bourbeau et al . (2004) provide an example of this \"I was not adequately prepared then, but now I know exactly how to...\" Sharing experience (role model)Learning from a peer that succeeded in changing the behaviour(s) enhances self- efficacyexpectationsofanindividual.Groups(suchascommunitypeersupport groups) can be useful in helping individuals learn vicariously through a sharing of experiences, reinforce learning, change self-image and discourage passivity. Problem-solving for Self-management Reminder: What is problem-solving for self-management? It is about problem definition,generationofpossiblesolutionsincludingthesolicitationof suggestions from friends and healthcare professionals, solution implementation, and evaluation of results (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Healthcare professionals, in supporting self-management, teach basic problem-solving skills as opposed to providing all of the solutions (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Flinder's University have described problem-solving as; \"Having an open dialogue with the patient about what they see as their main problem, what happens because of the problem, and how the problem makes them feel\" (Lawn and Battersby, 2009, p. 14, adapted from Von Korff et al ., 1997). and as \"The ability to systematically assist a patient to learn the skill of problem solving, i.e. identify and analyse practical issues arising in a situation and to determine options for a practical solution, making effective use of time and resources available\" (Lawn and Battersby, 2009, p. 14, adapted from Katon et al ., 2008). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 116Pause for Reflection and Discussion Think of a time you had a problem to solve? Now think about the process you underwent to address that problem? Was it a successful process? Would you change anything about the way you addressed the problem? Apply the criteria for problem-solving to the identified problem: 1.Definetheproblem 2. Generation of possible solutions 3. Solution implementation 4. Evaluation of results Now let us take that a step further and think of a time that you supported someone else to solve a problem. What did that feel like for you? What do you think helped you in offering support with problem-solving? Take some time to reflect on what this problem-solving strategy might look like for a person with a chronic condition: Mary is a 60 year old woman and is suffering from heart failure. On a recent visit to her GP, Mary admitted to feeling increasingly down because she feels that she is unable to do the things she enjoyed most, including working outside in the garden and walking to the shopping centre in the mornings. This was a great social outlet for Mary where she regularly met friends for coffee. Clinical examination indicates that there is no deterioration in Mary's physical condition. 1. Define the problem - Mary is starting to feel isolated and depressed and she admits that this is because she is not keeping busy and has stopped going out to meet her friends. On further investigation the GP discovers that Mary is fearful about doing the activities that she used to do in case it will exacerbate her symptoms. 2. Generation of possible solutions - The GP asked Mary if she would like information to help better understand her condition and the things that are safe for her to do. Mary was very keen to receive this information and her GP explained that \"Keeping active helps the symptoms of heart failure by improving the body's circulation and use of oxygen\" as detailed in the website he provided; ( https://irishheart.ie/news/heart-failure-and-physical-activity/ ). He explained to Mary that the Irish Heart Foundation provides people with information and advice on heart conditions and their website offers lots of resources including real life stories, booklets and useful contacts. The organisation runs local support groups, where people with heart conditions share experiences and advice through their regular meetings. Mary indicated that she didn't use computers but that her daughter did and that she would look at it with her. In the meantime the GP printed out some useful information which Mary could take away and read at home including the signs and symptoms which Mary should watch out for when exercising. They also explored other possible exercise options, such as a seated yoga class held in the local community which Mary had heard about from a friend. 3. Solution Implementation - Mary and her daughter accessed the Irish Heart Foundations' website. Mary decided that she would start walking to the shopping centre again now that she understands it is safe for her to do so. She is also happy to attend the local support group run by the Irish Heart Foundation and has booked into the next seated yoga class. 4. Evaluation of results - The next time that Mary went to visit her GP she was feeling much better. She was more optimistic about her future and was feeling happier now that she was participating in gentle exercises and socialising more as a result of this. The resources that the GP offered were very useful and having the correct information gave Mary the confidencethatsheneededtoremainactive. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 117The ability to problem-solve is a vital skill when self-managing a chronic condition. It is a skill that will be used over and over on a daily basis. Problem-solving will ultimately help inform the decisions that individuals make and is therefore closely linked to the next skill that we will explore: decision- making. Decision-making for Self-management Reminder: What is decision-making self-management of chronic condition? It is about making day-to-day decisions in response to changes in disease condition, and may be part of problem-solving. Decision-making is based on having enough and appropriate information (Lorig and Holman, 2003). The healthcare professional plays a key role in education and information provision, which ultimately supports an individual's decision-making skills required for effective medical, role and emotional self- management of their condition. Oftentimes, a person with a chronic condition may ask for information, for example; how much exercise can I participate in? Is it safe to drive? Can I carry on working shifts? Should I increase my salbutamol inhaler if I get the flu? Pause for Reflection and Discussion Think about the decisions that you make on a daily basis. Think about the outcome of the decisions. What factors inform the decisions you make? Have you ever supported someone to make a decision? How did you support them? What did that feel like? As a healthcare professional how do you think you could support an individual to develop decision-making skills to self-manage their chronic condition? Activity 4.1: Ottawa Personal Decision Guide Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (2015) developed a decision guide to help people identify their decision-making needs, plan the steps, track their progress, and share their views about the decision. Think about a decision you face now and use this guide to make your choice. This guide can be used by healthcare professionals to facilitate any health-related and social decision-making. \u0097 PDF Link: https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/docs/das/OPDG.pdf \u0097 A completed example by a student: https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/docs/opdg-video/opdg-example.pdf National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 118Figure 4.1: Ottawa Personal Decision Guide (reproduced with permission from Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, 2015) Ottawa Personal Decision Guide For People Making Health or Social Decisions Clarify your decision.

Page 2 of 2 National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 120In order to further understand the importance of problem-solving and decision-making processes in the self-management of a chronic condition, a number of case studies are presented in Activity 4.2. These case studies have been written by people living with a chronic condition to demonstrate how daily life can impact on their chronic condition and how they use their self-monitoring skills to interpret changes in health status, problem solve and make decisions. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 121 Activity 4.2: Case studies Select one of the case studies. In groups: \u0097 Identify the problem for the person in your scenario \u0097 Discuss the decision made by the person, and the factors that influencedthedecision \u0097 What strategies might have helped in developing the problem-solving and decision-making skills used to manage their condition, Consider self-efficacy strategies \u0097 Feed back to the wider group on the points above Case study 1: Airport Security Hypoglycaemia (Type 1 Diabetes) If you live with type 1 diabetes and travel, those three words \"Airport Security Hypo\" probably strike fear into your heart. Airport security is stressful enough with type 1 diabetes, even when it goes smoothly but if you throw in a hypo it's nerve wrecking. Last Saturday, I flew to London on my own (I live in Ireland). This incident happened on my return journey. I was in line at the metal detector, and had put my personal belongings on the security belt and that's when my CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) alarm went off, telling me that my glucose levels were 4.4mmols and dropping. Emmm, what do I do??? I need to manage my hypo. Do I jump the person behind me to grab my bag off the belt and risk the security agents responding as I would expect? Or do I wait and see if a more opportunistic moment presents itself? I knew I was going to have to volunteer for a pat down anyway. I choose this option, \"Well, it's only going to take a few minutes and feel fine so let's assume my CGM is telling a bit of a fib for right now\" combined with the \"wait and see\" approach. I went through the metal detector and it beeped. I was directed to the body scanner which I declined because of the manufacturer's recommendations about my CGM and opted for the manual check by a security person. The manual checks in this airport are conducted in a private room which requires two female security officers to be available. And so I took a seat and waited for the manual check. And waited some more. Thankfully the security officer directing the other people through the metal detector kept checking that someone was coming to me. Thankfully, I was at the airport way too early for my flight so apart from the threatened hypo I was relaxed. Another five minutes went by and I could start to feel the heat of my body increase but I was still functioning and calm. By the time the female security officers came to usher me to the screening room I could feel the heat turn into perspiration. I thought about asking if I could grab my glucose out of my personal belongings, but I really wanted to get this stress over with so I could relax and so I didn't ask for it. Additionally, I didn't know how it would be perceived if I asked for my belongings. The security officers seemed like really nice, jolly ladies but I did not want to push it. I want to reiterate that this was the choice I made and take full responsibility for. I did feel that I could ask for help at any stage help. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 122Case study 2: COPD Arjun is a 56 year old male, he has been an ex-smoker for 6 years, and was diagnosed with COPD two years ago. He has had a number of admissions to hospital with exacerbations, but he feels well most of the time, and works with his GP and practice nurse to stay well. Six months ago Arjun and his GP took some time during a clinical review to become familiar with a COPD self-management plan as an additional support to him in managing his condition and staying well. On this particular occasion Arjun woke up early with a funny sensation in his throat. He had some water to see if that would help. He continued with his normal morning routine which included taking his regular medications and inhalers, and keeping as active as possible. Arjuns's morning activity is to walk to the nearby shop for the newspaper before returning home to work in his office. On his walk back from the shop Arjun noticed that he was becoming a little more short of breath than usual. On his return home, he consulted his self-management plan, and started to use his breathing control exercises and took a dose of his reliever inhaler. The following day, he felt that he was getting more tired than usual and was also feeling hot. Later that day Arjun noticed that he was now coughing up sputum, which was yellow in colour instead of his normal clear colour. He also noticed that he was starting to get wheezy. He decided that it was time to follow the steps that were indicated for \"feeling unwell\" in his COPD self-management plan. He started to take his reliever inhaler every 4 hours. He also contacted his GP for advice. His GP advised Arjun to come into the surgery the following morning so that he could examine him and determine if he needed to commence on antibiotics and/steroids. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 123COPD Self-management Plan (M. Owens, personal communication, November 4, 2019)This is a guide to managing your symptoms. It's important to look after your own health and wellbeing, with support from your team of health professionals.Self-Care Plan Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) SYMPTOMS ADVICE FEELING WELL I am able to carry out my usual activities My phlegm is a normal colour and amount for me Continue with my medication as prescribed and continue my day as normal Keep as active as possible BAD DAY My COPD may be bothering me. For example, I am more breathless than usual. Use chest clearance techniques Use my reliever inhaler Use breathing control exercises If no relief I may be unwell. Move on to 'Feeling Unwell' section for guidance. FEELING UNWELL I am more wheezy, breathless I have more phlegm, which is yellow or green in colour Take my normal medications and inhalers Take my reliever medication every 4 to 6 hours Start rescue antibiotics and steroids Call GP or GP Out-of-Hours GP service for advice Call my COPD Outreach Team or COPD Support Ireland advice line VERY UNWELL My reliever and rescue prescription are not helpful or I feel worse I should urgently contact my GP or Out-of-Hours GP service. Go to the hospital Emergency Department if GP is not available. If I am short of breath at rest, have chest pain or confusion this is an emergency. CALL 112 or 999 and ask for an ambulance. Note for instructors: Possible discussion points: \u0097 What does Arjun do to self-manage his condition on a daily basis? \u0097 What else could Arjun do to that would help him to manage his condition? \u0097 What else could his GP do when Arjun is well again, to support him to self-manage? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 124Case study 3: Thanksgiving Blood Sugar Battle (Type 1 Diabetes) Thanksgiving features strongly in our household because my husband is American. As a person with type 1 diabetes dealing with celebrations feasts are a huge challenge. This one turned into a 24-hour challenge, in that the high blood glucose levels wiped me out the next day. Maybe, this is why the Americans make thanksgiving a four-day weekend? My approach to big meals, is to have a little of what I love, a very small amount of what I don't consider worth the insulin, just to be polite, and maybe even skip the potato, because, well, I'm Irish and we had them every single day growing up. My blood sugars did reasonably well, considering what I ate. But this year, about four hours after pie, when I thought I was a little in the clear, my blood sugars started to climb and climb and hover. It was 2am when my CGM alarmed for the last time and I finally got to sleep. I woke the next morning as if I had been out all night. The next morning, I had planned to treat myself to a morning of retail therapy in the city and to finish off the last of my Christmas shopping. I thought about not going because I was too tired. Then, made myself go because it would do me good and maybe I'd feel better for it. It did not work! I persevered because I had driven all the way there, but when the toy shop told me after waiting in line for about eight minutes, that their computers were down and could not issue a gift card, I decided It was time to go home. Had this been any other day and had I not been battling high blood glucose numbers the night before, I would have been productive on a superhuman level. My daughter finished early from school and so I only had one school pick up in the afternoon. I thought to myself \"Great! I'll have at least an hour or more to do some writing this afternoon\". That didn't work either. I could even concentrate on scrolling through my Facebook feed. And that doesn't require any concentration but I still couldn't do it. I gave up! I put the iPad down, the phone down and put my head down on the couch with lots of blankets and took a nap! And actually, in between the \"Mom, where is the... \" and the \"Mom, can I... \" I did actually nap. Sometimes, you have to give diabetes a win so that you can prepare yourself to fight the battle again another day. Compared to most hypos this one rebounded quite quickly and not too high. However, I did spend most of the day with glucose levels that were more elevated than my usual. And there you have it, diabetes the spontaneity killer. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 125Case study 4: Medication Management (Chronic Atrial Fibrillation) As a practicing nurse for many years the process of dispensing medication to patients was an activity that I did daily. Other than considering this activity from a patient safety perspective, I thought little about the impact of long term medication use from an individuals' psycho social perspective. In more recent times my current role as a researcher placed other demands on me. For example, it required that I sit for long periods of time reviewing, analysing, and processing research data. Combining my work life balance with aging parents and their associated care needs I failed to recognise the little time this left for me to focus on personal healthy lifestyle choices. In 2015 after a series of trips presenting my work overseas, I developed bilateral pneumonia and shortly after chronic atrial fibrillation. Initially I considered this bout of illness as a disruption to my busy life which I was keen to return to. I love what I do. Although there was a family history of atrial fibrillation it never occurred to me that this health issue was anything other than a temporary setback. I have never been ill or in hospital other than to have my two children. As someone who had recently turned 50 my firm belief was that these health issues would be something I would need to face much later in life. So while I maintained a strong focus on taking medications and health seeking behaviours it was a great disappointment to me after a year when I realised there was no ability for me to return to my former health state. With consultants support and approval, I trialled a period weaning myself off the medications which I was now having to take twice a day. Within a month I was back in hospital and required cardio version for a third time. My dilemma was this... what am I supposed to do? These medications carry serious side effects, and need to be taken regardless of their associated side effects and dietary restrictions which I now needed to manage. If I stop taking the medication... well two failed attempts already would suggest that this path would lead to additional cardio version. So where am I now three years later?... Following consultation with a cardiologist, I am considering ablation but again there is no indication that this approach is 100% successful as this procedure doesn't always work for everyone. Summary of the Lesson In this lesson you discussed the skills of problem-solving and decision-making for self- management. You had an opportunity to explore the importance of your role as a healthcare professional in supporting the development of these skills in individuals with chronic conditions. A number of case studies demonstrating the use of problem-solving and decision-making in day- to-day self-management of chronic conditions were presented. In the next lesson you will have the opportunity to explore the skills of resource utilisation and forming partnerships. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 126Lesson 2: Resource Utilisation and Forming Partnerships Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 4 Lesson 2: Resource Utilisation and Forming Partnerships Introduction to Lesson 2 In this lesson we are going to talk about the skills of resource utilisation and forming partnerships for effective self-management. This will include strategies that can help an individual cope with self-management of a chronic condition and with regard to forming partnerships the focus will be on effective communication. Recap Unit 4 Lesson 1 In Lesson 1 you explored the skills of problem-solving and decision-making. You revised the theory ofself-efficacyandyouwerepresentedwithcasestudiesdemonstratingtheimportanceofthese skills in the day-to-day self-management of chronic conditions. Resource Utilisation Reminder: What is resource utilisation for self-management? It is about developing ability to seek out and utilise resources which may help in managing health conditions. Self-management support therefore not alone involves educating the individual on how to utilise resources, but on how to seek them out and access them (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Flinder's University highlight that resource utilisation is about having a; \"Broad understanding of available resources, supports, services and activities within the patient's community that would be useful in supporting them and their carers/ family. This involves an understanding of what the services involve, how to access them and their appropriateness in being able to meet the patient's and their carer's identified needs\" (Lawn and Battersby, 2009, p. 16, adapted from Wagner et al ., 2001). Pause for Reflection and Discussion Have you ever considered what resources are available to individuals with a chronic condition? Have you ever thought how individuals with a chronic condition receive information about the resources available to them? Whatfactorsdoyouthinkinfluenceanindividual'sabilitytoutiliseresources? How do you think a healthcare professional could support an individual in utilising resources? How would you identify resources that you would direct individuals to? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 127Signposting is an important strategy for resource utilisation: \"This acts as a bridge between health care professionals and the social activities available, and can be done by a variety of people including health trainers, wellbeing coaches, navigators, and voluntary community services networks... Much of this support might be provided outside of a traditional consultation between a health care professional and someone with a long-term health condition. However, all of these types of support are strengthened when backed up by professionals using skills such as motivational interviewing, goal setting and problem solving in consultations\" (The Health Foundation (UK), 2015, p. 32). Some examples of local directories of services that support self-management can be accessed at https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/selfmanagement/ Social Prescribing is another way of helping individuals to access resources. Did You Know? The national framework document ' Living Well with Chronic Conditions ' highlights that social prescribing; \"... is a mechanism for linking people with non-medical sources of support within the community to improve physical, emotional and mental wellbeing\" (Health Service Executive, 2015, p. 2). \"The healthcare professional and person identify together the type of activities that will be of benefit, with the professional writing a 'prescription' directly to a service or 'referring' the individual to an intermediary, such as a link worker, with whom a package of services can be constructed\" (The Health Foundation (UK), 2015, p. 32). \"This approach has recently been tested and evaluated successfully in a social prescribing programme in Donegal where the various options taken up by participants include books for health, exercise initiatives, stress control workshops, creative and green activities, and volunteering\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, pp. 26-27). Social social prescribing related to self-management support? Self-management support provides individuals with knowledge and skills to manage the medical, role and emotional tasks needed for effective self-management. Social prescribing services are therefore a resource that healthcare professionals can avail of to facilitate individuals to improve their health and well-being. It provides a link between health services and the community sector. What does social prescribing involve? There are many health related activities available in people's local communities. These activities range from exercise-related activities such as the local gym, walking groups, gardening groups etc. to art-based activities and self-help programmes. Research has shown how participation in activities can improve mental and physical health. However, some individuals with chronic conditions may not be aware of what activities are available in their local community and how to access them. Social prescribing will assist individuals to do this. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 128How does it work? Social prescribing can be provided by a community link worker who will meet with an individual to identify activities in which they are interested in participating. Following this initial meeting, the community link worker will locate where in the person's community this activity is provided and get details such as how often it runs etc. They will then either pass on the information to the individual or theywillaccompanythepersonthefirsttimetheyattendtheactivityorprogramme. Watch this video on a social prescribing for people recovering from cancer treatment https://vimeo.com/176618952 Visit the following links Peer and social support are also very important to individuals with chronic conditions. As discussed in Lesson 1 of this Unit, learning from peers can assist in the development of self- efficacy.Peersupportisdefinedas: \"support from a person who has experiential knowledge of a specific behaviour, condition or situation\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 26, adapted from Dennis, 2003). Peer support includes the following (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 26): \u0097 Health professional-led groups of \u0097 Peer-led face-to-face self-management programmes e.g. Stanford programme \u0097 Peer coaches \u0097 Community health workers e.g. within the traveller community \u0097 Support groups e.g. stroke support groups, COPD Ireland support groups \u0097 Telephone-based peer support \u0097 Internet and email based support \u0097Jointpeerandhealthcareprofessionalledprogrammes Let's take a closer look at an example of peer support : The Chronic Disease Self-management Programme (formally known as the Stanford Programme) \"This is based on the concept of self-efficacy within social learning theory. It was originally developed by Stanford University in the US. It uses peer educators to build self-efficacy in a group setting. The Stanford chronic disease self-management programme is a generic programme, that is, it can be used for patients with a range of chronic diseases. It is based on the fact that people with chronic disease have similar concerns and, with specific skills and training, can effectively manage aspects of their own conditions. The programme consists of two and a half hour workshops once a week for six weeks, and while generally administered in community settings, is also available online.\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 26, adapted from Health Information and Quality Authority, 2015). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 129Now that you have explored the importance of supporting effective resource utilisation, we will look at forming partnerships as another core self-management skill. Forming Partnerships Reminder: forming partnerships is an important skill in self-management of chronic conditions. It involves: helping people to form partnerships with their healthcare professionals, including ability to report accurately the trends and tempo of the disease, make informed choices about treatment, and discuss these with the healthcare professional (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Pause for Reflection and Discussion Do you think that forming partnerships between individuals and healthcare professionals is important in self-management of chronic conditions? What do you think are the key elements of a \"good\" partnership? How can you as a healthcare professional support the formation of partnerships? What do you think the individual brings to the partnership? What do you think the healthcare professional brings to the partnership? Did You Know? Traditional models of acute healthcare delivery, resulted in the healthcare professional regarded as the expert and the individual as a passive recipient of diagnoses and treatment. Lorig and Holman (2003) highlighted the reorganisation of healthcare delivery to meet the demands of chronic conditions has resulted in a change in the relationship between the healthcare professional and individual with a chronic condition. Similarly the Living Well with a Chronic Condition: Framework for Self-management Support reports \"For health professionals it means not only providing clinical care, but helping people to think about their strengths and abilities, identifying their information needs and goals, and the changes they can make in their lives to take control, reach their goals and maintain their physical and mental health and wellbeing\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 28). Bodenheimer et al. (2005) stated that \"rather than having caregivers, particularly physicians, tell patients what to do to improve their health, the new model is designed to build a partnership between caregiver and patient, with a shared responsibility for making and carrying out health related decisions\" (p. 7). They have also indicated that; \"Self-management support can be viewed in two ways: as a portfolio of techniques and tools that help patients choose healthy behaviours; and a fundamental transformation of the patient-caregiver relationship into a collaborative partnership\" (p. 4). In Unit 1 we looked at the elements both the healthcare professional and the individual bring to the partnership: Here is a recap: Table 4.3: Qualities for Partnerships A Person-centred Approach recognises The healthcare professional may be expert in:A Person-centred Approach recognises an individual with a chronic condition is expert in: Making diagnoses Disease monitoring Disease aetiology Estimating prognosis Therapeutic options Personal goalsPersonal experience of the illness Personal social circumstances and network Personal attitudes to risk Personal values Personal preferences National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 130Effective communication is a vital component of forming partnerships! What elements of good communication should be fostered to help develop partnerships? Effective Communication for Forming Partnerships Communicationisacorecomponentinfosteringconfidenceinindividualswhohaveachronic condition, and is vital in forming healthcare partnerships. There is a responsibility on the healthcare professional to be empathetic and informative in their communication, whilst the individual who has a chronic condition should give information clearly, seek information and seek clarity when necessary (Global Initiative for Asthma, 2017). It is understood that individuals are partners in their own care and as a result need the skills and know how to communicate effectively with their care providers, this is especially true for the facilitation of self-management (Dures et al. , 2016). Indeed, effective communication has many desirable outcomes for self-management such as increased satisfaction, treatment success and improved health outcomes (Schmidt et al. , 2017). While Table 4.4 gives an outline for considerations in effective partnerships, communication interactions should be tailored according to individual needs e.g. complex needs, gender, deprivation levels, disability, health literacy levels, access.

Joe is 59 years old and has a history of depression and type 1 diabetes. Currently he is experiencing depressive symptoms and his blood glucose levels are quite erratic. He has lost one toe and has a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Over the last 10 years Joe has lived between group homes and sheltered accommodation, more recently preferring the security of the group homes. Joe frequently misses appointments with his GP and continues to smoke up to 40 cigarettes a day, however he always remembers to take his insulin and keeps a log of his blood glucose levels. He recently received a cigarette burn to his left calf which isn't healing very well. Imagine you are a pharmacist (or other healthcare professional) and that you meet Joe on a regular basis.

Summary of the lesson In this lesson you looked at resource utilisation, including, consideration of what resources are available, how to identify what is available and on how to support individuals to access and avail of resources. We also looked at the importance of forming partnerships between healthcare professionals and individuals and at how effective communication is a fundamental element of this. In the next lesson you will be introduced to the skill of action planning. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 133Lesson 3: Action Planning Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 4 Lesson 3: Action Planning Introduction to Lesson 3 This lesson focuses on actively engaging individuals/families in setting goals, developing action plans, and continuously re-evaluating and revising goals and action plans according to their needs. Recap Unit 4 Lesson 1 and 2 In Lessons 1 and 2 you explored the skills of problem-solving, decision-making, resource utilisation and forming partnerships as core skills of self-management for individuals with chronic conditions. Action Planning Reminder: what is action planning? It is about developing skills to plan action and to implement self-management plans (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Let's start by looking at action planning: Begin with identifying a SMART goal: \u0097 Specific :identifyaspecificpersonalgoal. \u0097 Measurable: How will you measure achievement of your goal? \u0097 Achievable : Outline the steps you need to take to achieve your goal. \u0097 Realistic: Be realistic about how long it could take to achieve your goal. \u0097 Timed: What is the timeframe for goal achievement? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 134 Activity 4.4: SMART goal Consider your own personal health and identify a SMART goal and complete the Accomplishing Goals Template. When identifying your personal goal, remember to plan small steps that will assist you in the achievement of your goal. Accomplishing Self-management Goals Template \u0097 Identify barriers to achieving your goal: \u0097 How will you manage these barriers: \u0097 What is your level of commitment/motivation to achieving your goal? Circle as appropriate: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (1 being not committed/motivated and 10 being very committed/ motivated ) \u0097 What is your follow-up plan? Group Feedback and Discussion: Provide feedback to your facilitator on your SMART goal and plan for accomplishing your goal and discuss your plan with class colleagues. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 135 Activity 4.5: Addressing barriers and enablers to achieving goals Consider why you circled a particular number in the commitment/ motivation scale on the Accomplishing Goals Template? Consider the following examples: \u0097 If you circled the number 7; consider what might help you to get to the number 8 or 9. \u0097 If you circled the number 3; consider what might help you to get to the number 4 or 5. Consider the following questions: \u0097 What could stop you achieving your goal? \u0097 What might help you overcome this barrier? \u0097 What have you tried in the past to overcome this barrier, did it work, if yes ( could you try this again ), if no ( why do you think it did not work ). Consider suggestions provided during Activity 4.6 as to what has helped other people achieve their goal. Think about other options to goal accomplishment. Consider all the options and devise a plan and remember to follow-up. Group Feedback and Discussion: Provide feedback to your facilitator on addressing barriers. Activity 4.6: Clinical Activity Identify a person with a chronic condition (Diabetes, Asthma, COPD and Cardiovascular Disease) and have a discussion with them about identifying their goals related to self-management, and setting a SMART goal. In a collaborative process with the person complete the Accomplishing Goals Template. Feedback and Discussion (potential feedback platform - online discussion board) : Reflectonanybarriers/challengesyouexperienced(ifany)andhowyou managed these. Were you happy with the experience? If you were to complete this activity again, would you do anything differently, if yes, please explain. Self-management support care planning Self-management support emphasises the central role of the individual living with a chronic condition in the management of their condition within their daily lives. It involves assessing an individual's personal beliefs, health behaviours and health knowledge, as well as providing advicebygivingspecificinformationaboutthetrajectoryoflivingwithachronicconditionand theassociatedhealthbenefitsofunderstandingandmanagingthecondition.Forthistohappen, it is important to problem solve collaboratively (individual living with a chronic condition and healthcare professional). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 136This collaborative process is used to: \u0097 Identify and set personal goals related to self-management \u0097 Examine current health behaviours that could potentially change \u0097 Understand barriers to change and how to manage them It is important to understand that self-management support is not lecturing, saying \"you should do this or that\", didactic patient education, shaming a person or waiting for the person living with a chronic condition to ask a question. Remember, that assessing individual's knowledge is important, but this alone will not change the health outcomes of chronic conditions. To enact health outcome change, one must involve the person with a chronic condition in the decision-making process. This involves assessment of personal health needs and barriers, goal setting, skills development, problem-solving and most importantly a follow-up action plan. Following this, the person with a chronicconditionwillbemoreawareandinformedabouttheirhealth,empoweredandconfident that they can self-manage, and importantly understand that they are decision-making partners with their healthcare professional. This can be facilitated by personalised care planning including self-management planning process. In Unit 3, you had the opportunity to explore an example of planning for deterioration with the individual who has asthma by working through the Asthma Action Plan. Remember, that the person living with a chronic condition is an expert about their own life living with the condition. The healthcare professional is perceived only an expert on the condition. Self-management support is about the relationship/marriage between chronic conditions and living the best possible healthy life.

This activity encompasses information from Unit 2 - addressing holistic approaches to self- managementsupportandhealthliteracy,anditalsoincorporatesthefiveskills that we have addressed in Unit 4. Jack is 68 years old and has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His COPD was diagnosed 15 years ago. Jack is often out of breath and fatigues easily. Jack currently has which is likely to be an exacerbation of his COPD. Jack lives alone. He is independent with all activities of daily living, for example, shopping, cooking, cleaning, washing, and dressing. However, Jack is finding it increasingly difficult to complete these activities. Jack likes to walk to mass and goes to bingo once per week. Jack has two sons who live nearby, but Jack does not have much contact with either of them. Jack takes a lot of medication to manage his COPD. He finds winter time very difficult as he usually experiences an exacerbation of his COPD. Jack visits his GP for a repeat prescription. When he attends he is reviewed by his GP and practice nurse and through discussion with Jack his self-management support needs were identified. These included: \u0097 He did not know how to use the inhalers prescribed for him (need = education, information, training) \u0097 He was worried that he might become dependent on his inhalers if he used them regularly (need= education) \u0097 His confidence had suffered since his recent exacerbation, and he was anxious about walking to local shops due to fear of becoming breathless (need= confidence building particularly around exercise) \u0097 He still smoked, and although he recognised it was bad for his health and wanted to quit, he didn't feel he could do this alone (need=advice on smoking cessation) \u0097 He was lonely and becoming more isolated because of his condition, and was at risk of developing depression (need= social and emotional support) Questions \u0097Whatself-managementskillswouldhelpJackwiththeseissues? \u0097HowcouldyouasahealthcareprofessionalsupportJackinself- managing his chronic condition? Support from the healthcare professionals might include: regular clinical review will help with developing partnership, joint goal setting and action planning; education and information about his condition, and training in inhaler technique; smoking cessation support; signposting him to COPD support groups locally - or directing him to COPD Support Ireland helpline - this may help provide social interaction and help him to adapt to living with a long term condition through seeing and hearing how others have coped. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for patients who have experienced an exacerbation ofCOPD.Itincludesexercising(buildingconfidencetodomoreindailylife),educationabout disease, inhaler technique; self-monitoring, ongoing self-management. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 138Before moving on to Unit 5 it is important to consider the challenge faced by individuals who have a chronic condition in juggling the management of their condition, when they are engaged invariousservices.ForexampleapersonlivingwithCOPD,likeJackasinLesson3mayattend the GP for medical management on a regular basis, a respiratory consultant when required, a physiotherapist for respiratory management and general physical conditioning, an occupational therapist for energy conservation and a social worker for support. Each healthcare professional willlikelysetdiscipline-specificgoalsandactionplanswiththeindividual.Thus,theindividual livingwiththechronicconditionmayhavenumerousgoalstomeet,whichconflictwitheach other. Healthcare professionals and individuals living with chronic conditions should consider the management of the condition holistically, to ensure that management strategies are feasible for the individual. In some cases it may be appropriate to have a designated key worker, i.e. a healthcare professional who has oversight of all services and supports that the individual living with the chronic condition is engaged with. However, in most cases the individual living with the chronic condition will have responsibility and oversight of the services they are utilising. Healthcare professionals should support the individual to navigate and manage the requirements from varying services. Summary of the lesson In this lesson you focused on the skill of action planning. You had the opportunity to set a goal for yourself and to consider a plan of action to achieve that goal. You then explored the importance of self-management action planning to individuals with a chronic conditionandreflectedonyourroleasahealthcareprofessionalinsupportingindividualsto develop this skill.

Introduction to Unit 5 In Unit 5 you will develop a knowledge and understanding of co-ordinating and managing care delivery relevant to day to day professional practice that supports self-management by healthcare professionals. A critical perspective on current health service organisation and delivery for self- management support will be considered. The relevance of broadening perspectives on self- management support beyond health services to include social services and community support groups will be examined. The role of inter-professional team approaches to self-management support will be explored including critical examination of current practices. The impact of self- management support on service provision and delivery, and on patient outcomes will be reviewed. There are two lessons in total in this unit each one builds on the previous lesson. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 143Lesson 1: Self-management Support within the Context of Healthcare Reforms: Whole Systems Perspectives Duration: 1 Hour PPT Title - Unit 5 Lesson 1: Self-management Support within the Context of Healthcare Reforms: Whole Systems Perspectives Introduction to Lesson 1 In this lesson we will do an initial recall of your learning from Units 1 to 4 and consider the relevance of the knowledge gleaned from these prior units to exploring self-management support within the context of healthcare reforms in Ireland. We will then take a critical review of how current national reforms in healthcare are relevant to promoting self-management support for chronic conditions drawing on your experiences of learning in practice/health services in your programme to date. We will examine the strengths and weaknesses of current healthcare organisation and delivery specifictoitsimplicationsforself-managementsupportforindividualswithchronicconditions. In this lesson we consider why supporting self-management through service delivery and organisation is important to managing the burden of chronic conditions on our health system. Let's begin this lesson with an activity, drawing on the recall activity requested of you as a prerequisite for this Unit. Activity 5.2: In-class Warm-up Brainstorm In dyad/triad groups, ask students to jot down their thoughts on the following questions: 1. What is the relevance of self-management support to managing the burden of conditions? 2. What is your responsibility as a healthcare professional in providing self-management support within the context of healthcare delivery and day to day practice? Take feedback Note to Instructors: During feedback, take note of students' responses and whether some key points are raised: Q1: e.g. prevalence of chronic conditions including multimorbidity; burden on the health services such as accessibility, utilisation, costs, etc. Q2: e.g. skilled and competent for self-management support delivery, working in partnership with individuals, coordinating care across service boundaries, advocating for service improvements, other etc. This is intended to be a quick feedback rather than detailed discussion. Whole Systems Approaches to Healthcare Organization and Delivery In everyday practice, it is common for many frontline healthcare practitioners to get caught up in very busy workloads focusing mostly on their immediate practice rather than seeing the bigger picture at a health system level. This raises a question of whether a 'big picture' in terms of having a 'whole system\" perspective on healthcare is relevant to frontline staff. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 144Pause for Reflection and Discussion What is your understanding of a 'whole system' approach to healthcare organizationanddelivery? Whatarethebenefitsoftakinga'wholesystem'perspectiveonhealthcare organizationanddeliveryinsupportingindividualswithchronicconditions? Note to Instructors: To facilitate discussion on the above questions, papers that may be helpful to as a resource on systems thinking specific to health are: The application of systems thinking in health: why use systems thinking? (Peters, 2014) and, embracing uncertainty, managing complexity: applying complexity thinking principles to transformation efforts in healthcare systems (Khan et al. , 2018). These papers are to serve as background reading for instructors to raise awareness about whole systems thinking for self-management support in healthcare among students, rather than any in-depth theoretic/conceptual/empirical discussion around health system transformation in general. That said, these papers could be included in student reading list as resourceful reading. Followingonfromthisdiscussionaround'wholesystems'perspectivesonhealthcareorganization anddelivery,let'sbrieflycapturewhatthismeans.Peters(2014)referstotheoriginoftheword system: \"The word system is derived from the Greek sunist\u00e1nai meaning 'to cause to stand together\" (Peters, 2014, p. 1). Peters goes on to explain that: \"A system is a perceived whole, made up of parts that interact toward a common purpose... Systems thinking [takes account]...of the whole, its parts, and the interactions within and between levels\" (Peters, 2014, p. 1). Over time there has been increasing efforts to rank the performance of health systems around the world, and while there is no gold standard for this ranking (Sch\u00fctte et al. , 2018), a whole systems approach is considered critical to tackling complex public health problems including chronic conditions (Greenhalgh, 2009; Pinnock et al. , 2016; Bagnall et al. , 2019). Greenhalgh (2009) offers a useful differentiation between the micro level of managing chronic conditions in healthcare with a focus on patient self-management and the macro level of healthcare with a focus on whole systems approaches. Take a look at this difference in the following table. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 145Table 5.2: Micro-and Macro Level Healthcare in Managing Chronic Conditions Approach Patient Role HCP Role Definition of Success At micro-level: SM with gains in knowledge, skills, motivations, attitudese.g. working with SM plan requiring psychological resources (e.g.self-efficacy)and skills (e.g. setting goals & action planning,* taking inhaler*)e.g. educator,* trainer, advisor, establishing partnership/collaborative relationships with patientsImplementation a SM plan with positive outcomes* e.g. increasedself-efficacy, improved health status At macro-level: Whole Systems approaches involving multiple sectors* e.g. primary, community, acute care, voluntary, social care and service user sectors\"Developing and achieving a holistic, personalised care plan, drawing on available resources in the community\" (p. 629) and other resources such as support from HCPse.g. educator,* advocate,* partnering with patients to support social learning and participatory change\"Emergence of new structures and opportunities for supporting healthy living and managing illness\" (p. 629) Others* e.g. improved accessibility to healthcare, improved quality of healthcare delivery, & reduced health costs HCP = healthcare professional; SM=self-management Source : abbreviated and adapted from Greenhalgh (2009, p. 629) to include points addressed in previous units of this curriculum. Note to Instructors: Consider drawing on points raised by students in the ' Pause for Reflection and Discussion' exercise above as a way of linking their understandings of whole systems approaches to that offered in the above table. Whole Systems Approach to Healthcare and Self-management Support In Ireland's national framework for self-management support - \"Living Well with a Chronic Condition\" (Health Service Executive, 2017), there is a commitment to a whole system approach to supporting patient self-management for better healthcare in managing chronic conditions taking account of different levels of the system. The following diagram extracted from the framework captures a whole systems approach for self-management support: Living Well with a Chronic Condition: Framework for Self-management Support National Framework and Implementation Plan for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions: COPD, Asthma, Diabetes and Cardiovascular disease Self-management Support National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 146Figure 5.1: Whole System Model for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions (reproduced with permission from Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 18)Figure 1: Whole System Model for Support for Self-management for Chronic ConditionsWider System Support for Self-m anagement Organisation Support for Self-m anagement Informed and Skilled Health Care Professionals Supporting Self-management Engaged and Informed Patients and CarersPerson S uppor ted to Self-manageWider System Support for Self-management Through partnership working with external providers including: General Practitioners Voluntary/Community Organisations Professional and Regulatory Bodies Academia, including higher education institutionsOrganisational Suppor t for Self-management Policy support Coordination of service delivery Financial support Resources Optimising use of technology (including telehealth and telemedicine) Quality assurance (evaluation to include patient experience) Informed and Skilled Health Care Professionals Through education and training in self-management support including: communication skills person-centred care health behaviour change care and support planning collaborative agenda setting goal setting, action planning and follow up group facilitationPatients and Carers will have timely access to: Disease speci/f_ic self- management support (e.g. diabetes structured education, cardiac rehab, pulmonary rehab, asthma education) Generic interventions: - regular clinical review - care planning - provision of appropriate information - health behaviour change support - peer and social support - generic self management education - carer support Care PlanThe person who is able to self-manage their long term condition: knows about their condition follows a treatment plan (care plan) agreed with their health professionals actively shares in decision- making with health professionals monitors and manages signs and symptoms of their condition knows how to respond to a deterioration in their condition manages the impact of the condition on their physical, emotional and social life adopts lifestyles that promote health has access to support services and has the con/f_idence and ability to use them 18 National Framework and implementation Plan for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions: COPD, Asthma, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease4. Whole System Model for Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions Note to Instructors It is worth taking students through this diagram to illustrate the complexity of whole systems approach and the need to link each component i.e. individual and healthcare professionals (micro-level), organisation of services e.g. interventions, technology support (meso-level) and then wider system support (working with voluntary sector, developing the role of HCPs). This overview will inform students' knowledge and understanding of how self-management support sits within the wider organization and delivery of healthcare (see below the Chronic Care Model). National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 147Although self-management support requires a whole systems approach for successful management of chronic conditions, self-management support is a component within a broader model of healthcare for chronic conditions. The Chronic Care Model illustrates this very well. Pause to examine and discuss self-management support within the Chronic Care Model Take a look at the Chronic Care Model (presented on slide). When you look at this diagram, what comes to mind about the 'bigger picture' of chronic care? How would you describe what this model means in terms of managing chronic conditions in your own words? Note: this is intended to be a 'warm-up' exercise for students. More detailed prompt and probe questions are detailed below in notes to instructors. Figure 5.2: The Chronic Care Model (Wagner et al. , 1996) Self- Management Support Informed, Activated PatientPrepared Proactive Practice TeamDelivery System DesignDecision SupportClinical Information SystemsHealth Systems Organisation of Healthcare Improved OutcomesCommunity Resources and Policies Productive Interactions Note to Instructors: Use prompt and probe questions to facilitate students share their observations and thoughts e.g. What sector of the healthcare system is given prominence and why (Explore community & relevance to self-management support)? What resources need to be mobilised to support individuals' needs for self-management? What is needed in a health system to promote safe, high quality care in providing self-management support? What is required of a delivery design system to assure effective, efficient self-management support? What is needed to support healthcare professionals' clinical decision-making for self-management support? What is the relevance of clinical information systems to organising individuals and population data for efficient and effective care? What does the Chronic Care model depict in terms of an individual and a healthcare professional working relationships? The approach to this exercise may vary depending of student group learning styles and also factors such as class sizes, time etc. a lean way to capture breadth and depth of information from students is to divide them into groups and allocate questions accordingly. As a resource for this discussion, it is recommended that instructors orientate themselves to the Chronic Care Model website http://www.improvingchroniccare.org/index.php?p=The_Chronic_Care_Model&s=2 . From here links to each of the model's components can be accessed. This link can also be provided to students who wish to explore the model further. Although the Chronic Care Model is not formally used in Ireland, all of its components are relevant as various aspects of healthcare reform including the implementation of self-management support. The Chronic Care Model originally developed and implemented by (Wagner et al. , 1996) in the USA, totackletherisingburdenofchronicconditionsandtheneedforeffectivehealthcareorganization and delivery, is the most prominent and widely used chronic condition management approach worldwide. Support for the Chronic Care Model is evident in Ireland's national framework for self- management support - \" Living Well with a Chronic Condition\" : National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 148\"This model has broad international acceptance as a framework to provide guidance on shifting from our current model of care which is predominantly acute and episodic care, to a lifelong model of health promotion, prevention, early intervention and chronic care\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 13). Current provision of Self-management Support in the Irish Healthcare System - Your Perspectives and Experiences The perspectives and experiences of frontline healthcare professionals and individuals are important to shaping healthcare system reforms and also to evaluating current provision of services arising out of national health policy. Take for example, the national framework for self-management support - \" Living Well with a Chronic Condition\" , healthcare professionals were consulted through focus groups, and their views along with the views of other groups including individuals helped develop the framework. The framework states the following: \"An initial draft of the framework was further refined through a national consultation in 2016. This consultation included focus groups with healthcare professionals both within and outside the HSE, patients and representatives of patient organisations; and interviews with HSE senior management, and ICGP and Department of Health representatives\" (Health Service Executive, 2017, p. 12). Although current students as future healthcare professionals were not involved in the consultation process around developing the framework for self-management support, that does not preclude studentsfromhavingaviewontheframework,specificallyonitsimplementationandfuture direction. As future healthcare professionals, you already have experienced clinical practice/health service delivery as students during scheduled clinical placements. Therefore, you are in a position to comment on how self-management support is working in practice. Your view matters, because asfuturefrontlinehealthcareprofessionalsyourcriticalreflectionsoncurrentpracticescanbean important springboard for continuing improvement of the healthcare of individuals with chronic conditions through self-management support (i.e. micro-system level). Your view also matters at a policy and system level (i.e. macro-system level) such that any reforms at national level needs to be informed by frontline staff. The Chronic Care Model represents a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of chronic conditions. In the Chronic Care Model, Wagner et al. (1996) emphasises the importance of self-management support linked with adequate record systems, readily available evidence and well-designed care delivery systems in leading to improved outcomes. The model also highlights how essential it is that individuals play an active and informed part in the continuing care of their own diseases in a partnership with their healthcare professionals. Let's return for a moment to the earlier point about the daily 'busy' lives of frontline healthcare, and not seeing the bigger picture at a health system level. This raises a question of whether a 'big picture' in terms of having a 'whole system perspective' on healthcare is relevant to frontline staff. Justimagineasfrontlinehealthcareprofessionals,anopportunityarisestostepbackfromthe businessofeverydaypracticetocriticallyreflectonhowtheorganisationanddeliveryofhealthcare through the current healthcare system in Ireland impacts on your work and efforts to support individuals in the self-management of their chronic conditions. Let us now explore your experiences and hear your views through the following activity. National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 149 Activity 5.3: Preparing a Statement about Self-management Support for Chronic Conditions for submission to the Minister for Health (Worksheet 1) As frontline healthcare professionals, you are invited to make a submission to the Minister for Health on the current health services towards self-management support for individuals with chronic conditions. For this submission, draw on your experiences in practice to date to inform your views. In your submission, address the following: \u0097 Current strengths of the health services towards self-management support implementation \u0097 Current weaknesses/limitations of the health services towards self- management support implementation \u0097 Recommendations for future direction towards enhancing self- managementsupportimplementationinhealthcareorganizationand delivery A template is provided for this exercise including various areas of services based on Chronic Care Model that students can comment on. The total number of students in the class can be divided into small groups (and may need to comprise clusters of triads if groups are large) and allocated a subset of topics from those listed below. This is to ensure that all topics are addressed within a limited time frame. Prompt students to reflect on earlier discussion on Chronic Care Model. Allow Students approximately 15-20 minutes for this Activity following which open class discussion takes place. Note to Instructors: Student are not expected to write a full submission but rather to jot down their thoughts. At the end of this exercise, explore some key points from students to generate discussion. The following resources can serve as information for integration into the discussion and for raising awareness to the students that these are available, although not necessarily directly relating to self-management support.

While this is important, educating healthcare professionalsaloneisnotsufficienttomakesignificantgainsinrealisingacultureofself-management support in the health system. A health system committed to self-management support requires a coordinated approach such that services are integrated between acute, primary care and community services and resources. In this lesson, we examine what is meant by co-ordinating person-centred care and health services within an integrated health system, and how resources can be mobilised to support this. Keeping the Focus on Person/People-centred Care Fromtheveryfirstunitofthiscurriculum(Unit1:FoundationofSelf-managementSupportfor Chronic Conditions) and throughout the curriculum on self-management support as a whole, person-centred care has been presented as a core concept. Often times, healthcare professionals may focus on person-centred care only within the context of their day to day encounters with individuals. However, person-centred care also needs to be a core focus at the level of organising service delivery. The intention here is not to consider person-centred care in depth since by now in the curriculum, as future healthcare professionals, you will be familiar with this concept. However, it is useful toremindourselvesofthisconceptwithinthespecificcontextoforganisationanddeliveryof healthcare for people with chronic conditions. Let's now watch a brief video as a reminder, which refers to people-centred care. Activity 5.4: People-centred Care People-centered care is concerned with moving a healthcare service from what is the matter with you to what matters to you. Watch the video on the link provided which summarises what person-centered care is. Watch this video on people-centered care (2m 35s): www.youtube.com/ watch?v=pj-AvTOdk2Q (Permission to use for educational purposes received from WHO ( permissions@who.int )) Pause for Reflection and Discussion Prompt Question: How people-centredness is our current healthcare system in Ireland in terms of service organisation and delivery? National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 152Integrated Care for self-management support: What Does This Mean? The organisation and delivery of healthcare services is complex and multifaceted involving multiple service areas. The need for these services to be integrated towards a seamless continuum of care is paramount if individuals are to be supported to manage their chronic conditions in their homes. Activity 5.5: Pause and Think Discuss these questions in groups. \u0097 What does integrated care and health services mean within the context of self-management support? \u0097 How do you think integrated care can support self-management support service delivery and organisation? Activity 5.6: Integrated Care Watch this video on Sam's story regarding integrated care. As you watch this, reflectonyourexperiencesofworkingintheIrishhealthcaresystemtaking noteofthestrengthsandweaknessesoftheorganizationanddeliveryofhealth servicesspecifictothecontextofself-managementsupportforpeoplewith chronic conditions.

The video focuses on the NHS in the UK. However, with consideration to the Irish healthcare services while watching this video, consider the following activity. Mobilising Resources for Self-management Support Based on the video on Sam, it was apparent that a number of resources were available to him. Pause for Reflection and Discussion Recall what the resources were in Sam's story ApartfromtheresourcesidentifiedinthevideoonSam,othercommunityresourcesareavailable. Consider the directory of services available to facilitate discussion, accessible at www.hse.ie/ selfmanagementsupport . National Undergraduate Curriculum for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Part 2 153Mobilising resources requires a critical review of how these can be accessed and optimised for self-management support when working with individuals with chronic conditions. Consideration needs to be given to current developments in healthcare services and reforms that are taking place. At the time of writing this curriculum, the following are some of the changes or ongoing developments taking place that potentially could impact on the organisation and delivery of services in terms of resources available for self-management support. These include but are not limited to: \u0097 GP contracts \u0097 Clinical Care Programmes \u0097 Demonstrator Projects for chronic condition management \u0097 Growth in Advanced Nurse Practitioners \u0097 Recognition of role of voluntary sector \u0097 Service user involvement Drawing on the above examples, facilitate discussion with students on how resources can be mobilised to facilitate self-management support for individuals with chronic conditions. Following on from the above discussion, move towards consolidating learning at the macro and meso level of providing self-management support focusing on the following activity. Activity 5.7: e-Health Read the following case study in the link and consider giving this as a handout orpostingonVLEforstudentstoprintoutpriortothisLesson.Takenotethatat the core of this case study is the potential of e-Health in the organisation and delivery of health services. https://www.ehealthireland.ie/Strategic-Programmes/Electronic-Health-Record- EHR-/Final-Persona-Scenario-files/Community-Care-Persona-John-Malone- Scenario-1-v1-0.pdf Follow on from this case study, explore other resources that may be relevant to optimising self-management support. Note to Instructors: Lecturers/Instructors to probe and prompt based on current knowledge of resources available to people with chronic conditions. Summary of the lesson IndrawingaconclusiontothisfinalunitoftheSelf-managementSupportforChronicConditions curriculum, let's recap on the curriculum as a whole. For this, consider how the health service organisation and delivery connects with the micro-level involving direct patient. Take a look at the following diagram and explore how it brings together all of your learning on self-management support for chronic conditions.

Professor Eileen Savage (UCC), Dr Carmel Mullaney (HSE), Ms. Dawn Sinclair (UCC), and Mr Anthony O'Reilly (May 2018) Aim of the Survey What is the current practice and provision of Self-management Support for CD in curricula of undergraduate/graduate entry healthcare students attending HEIs in Ireland? Methods Questionnaire: The survey consisted of two sections: Section 1) demographic/background section and Section 2) Self-management Support for CD curriculum content (Appendix 1). Thesurveytakesapproximatelyfifteenminutestocomplete. Survey Participants: The sampling strategy was to target all Higher Education Institutes (Universities (n=6 UCC, UCD, DCU, Trinity, NUI, UL), National University of recognised Colleges (n=1 RCSI), and Institutes of Technology (n=6 AIT, WIT, Dundalk IT, GMIT, Letterkenny IT, ITT) that offer undergraduate/graduate entry level degrees for future healthcare professions (Medicine, Nursing, Midwifery, Dentistry, Dietetics, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Podiatry, Public Health, Psychology, Speech and Language Sciences, Occupational Health Sciences and Social Care). The relevant HEIs were contacted through the heads of school, and programme co-ordinators/ leads of the relevant healthcare departments/schools. Each were e-mailed and provided with a cover letter detailing the study. The relevant programme co-ordinators/leaders were requested to distribute the survey to the appropriate members of staff such as module leaders and lecturers directly involved in teaching students on chronic disease related content and skills. This study received ethical approval from the Social Research and Ethics Committee, UCC. The reporting of results is anonymised whereby no individual or identifying information is reported.
