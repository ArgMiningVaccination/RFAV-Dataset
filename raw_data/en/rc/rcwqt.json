At Retreat, we believe in the myriad benefits of psychedelic medicine, from macrodoses to microdosing and everything in between\u2014when utilized as a tool safely and with intention. Our goal is to provide you with research-backed information to support you in your decision making. If you're interested in trying psilocybin, also known as \"magic mushrooms\" or \"shrooms\", one of the first questions you may have is: \"How much do I take?\" There are a number of factors that affect the dosage of psilocybin, including the strain of psilocybin mushroom (there are more than 180 different types of magical mushrooms), the form function (mushrooms often come in chocolates, gummies, pills, or capsules), your constitution, and, of course, your desired outcome for your experience (ranging from a sub-perceptible dose for microdosing to a full psychedelic journey or a macrodose). Knowing how much to take in terms of dosage isn't always obvious. We've gathered a few dosage tips in this article to help you know where to start. Our team has done the due diligence of personal exploration, research, and reading case studies to bring you this information. Whether you're microdosing to [improve your creativity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-018-5106-2) or taking a [macrodose to help with depression](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443), read on for what we have found in our research regarding the ins and outs of magic mushroom dosage. Psilocybin 101: What are Magic Mushrooms? Magic mushroom is the casual term for the more than 200 species of mushrooms that contain psilocybin, a psychedelic compound that can create hallucinogenic effects, as well as, according to studies, provide mental health benefits ranging from [decreased depression](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443), [supporting people with PTSD](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/medical-ethics/education/high-school-bioethics-project/learning-scenarios/ptsd-treatment-psychedelics), or enhancing your [creativity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-018-5106-2) and productivity with microdosing. Psilocybin is found in mushrooms of all types, many of which grow naturally in the [forests and backyards of the Pacific Northwest](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/a-psychedelic-surprise-may-be-thriving-in-your-local-garden). Psilocybin [has been shown to have the ability to increase serotonin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30685771/) (also known as the feel-good hormone), as it interacts with the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A. Balanced levels of serotonin can result in feelings of pleasure, calmness, and clarity. Psilocybin is also known to [increase dopamine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25342005/), a neurotransmitter located in the brain's reward center that is associated with happiness and depression. Learn to microdose with our free guide. Magic mushrooms, or psilocybin, have been taken throughout history for recreational, medicinal, and religious purposes. For centuries, magic mushrooms have had a rich spiritual history among indigenous cultures across Latin America including the Mixtecs, Mazatecs, Nahuas, and Zapotecs. They were also taken in Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. In 1955, [Maria Sabina](https://psychedelicreview.com/person/maria-sabina/), a Oaxacan practitioner, invited two westerners to participate in a velada ceremony, a ritual that utilizes psilocybin to experience spiritual enlightenment. The westerners, [R. Gordon Wasson](https://psychedelicreview.com/person/r-gordon-wasson/), an author and executive at J.P. Morgan, and his wife Valentina, took a sample of Sabina's spores to France, where they were studied by the Swiss chemist, Albert [Hofmann](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Hofmann), who created the best-known psychedelic, LSD. In the same decade, [psychiatrist Humphry Osmond began studying psychedelics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31132970/), using author Aldous Huxley as one of his first subjects. Huxley later wrote \"Doors of Perception\" about his experience with Mescalin. Throughout the 1950s, Osmond and his colleague John Smythies tested psychedelics as a treatment for alcoholism. By the 1960s and 1970s, the recreational use of magic mushrooms increased in popularity; they became a symbol of the counterculture during these decades. Then, along came President Richard Nixon, who launched the \" [War on Drugs\",](https://time.com/6090016/us-war-on-drugs-origins/) which would affect America's policy and perception on psychedelics for the next five decades, leading to heavy regulation of psychedelics and mass incarceration for psychedelic-related offenses in the United States. When psilocybin was added to the DEA's list of Schedule I substances in 1970, scientists were forced to abandon their research on its mental health benefits. It wasn't until the early 2000s that the U.S. government began allowing small trials to resume. For the past 15 years, researchers at [Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Unit](https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/) have been leading studies on the effects of psilocybin on mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, and more. Today, we have arrived at the Psychedelic Renaissance, with the rebirth of a new, holistic, and healthful approach to psychedelic medicine. When faced with a global mental health crisis, policymakers cannot ignore the benefits of psychedelic medicine being published via research studies at [universities](https://www.businessinsider.com/universities-set-up-psychedelics-research-centers-depression-anxiety-imperial-hopkins-2021-3) including [Johns Hopkins](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/research/psychedelics-research.html), [Washington University](https://healthymind.wustl.edu/items/washington-universitys-program-in-psychedelic-research/), Columbia University of New York, and Stanford. This list is quickly growing and [this website](https://psychedelicinvest.com/educational-organizations/) maps out the educational institutions that are researching psychedelics. Psilocybin amounts can vary between different strains of magic mushrooms and even within the same strain. The only way to determine exactly how much of an active ingredient is in a mushroom is for researchers to test it in a laboratory setting. You can estimate the dose of active ingredients in your magic mushrooms if you know the strain. Mushroom identification books provide information in regards to determining which type of mushroom you're working with and how much of each active ingredient is commonly found in your strain per gram. It's important to never consume any mushroom product unless it is offered by a company, organization or individual with professional and medical credibility. There are many benefits reported from Microdosers. Here is a list of just some of these benefits and research to accompany these claims! When you download our free Microdosing Guide or join our Microdosing Progra you will explore these benefits in greater depth. If you're a mycophile or psychonaut (like us), you likely know that psilocybin is the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. But what you may not know is that there are two active ingredients in mushrooms: psilocybin and psilocin. And both have been shown by studies to play a role in the psychedelic and healing effects of psychedelic medicine. Our bodies break down psilocybin into [psilocin in our digestive tracts](https://healing-mushrooms.net/psilocin). While magic mushrooms contain plenty of psilocin on their own, this compound is pretty fragile and its potency can diminish pretty quickly after the mushroom is harvested. The good news is that the psilocybin in the mushrooms isn't as fragile a compound and our bodies can transform that psilocybin into psilocin. Psychedelic drugs like psilocybin activate the 5-HT2A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30685771/). This disrupts neural activity and changes neural networks, suppressing the default network, which controls ego and self-awareness. These effects combined with various healing practices and psychotherapy can combine to rewire and heal neural networks in the brain. The effects that psilocybin has on serotonin receptors is thought to be one reason why psychedelics can distort your perception of reality, including time, spatial awareness, and sense of self. Join our Microdosing Program to learn more about the science behind psychedelics. How much psilocybin you take can greatly change the outcome of your experience, ranging from feelings of increased creativity, to euphoria, to a total lack of your sense of self or the feeling that one is dying, also known as \"ego death.\" An Overview of Magic Mushroom Dosage An appropriate dose of magic mushrooms will be different for everyone and it is important to always first seek the opinion of a medical professional before consuming any mushroom product. Different factors affect how the mushrooms will impact you including your brain chemistry, your physical composition, how you slept, and what you ate and drank. The adage start low and go slow is a good rule of thumb \u2014 especially if you're new to psychedelics or you're exploring a new strain. To break it down further, we suggest starting with a \"low\" dosage (lower than the dosage you may be used to for new strains) and \"slow\" into it by increasing dosage every 30 - 60 minutes, as needed, as psilocybin builds in potency. Some people find that microdosing mushrooms help them to reap the most benefits. Others prefer to take medium, large, or \"heroic\" doses. Microdosing is a term used to describe a very small dose of any drug \u2014 not only magic mushrooms. A typical \"normal\" dose of magic mushrooms to reach a psychedelic state might be something like 2 - 6 grams. A microdose would range between 0.25 to 0.5 gram. This answer will be different depending on who you ask, as many factors impact this (see above). Microdosing has been described by studies as a sub-perceptual experience, meaning you aren't meant to feel \"high\" or the hallucinogenic effects of the mushrooms, and can provide many benefits including increased [creativity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-018-5106-2), [mood](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364961/), [focus](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-019-0308-4), and productivity. A macrodose is simply a full dose or a high dose of a drug. A macrodose of psilocybin might start at 6 milligrams and go up from there, depending on how hallucinogenic a user may want their experience to be. Some users may take upwards of 5 or more grams in one sitting, though we don't recommend that to anyone who is new to psychedelics, as many adverse outcomes may occur if not done in a safe set and setting, with preparation and intention. Not sure how much psilocybin to take? We get it. Magic mushrooms don't come with instructions and it can be intimidating to know where to start. While everyone's body is different, we've defined a few parameters to help get you started. Regardless of the dose you take, please always have someone there with you supervising you that is not under the influencer: a trip sitter, therapist, facilitator, or trusted and experienced friend. Microdose: 0.1 to 0.5 Grams A microdose of magic mushrooms is a small dose that won't result in a hallucinogenic experience, also known as a sub-perceptible dose. Most people who microdose psilocybin do so to reduce the symptoms of mood disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Or, to optimize their performance with increased focus and creativity. A microdose of mushrooms is only 0.1 - 0.5 grams. For most people, it is typically 0.1 - 0.2 grams. Your tolerance is impacted by your protocol and your experience with macrodoses, among other factors. 0.5 to 2 grams of mushrooms is considered a low dose. Unlike microdosing, this dosage should offer some mild effects, likely a euphoric state and sensory experiences. Depending on the strain, you can expect to feel the effects for anywhere from 2 - 8 hours, so plan accordingly. You can expect to feel light, euphoric, and may see visuals. This is often beautiful when in nature, and comes through bright, vivid colors, and smiling trees. Your judgment may be impaired, so it's not recommended to take a low dose of magic mushrooms if you're planning on driving, going to work, taking care of children, or hosting a board meeting. A medium dose of magic mushrooms is 2 to 3 grams of dried mushrooms. This dosage may offer all the effects of a low dose with some hallucinogenic symptoms. You may feel euphoric and sensory experiences \u2014 just more intensely. You may see brighter colors, more movement, and some visible alterations that aren't really there. You can expect to have interesting, new thoughts enter your mind. 3 to 5 grams of mushrooms is considered a high dose of magic mushrooms. If you're taking magic mushrooms for a mind-altering experience, you may want to take this dosage. You will likely experience hallucinations and sensory distortions (objects may appear larger than they actually are, objects will change, the room may darken or lighten, or visual details may become distorted). You may also experience cross-sensory experiences, such as seeing sounds or smelling colors, an experience known as synesthesia. A very high dose of psilocybin is called a \"heroic\" dose or a \"committed\" dose. Ethnobotanist Terance McKenna (a supporter of psychedelic research) coined both of these terms. Five grams of psilocybin (or more) will produce the most dramatic effects. People who take five grams or more of magic mushrooms may experience full ego death and loss of reality. If you're planning on taking this high of a magic mushroom dose, you'll most certainly want to be supervised (by a trip sitter, guide, therapist, doctor, or a trusted friend with psychedelic experience). You'll want to be in a safe, calm, and quiet place\u2014a heroic dose of mushrooms is not a social experience. Yet, psychedelic supporters (like McKenna) argue that taking such a high dose can also have the most significant effects. Take a heroic dose if you're familiar with psychedelics (specifically magic mushrooms) and want to experience a total ego death (which is not as scary as it sounds but is still a major commitment). Ego death can feel like a complete loss of sense of self and self-identity. It's often described as a feeling of dying or becoming one with the world. It is a temporary experience that occurs in Users who undergo an ego death often report feelings of bliss, euphoria, or peace during the ego death. In psilocybin trials on [terminal cancer patients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30102082/), ego death was simply a precursor to actual death and allowed patients to let go of the fear of dying. One may want to experience an ego death so they can truly experience living each day without the fear of death, which can be extremely liberating. Heroic doses help us work through trauma, feel connection, and enhance spirituality. Users often report feelings of deeper connection, meaning, and oneness, along with a decreased fear of death. While all of the information on dosage can be overwhelming, there's no need to worry. We've included things to consider and resources on how to determine an ideal magic mushroom dosage. Preparation and integration are important parts of any psychedelic journey. Before taking any psychedelics, you should prepare for your psychedelic journey, whether macro or micro, with self-reflection, preparation, and proper guidance\u2014 including consultation with a medical professional and a mental health professional. You can start by asking yourself a few simple questions. First things first, your dosage and your mindset will determine how you feel on magic mushrooms. So, it's important to be honest with yourself about this question. Using the above dosage guide as a jumping-off point, consider your desired mental state and any fears or reservations you may have. Whether you want to feel the psychedelic effects or not is an important factor when determining how much to take. Typically, it takes 30 minutes to start to feel the effects of psilocybin. As we said above, start low and go slow. You can always take more if you're not feeling it after 30 minutes to an hour but you can't \"take less\" once you've started feeling the effects strongly. Unlike alcohol, mushrooms take longer to metabolize in the body and the effects can last for many hours. If you've never taken psychedelics before, haven't taken them in a long time, or are trying a new strain, we always recommend going slightly lower to start. You can always take more to enhance your experience later. We recommend setting an intention before every journey, no matter the dosage. Some people explore psychedelics for creative enhancements, some from mental health benefits and others out of curiosity. The \"why\" and your intentions should help you determine your dose. If you've taken psychedelics before, you may want to use your previous dose and experience as a starting off point for your magic mushroom dosage. Take into account any changes in your body since your last dose as well as other factors, such as excessive weight gain or loss, changing or starting new medication, recently having had a baby, stress, entering menopause (or premenopause), or other lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise). In these circumstances, it's always best to start with a lower dose as you get to know your body again. Determining your \"set and setting\" will help you understand how much of a dose you can take, and is one of the most important pieces for any psychedelic journey. While there's a lot more to consider when setting up your space for your journey, when it comes to dosing, the first question to ask yourself is: \"Will I have a quiet room or space where I can safely take my mushrooms?\" This could be an area where you meditate, journal, pray, or do some breathing exercises as part of your inward connection. Perhaps you consider renting a private space for you and your trip sitter to go to for your journey if you don't have complete privacy where you live. For bigger doses especially, you want to make sure you put a lot of consideration into how you set up your space. We go more in depth on this in our Retreat Microdose Program. The next important thing to consider when it comes to setting and dosage is how much time you have for your journey. Heavier doses of psilocybin can last for 6 - 8 hours, so you definitely want to plan accordingly. We recommend that you not plan anything for after your journey when taking 1 or more grams, especially in the beginning when you're unsure of how the mushrooms will affect you. It's important to note that 2 grams may affect you for 2 hours one day and another day, the same 2 grams could affect you for 6 hours. It's hard to know exactly how you will react so it's important to give yourself plenty of time to come down before you need to be responsible for anything. Equally important, mushrooms open up your heart and mind, so you will be feeling more sensitive than usual in the hours and days that follow. Whether or not you have someone to support you during your journey will make a big difference in how much you take. At Retreat, we recommend that you always have someone with you during your journey, but that's not necessary in the case of microdosing. Otherwise, make sure you let someone trusted know what you plan to do, where and when you plan to take mushrooms, and have someone in the home with you (they don't need to be in the room but at least having someone nearby who is \"sober\" is very important, especially with higher doses.) Before beginning any psychedelic exploration, we recommend speaking with professionals. As part of our Microdosing Program, you will go through a medical screening and speak with a trained psychedelic coach before you start to microdose. Where possible, build a relationship with a psychotherapist who specializes in psychedelic integration and microdosing, who can help you prepare for and integrate your experiences as they arise, and who can support you as your life begins to change for the better. Microdosing can bring up a lot of challenging emotions and/or traumas and having the support of a professional to help you process during these times is invaluable. It's common to work with a therapist before, during and after microdosing. As part of our course, you will consult with our psychedelic/microdosing integration specialist. Are your immediate family, spouse, or friends supportive of your decision to explore psychedelics? Ideally you will have some psychedelically friendly people in your life to encourage your process and offer feedback. This is why we created the members-only Retreat community as part of our Microdosing Program, for you to be able to engage with other microdosers, to support one another and to share suggestions, feedback, and to build community. This community is meant to be a safe, open, and confidential space for you to thrive. You can apply to join here. Magic mushrooms come in several different forms. Nearly all of these forms come from mushrooms themselves. The only form of magic mushrooms on this list that isn't \"really\" mushrooms is truffles. Don't know which form of psilocybin to take? Your desired dosage and the availability of psilocybin where you live may play a pretty big role in your decision. One surefire way to get magic mushrooms is to go right to the source. You can't get any closer to magic mushrooms than by eating the raw mushrooms themselves\u2014something we don't recommend unless you have professional guidance. When buying dried magic mushrooms, it's important to ask questions about the strain you're buying (and approximate dosage parameters for that strain), how the mushrooms were dried (to preserve potency, they need to be dried fully), and if the mushrooms were properly stored (light can reduce potency). Since the stems and caps may contain different quantities of active ingredients, [one expert](https://twitter.com/trikomes/status/1280585597107617793) suggests that the caps have more potency. Once you have your dried mushrooms, you can eat them as they are or with food, blend them up into a dust and put them in your smoothie or on food, or encapsulate them and take them in pill form. Try out different methods to see which you enjoy most. Magic mushrooms are also available in more processed forms, like chocolates or gummies. Each piece should contain a proportionate amount of the mushrooms, which should be indicated by the package or seller. Chocolate bars are often more challenging to get the exact dose, given the way the chocolate bars are made, the amount of psilocybin varies by bar and by square of chocolate. Another term you might hear thrown around a lot when talking about magic mushrooms is truffles or even magic truffles. These are synthesized magic mushrooms. Instead of growing these mushrooms, they're made in a lab from chemical compounds. In psilocybin clinical trials, many patients actually receive this chemically manufactured form of psilocybin. This form isn't \"better\" or \"worse\" than when it's extracted from mushrooms. Researchers even believe that in its chemically manufactured form, it's easier to dose psilocybin. If you hear someone referring to magic truffles, they might be referring to a form of chemically manufactured psilocybin. Though still illegal in the U.S., this form of psilocybin is popularly taken in Amsterdam; psilocybin manufactured in a lab falls in a legal loophole in the Netherlands, as only hallucinogenic mushrooms have been outlawed. We understand that sourcing magic mushrooms isn't easy. Therefore, we've compiled some tips to kick off your journey and ease some of your sourcing issues. If you're planning on buying psilocybin, always do so from a trusted source. Ask your friends or family members for a referral or recommendation. Join an online community to learn about the best ways to source, dose, and journey on psilocybin. Do not source from Instagram or TikTok sellers. Always get a friend-of-a-friend referral. Ask about the source, strain, and dosage. Trust your gut. Mushrooms tend to make people kinder, gentler, and more connected to others and the environment. Many people who grow and facilitate mushrooms want to help others heal. If you're getting aggressive, weird, or salesy type messages, it's likely a scam\u2014be mindful of the source, the referral, the communication style, and the energy. Live in a jurisdiction where psilocybin is legal or decriminalized? You may be able to take your mushrooms to a testing center that will test your sample for potency, solvents, pesticides, contaminants, and more. If allowed by the laws of your local jurisdiction, you may also be able to order psilocybin testing kits online to test the composition and concentration of magic mushrooms. Only 150 mg of magic mushrooms is needed to test the potency of up to 0.1 to 2% psilocybin concentration. Got a green thumb? If you're planning on microdosing long-term, you may want to grow your own magic mushrooms. This way, you'll have a steady source of mushrooms for microdosing. You'll also know what strains you're working with and if anything has been added to your shrooms during the grow process \u2014 because you're the one who's growing them! If you're able to fit a kit or spores to grow, it can be a very rewarding and enriching experience to grow your own healing medicine. We're big fans of the new Shrooly, an at-home mushroom-growing contraption. Psilocybin retreats are offered to new users who need some help or guidance with magic mushroom dosage. Right now, most of these retreats are offered internationally, particularly in Jamaica, the Bahamas, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Psilocybin is legal in Jamaica and the Bahamas, and is deprioritized by local authorities in Costa Rica and Mexico. There are at least a dozen retreats offered and most of the retreats include screening for pre-existing conditions and providing a list of medications that may interact with psilocybin. They usually also provide some type of mental health support before, during, and after your journey. They may also offer other perks, such as yoga, surfing, massage therapy, and healthy meals. While most of these retreats don't focus on microdosing, they can be considered a \"crash course\" in psychedelics and can help you build knowledge and community. You're probably reading this article because you're trying to decide if magic mushrooms are for you. Here are a few more notes to help you ease your concerns and debunk any myths. Psilocybin is listed as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. According to the U.S. government, substances on this list have, \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" Yet, the same goes for cannabis, a drug that has been legalized in many states, decriminalized in many more, and approved for medicinal purposes in 37 states. More than [two dozen states](https://theappeal.org/the-lab/explainers/the-movement-to-decriminalize-psilocybin-explained/) have proposed policies under consideration to decriminalize or legalize psychedelics. It has been deprioritized in over a dozen localities, including Northampton, MA, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, CA. Oregon will begin accepting applications for licensure for the sale of psilocybin on January 2, 2023. The legalization of [state-regulated healing centers](https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Proposition_122,_Decriminalization_and_Regulated_Access_Program_for_Certain_Psychedelic_Plants_and_Fungi_Initiative_(2022)) was approved by voters in November 2022 in Colorado. Psilocybin has been decriminalized in nine localities (and counting), including [Detroit and Ann Arbor](https://mushroomspores.blog/psilocybin-law/detroit-decriminalizing-magic-mushrooms/). The amount of active ingredients in magic mushrooms varies by strain. Taking 1 gram of one strain of mushroom might cause different results than taking that same dosage of another strain. Once you know how one strain affects you, some experts recommend sticking to that strain. Or, if one strain isn't doing it for you, consider trying another along the same safety precautions detailed above. The bottom line? Research shows that magic mushrooms are kind of like cannabis. While all strains should have a similar effect, not all strands will offer the same effect. Just as the amount of flavor in your portobellos varies from stems to caps, the amount of active ingredients in magic mushrooms may also vary in caps versus stems. If you're new to magic mushroom dosage, some experts recommend taking a smaller dose of mushroom from a cap than a stem. There's not a whole lot of live data on this out there, but caution, safety, and following the advice of a professional are of utmost importance. There are so many different factors that can influence the way your body reacts to any drug. And if you don't have a doctor monitoring your reactions and offering dosage advice, you may need to accept that finding the right may take some time. Just because one microdosing schedule (or magic mushroom dosage) works for your bestie, doesn't mean your body will react the same. The idea is to take small doses, record your results, and adjust accordingly. The benefits may be minimal at first. Or, you may experience [negative psychological side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600464/) (though those microdosing usually experience such side effects only on dosing days). If you're taking any medication, you should check with your doctor before microdosing. A short list of some of the medications that psilocybin may interact with include: When it comes to medications (even herbal supplements like St. John's Wort), it's better not to mix psychedelics with certain substances. Never stop taking your medications without consulting with your doctor first. Please don't stop taking prescribed medications without talking to your doctor first. Here are our recommendations for preparing for a psychedelic journey. Interested in microdosing? Download our Free Microdosing Guide. Do talk to your doctor before taking magic mushrooms and consider possible medication interactions, family medical history, and preexisting conditions. Do speak to a therapist, or a psychedelic facilitator, before engaging in a macro journey. Do your research in pre-journey preparation and post-journey integration. Do consider set & setting. Do find a professional guide, trip sitter, or trusted psychonaut to watch over you on your magic mushroom journey. Do start with a lower dose of magic mushrooms, following advice of a professional. Remember: start low, go slow. Don't assume your body will react the same to a magic mushroom dosage as someone else's. Brain composition and chemistry play a large role in how your body will react to psychedelics, so start low and go slow. Don't take psychedelics before going to work, driving a car (or operating machinery), or while you're in charge of minors, children, or pets. Don't assume that you're not under the influence of psilocybin just because you think the effects have worn off (the effects usually last three to six hours but can last for even longer).
