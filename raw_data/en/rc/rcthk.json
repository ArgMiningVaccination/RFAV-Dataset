This line of research andtheorizing offersa novel and intriguing perspective of ahedonictheoryofexercise behavior. a widely circulated e-mail message, forwarded to one of the authors(PE.)by a former student Exercisepsychology is a scientific field in the midst of aKuhnlan crisis.Anoldparadigm, according to whichbehavioral decisions (such as the decision to engage in, adhere to, or disengage from physical activity) are guidedbythe rational cognitive analy\u00ad sisofavailable information, hasstartedto show its weaknesses. Over the past 20years,aperiodduring whichmoreinformation aboutthehealthbenefits of physical activity has become available thanever before, the percentage ofpeopleengaging in regular physical activi tyhasremained stagnant. Cognirive models typically accountfor less than 25%ofthe variation in physical activity behavior. It wouldbe hard to deny that there must be additional sources ofvarianceandthat these shouldbe explored. This chapterisabouttheuntapped potential represented by one such variable-namely, affect. OntheBrinkofaKulmian Revolution? To place the currenr psy\u00ad chology in historical contextand tobetterunder\u00ad standtheunderlying intellectual conflict between the old and new paradigm, it is useful to revisit someofThomas Kuhn'stimeless insights about the emergence of scientific revolutions. According toKuhn(1962/1996), \"normal science\" is a labelthatdescribes \"research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements thatsomeparticular scientific community acknowl\u00ad edges for a time as supplying the foundation forirs furtherpractice\" (p,10).Normalscienceoperates on the basis of\"paradigms.\" Aparadigm isa cornbi\u00ad nationoftheory, practice, and instrumentation rhar acts as an accepted example ofscientific practice. Paradigms serve a crucial function in thescientific enterprise becausethey\"provide models from which springparticular coherent traditions ofscientihc research\" (p. 10). Onceaparadigm is established, the main func\u00ad tionof\"normal-scientific') research is and theories matme_ paradigm supplies\" (Kuhn,1962/1996, p.24).Whatnormal science does not do is [0 observe and consider newphenomena (\"indeed thosethatwillnotfitthe box are often not seen at all,\"P: 24)and to develop new theories achieved the status ofparadigm, a scientific theoryis declared invalid only ifan alternate candidate isavailable to take its place. ...The actofjudgment scientists to reject apreviously accepted theoryis alwaysbased uponmorethanacomparison ofthattheorywith the world. The decision to reject one paradigm isalways simultaneously the decision to accept' another,andthejudgment leadingtothatdecision andanalyzing information: Manyactivities involve inferential conditional relations between events in probabilistic environments. Discernment ofpredictive rules requires cognitive processing ofmultidimensional uncertainties.

Withinspecific studies, the results have been similarly discordant withrationality assumptions. For example, patients in cardiac rehabilitation (N=353)were asked questions related to their perceived risk (e.g.,\"If Ikeep my lifestyle the way it was priorto the acute treatment, Iwill ofrisk(M=3.10out of4.00).However, the correlation ofriskpercep\u00ad tion to the intention to be physically active (e.g., ttlintendto become physically active on a regular basis\")wasonlyr=.09.Outcome expectancy (e.g., \"IfI would exerciseon a regular basis, then Iwould feelbalanced in my daily life));M=3.60outof 4.00)wasalsowealdy related to intention (r=.29).

Theseandnumerous otherstudieswithsimilar results suggest thatitmightbe erroneous to assume that the decision to engage inor adhere to an exer\u00ad ciseprogram depends (e.g., enumerating the healthbenefitsofactivity and the risksofinactiv\u00ad ity),is unlikely to be very effective (e.g., Dishman &Buckworth, 1996). In fact, a growing numberoftheorists have questioned theabilityofhumanbeings to col\u00ad lect, process, and bastion of reason at all: they may be ':;>\"enmeshed in irs networks, for established in-me :i~\\~'r:'::fornladveyears, theireffectivedeployment probably ;~.:,',:'.:,','\"' depends, to a considerable extent, on a continued \"'.\\;' I :';i:.\",',abilityto experience feelings. the certainly notnew, since its (2009) notedthefollowing: \"Though successful in many ways, the cognitive revolution may have beentoo focused onanalyticandcomputational processes. thetimeline ofthisideaoverthecourseofthe past 25 centuries byconcentrating on select and entertainment, sexual ~~~~?!ve.orenjoyment of a plentiful table.
