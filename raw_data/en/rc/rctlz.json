We conducted a cross-sectional survey on a convenience sample of students from all the 18 governmental medical schools in Egypt. A total of 2273 students participated in the online self-administered questionnaire. Around 8 in 10 (83.2%) students were fully vaccinated, of which 17.9% received the booster dose. Only 36.9% believed that COVID-19 is serious on the individual level. The majority (73.9%) strongly or slightly agreed they may become infected after vaccination if they do not follow the preventive measures. We observed a slow decline in the perceived risk of vulnerability and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection among students in parallel to a growing perception of self-efficacy and controllability. Less than one-third (28.9%) of students showed good adherence to protective measures. However, this was lower than the previously reported adherence in the same population before vaccination. Female students, those in the first academic year, those who did not contract COVID-19 infection before, and those with a higher perception of susceptibility and perceived controllability were more likely to perform better at protective measures.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-20", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Risk Perception and Adherence to Preventive Measures among Medical Students after Receiving COVID-19 Vaccination: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study in Egypt [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010007](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010007) [COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage, Behaviors, In the meanwhile, the development of the COVID-19 vaccine became a priority to control such a rapidly spreading virus. Eight months after, the first version of the COVID-19 vaccine was introduced by Pfizer-BioNTech and became available for adults older than 16 years, followed by the development, authorization, and distribution of multiple types of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00007)]. [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00007), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00007)]. In the Egyptian context, and despite its efforts, Egypt hardly managed to fully vaccinate 38.48% of Egypt's population, while only 8.26% received a booster dose by September 2020 [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00007)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00007), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00007), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00007), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00007), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00007)]; a behavior that contributes to more viral transmission and a high likelihood of developing new strains. According to the \"health belief model\", health-related behavior is influenced by individual perceptions such as perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, benefits-barriers net cost, and self-efficacy [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00007)]. Therefore, recognizing the population's behavior and understanding the influencing factors contributing to it are very important to guide public health policy and practice. Therefore, several studies investigated the adherence to preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic before and after vaccination. In response, a rapidly growing scientific literature was observed investigating population behavior during the pandemic and assessing the population's knowledge, attitude, hesitancy, and practices. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00007), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00007), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00007), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00007)]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the same variables following the vaccination campaign. In addition, these previous studies were limited to single or limited centers and had relatively small sample sizes. - (1) - Current vaccination status; - (2) - Adherence to protective measures; - (3) - Perceptions of COVID-19 risk after the vaccination campaign. 2. Materials and Methods [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00007)]. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of the High Institute of Public Health, Alexandria University on 28 June 2022 and was conducted according to the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki. Participation in this study was completely voluntary. Written consent was applied at the beginning of the questionnaire, which must be approved before answering. Confidentiality and privacy of all collected data were preserved, and the personal data were securely stored and only accessible to the statistician. 2.1. Study Design, Setting, and Participants [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00007)] ( [Appendix A](#app2-vaccines-11-00007)). Students from private medical schools, students from other medical faculties such as veterinary medicine, and non-medical students were not included in this survey. Convenience sampling was employed using an online self-administered questionnaire hosted on the QuestionPro platform. The questionnaire link was shared on the official educational communication groups of all medical classes. As Egypt adopted an online approach in higher education after the COVID-19 pandemic, it was expected that all students routinely access their classes' official groups and subsequently have equal chances to access our questionnaire. 2.2. Variables 2.3. Data Sources and Measures - 1. - Standard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak: [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00007)]. We adopted three sections of the questionnaire that covered three aspects, i.e., - Perception of the seriousness of the disease (two items); - Extent of anxiety and perception of the susceptibility to the disease (four items); - Perceived controllability and self-efficacy of preventive measures (eight items). - 2. - Adherence to Preventive Measures: [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00007)]. In addition, we included another six items used in previous studies on the same population [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00007), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00007)]. Adherence to these measures was reported on a 5-point Likert scale from never (1 point) to always (5 points). The total adherence score was the sum of the 14 items with a range of 14-70. Students with a score 49 (70% of total score) were considered adherent to protective measures. We conducted a reliability analysis, which showed a Cronbach's = 0.865, ensuring that the questionnaire was reliable in this population. 2.4. Pilot [Supplementary File S1](#app1-vaccines-11-00007)). 2.5. Bias - We estimated that the minimum completion time of the questionnaire was 150 s, so any response with less completion time was regarded as a careless response and, therefore, was excluded. - Duplication of responses was prevented using the IP address. - Data of the pilot study were excluded from the final analysis reported in this manuscript. 2.6. Sample Size and Power Calculation [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00007)]. The sample size was calculated to detect an adherence rate of 28.1%, as reported in the literature [ [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00007)]. To detect this adherence rate with a 95% confidence level and a 2.5% margin of error, a minimum sample size of 1224 is required. To account for the non-random sample, a design effect of 1.5 was applied. Finally, a minimum sample of 1836 students were included in this study. The sample size was calculated using EpiInfo 7.2.3.0 software according to the methods of Fahim and Negida [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00007)]. 2.7. Statistical Methods 3. Results 3.1. Sociodemographic Characteristics [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00007-t001)). 3.2. Risk Perception toward COVID-19 3.2.1. Perception of Seriousness [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00007-t002)). 3.2.2. The Extent of Anxiety and Perception of Susceptibility 3.2.3. Perceived Controllability and Self-Efficacy of Preventive Measures [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00007-t002)). 3.3. Protective Behaviors 3.3.1. Protective Behavior Following Vaccination [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00007-t003)). The median score of protective behavior was 43 (36-50). Only 545 (28.9%) students were considered adherent to protective measures. Universities showed different scores (p < 0.001). However, all universities' scores were less than 49 (70% of the total score). 3.3.2. The Factors That Influence COVID-19 Protective Behaviors [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00007-t001), our univariate analysis indicated that females were more adherent to protective measures (p < 0.001). Fully vaccinated students who received the booster dose showed a better protective behavior than others (p = 0.043). [Table 4](#vaccines-11-00007-t004)). 4. Discussion 4.1. Key Results 4.2. Significance of the Study 4.3. Agreement and Disagreement with Previous Studies [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00007)]. [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00007)]. Similarly, most recent studies by Corea on the Italian population and Qin on Chinese medical students following vaccination recorded a reduction in adherence to protective behavior, mainly with risky social activities [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00007), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00007)]. This is inconsistent with the high adherence rate reported by Soltan's in Egypt, Taghrir in Iran, and Baniyas in in 2020 [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00007), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00007), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00007)]. [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00007), [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00007)]. In the same context, our results are in line with Kasemy's study on the Egyptian community in 2020, who found that participants from rural settings showed higher protective practices rather than urban residents [ [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00007)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00007)]. 4.4. Strength Points and Limitations - Multicenter national study; - Large sample size; - Conducted after vaccination; - Conducted on medical students; - Validated measure (2 questionnaires). 4.5. Interpretation (Implications for Public Health) [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00007)]. Another explanation was given by Wong who stated that vaccinated people have a higher dread risk of infection [ [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00007)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00007)]. In addition, the high vaccination coverage in our sample may urge students to return to their normal social life as they perceive they are protected by the vaccine. This is in line with Okamoto's recent study on the change in student and academic staff attitudes following vaccination [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00007)]. This behavior has been recently highlighted by the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies who refer to it as \"risk compensation\", which occurs usually when people feel they are no longer suspected to be infected, due to vaccination [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00007)]. 4.6. Generalizability 5.
