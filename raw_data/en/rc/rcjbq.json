The current programme of research focuses on the biological mechanisms underlying this hypothesis, exploring early-life environmental influ- ences on immune development and the long-term functional consequences these influences may have. Results obtained to date show that thymus development during infancy is critically sensitive to environmental exposures, with smaller thymuses observed in the hungry season. Measurement of the frequency of T-cell receptor excision circles indicate that thymus function is also sensitive to seasonal influences, with further studies implicating variations in breast-milk IL-7 as a possible mediator of these effects. Studies in adults have shown that size at birth is positively correlated with antibody responses to vaccination with polysaccharide antigens, thus providing evidence for long-term functional decits. The present paper will review progress made to date within this eld of research. Gambia: Immune function: Programming: Thymus: Vaccine response In rural Gambia many aspects of health and behaviour are dened by the distinct seasonal pattern, with a long dry season from November to June followed by a period ofintense rainfall lasting from July to October. In brief, the dry 'harvest' season is characterised by low levels of active infections (Brewster & Greenwood, 1993) and periodsof good growth in infants and children (Ulijaszek &Strickland, 1993), and a period of positive energy balance is observed in all adults. This positive energy balance comes as a result of adequate food supplies from theprevious year's harvest coupled with reduced farming activities in the absence of rainfall (Singh et al . 1989). Conversely, the annual rains (the 'hungry' season) bringabout an increase in levels of infections (specicallymalaria and diarrhoeal disease) and poor growth during infancy, and a negative energy balance is observed in all adults as a direct consequence of depleted food suppliescoupled with intensive agricultural activity. Pregnant women are not exempt from these effects, which lead to seasonal patterns in pregnancy weight gains (Prenticeet al. 1981), length of gestation (Rayco-Solon et al. 2005 b) and birth weight (Rayco-Solon et al . 2005 a). It is known that much of the observed seasonal decit in birth weight is nutritional in origin, since it is reversed by maternaldietary supplementation (Ceesay et al . 1997). Season of birth in this part of rural Africa can therefore be used as a proxy indicator of early-life exposures to both nutritionaland infectious stresses.

Initial interest in this eld was fuelled by epidemi- ological observations of associations between geographical patterns in social conditions in early life and mortalityfrom chronic disease in adulthood (Barker & Osmond, 1986), and the active research that followed these obser- vations has led to the 'developmental origins of healthand disease' hypothesis. Much of the research within this eld has relied on the long-term preservation of detailed records of birth, growth and death, with three cohorts fromHertfordshire, Preston and Shefeld in the UK paving theway for a number of key early publications (Barker, 1994). The main observations from these initial studies then pre- cipitated a number of research programmes around theworld that have utilised long-held demographic and birth records to explore the long-term consequences of early-life exposures. The authors' contribution to this eld started with a serendipitous observation arising from a combination of long-term demographic record keeping and the 'experi-ment of nature' created by the strong seasonality described earlier. Since the late 1940s the UK Medical Research Council has maintained a demographic record of all resi-dents from three villages in the rural West Kiang regionof The Gambia. In light of the growing interest in the long- term effects of early-life exposures, these records have been used to look at survival according to events in earlylife, using season of birth as a proxy measure for early-life exposures (Moore et al . 1997, 1999). The Kaplan-Meier survival plots in Fig. 1 illustrate the profound bias that wasobserved in survival, with individuals born in the annual hungry season having rates of mortality in young adult- hood that are up to 10-fold higher than those of their counter- parts born in the harvest season. Using clinic and hospitalrecords, where they were available, or verbal autopsy data for missing cases, cause-of-death information reveals an absence of deaths from chronic degenerative diseases andan excess of infectious or infection-related deaths. This nding led to the hypothesis that early-life exposures, correlated with season of birth, have compromised immunedevelopment, resulting in later decits in function and ultimately survival. There are a number of seasonally- related factors that could potentially disrupt early immu-nological development, including a variety of nutritional,infectious or toxic exposures. However, it has been argued elsewhere (Moore et al . 1999; Prentice et al . 1999) that there is strong evidence that within this setting the mostlikely aetiology of the observed effect on survival is nutritional in origin, and a programme of work is currently exploring this aspect in detail. Programming the immune system Evidence to support the hypothesis that the human immune system may be programmed by nutritional deciencies during early life starts with the knowledge that many of theprinciple components of the immune system develop in fetal life; for example, the release of T-cells from the fetal thymus occurs as early as weeks 14-15 of gestation.Indeed, by 15-16 weeks the architecture of the human fetal thymus resembles that of the neonate (Klein & Horejsi, 1997). Specic nutritional deciencies occurring duringthese critical periods of development could, therefore, havelong-term immunological consequences. Indeed, maternal malnutrition has been observed to have greater effects on thymic and lymphoid tissue development than on otherorgans (Winick & Noble, 1966; Owens & Owens, 1989), presumably reflecting a physiological mechanism to pro- tect the growth and development of other specic organs,such as the brain. In addition, there is evidence to demonstrate that such decits in organ growth and devel- opment occurring in utero are more serious and longer lasting than those caused by later malnutrition (Beach et al. 1982). The evidence to support the long-term consequences of these early insults comes from data that suggest thatlow-birth-weight infants may have sustained impairment of immune competence as infants and children when assessed by various in vitro methods. However, such ndings are not universal (Pittard et al . 1984) and much debate now surrounds the validity of many of these early studies. It is well known, however, that intrauterine growth retardationleads to an increased susceptibility to infections in child- hood (Ashworth, 1998), with data from Brazil showing hazards ratios for infectious deaths rising as high as 5.0 (Victora et al. 1988). Direct evidence to support the long-term programming of the human immune system is, however, limited to a small number of published studies in adolescents andadults.

Hazard ratios for mortality: for adults aged 20 years, 10 .3 (P=0.00002); for adults aged 15 years, 3 .7(P=0.000013). (From Moore et al. 1999, reproduced with permission.)312 S. E. Moore et al. https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2006503 Published online by Cambridge University PressPhilippines (the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey), McDade and colleagues (McDade et al. 2001 a,b, 2004) have demonstrated associations between early growth and thymopoeitin production (McDade et al . 2001 b), antibody response to vaccination (McDade et al . 2001 a) and serum IgE levels (McDade et al. 2004) during adolescence. Of interest, all these relationships onlybecome signicant when adjusted for contemporary factors such as adolescent BMI or household sanitary conditions, suggesting an interaction between the fetal environmentand later-life exposures in programming the immune sys- tem. Studies in adults appear limited to two papers from the UK showing relationships between impaired fetalgrowth and elevated levels of thyroid auto-antibodies(Phillips et al . 1993) or serum IgE levels at ages 50-70 years (Godfrey et al . 1994). Despite these differing out- come measures, the reports of these studies include withintheir conclusions the suggestion that these associations may indicate the long-term functional consequences of an early insult to the thymus. This area is now being investi-gated in more detail. Early programming of the thymus The thymus is a likely programming target because its development commences during early fetal life and itreaches its maximum size in relation to total body weight soon after birth. Furthermore, the thymus is central to the development of controlled adaptive immunity, as it playsa crucial role in the development of T-cells by providing the microenvironment in which bone marrow-derived pro- genitors undergo proliferation, T-cell receptor rearrange-ment and thymocyte differentiation into mature T-cells(Madhok et al. 2005). By the time of delivery the thymus is almost fully developed. It increases in weight over the rst 6 months of life, after which time it begins to shrinkin size. This shrinkage is associated with a concomitant decrease in the production of new T-cells, and it has long been assumed that this decrease in production iscorrelated with a reduction in the functional capacity of the thymus. However, the advent of more advanced methods for the assessment of thymus output has led torecent evidence that the role of the thymus continues beyond this time point (Mackall et al. 1995; et al. . 2004; Madhok et al . 2005). Although early data from a prospective study in Danishinfants fail to show any association between thymus size at birth and childhood allergic disease (Benn et al. 2001), evidence is now emerging from the authors' group andother groups that supports the long-term consequences of an early insult to the fetal thymus. Postnatal thymus development can be assessed sono- graphically using a validated method in which the trans- verse diameter of the thymus and the sagittal area of its largest lobe are multiplied to give a volume-related thymicindex. This index has been shown to correlate with thymusweight at autopsy (Hasselbalch et al . 1996 b). Using this technique Hasselbalch et al . (1996 a) have shown that formula-fed Danish infants have a reduced thymus sizeas compared with breast-fed infants. Furthermore, a studyfrom Guinea-Bissau in west Africa has shown that a small thymus at birth predicts an increase in risk of infection- related mortality in infancy (Aaby et al . 2002). As all deaths in this population group were found to be frominfectious diseases, thymus size at birth may be an impor- tant predictor of postnatal immune competence. This sonographic technique has been used to assess thymusdevelopment in infants from The Gambia and from Bangladesh. Thymus development in The Gambia In The Gambia thymus development has been assessed in a prospective cohort of 138 infants recruited prenatally and followed until 52 weeks of age. Thymus size was assessed in infants at 1, 8, 24 and 52 weeks of age, together with thecollection of growth and morbidity data. In relation to absolute size, mean thymic index increases dramatically up to 24 weeks of age, and then decreases to the measurementtaken at 52 weeks (Collinson et al . 2003). At all ages thymic index is strongly associated with current weight (P\u00a30.001), and in proportion to body size mean thymic index is greatest at 1 week, decreasing to the 52-weekmeasurement. In addition, the results also show that infants have a characteristic thymic index, with tracking of thymus growth that is at least partially distinct from the postnataleffects of season and body weight. In relation to an early- life programming effect, thymic index at 1 and 8 weeks is associated with birth weight, but this relationship doesnot persist after adjusting for current weight. However, as is illustrated in Fig. 2, there is a seasonal effect on thymus size, with the smallest thymuses, from week 1 onwards,being observed in the hungry season after adjustment forinfant weight (Collinson et al. 2003). The functional consequence of the observed seasonal effect on thymus size is not yet fully understood. Recentdata from Denmark show a correlation between thymic index at 10 months of age and CD8 +cell counts (Jeppesen et al . 2004), but further follow-up data on cohorts with early thymus size estimates are not yet available. In order to address this question in the Gambian cohort, T- lymphocyte populations and subpopulations have beenassessed in parallel to the measurement of thymus size. Table 1 shows the key ndings from this analysis. As illustrated, geometric mean cord and postnatal lymphocytecounts are higher in births occurring in the hungry season,with both season of birth and season of measurement effects. Absolute CD3 +(all T-cells), CD8 +and CD56 + (natural killer) in hungry-seasonbirths, but absolute CD4 +counts and CD19 +(B-cells) counts show no association with birth season (Collinson, 2002). These results demonstrate a seasonal influence oncell counts that is present in cord blood (indicating in utero responses), is sustained at least over the rst year of life and is not explained by current nutritional status (datanot presented), possibly indicating long-term decits incellular function. The precise mechanisms for these observed seasonal effects on cell numbers, and the role that the apparent seasonal impact on thymus size may have,requires further investigation.Nutrition and developmental immunology 313 https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2006503 Published online by Cambridge University PressIn the absence of a direct marker for the accurate quantication of recent thymic emigrants, thymus output can be assessed by measuring the frequency of signal-jointT-cell receptor-rearrangement excision circles (sjTREC). These sjTREC represent the extrachromosomal excision products that are formed by the excision of DNA duringrecombination events in the genome to produce the a chain of the T-cell receptor in the thymus, and hence quantication of the frequency of sjTREC levels is anindirect measure of thymus output. To assess seasonal influences on thymus output during infancy sjTREC levelswere measured in blood samples collected from infants in the Gambian study at birth and 8 weeks of age. Despite considerable monthly variation, those infants born in theharvest season were found to have signicantly higher sjTREC levels than those born in the hungry season (2.12 v.0.92 sjTREC/100 T-cells, P=0.006) at week 8 but not at birth (N'Gom et al . 2004). Although the use of sjTREC levels as a marker for absolute thymus function has been questioned (Hazenberg et al . 2003), it can be argued that this nding implies that the higher sjTRECcounts in infants born in the harvest season indicates a greater number of recent thymic emigrants, when com- pared with infants born in the hungry season, correspond-ing to the observed decit in thymus size. It is of interest that the greatest difference in thymus size is observed when the infants are 8 weeks of age. Thisnding is surprising, since at this age infants in this com- munity are fully breast-fed, are growing well and have minimal incidence of active infections.

Moore et al. https://doi.org/10.1079/PNS2006503 Published online by Cambridge University Pressa number of key antimicrobial factors in breast milk, with breast milk collected in the late rainy season containing 35% less IgA and IgG and 20% less secretory component and lysozyme (Prentice et al . 1984). In addition, these differences are accompanied by a slight fall in milk pro- duction during the rainy season. The observed decit in thymus size in infants when measured in the hungry seasoncould therefore reflect a deciency of a specic component in breast milk. Indeed, this conjecture is supported by the observations from Denmark described earlier that suggestthat breast-feeding promotes thymus development (Has- selbalch et al. 1996 a). Whilst the role that immune factors in breast milk have on passive immunity is clearly estab-lished (Hanson et al. 2003), the influence that these factors may have on adaptive responses is less clearly understood. It is also well established that breast milk is a medium for a wide range of hormonal and cytokine signals, and thecandidate factors that have already been identied include leptin, epidermal growth factor, Goldman, 1998; Hawkes et al . 1999). It is therefore plausible that seasonal variations in such factors may play a role in influencing the differentialdevelopment of the human thymus during the early post-natal period. Recent work in The Gambia in relation to these obser- vations has focused on the potential role of the cytokineIL-7, which is known to be essential for normal thymocyte development and for the proliferation and survival of precursor T-cells (Suda & Zlotnik, 1991; Morrissey et al . 1994). However, until the study of N'Gom et al. (2004) no published evidence has existed in the literature to report the presence or variation of IL-7 in human breast milk;hence, the functional consequence of this factor, if any, is not understood. Using stored samples of breast milk from Collinson's (Collinson, 2002; Collinson et al . 2003) pro- cohort study described earlier, IL-7 levelshave been quantied in samples collected at 1 and 8 weeks post partum. Despite considerable monthly variation IL-7 levels were found to be signicantly lower in breast-milksamples collected at 1 week post partum in the hungry season compared with those collected in the harvest season (7 pg/ml v. 10 pg/ml, P=0.02; N'Gom et al . 2004). A similar, but non-signicant, trend was found in the samples collected at 8 weeks post partum. The precise functional role of IL-7 in human breast milk requires further investi-gation, but this observation suggests that seasonally- variable exposures may exert direct effects on breast-milk composition, which may in turn be responsible for theobserved seasonal differences in thymus size and function. Thymus development in rural Bangladesh In an attempt to further understand these observations from The Gambia, thymus development has been assessedwithin a large-scale study of combined interventions toimprove maternal and infant health in the rural Matlab region of Bangladesh (the MINIMat study). Within the MINIMat study all pregnant women were randomised toreceive a combination of prenatal protein-energy andmicronutrient supplements. The prenatal arm of the study was completed in June 2004 with a total of 3282 singletoninfants born. All key ndings from the main study in relation to birth weight and the other primary outcomes will be reported elsewhere. Within the MINIMat study, thymus development has been assessed during the rst year of infancy in a large subgroup of infants to look more specically at prenatal and postnatal influences on thymus development. Inapproximately 1750 infants thymus size was assessed by ultrasonography at weeks 8, 24 and 52, with sonographers trained according to the same techniques as those used inThe Gambia. In addition, infants who were born in health facilities ( n1173) had an additional measurement made at day 1 of age. Fig. 3 illustrates absolute thymic index andthymic index:body weight by age at measurement. As in The Gambia, absolute thymus size increases rapidly from the measurement at birth to the measurement at 24 weeksof age, decreasing to the 52-week measurement. Thymussize relative to body weight shows a constant decrease from the measurement taken at birth to the nal measure- ment taken at 52 weeks of age. Analysis of the data isongoing, but preliminary observations support the previous observations from The Gambia, suggesting that thymus size in Bangladeshi infants is also influenced by both sea-sonally-related factors and by exposures early in life, as measured by birth weight. Further work in this large cohort of well-characterised Bangladeshi infants will also explorethe functional implications of these differences in thymussize. Long-term functional consequences of early undernutrition As highlighted earlier, evidence linking fetal growth to a direct measure of functional decits in later immune2025303540455055 1 8 10 20 24 30 40 50 52 60 Age (w eeks)TI 567891011 TI:infant weight Fig. 3.

In this study the predicted probability of mounting an adequate anti- body response to the Vi vaccine was found to be lower(P=0.023) in adolescents who were both prenatally and currently undernourished (0.32) compared with ade- quately-nourished adolescents (0.49-0.70; McDade et al . 2001 a). This observation has subsequently been replicated in a cohort of adults in Lahore, Pakistan (Moore et al . 2004). In the early 1960s an urban slum settlement inLahore was selected for a community-based follow upof infant health. Between 1964 and 1978 a total of 2468 infants were recruited into this study and followed partly longitudinally into childhood (Jalil et al . 1989). These subjects are now adults and have recently been traced for follow up in a study looking at the effect of poverty, early- life malnutrition and infections on adult health and mor-tality. In parallel to the main follow up a selected cohort of 257 of the adults from this cohort (mean age 29.4 years; 146 males) has participated in a study of early-life pre-dictors of adult immune function that used a variety ofmeasures including response to vaccination. Each subject received a single dose of the same Vi vaccine as that used in the Philippines study of McDade et al. (2001 a) and two doses of rabies vaccine. Antibody titres were measured on pre-vaccination (Vi only) and post-vaccination serum samples (Vi and rabies). Vaccine responses were not foundto be consistently associated with any of the contemporary adult variables measured, including month of study, gender, current age and indicators of socio-economicstatus. However, both anti-Vi IgG and IgM antibody responses to the Vi vaccine were found to be signicantly related to birth weight, with a lower antibody responseobserved in subjects who had a lower birth weight (for theanti-Vi IgG antibody response, P=0.031; for the anti-Vi IgM antibody response, P=0.034; Fig. 4). The antibody response to the rst dose and the second dose of the rabiesvaccine, however, was not found to be associated with birth weight. The contrasting effects on typhoid and rabies responses observed in this study seem to suggest that theantibody generation to polysaccharide antigens, which are T-cell-independent antigens, is compromised by fetal growth retardation. A follow up of these adults has recently been carried out to see if the impaired ability of lower-birth-weight subjects to mount an adequate antibody response to vaccination ismaintained following a subsequent follow-up dose of thesame vaccine. Pre-vaccination antibody titres were found to be strongly correlated with post-vaccination titres from the previous study ( r0.832), with geometric mean antibody titres increasing from 2 .86 (95% CI 2 .38, 3 .46) ELISA units before vaccination to 5.10 (95% CI 4.28, 6.09) ELISA units 21 d post vaccination ( P\u00a30.0001). Of key interest, this second dose of the same vaccine was not observed to overcome the decit observed in the previous study, and post-vaccination antibody titres remained posi-tively correlated with birth weight ( P=0.0284). In the same study a single dose of a conjugated Haemophilis Bpolysaccharide-conjugate vaccine was also administered. No signicant associations were observed between size at birth and antibody responses to this vaccine. This lack of a response to the polysaccharide conjugate, together withthe continued failure of lower-birth-weight subjects torespond to the Vi vaccine supports the suggestion of a possible defect in processes leading to the antibody gen- eration to T-cell-independent antigens. An ongoing studyin The Gambia is exploring whether this defect is unique to the Vi vaccine, or whether antibody responses to other polysaccharide vaccines are also correlated with exposuresearly in life. Taken alongside the observations from The Gambia, these ndings add another level of complexity, and suggestthat more than one component of the immune system could be impaired by early-life nutritional insults. Further studies will aim to elucidate the functional mechanisms for thisobserved impairment in antibody response in individualswho have a lower birth weight. Conclusions Evidence is accumulating to suggest that nutritional de- ciencies during prenatal or early postnatal life may disrupt the development of the human immune system, resulting infunctional decits later in life. Such decits may ultimately be linked to an increase in the risk of premature mortality from infectious disease. Whilst much of the data reportedin the current paper comes from resource-poor countries, in which infectious diseases still contribute to a large pro- portion of deaths, the ndings may have implicationsfor the aetiology of other immune-related outcomes, suchas allergy, autoimmune diseases and cancer immuno- surveillance. Further research is therefore required to help understand the true relationship between early-life nutri-tional status and later immune function.2\u00b782\u00b793\u00b703\u00b713\u00b723\u00b733\u00b743\u00b753\u00b76 IgG IgM Anti-Vi antibody levelsBirth weight (kg) Fig. 4.
