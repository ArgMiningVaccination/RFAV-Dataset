The Congress finds as follows: (1) The population of racial and ethnic minorities is expected to increase over the next few decades, yet racial and ethnic minorities have the poorest health status and face substantial cultural, social, and economic barriers to obtaining quality health care. (2) Health disparities are a function of not only access to health care, but also the social determinants of health-- including the environment, the physical structure of communities, nutrition and food options, educational attainment, employment, race, ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, immigrant or citizenship status, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability status--that directly and indirectly affect the health, health care, and wellness of individuals and communities. (3) By 2020, the Nation will face a shortage of health care providers and allied health workers and this shortage disproportionately affects health professional shortage areas where many racial and ethnic minority populations reside. (4) All efforts to reduce health disparities and barriers to quality health services require better and more consistent data. (5) A full range of culturally and linguistically appropriate health care and public health services must be available and accessible in every community. (6) Racial and ethnic minorities and underserved populations must be included early and equitably in health reform innovations. (7) Efforts to improve minority health have been limited by inadequate resources in funding, staffing, stewardship, and accountability. Targeted investments that are focused on disparities elimination must be made in providing care and services that are community-based, including prevention and policies addressing social determinants of health. (8) In 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services developed the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and the National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity, two strategic plans that represent the country's first coordinated roadmap to reducing health disparities. Along with the National Prevention Strategy, Healthy People 2020, and the National Health Care Quality Strategy, as well as critical resources such as the 2012 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports, these comprehensive plans will work to increase the number of Americans who are healthy at every stage of life. (9) The Department of Health and Human Services has also reviewed and advanced updated clinical guidelines and developed other strategic planning documents-- (A) to combat health disparities with a high impact on minority populations including the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis; and (B) to provide high-quality family planning services including recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Population Affairs. (10) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, represents the biggest advancement for minority health in the last 40 years. TITLE I--DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING SEC. 101. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to promote data collection, analysis, and reporting by race, ethnicity, sex, primary language, sexual orientation, disability status, gender identity, and socioeconomic status among federally supported health programs.

TITLE II--CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE SEC. 201. DEFINITIONS. In this title, the definitions contained in section 3400 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by section 202, shall apply. SEC. 202. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Effective communication is essential to meaningful access to quality physical and mental health care. (2) Research indicates that the lack of appropriate language services creates language barriers that result in increased risk of misdiagnosis, ineffective treatment plans and poor health outcomes for limited-English-proficient individuals and individuals with communication disabilities such as hearing, vision, or print impairments. (3) The number of limited-English-speaking residents in the United States who speak English less than very well and, therefore, cannot effectively communicate with health and social service providers continues to increase significantly. (4) The responsibility to fund language services in the provision of health care and health-care-related services to limited-English-proficient individuals and individuals with communication disabilities such as hearing, vision, or print impairments is a societal one that cannot fairly be visited solely upon the health care, public health, or social services community. (5) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on the grounds of race, color, or national origin by any entity receiving Federal financial assistance. In order to avoid discrimination on the grounds of national origin, all programs or activities administered by the Department must take adequate steps to ensure that their policies and procedures do not deny or have the effect of denying limited-English-proficient individuals with equal access to benefits and services for which such persons qualify. (6) Both the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and require the provision of appropriate auxiliary aids and services necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities. The type of auxiliary aid or service necessary to ensure effective communication will vary in accordance with the method of communication used by the individual; the nature, length, and complexity of the communication involved; and the context in which the communication is taking place. A public accommodation should consult with individuals with disabilities whenever possible to determine what type of auxiliary aid is needed to ensure effective communication, but the ultimate decision as to what measures to take rests with the public accommodation, provided that the method chosen results in effective communication. In order to be effective, auxiliary aids and services must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and in such a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual with a disability. (7) Linguistic diversity in the health care and health- care-related-services workforce is important for providing all patients the environment most conducive to positive health outcomes. (8) All members of the health care and health-care-related- services community should continue to educate their staff and constituents about limited-English-proficient and disability communication issues and help them identify resources to improve access to quality care for limited-English-proficient individuals and individuals with communication disabilities such as hearing, vision, or print impairments. (9) Access to English as a second language, and sign language instructions, readers, and other auxiliary aids and services, are essential to ensure effective communication and eliminate the language barriers that impede access to health care. (10) Competent language services in health care settings should be available as a matter of course.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and other expert entities, such as the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), have indicated a nationwide shortage of up to 104,900 physicians, split evenly between primary care and specialists, by 2030. (2) Primarily due to the growing and aging population, over the next decade, physician demand is expected to grow up to 17 percent. (3) The United States Census Bureau estimates that the United States population will grow from 321 million in 2015 to 347 million in 2025. Further, the number of Medicare beneficiaries is estimated to increase from 47.8 million in 2015 to approximately 66 million in 2025. (4) Approximately 36 percent of practicing physicians are over the age of 55 and are likely to retire within the next decade. (5) A nationwide physician shortage will result in many Americans waiting longer and traveling farther for health care; seeking nonemergent care in emergency departments; and delaying treatment until their health care needs become more serious, complex, and costly. (6) Changing demographics (such as an aging population), new health care delivery models (such as medical homes), and other factors (such as disaster preparedness) are contributing to a shortage of both generalist and specialist physicians. (7) These shortages will have the most severe impact on vulnerable and underserved populations, including racial/ethnic minorities and the approximately 20 percent of Americans who live in rural or inner-city locations designated as health professional shortage areas. (8) The AAMC's Health Care Utilization Equity model estimates that if racial and ethnic minorities and individuals from rural areas utilized health care in a similar way to their Caucasian counterparts living in metropolitan areas, the physician shortage would require an additional 96,000 physicians. (9) To address the physician shortage, medical education and training need to be accessible for students and physicians from all backgrounds. International graduates play an important role in U.S. health care, representing roughly 25 percent of the health care workforce. Immigration pathways like student, exchange-visitor, and employment visas, and programs like the National Interest Waiver and Conrad 30 J-1 Visa Waiver, help improve health access across the country. (10) United States medical schools have committed to and have initiated a 30 percent increase in enrollment by 2017 to help reduce the Nation's shortage of quality physicians. (11) An increase in United States medical school graduates must be accompanied by an increase of 4,000 graduate medical education (GME) training positions each year. (12) Graduate medical education programs and teaching hospitals provide venues in which the next generation of physicians learns to work collaboratively with other physicians and health professionals, adopt more efficient care delivery models (such as care coordination and medical homes), incorporate health information technology and electronic health records in every aspect of their work, apply new methods of assuring quality and safety, and participate in groundbreaking clinical and public health research. (13) The Medicare Program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (having more beneficiaries than any other health care program), supports its ``fair share'' of the costs associated with graduate medical education (GME). (14) In general, the level of support of graduate medical education by the Medicare Program has been capped since 1997 and has not been increased to support the expansion of graduate medical education programs needed to avert the projected physician shortage or to accommodate the increase in United States medical school graduates. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that eliminating the limit of the number of residency positions that receive some level of Medicare support under section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)), also referred to as the Medical graduate medical education cap, is critical to-- (1) ensuring an appropriate supply of physicians to meet the Nation's health care needs; (2) facilitating equitable access for all who seek health care; and (3) mitigating disparities in health and health care. SEC. 313. CAREER SUPPORT FOR SKILLED, INTERNATIONALLY EDUCATED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) According to the Association of Schools of Public Health, projections indicate a nationwide shortage of up to 250,000 public health workers needed by 2020. (2) Similar trends are projected for other health professions indicating shortages across disciplines, including within the fields of nursing (500,000 by 2025), dentistry (15,000 by 2025), pharmacy (38,000 by 2030), mental and behavioral health, primary care (46,000 by 2025), and community and allied health. (3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will result in serious health threats and more severe and costly health care needs, due to, in part, a delayed response to food-borne outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, fewer cancer screenings, and delayed treatment. (4) Vulnerable and underserved populations and health professional shortage areas will be most severely impacted by the health workforce shortage. (5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, over 2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in the United States today are unemployed or underemployed in low- or semi-skilled jobs that fail to draw on their education and expertise. (6) Approximately 2 out of every 5 internationally educated immigrants are unemployed or underemployed. (7) According to Drexel University Center for Labor Markets and Policy, underemployment for internationally educated immigrant women is 28 percent higher than for their male counterparts. (8) According to the Drexel University Center for labor markets and policy, the mean annual earnings of underemployed immigrants were $32,000, or 43 percent less than United States born college graduates employed in the college labor market. (9) According to Upwardly Global and the Welcome Back Initiative, with proper guidance and support, underemployed skilled immigrants typically increase their income by 215 percent to 900 percent. (10) According to the Brookings Institution and the Partnership for a New American Economy, immigrants working in the health workforce are, on average, better educated than United States-born workers in the health workforce. (b) Grants to Eligible Entities.-- (1) Authority to provide grants.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services acting through the Bureau of Health Workforce within the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, or the Office of Minority Health (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') may award grants to eligible entities to carry out activities described in subsection (c). (2) Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant under this section, an entity shall-- (A) be a clinical, public health, or health services organization, a community-based or nonprofit entity, an academic institution, a faith-based organization, a State, county, or local government, an Area Health Education Center, or another entity determined appropriate by the Secretary; and (B) submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. (c) Authorized Activities.--A grant awarded under this section shall be used-- (1) to provide services to assist unemployed and underemployed skilled immigrants, residing in the United States, who have legal, permanent work authorization and who are internationally educated health professionals, enter into the American health workforce with employment matching their health professional skills and education, and advance in employment to positions that better match their health professional education and expertise; (2) to provide training opportunities to reduce barriers to entry and advancement in the health workforce for skilled, internationally educated immigrants; (3) to educate employers regarding the abilities and capacities of internationally educated health professionals; (4) to assist in the evaluation of foreign credentials; (5) to support preceptorships for international medical graduates in hospital primary care training; and (6) to facilitate access to contextualized and accelerated courses on English as a second language.

Subtitle C--Advancing Health Equity Through Payment and Delivery Reform SEC. 441. SENSE OF CONGRESS. It is the Sense of Congress that the sustainability of the U.S. health care system hinges on restructuring how health care is paid for, shifting away from paying for the volume of services provided to the value the services provide. High value care is care that provides higher quality care more efficiently, achieving greater health improvement and better health outcomes at lower cost (per patient and overall). A high value health care system must deliver timely, accessible, well-coordinated, high quality, culturally centered, and language appropriate care to everyone. Therefore, eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity must be central to efforts to achieve a high value health care system. This will require tailored interventions and targeted investments to address inequities in health and health care to make sure that health care delivery and payment efforts are responsive to and inclusive of the needs of communities of color and other communities experiencing disparities. New models of value-based payment and care delivery should consider the holistic needs of the patient population, including social determinants of health and behavioral health needs. SEC. 442. CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES QUALITY PAYMENT PROGRAM. (a) In General.--The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Quality Payment Program, developed through implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, should explicitly integrate ``achieving health equity'' across all measures and activities, including the Merit-based Payment Incentive System and Alternative Payment Models. In addition, CMS should identify limited- English proficient (LEP) persons as a specific underserved group within the program and give high weight to providing language services for non-English speakers. Clinicians can demonstrate performance in this category by developing language assistance plans, providing oral interpretation services, and providing translated documents for the population served or eligible to be served. (b) Stratified Data.--CMS should include an explicit reference that data stratification and reporting is one way of working to achieve health equity. CMS should require that in reporting this measure, clinicians should stratify clinical quality measures by disparity variables, including race, ethnicity, preferred language, disability status, sexual orientation, and gender identity, psychological and behavioral status. Clinicians can use existing demographic data collection fields in CEHRT to do this. Stratified data can help clinicians identify and distinguish efforts to improve quality from efforts to reduce disparities, which may not correlate without dedicated work. All participating entities in the Quality Payment Program should adopt 2015 Certified Electronic Health Records Technology as a condition of participating in the program. (c) Quality Improvement Activities.--Further, CMS, upon yearly review of the Quality Payment Program, should add quality improvement activities that implement the Culturally and Linguistically Accessible Standards (CLAS) standards as Improvement Activities. SEC. 443. DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF DISPARITY REDUCING DELIVERY AND PAYMENT MODELS. (a) In General.--The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Innovation (CMMI) will establish a dedicated fund to identify, pilot, evaluate and scale delivery and payment models that target health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities, including models that support high-value non-medical services that address socially-determined barriers to health including: English proficiency, health literacy, case management, transportation and enrollment assistance which will help to reduce disparities and impact the overall cost of care. (b) Pilot Programs.--Pilot and demonstration programs that include partnerships with entities including community based organizations or other non-profit entities to help address socially determined barriers to health and health care will be given priority. (c) Alternatives.--Require all CMMI funded alternative delivery and payment models to include measures to assess and track their impact on health disparities, using existing measures such as, but not limited to, the National Quality Forum Healthcare Disparities and Cultural Competency Measures, and stratified by race, ethnicity, English proficiency, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability status. SEC. 444. SUPPORTING SAFETY NET AND COMMUNITY-BASED PROVIDERS TO COMPETE IN VALUE-BASED PAYMENT SYSTEMS. (a) In General.--All proposed pay for performance and alternative payment models, developed and tested by CMMI, or any other HHS agency should be assessed for potential impact on safety net, community based, and critical access providers, including federally qualified health centers. (b) New Models.--The rollout of new payment models should include training and additional up front resources for community based and safety net providers to enable them to participate in them. Subtitle D--Health Empowerment Zones SEC. 451. SHORT TITLE. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Health Empowerment Zone Act of 2018''. SEC. 452. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Numerous studies and reports, including the 2015 National Healthcare Disparities Report of the Administration on Healthcare Research and Quality and the 2002 Unequal Treatment Report of the Institute of Medicine, document the extensiveness to which health disparities exist across the country. (2) These studies have found that, on average, racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately afflicted with chronic and acute conditions--such as cancer, diabetes, musculoskeletal disease, obesity, and hypertension--and suffer worse health outcomes, worse health status, and higher mortality rates than their White counterparts. (3) Several recent studies also show that health disparities are a function of not only access to health care, but also the social determinants of health--including the environment, the physical structure of communities, nutrition and food options, educational attainment and health literacy, employment, race, ethnicity, immigration status, geography, and language preference--that directly and indirectly affect the health, health care, and wellness of individuals and communities. (4) Integrally involving and fully supporting the communities most affected by health inequities in the assessment, planning, launch, and evaluation of health disparity elimination efforts are among the leading recommendations made to adequately address and ultimately reduce health disparities. (5) Recommendations also include supporting the efforts of community stakeholders from a broad cross section--including, but not limited to local businesses, local departments of commerce, education, labor, urban planning, and transportation, and community-based and other nonprofit organizations, including national and regional intermediaries with demonstrated capacity to serve low-income urban communities--to find areas of common ground around health disparity elimination and collaborate to improve the overall health and wellness of a community and its residents.

TITLE VI--MENTAL HEALTH SEC. 601. MENTAL HEALTH FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Despite the existence of effective treatments, disparities lie in the availability, accessibility, and quality of mental health services for racial and ethnic minorities. (2) These disparities have powerful significance for minority groups and for society as a whole. (3) Racial and ethnic minorities bear a greater burden from unmet mental health needs and thus suffer a greater loss to their overall health and productivity. (4) The foremost barriers include the cost of care, societal stigma, and the fragmented organization of services. (5) African American attitudes toward mental illness are another barrier to seeking mental health care. (6) Mental illness retains considerable stigma, and seeking treatment is not always encouraged. (7) Mental illness is highly stigmatizing in many Asian cultures. (8) Addressing mental health stigma in communities will help increase utilization of mental health services and reduce the burden of mental illness SEC. 602.

TITLE VII--ADDRESSING HIGH IMPACT MINORITY DISEASES Subtitle A--Cancer SEC. 701. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION. (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2018''. (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer deaths. (2) Lung cancer kills more people annually than breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer combined. (3) Since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92- 218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and comprehensive research has raised the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer to 88 percent, for prostate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon cancer to 64 percent. (4) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is still only 15 percent, and a similar coordinated and comprehensive research effort is required to achieve increases in lung cancer survivability rates. (5) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed as nonsmokers or former smokers. (6) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are women. (7) Certain minority populations, such as African American males, have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality, notwithstanding their similar smoking rate. (8) Members of the baby boomer generation are entering their sixties, the most common age at which people develop lung cancer. (9) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and battlefield emissions are serious problems among military personnel and war veterans. (10) Significant and rapid improvements in lung cancer mortality can be expected through greater use and access to lung cancer screening tests for at-risk individuals. (11) Recent research has shown that screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan improved lung cancer death mortality by 20 percent for those with a high risk of lung cancer through early detection. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services supports annual lung cancer screening for high-risk patients with low-dose computed tomography. (12) Additional strategies are necessary to further enhance the existing tests and therapies available to diagnose and treat lung cancer in the future. (13) The August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels characterized for other common malignancies and far out of proportion to its massive health impact''. (14) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather than around specific research disciplines. (15) The United States must enhance its response to the issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group, and this can be accomplished through the establishment of a coordinated effort designed to reduce the lung cancer mortality rate by 50 percent by 2020 and targeted funding to support this coordinated effort. (c) Sense of Congress Concerning Investment in Lung Cancer Research.--It is the sense of the Congress that-- (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a national public health priority; and (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified and necessary to adequately address and reduce lung cancer mortality. (d) Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program.-- (1) In general.--Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``SEC. 417H.

SEC. 702. EXPANDING PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, OUTREACH, SCREENING, TESTING, ACCESS, AND TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS. (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2018'' or the ``PROSTATE Act''. (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men. (2) In 2010, more than 217,730 new patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 32,000 men died from this disease. (3) Roughly 2,000,000 Americans are living with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and its consequences. (4) While prostate cancer generally affects older individuals, younger men are also at risk for the disease, and when prostate cancer appears in early middle age, it frequently takes on a more aggressive form. (5) There are significant racial and ethnic disparities that demand attention, namely African Americans have prostate cancer mortality rates that are more than double those in the White population. (6) Underserved rural populations have higher rates of mortality compared to their urban counterparts, and innovative and cost-efficient methods to improve rural access to high- quality care should take advantage of advances in telehealth to diagnose and treat prostate cancer when appropriate. (7) Certain veterans populations may have nearly twice the incidence of prostate cancer as the general population of the United States. (8) Urologists may constitute the specialists who diagnose and treat the vast majority of prostate cancer patients. (9) Although much basic and translational research has been completed and much is currently known, there are still many unanswered questions. For example, it is not fully understood how much of known disparities are attributable to disease etiology, access to care, or education and awareness in the community. (10) Causes of prostate cancer are not known. There is not good information regarding how to differentiate accurately, early on, between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease. As a result, there is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer. There are no treatments that can durably arrest growth or cure prostate cancer once it has metastasized. (11) A significant proportion (roughly 23 to 54 percent) of cases may be clinically indolent and ``overdiagnosed'', resulting in significant overtreatment. More accurate tests will allow men and their families to face less physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma, and billions of dollars could be saved in private and public health care systems in an area that has been identified by the Medicare Program as one of eight high-volume, high-cost areas in the Resource Utilization Report Program authorized by Congress under the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. (12) Prostate cancer research and health care programs across Federal agencies should be coordinated to improve accountability and actively encourage the translation of research into practice, to identify and implement best practices, in order to foster an integrated and consistent focus on effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. (c) Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education.-- (1) Interagency prostate cancer coordination and education task force.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force (in this section referred to as the ``Prostate Cancer Task Force''). (2) Duties.--The Prostate Cancer Task Force shall-- (A) develop a summary of advances in prostate cancer research supported or conducted by Federal agencies relevant to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of prostate cancer, including psychosocial impairments related to prostate cancer treatment, and compile a list of best practices that warrant broader adoption in health care programs; (B) consider establishing, and advocating for, a guidance to enable physicians to allow screening of men who are over age 74, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account quality of life and family history of prostate cancer; (C) share and coordinate information on Federal research and health care program activities, including activities related to-- (i) determining how to improve research and health care programs, including psychosocial impairments related to prostate cancer treatment; (ii) identifying any gaps in the overall research inventory and in health care programs; (iii) identifying opportunities to promote translation of research into practice; and (iv) maximizing the effects of Federal efforts by identifying opportunities for collaboration and leveraging of resources in research and health care programs that serve those susceptible to or diagnosed with prostate cancer; (D) develop a comprehensive interagency strategy and advise relevant Federal agencies in the solicitation of proposals for collaborative, multidisciplinary research and health care programs, including proposals to evaluate factors that may be related to the etiology of prostate cancer, that would-- (i) result in innovative approaches to study emerging scientific opportunities or eliminate knowledge gaps in research to improve the prostate cancer research portfolio of the Federal Government; (ii) outline key research questions, methodologies, and knowledge gaps; and (iii) ensure consistent action, as outlined by section 402(b) of the Public Health Service Act; (E) develop a coordinated message related to screening and treatment for prostate cancer to be reflected in educational and beneficiary materials for Federal health programs as such documents are updated; and (F) not later than 2 years after the date of the establishment of the Prostate Cancer Task Force, submit to the Expert Advisory Panel to be reviewed and returned within 30 days, and then within 90 days submitted to Congress recommendations-- (i) regarding any appropriate changes to research and health care programs, including recommendations to improve the research portfolio of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, and other Federal agencies to ensure that scientifically based strategic planning is implemented in support of research and health care program priorities; (ii) designed to ensure that the research and health care programs and activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other Federal agencies are free of unnecessary duplication; (iii) regarding public participation in decisions relating to prostate cancer research and health care programs to increase the involvement of patient advocates, community organizations, and medical associations representing a broad geographical area; (iv) on how to best disseminate information on prostate cancer research and progress achieved by health care programs; (v) about how to expand partnerships between public entities, including Federal agencies, and private entities to encourage collaborative, cross-cutting research and health care delivery; (vi) assessing any cost savings and efficiencies realized through the efforts identified and supported in this section and recommending expansion of those efforts that have proved most promising while also ensuring against any conflicts in directives from other congressional or statutory mandates or enabling statutes; (vii) identifying key priority action items from among the recommendations; and (viii) with respect to the level of funding needed by each agency to implement the recommendations contained in the report.

(4) Initial implementation.--The Secretary shall implement the reporting process under this subsection for reporting periods beginning not later than 6 months after the date that measures are first established under subsection (a). Subtitle B--Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention SEC. 711. VIRAL HEPATITIS AND LIVER CANCER CONTROL AND PREVENTION. (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention Act of 2018''. (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) In the United States, as many as 4,400,000 persons are living with the hepatitis B virus (referred to in this section as ``HBV'') or the hepatitis C virus (referred to in this section as ``HCV''). (2) In the United States, chronic HBV and HCV are the most common cause of liver cancer, one of the most lethal and fastest growing cancers in this country. It is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and the most common indication for liver transplantation. At least 21,000 deaths per year in the United States can be attributed to chronic HBV and HCV. Chronic HCV is also a leading cause of death in Americans living with HIV/AIDS; many of those living with HIV/AIDS are coinfected with chronic HBV, chronic HCV, or both. (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in this section as the ``CDC''), approximately 2 percent of the population of the United States is living with chronic HBV, chronic HCV, or both. The CDC has recognized HCV as the Nation's most common chronic bloodborne virus infection and HBV as the deadliest vaccine-preventable disease. (4) HBV is easily transmitted and is 100 times more infectious than HIV. According to the CDC, HBV is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, semen, or other body fluids. HCV is transmitted by contact with infectious blood, particularly through percutaneous exposures (i.e. puncture through the skin). (5) The CDC estimates that in 2015, approximately 33,900 Americans were newly infected with HCV and approximately 21,900 Americans were newly infected with HBV. These estimates could be much higher due to many reasons, including lack of screening education and awareness, and perceived marginalization of the populations at risk. (6) In 2012, CDC released new guidelines recommending every person born between 1945 and 1965 receive a one-time test. Among the estimated 102 million (1.6 million chronically HCV- infected) eligible for screening, birth-cohort screening leads to 84,000 fewer cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 46,000 fewer cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 10,000 fewer liver transplants, and 78,000 fewer HCV-related deaths gained versus risk-based screening. (7) In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a Grade B rating for screening for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in persons at high risk for infection and adults born between 1945 and 1965. In 2014, the USPSTF issued a Grade B for screening for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in persons at high-risk of hepatitis B infection. In 2009, the USPSTF issued a Grade A for screening pregnant women for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) during their first prenatal visit. (8) There were 59 outbreaks (24 of HBV and 36 of HCV, including one of both HBV and HCV) reported to CDC for investigation from 2008 through 2016 related to healthcare- associated infection of HBV and HCV, 56 of which occurred in nonhospital settings. There were more than 115,983 patients potentially exposed to one of the viruses. (9) Chronic HBV and chronic HCV usually do not cause symptoms early in the course of the disease, but after many years of a clinically ``silent'' phase, CDC estimates show more than 33 percent of infected individuals will develop cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or liver cancer. Since most individuals with chronic HBV, HCV, or both are unaware of their infection, they do not know to take precautions to prevent the spread of their infection and can unknowingly exacerbate their own disease progression. (10) HBV and HCV disproportionately affect certain populations in the United States. Although representing only about 5 percent of the population, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for over half of all chronic HBV cases in the United States. Baby boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965) account for approximately 75 percent of domestic chronic hepatitis C cases. In addition, African Americans, Latinos (Latinas), and American Indian/Native Alaskans are among the groups which have disproportionately high rates of HBV and/or HCV infections in the United States. (11) For both chronic HBV and chronic HCV, behavioral changes can slow disease progression if diagnosis is made early. Early diagnosis, which is determined through simple blood tests, can reduce the risk of transmission and disease progression through education and vaccination of household members and other susceptible persons at risk. (12) Advancements have led to the development of improved diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis. These tests, including rapid, point of care testing and others in development, can facilitate testing, notification of results and post-test counseling, and referral to care at the time of the testing visit. In particular, these tests are also advantageous because they can be used simultaneously with HIV rapid testing for persons at risk for both HCV and HIV infections. (13) For those chronically infected with HBV or HCV, regular monitoring can lead to the early detection of liver cancer at a stage where a cure is still possible. Liver cancer is the second deadliest cancer in the United States; however, liver cancer has received little funding for research, prevention, or treatment. (14) Treatment for chronic HCV can eradicate the disease in approximately 90 percent of those currently treated. The treatment of chronic HBV can effectively suppress viral replication in the overwhelming majority (over 80 percent) of those treated, thereby reducing the risk of transmission and progression to liver scarring or liver cancer, even though a complete cure is much less common than for HCV. (15) To combat the viral hepatitis epidemic in the United States, in February 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services released its ``National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2017-2020'' (hereafter referred to as the ``HHS Action Plan''). In March 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) released ``A National Strategy for the Elimination of Hepatitis B and C: Phase Two Report'', recommending specific actions to eliminate viral hepatitis as public health problems in the United States by 2030. (16) The annual health care costs attributable to HBV and HCV in the United States are significant. For HBV, it is estimated to be approximately $2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per infected person). In 2000, the lifetime cost of HBV--before the availability of most current therapies--was approximately $80,000 per chronically infected person, totaling more than $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical costs for patients are expected to increase from $30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over $85,000,000,000 in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and diagnosing individuals earlier--and connecting them to appropriate treatment and care, will save lives and critical health care dollars. Currently, without a comprehensive screening, testing, and diagnosis program, most patients are diagnosed too late when they need a liver transplant costing at least $314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have liver cancer or end-stage liver disease which costs $30,980 to $110,576 per hospital admission. As health care costs continue to grow, it is critical that the Federal Government invests in effective mechanisms to avoid documented cost drivers. (17) According to the IOM report in 2010, chronic HBV and HCV infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality despite being preventable and treatable. Deficiencies in the implementation of established guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and medical management of chronic HBV and HCV infections perpetuate personal and economic burdens. Existing grants are not sufficient for the scale of the health burden presented by HBV and HCV. (18) Screening and testing for HBV and HCV is aligned with the Healthy People 2020 goal to increase immunization rates and reduce preventable infectious diseases. Awareness of disease and access to prevention and treatment remain essential components for reducing infectious disease transmission. (19) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and awareness of HBV and HCV and to assist State and local prevention and control efforts in reducing the morbidity and mortality of these epidemics. (20) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the discretion to carry out this Act directly and through whichever of the agencies of the Public Health Service the Secretary determines to be appropriate, which may (in the Secretary's discretion) include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health (including the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities), and other agencies of such Service. (21) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 151 percent increase in hepatitis C cases from 2010- 2013, stemming from the opioid, heroin, and overdose epidemics affecting communities nationwide. For the first time since 2006, the number of reported cases of acute hepatitis B infection in the United States is rising; it increased by 20.7 percent in 2015 alone, which is also largely due to the opioid epidemic.

Subtitle C--Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases SEC. 721. ACQUIRED BONE MARROW FAILURE DISEASES. (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Bone Marrow Failure Disease Research and Treatment Act of 2018''. (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following: (1) Between 20,000 and 30,000 Americans are diagnosed each year with myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and other acquired bone marrow failure diseases. (2) Acquired bone marrow failure diseases have a debilitating and often fatal impact on those diagnosed with these diseases. (3) While some treatments for acquired bone marrow failure diseases can prolong and improve the quality of patients' lives, there is no single cure for these diseases. (4) The prevalence of acquired bone marrow failure diseases in the United States will continue to grow as the general public ages. (5) Evidence exists suggesting that acquired bone marrow failure diseases occur more often in minority populations, particularly in Asian-American and Latino or Hispanic populations. (6) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute have conducted important research into the causes of and treatments for acquired bone marrow failure diseases. (7) The National Marrow Donor Program Registry has made significant contributions to the fight against bone marrow failure diseases by connecting millions of potential marrow donors with individuals and families suffering from these conditions. (8) Despite these advances, a more comprehensive Federal strategic effort among numerous Federal agencies is needed to discover a cure for acquired bone marrow failure disorders. (9) Greater Federal surveillance of acquired bone marrow failure diseases is needed to gain a better understanding of the causes of acquired bone marrow failure diseases. (10) The Federal Government should increase its research support for and engage with public and private organizations in developing a comprehensive approach to combat and cure acquired bone marrow failure diseases.

Subtitle E--HIV/AIDS SEC. 741. STATEMENT OF POLICY. It is the policy of the United States to achieve an AIDS-free generation, and to-- (1) expand access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV/AIDS and immediately link people to continuous and coordinated high-quality care when they learn they are infected with HIV; (2) expand targeted efforts to prevent HIV infection using a combination of effective, evidence-based approaches, including routine HIV screening, and universal access to HIV prevention tools in the communities where HIV/AIDS is most heavily concentrated, particularly communities of color; (3) ensure laws, policies, and regulations do not impede access to prevention, treatment, and care for people living with HIV/AIDS or at risk for acquiring HIV; (4) accelerate research for more efficacious HIV prevention and treatments tools, a cure, and a vaccine; and (5) respect the human rights and dignity of persons living with HIV/AIDS. SEC. 742. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) Over one million people are estimated to be living with HIV in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 15 percent of whom are unaware of their HIV-positive status. (2) Annually there are about 37,600 new HIV infections and 20,000 deaths in people with an HIV diagnoses in 50 States and 6 dependent areas of the United States. (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that, in 2015, there were approximately 37,600 people newly diagnosed with HIV. The estimated number of annual new HIV infections declined 10 percent from 2010 to 2014. However, the number of new infections is increasing among certain populations, such as Latino gay and bisexual men, where annual infections increase 14 percent. New infections among Black gay or bisexual men are remaining stable. (4) HIV disproportionately affects certain populations in the United States. Though African Americans represent approximately 12 percent of the population, African Americans account for almost half (45 percent) of all people living with HIV in the United States. Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 67 percent of all new HIV infections and are the only risk group in which HIV infections continue to increase. (5) Disparities exist among Latinos/Hispanics; they make up 18 percent of the United States population and 24 percent of new infections (2015). (6) Though the rate of new infections among American Indians/Alaska Native (AI/AN) is proportional to their population size, from 2005 to 2014, the annual number of HIV diagnoses increased 19 percent among AIs/ANs overall and 63 percent among AI/AN gay and bisexual men. (7) Asian Americans account for about 2 percent of new HIV infections, but in 2013, 22 percent were undiagnosed, the highest rate of undiagnosed HIV among any race/ethnicity. (8) The latest data from the CDC (2015) indicate that new infections among women declined 20 percent. (9) The history of HIV shows that culturally relevant and gender-responsive supportive services, including psychosocial support, treatment literacy, case management, and transportation are necessary strategies to reach and engage women and girls in medical care. (10) The limited data available on transgender individuals point to a disproportionate burden of HIV infection. (11) Stigma and discrimination contribute to these disparities. (12) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that increasing the proportion of people who know their HIV status is an essential component of comprehensive HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts and that early diagnosis is critical in order for people with HIV/AIDS to receive life-extending therapy. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend routine HIV screening in health care settings for all patients aged 13 to 64, regardless of risk. (13) In 1998, Congress created the National Minority AIDS Initiative to provide technical assistance, build capacity, and strengthen outreach efforts among local institutions and community-based organizations that serve racial and ethnic minorities living with or vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. (14) To combat the HIV epidemic in the United States, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) provides a framework of increasing access to care, reducing new infections, and eliminating HIV-related health disparities. The vision of NHAS is ``The United States will become a place where new HIV infections are rare and when they do occur, every person, regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, gender identity, or socioeconomic circumstance, will have unfettered access to high quality, life-extending care, free from stigma and discrimination.''. (15) At present, many States and United States territories have criminal statutes based on ``exposure'' to HIV. Most of these laws were adopted before the availability of effective antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS. (16) Research shows that stable housing leads to better health outcomes for those living with HIV. Inadequate or unstable housing is not only a barrier to effective treatment, but also increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors leading to HIV infection. Insecure housing puts people with HIV/AIDS at risk of premature death from exposure to other diseases, poor nutrition, and lack of medical care. (17) Due to advances in treatment, many people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) today are living healthy lives and have the ability and desire to fully participate in all aspects of community life, including employment. Research associates being employed with tremendous economic, social, and health benefits for many people living with HIV/AIDS. (18) The common benefits associated with employment include income, autonomy, productivity, and status within society, daily structure, making a contribution to one's community, and increased skills and self-esteem. Research also indicates that many people with disabilities, including PLWHA, report perceiving themselves as being less disabled or not disabled at all, when working. Furthermore, some studies link working with better physical and mental health outcomes for PLWHA when compared to those who are not working. Preliminary data also suggest that transitioning to employment is associated with reduced HIV-related health risk behavior for many people. (19) On July 16, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug to reduce the risk of HIV infection in uninfected individuals who are at high risk of HIV infection and who may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners. (20) Syringe service programs (SSPs) have been associated with lowered HIV infections, lower hepatitis C infections, and increased linkage to substance use treatment. (21) There is now conclusive scientific evidence that a person living with HIV who is on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is durably virally suppressed (defined as having a consistent viral load of less than 200 copies/ml) does not sexually transmit HIV. The conclusive evidence about the highly effective preventative benefits of ART provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of people living with HIV, improve treatment uptake and adherence, and advocate for expanded access to treatment and care.

(2) Significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist for both adults and children particularly for low-income and minority populations, particularly African Americans and Puerto Ricans. (3) African-American children are twice as likely to have asthma as White children. (4) In 2010, almost 4.5 million non-Hispanic African Americans reported having asthma. African Americans with asthma are three times as likely to visit the emergency department and twice as likely to get hospitalized as White patients with asthma. (5) Puerto Ricans are 3.4 times as likely to die from asthma compared with all other Hispanic or Latino groups. Overall Hispanic Americans are 30 percent more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than non-Hispanic Whites. (6) More than 65 percent of adults with asthma are women. (b) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall convene a working group comprised of patient groups, nonprofit organizations, medical societies, and other relevant governmental and nongovernmental entities, including those that participate in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, to develop a report to Congress that-- (1) catalogs, with respect to asthma prevention, management, and surveillance-- (A) the activities of the Federal Government, including identifying all Federal programs that carry out asthma-related activities, as well as assessment of the progress of the Federal Government and States, with respect to achieving the goals of the Healthy People 2020 initiative; and (B) the activities of other entities that participate in the program, including nonprofit organizations, patient advocacy groups, and medical societies; and (2) makes recommendations for the future direction of asthma activities, in consultation with researchers from the National Institutes of Health and other member bodies of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program who are qualified to review and analyze data and evaluate interventions, including-- (A) a description of how the Federal Government may better coordinate and improve its response to asthma including identifying any barriers that may exist; (B) a description of how the Federal Government may continue, expand, and improve its private-public partnerships with respect to asthma including identifying any barriers that may exist; (C) identification of steps that may be taken to reduce the-- (i) morbidity, mortality, and overall prevalence of asthma; (ii) financial burden of asthma on society; (iii) burden of asthma on disproportionately affected areas, particularly those in medically underserved populations (as defined in section 330(b)(3) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(b)(3))); and (iv) burden of asthma as a chronic disease; (D) identification of programs and policies that have achieved the steps described in subparagraph (C), and steps that may be taken to expand such programs and policies to benefit larger populations; and (E) recommendations for future research and interventions. (c) Report to Congress.--At the end of the 5-year period following the submission of the report under this section, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program shall evaluate the analyses and recommendations under such report and determine whether a new report to the Congress is necessary, and make appropriate recommendations to the Congress. SEC. 777. ASTHMA-RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. Section 317I of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b-10) is amended to read as follows: ``SEC. 317I.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE ACTION PLAN. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows: (1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (``COPD'') refers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema, incurable diseases that make it difficult to exhale all the air from one's lungs, and that can cause persistent coughing, shortness of breath, and sputum. (2) COPD exacerbations--episodes of acute difficulty breathing and moderate to severe fatigue--are dangerous, and their treatment often requires hospitalization. (3) While smoking is the primary risk factor for COPD, other risk factors include air pollution, occupational exposures, heredity, a history of childhood respiratory infections, and socioeconomic status. (4) Over 13.5 million United States adults are estimated to have COPD. (5) COPD is the third-leading cause of death in America, claiming over 134,000 lives in 2010. (6) Since 2000, deaths for women with COPD have exceeded deaths in men. (7) Although African Americans have a lower prevalence of COPD in the United States, researchers have shown that African Americans may be underdiagnosed. Furthermore, research has shown that African Americans develop COPD with less cumulative smoke exposure and at a younger age. (b) In General.--The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall conduct, support, and expand public health strategies, prevention, diagnosis, surveillance, and public and professional awareness activities regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (c) National Action Plan.-- (1) Development.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in consultation with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall develop a national action plan to address chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the United States with participation from patients, caregivers, health professionals, patient advocacy organizations, researchers, providers, public health professionals, and other stakeholders. (2) Contents.--At a minimum, such plan shall include recommendations for-- (A) public health interventions for the purpose of implementation of the national plan; (B) biomedical, health services, and public health research on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and (C) inclusion of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the health data collections of all Federal agencies. (3) Consideration.--In developing such plan, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute shall consider the recommendations and findings of the Institute of Medicine in the report entitled ``A Nationwide Framework for Surveillance of Cardiovascular and Chronic Lung Diseases'' (July 22, 2011). (d) Chronic Disease Prevention Programs.--The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute shall carry out the following: (1) Conduct public education and awareness activities with patient and professional organizations to stimulate earlier diagnosis and improve patient outcomes from treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To the extent known and relevant, such public education and awareness activities shall reflect differences in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by cause (tobacco, environmental, occupational, biological, and genetic) and include a focus on outreach to undiagnosed and, as appropriate, minority populations. (2) Supplement and expand upon the activities of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute by making grants to nonprofit organizations, State and local jurisdictions, and Indian Tribes for the purpose of reducing the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in disproportionately impacted communities, through public health interventions and related activities. (3) Coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop pilot programs to demonstrate best practices for the diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (4) Develop improved techniques and identify best practices, in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, for assisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients to successfully stop smoking, including identification of subpopulations with different needs. Initiatives under this paragraph may include research to determine whether successful smoking cessation strategies are different for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients compared to such strategies for patients with other chronic diseases. (e) Environmental and Occupational Health Programs.--The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall-- (1) support research into the environmental and occupational causes and biological mechanisms that contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and (2) develop and disseminate public health interventions that will lessen the impact of environmental and occupational causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (f) Data Collection.--Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, acting jointly, shall assess the depth and quality of information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is collected in surveys and population studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including whether there are additional opportunities for information to be collected in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the National Health Interview Survey, and the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System surveys. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute shall include the results of such assessment in the national action plan under subsection (b). (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. Subtitle H--Tuberculosis SEC. 781. ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF TUBERCULOSIS. (a) Short Title.--This subtitle be cited as the ``End Tuberculosis Act''. (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings: (1) In the United States, 9,272 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis (referred to in this section as ``TB'') in 2016. (2) Disparities in TB exist and significantly impact minority communities in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in this section as ``CDC'') finds that 87 percent of people diagnosed with TB in 2016 self-identified as racial and ethnic minorities. (3) African Americans comprised 21 percent of people diagnosed with TB during 2016. The population-adjusted rate of TB among African Americans is 1.7 times higher than the national total, and 8.2 times higher than among Whites. (4) Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders comprised 35 percent of people diagnosed with TB during 2016. The population-adjusted rate of TB among Asian Americans is 6.2 times higher than the national total, and 30 times higher than among Whites. The population-adjusted rate of TB among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders is 4.8 times higher than the national total, and 23.2 times higher than among Whites. (5) Hispanics and Latinos comprised 28 percent of people diagnosed with TB during 2016. The population-adjusted rate of TB among Hispanics and Latinos is 1.6 times higher than the national total, and 7.5 times higher than among Whites. (6) TB is both preventable and curable, but the current rate of decline of TB in the United States remains too slow to achieve TB elimination in this century. (7) TB is transmitted through the air when a person who has TB disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. People who are in close proximity to the person with TB can breathe in the TB bacteria, and the bacteria will initially settle in their lungs. Without proper and timely diagnosis and access to treatment, the TB bacteria may grow and spread to other parts of their body. (8) As many as 13,000,000 people in the United States may have Latent TB Infection (referred to in this section as ``LTBI''). People with LTBI have TB bacteria in their bodies, but their immune system is containing the bacteria, and they are not sick, nor do they have any current risk of spreading TB to others. LTBI can activate into infectious, life-threatening TB if not treated. Modeling has shown that eliminating TB is not possible without addressing LTBI. (9) Comorbidities associated with TB include cancer, diabetes mellitus, and HIV. People with these medical conditions and compromised immune systems are more likely to develop active TB disease and to have worse outcomes from TB. (10) Forms of active TB that do not show drug resistance are classified as Drug-susceptible TB (referred to in this section as ``DS-TB''). Drug-resistant TB (referred to in this section as ``DR-TB'') is a rising threat to the public health of the United States. DR-TB that exhibits resistance to two or more first-line drugs is referred to as multi-drug resistant TB (referred to in this section as ``MDR-TB''). MDR-TB that also is resistant to at least one injectable second-line medication and at least one fluoroquinolone is classified as extensively drug-resistant TB (referred to in this section as ``XDR-TB''). (11) Approximately 78 people in the United States were diagnosed with MDR-TB in 2016. One person was diagnosed with XDR-TB in the same year. (12) In the United States, direct treatment costs average $17,000 to treat a patient with DS-TB, $150,000 to treat a patient with MDR-TB, and $482,000 to treat a patient with XDR- TB. When factoring in productivity losses during treatment, DS- averages $46,000, MDR-TB averages $294,000 and XDR-TB averages Treatment is often difficult, with daily complex multi-pill regimens and injections, with side-effects ranging from hearing and vision loss to mental health issues. (13) Recognizing the public health, economic and societal costs to the threat of MDR-TB, the National Action Plan to Combat MDR-TB (NAP) was developed by the White House to provide the United States with a comprehensive three-pronged strategy to address MDR-TB by strengthening domestic capacity to combat MDR-TB; improve international capacity and cooperation to combat MDR-TB; accelerate basic and applied research and development for new therapies, diagnostics and prevention strategies to combat MDR-TB. (14) Additional Federal support is necessary to expand TB control efforts in case finding and treatment to address LTBI in a national prevention initiative. Key policy and research breakthroughs increase the success of a TB prevention initiative: the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommendation's ``B'' rating, screening for LTBI among high- risk adults as a covered service increases the likelihood that impacted racial and ethnic minority groups can get tested for TB; a new, shorter course treatment regimen (3HP) reduces the length of treatment for LTBI from every day for 6 to 9 months to one dose per week for 12 weeks, increasing likelihood of treatment completion; and the use of blood-based diagnostic tests, Interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs, increases ability to detect LTBI among patients in affected communities. SEC. 782. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STATES IN COMBATING AND ELIMINATING TUBERCULOSIS. Section 317E(f) of the Public Health Act (42 U.S.C. 247b6(f)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(3) Additional funding for states in combating and eliminating tuberculosis.--In addition to amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out sections 247-b(1)(2)(3) for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2021.''. SEC. 783. STRENGTHENING CLINICAL RESEARCH FUNDING FOR TUBERCULOSIS. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall expand and intensify support for current and prospective research activities of the National Institutes of Health, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Tuberculosis Elimination to develop new therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines, and other prevention modalities in addressing all forms of tuberculosis (in this section referred to as ``TB''). (b) Included Research Activities.--Research activities under subsection (a) shall include-- (1) research to develop novel, safe drugs and drug regimens for the treatment of TB, including in adolescent and pediatric populations and in pregnant and lactating women; (2) research to develop rapid diagnostic tests for all forms of TB, including diagnostics that can be used for pediatric populations and people living with HIV, diagnostics that can detect extra pulmonary TB and drug resistance, and diagnostics that can be used at the point of care; (3) research to advance basic knowledge of the pathogenesis of TB and its major comorbidities, including HIV and diabetes mellitus; (4) research to improve knowledge and understandings of the role of latency in TB and the factors that increase the risk of latent TB infection progressing to active, symptomatic TB disease; (5) awarding grants and contracts to specifically develop new and needed vaccines to address TB; (6) awarding grants and contracts to support the training and development of clinical researchers whose research improves the landscape of tools to combat TB; and (7) awarding grants and contracts to support capacity- building and develop clinical trial site infrastructure in the United States and in TB endemic countries to support the aforementioned research activities. Subtitle I--Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases SEC. 785. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) Eighty percent of African-American women and nearly 74 percent of Hispanic men are either overweight or obese, speeding the onset and progression of arthritis. (2) Arthritis affects 46 million Americans, and that number will rise to 67 million by the year 2030. (3) Twenty-seven million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, making it the leading cause of disability in the United States. Osteoarthritis is sometimes referred to as degenerative joint disease. (4) Obesity accelerates the onset of arthritis: 70 percent of obese adults with mild osteoarthritis of the knee at age 60 will develop advanced end-stage disease by age 80. In contrast, just 43 percent of nonobese adults will have end-stage disease over the same time period. (5) Arthritis affects one in five Americans, and is the single greatest cause of chronic pain and disability in the United States. (6) Women, African Americans, and Hispanics have more severe arthritis and functional limitations. These same individuals are more likely to be obese, diabetic, and have higher incidence of heart disease--medical conditions that can be improved with physical activity. Instead of moving; however, these groups have an inactivity rate of 40 to 50 percent, which continues to increase. (7) Arthritis costs $128 billion a year, including $81 billion in direct costs (medical) and $47 billion in indirect costs (lost earnings). Each year, $309 billion in direct and indirect costs is lost due to disparities in osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal diseases. (8) Obesity and other chronic health conditions exacerbate the debilitating impact of arthritis, leading to inactivity, loss of independence, and a perpetual cycle of comorbid chronic conditions. (9) Sixty-one percent of arthritis sufferers are women, and women represent 64 percent of an estimated 43 million annual visits to physicians' offices and outpatient clinics where arthritis was the primary diagnosis. Women also represented 60 percent of approximately 1 million hospitalizations that occurred in 2003 for which arthritis was the primary diagnosis. (10) Women ages 65 and older have up to 2\\1/2\\ times more disabilities than men of the same age. Higher rates of obesity and arthritis among this group explained up to 48 percent of the gender gap in disability, above all other common chronic health conditions. (11) The primary indication for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also known as knee replacement, is relief of significant, disabling pain caused by severe arthritis. (12) Knee replacement is surgery for people with severe knee damage. Knee replacement can relieve pain and allow you to be more active. When you have a total knee replacement, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the surface of your knee joint and replaces them with a man-made surface of metal and plastic. In a partial knee replacement, the surgeon only replaces one part of your knee joint. (13) Total hip replacement, also called total hip arthroplasty (THA), is used if your hip pain interferes with daily activities and more conservative treatments have not helped. Arthritis damage is the most common reason to need hip replacement. (14) The odds of a family practice physician recommending TKA to a male patient with moderate arthritis are twice that of a female patient, while the odds of an orthopaedic surgeon recommending TKA to a male patient with moderate arthritis are 22 times that of a female patient. (15) African Americans with doctor-diagnosed arthritis have a higher prevalence of severe pain attributable to arthritis, compared with Whites (34.0 percent versus 22.6 percent). African Americans, compared to Whites, report a higher proportion of work limitations (39.5 percent versus 28.0 percent) and a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributable work limitation (6.6 percent versus 4.6 percent). (16) Hispanics are 50 percent more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to report needing assistance with at least one instrumental activity of daily living and to have difficulty walking. (17) African Americans and Hispanics were 1.3 times more likely to have activity limitation, 1.6 times more likely to have work limitations, and 1.9 times more likely to have severe joint pain than Whites. (18) In 2003, the Institute of Medicine reported that the rates of TKA and THA among African-American and Hispanic patients are significantly lower than for Whites--even for those with equitable health care coverage such as through Medicare or the Department of Veterans Affairs. (19) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2000, African-American Medicare enrollees were 37 percent less likely than White Medicare enrollees to undergo total knee replacements. In 2006, the disparity increased to 39 percent. (20) Even after adjusting for insurance and health access, Hispanics and African Americans are almost 50 percent less likely to undergo total knee replacement than Whites. SEC. 786. OSTEOARTHRITIS AND OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH-RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. (a) Education and Awareness Activities.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall direct the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion to conduct and expand the Health Community Program and Arthritis Program to educate the public on-- (1) the causes of, preventive health actions for, and effects of arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions in minority patient populations; and (2) the effects of such conditions on other comorbidities including obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. (b) Programs on Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Conditions.-- Education and awareness programs of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions in minority communities shall-- (1) be culturally and linguistically appropriate to minority patients, targeting musculoskeletal health promotion and prevention programs of each major ethnic group, including-- (A) Native Americans and Alaska Natives; (B) Asian Americans; (C) African Americans/Blacks; (D) Hispanic/Latino Americans; and (E) Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders; and (2) include public awareness campaigns directed toward these patient populations that emphasize the importance of musculoskeletal health, physical activity, diet and healthy lifestyle, and weight reduction for overweight and obese patients. (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary for fiscal year 2019 and each subsequent fiscal year. SEC. 787. GRANTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASE HEALTH EDUCATION WITHIN HEALTH PROFESSIONS SCHOOLS. (a) Program Authorized.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary''), in coordination with the Secretary of Education, shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to academic health science centers, health professions schools, and other institutions of higher education to enable such institutions to provide people with comprehensive education on arthritis and musculoskeletal health, particularly-- (1) obesity-related musculoskeletal diseases; (2) arthritis and osteoarthritis; (3) arthritis and musculoskeletal health disparities; and (4) the relationship between arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases and metabolic activity, psychological health, and comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.

(f) Report to Congress.-- (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for a period of 5 years, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the activities to provide health professions students with comprehensive arthritis and musculoskeletal health education funded under this section. (2) Report elements.--The report described in paragraph (1) shall include information about-- (A) the number of entities that are receiving grant funds; (B) the specific activities supported by grant funds; (C) the number of students served by grant programs; and (D) the status of program evaluations. Subtitle J--Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders SEC. 791. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders Health Disparities Act''. (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following: (1) Decrements in sleep health such as sleep apnea, insufficient sleep time, and insomnia, affect 50-70 million United States adults. Twelve to eighteen million United States adults have sleep apnea, a chronic disorder characterized by one or more pauses in breathing which can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour, disrupting sleep and resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness and loss in productivity. (2) Seventy percent of high school students are not getting enough sleep on school nights, while 33 percent of Americans get fewer than 7 hours of sleep per night, and roughly 6,000 fatal motor vehicle crashes are caused by drowsy drivers. (3) Insufficient sleep and insomnia are more prevalent in women. Women who are pregnant and have sleep apnea are at an increased risk of cardiovascular complications during pregnancy. The impact of disparities in sleep health is associated with a growing number of health problems, including the following: (A) Hypertension. (B) Cancer. (C) Stroke. (D) Cardiac arrhythmia. (E) Chronic heart failure and heart disease. (F) Diabetes. (G) Cognitive functioning and behavior. (H) Depression and bipolar disorder. (I) Substance abuse. (4) A ``sleep disparity'' exists in that poor sleep quality is strongly associated with poverty and race. Factors such as employment, education, and health status, amongst others, significantly mediated this effect only in poor subjects, suggesting a differential vulnerability to these factors in poor relative to nonpoor individuals in the context of sleep quality. (5) African Americans sleep worse than Caucasian Americans. African Americans take longer to fall asleep, report poorer sleep quality, have more light and less deep sleep, and nap more often and longer. (6) African Americans and individuals in lower socioeconomic status groups may be at an increased risk for sleep disturbances and associated health consequences. (7) Among young African Americans, the likelihood of having sleep disordered breathing and exhibiting risk factors for poor sleep is twice that in young Caucasians. Frequent snoring is more common among African American and Hispanic women and Hispanic men compared to non-Hispanic Caucasians, independent of other factors including obesity. (8) African Americans with sleep-disordered breathing develop symptoms at a younger age than Caucasians but appear less likely to be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. This delay may at least in part be due to reduced access to care. (9) Sleep loss contributes to increased risk for chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all of which have increased prevalence in underserved, underrepresented minorities. Racial and ethnic disparities related to obesity may also contribute to disparities in health outcomes related to sleep-disordered breathing. (10) Non-Caucasian adults report an insomnia rate of 12.9 percent compared to only 6.6 percent for Caucasians. (11) African-American women have a higher incidence of insomnia than African-American men, perhaps related in part to higher risk for chronic persisting symptoms. SEC. 792.

TITLE X--ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE Subtitle A--In General SEC. 1001. DEFINITIONS. (a) Determinants of Health.--The term ``determinants of health''-- (1) refers to the range of personal, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health status; and (2) includes social determinants of health (which are sometimes referred to as ``social and economic determinants of health'' or ``socioeconomic determinants of health''), environmental determinants of health, and personal determinants of health. (b) Environmental Determinants of Health.--The term ``environmental determinants of health'' refers to the broad physical, psychological, social, and aesthetic environment. (c) Personal Determinants of Health.--The term ``personal determinants of health'' refers to an individual's behavior, biology, and genetics. (d) Social Determinants of Health.--The term ``social determinants of health'' refers to a subset of determinants of the health of individuals and environments (such as communities, neighborhoods, and societies) that describe people's social identity, describe the social and economic resources to which people have access, and describe the conditions in which people work, live, and play. SEC. 1002. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) There are more opportunities to improve health for everyone when we understand that health starts, first, not in a medical setting, but in our families, in our schools and workplaces, in our neighborhoods, and in the air we breathe and water we drink. (2) The social determinants of health are the largest predictors of health outcomes. (3) Healthy People 2020 identifies health and health care quality as a function of not only access to health care, but also the social determinants of health, categorized into the following: neighborhoods and the built environment; social and community context; education; and economic stability. The following examples illustrate the nexus between the unequal distribution of the social determinants of health and health disparities: (A) The built environment influences residents' level of physical activity. Neighborhoods with high levels of poverty are significantly less likely to have places where children can be physically active, such as parks, green spaces, and bike paths and lanes. Neighborhoods and communities can provide opportunities for physical activity and support active lifestyles through accessible and safe parks and open spaces and through land use policy, zoning, and healthy community design. (B) Emotional and physical health and well-being are directly impacted by perceived levels of safety, such as unlit streets at night. Community members have expressed that safety is not only a barrier to accessing programs and services that increase quality of life but they are also not able to access physical activity in their community through the built environment. (C) In many workplace environments, toxic chemicals have lasting detrimental effects on employees' health. The hazardous compounds found in most nail salon products affect the respiratory system, reproductive system, and central nervous system, and also cause kidney and liver damage. Recognizing the importance of addressing occupational hazards as a matter of public health, especially for Asian-American women who constitute 40 percent of nail salon technicians--with Vietnamese-American women accounting for 37 percent of this--the White House Initiative on Asian American Pacific Islanders has created an interagency working group to coordinate efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational and Safety Health Administration, Food and Drug Administration, and other Federal agencies to create programming, draft regulations, and conduct more outreach on educating workers on health and safety issues. (D) Historical and institutional discrimination against certain racial groups in the United States has shaped the way in which social and economic resources and exposure to health promoting environments are distributed. Income, education, occupation, neighborhood conditions, schools, workplaces, the use of and health and social services, and experiences with the criminal justice system are all highly patterned by race, with racial minorities (compared to Whites) experiencing more that is health harming. Finding ways to uncouple the link between race and access to resources and healthy environments is a principal means of reducing health disparities. Additionally, the anticipation of racism itself causes higher psychological and cardiovascular stress levels that are linked to poor health outcomes. Remedying discriminatory practices at the individual and systemic levels will likely reduce health disparities caused by this unequal distribution of stress. (E) Poor health among Native Americans has largely been driven by post-colonial oppression and historical trauma. The expropriation of native lands and territories to the American state had severe consequences on Native American health. This resulted in the deprivation of traditional food sources--and nutrients--for Native Americans and also the destruction of traditional economies and community organization. Today, Native Americans have twice the rate of diabetes than non-Hispanic Whites. Recognition of the origins of the diabetes as having a social and community context, rather than just individual responsibility and genetic predisposition, will shape better policy to provide food security. (F) In the context of prisons, overcrowding has led to the deterioration of the physical and mental health of individuals after they leave prison. In particular, the mass incarceration of African-American males as a result of unequal contact with and treatment in the criminal justice system has contributed to an overburdening of certain infectious diseases within the African-American community. As a social institution, incarceration amplifies existing adverse health conditions by concentrating diseases and harm health behaviors such as tobacco use, drug use, and violence. (G) Educational attainment is the strongest predictor of adult mortality. It is a basic component of socioeconomic status by shaping earning potential to access resources that promote health. People with more education are less likely to report that they are in poor health, and are also less likely to have diabetes and other chronic diseases. (H) Similarly, reading ability is a strong predictor of adult health status and is often correlated with other child health issues, such as developmental problems, vision and hearing impairments, and frequent school absence due to illness. (I) Individuals with lower levels of educational attainment are much more likely to report to be current smokers. In 2015, smoking prevalence was 34.1 percent among adults with a GED diploma, 24.2 percent with less than a high school diploma, and 19.8 percent with a high school diploma, while dropping significantly to 7.4 percent among adults with an undergraduate college degree and 3.6 percent with a postgraduate college degree. (J) Social class differences account for a large part of health disparities. For example, children living in poverty experience poorer housing conditions, increased exposure to indoor allergens and toxins (such as pesticides, lead, mercury, radon, air pollution, and carcinogens), and more psychological stress. These experiences culminate in worse adult health as compared with children with higher socioeconomic status. Specifically, children living in socioeconomic neighborhoods have higher rates of asthma due to higher rates of psychological stress resulting from higher rates of violence. (K) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, questioning and intersex (LGBTQIA) individuals face health disparities linked to societal stigma, discrimination, and denial of their civil and human rights. Discrimination against LGBTQIA individuals has been associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, and suicide. Experiences of violence and victimization are frequent for LGBTQIA individuals, and have long-lasting effects on the individual and the community. Personal, family, and social acceptance of sexual orientation and gender identity affects the mental health and personal safety of LGBTQIA individuals. (L) Individuals in older and cheaper housing are at higher risks to be exposed to lead, particularly in housing built prior to 1960. The threat of lead poisoning disproportionally affects vulnerable populations, with children living in poverty (5.6 percent) and Black children (5.6) experiencing the highest rates. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, about 3.6 million homes nationwide that house young children have lead hazards such as peeling paint, contaminated dust, or toxic soil. The combined cost of medical treatment and special education for lead poisoned children averages about $5,600 per child per year, and lead poisoning costs the United States an estimated $50 billion annually. (4) Laws and regulations that improve opportunities to live in safe neighborhoods, with more social cohesion, attain higher education, sustain stable employment, and bridge class differences help foster the health and safety of individuals. (5) The global public health community has reached consensus through the Rio Political Declaration of Social Determinants of Health that ``[c]ollaboration in coordinated and intersectoral policy actions has proven to be effective. Health in All Policies, together with intersectoral cooperation and action, is one promising approach to enhance accountability in other sectors of health, as well as the promotion of health equity and more inclusive and productive societies.''. SEC. 1003. HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Health Impact Assessment is a tool to help planners, health officials, decisionmakers, and the public make more informed decisions about the potential health effects of proposed plans, policies, programs, and projects in order to maximize health benefits and minimize harms. (2) Health Impact Assessments can be done at a fraction of the cost and time typically required for other planning and permitting reviews. (3) Health Impact Assessments can build community support and reduce opposition to a project or policy, thereby facilitating economic growth by aiding the development of consensus regarding new development proposals. (4) Health Impact Assessments facilitate collaboration across sectors. (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to-- (1) provide more information about the potential human health effects of policy decisions and the distribution of those effects; (2) improve how health is considered in planning and decisionmaking processes; and (3) build stronger, healthier communities through the use of Health Impact Assessment.

SEC. 1007. ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESTORATION. (a) Findings.-- (1) General findings.--The Congress finds as follows: (A) As human beings, we share our environment with a wide variety of habitats and ecosystems that nurture and sustain a diversity of species. (B) The abundance of natural resources in our environment forms the basis for our economy and has greatly contributed to human development throughout history. (C) The accelerated pace of human development over the last several hundred years has significantly impacted our natural environment and its resources, the health and diversity of plant and animal wildlife, the availability of critical habitats, the quality of our air and our water, and our global climate. (D) The intervention of the Federal Government is necessary to minimize and mitigate human impact on the environment for the benefit of public health, to maintain air quality and water quality, to sustain the diversity of plants and animals, to combat global climate change, and to protect the environment. (E) Laws and regulations in the United States have been created and promulgated to minimize and mitigate human impact on the environment for the benefit of public health, to maintain air quality and water quality, to sustain wildlife, and to protect the environment. (F) Such laws include the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt to create the national park system, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-205), and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-588). (G) Attempts to repeal or weaken key environmental safeguards pose dangers to the public health, air quality, water quality, wildlife, and the environment. (2) Findings on changes and proposed changes in law.--The Congress finds that, since 2001, the following changes and proposed changes to existing law or regulations have negatively impacted or will negatively impact the environment and public health: (A) Clean water.-- (i) On May 9, 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers put forth a final rule that reconciled regulations implementing section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by redefining the term ``fill material'' and amending the definition of the term ``discharge of fill material'', reversing a 25-year-old regulation. The new rule fails to restrict the dumping of hardrock mining waste, construction debris, and other industrial wastes into rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. The rule further allows destructive mountaintop removal coal mining companies to dump waste into streams and lakes, polluting the surrounding natural habitat and poisoning plants and animals that depend on those water sources. (ii) On February 12, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency published the rule ``National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Regulation and Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations'', new livestock waste regulations that aimed to control factory farm pollution but which would severely undermine existing protections under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. This regulation allows large-scale animal factories to foul the Nation's waters with animal waste, allows livestock owners to draft their own pollution-management plans and avoid ground water monitoring, legalizes the discharge of contaminated runoff water rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, and metals, and ensures that large factory farms are not held liable for the environmental damage they cause. In a 2005 Federal court decision (``Waterkeeper Alliance, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency'', 399 F.3d 486 (2nd Cir. 2005)), major parts of the rule were upheld, others vacated, and still others remanded back to the EPA. On November 20, 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency published a revised final rule which undermines environmental protection provisions by removing mandatory permitting requirements and allowing large animal farms to self-certify the absence of pollutant discharge activity. (iii) On March 19, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency published a new rule regarding the Total Maximum Daily Load program of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act that regulates the maximum amount of a particular pollutant that can be present in a body of water and still meet water quality standards. The new rule withdrew the existing regulation put forth on July 13, 2000, and halted momentum in cleaning up polluted waterways throughout the Nation. By abandoning the existing rule, the Environmental Protection Agency is undermining the effectiveness of cleanup plans and is allowing States to avoid cleaning polluted waters entirely by dropping them from their cleanup lists. Waterways play a crucial role in the lives of the people of the United States and are critical to the livelihood of fish and wildlife. The result of dropping the July 2000 rule is that the restoration of polluted rivers, shorelines, and lakes will be delayed, harming more fish and wildlife and worsening the quality of drinking water. (iv) On December 2, 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers jointly issued a guidance document in the form of a legal memorandum, titled ``Clean Water Act Jurisdiction Following the U.S. Supreme Court's Decision in Rapanos v. United States & Carabell v. United States''. This new guidance dictates enforcement actions under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and calls for a complicated ``case-by-case'' analysis to determine jurisdiction for waterways that do not flow all year. Such actions endanger small streams and wetlands that serve as important habitats for aquatic life, which play a fundamental role in safeguarding sources of clean drinking water and mitigate the risks and effects of floods and droughts. Further, the definition provided therein for ``waters of the United States'' is applicable to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as a whole, potentially affecting programs that control industrial pollution and sewage levels, prevent oil spills, and set water quality standards for all waters in the United States protected under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. (B) Forests and land management.-- (i) On December 3, 2003, the President signed into law the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.). Although the law attempts to reduce the risk of catastrophic forest fires, it provides a boon to timber companies by accelerating the aggressive thinning of backcountry forests that are far from at-risk communities. The law allows for increased logging of large, fire-resistant trees that are not in close proximity of homes and communities; it undermines critical protections for endangered species by exempting Federal land management agencies from consulting with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service before approving any action that could harm endangered plants or wildlife; and it limits public participation by reducing the number of environmental project reviews. (ii) On April 21, 2008, the Department of Agriculture issued a Final Planning Rule and Record of Decision for National Forest System Land Management Planning. Similar to rules enacted by the Administration on January 5, 2005, later remanded back to the agency in Federal district court for violating the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the Administrative Procedure Act (``Citizens for Better Forestry v. United States Department of Agriculture'', 481 F. Supp. 2d 1059 (N.D. Cal. 2007)), this revised rule eliminates strict forest planning standards established in 1982, and opens millions of acres of public lands to damaging and invasive logging, mining, and drilling operations. These regulations would reverse more than 20 years of protection for wildlife and national forests by removing the overall goal of ensuring ecological sustainability in managing the national forest system, weakening the National Forest Management Act of 1976, and effectively ending the review of forest management plans under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. (iii) On September 20, 2006, the District Court for the Northern District of California vacated the Protection of Inventoried Roadless Areas rule, enacted on May 13, 2005, which gave State Governors 18 months to petition the Federal Government to either restore the previous rule for their States, or submit a new management and development plan for national forest areas inventoried under the rule. Despite the enjoinment of the Administration's 2005 rule, and the subsequent restoration of the original Roadless Area Conservation Rule, the United States Forest Service has continued to allow States to petition for a special rule under the authority of the Administrative Procedure Act, publishing a final special rule for Idaho on October 16, 2008. As a result, 58.5 million acres of wild national forests are still vulnerable to logging, road building, and other developments that may fragment natural habitats and negatively impact fish and wildlife. (iv) On November 17, 2008, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) signed the Record of Decision (ROD) amending 12 resource management plans in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, opening 2,000,000 acres of public lands to commercial tar sands and oil shale exploration and development. On November 18, 2008, the BLM published a final rule for Oil Shale Management setting the policies and procedures for a commercial leasing program for the management of federally owned oil shale in those three States. Previously barred by a congressional moratorium on the commercial leasing regulations for oil shale until September 30, 2008, the development of oil shale on public lands poses a serious threat to land conservation, endangered and threatened species, and critical habitat. Domestic shale oil production allowed by these regulations is highly water and energy intensive, the impacts of which will intensify existing water scarcity in the arid Western Region and potentially degrade air and water quality for surrounding populations. (C) Scientific review.--On December 16, 2008, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the Department of Commerce jointly issued a new rule amending regulations governing interagency cooperation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA).
