I thought I would pass along this information From the University of Arizona Andrew Weil Center For Integrative Medicine During this time of great societal stress, we are here to contribute our knowledge and experience to your health and wellbeing. There is a high level of interest in evidence-based integrative strategies to augment public health measures to prevent COVID-19 virus infection and associated pneumonia. Unfortunately, integrative measures have not been validated in human trials of COVID-19. Notwithstanding, this is an opportune time to be proactive. Using available evidence, we offer the following strategies for you to consider to enhance your immune system to reduce the severity or the duration of a viral infection. Again, we stress that these are supplemental considerations to the current recommendations that emphasize regular hand washing, physical distancing, stopping non-essential travel, and getting tested if you develop symptoms. RISK REDUCTION: - Adequate sleep: Shorter sleep duration increases the risk of infectious illness. Adequate sleep also ensures the secretion of melatonin, a molecule which may play a role in reducing coronavirus virulence (see Melatonin below). - Stress management: Psychological stress disrupts immune regulation. Various mindfulness techniques such as meditation, breathing exercises, and guided imagery reduce stress. - Zinc: Coronaviruses appear to be susceptible to the viral inhibitory actions of zinc. Zinc may prevent coronavirus entry into cells and appears to reduce coronavirus virulence. Typical daily dosing of zinc is 15mg - 30mg daily with lozenges potentially providing direct protective effects in the upper respiratory tract. - Vegetables and Fruits: Vegetables and fruits provide a repository of flavonoids that are considered a cornerstone of an anti-inflammatory diet. At least 5-7 servings of vegetables and 2- 3 servings of fruits are recommended daily. Some of these foods and/or dietary supplements include: tomatoes, apples, onions, oranges, nuts, parsley, celery, berries, licorice and Chinese skullcap. - Vitamin C: Clinical trials have found that vitamin C shortens the frequency, duration and severity of the common cold and the incidence of pneumonia. Typical daily dosing of vitamin C ranges from 500mg to 3000mg daily with even higher doses utilized during times of acute infection. - Melatonin: Melatonin has been shown to be anti-inflammatory. It also reduces oxidative lung injury and inflammatory cell recruitment during viral infections. - Curcumin: Curcumin, a key component of turmeric, has anti-inflammatory actions and antiviral effects - You can read the full post by going to drweil.com In addition I recommend a good multiltivitamin with minerals, like phytomulti by metagenics. I also recommend a good probiotic like Ultraflora Balance by metagenics, which can also help support your immune system. Regular exercise can also help support your immune system and reduce stress.. Hoping all of you remain healthy. Dr. Keller "}
