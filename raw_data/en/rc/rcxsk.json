INTR ODUCTION Since the signing of the Montreal Protocol on Subs tances that Har m the Ozone Layer in 1987 and its subsequent amend ments, t he use of the fire suppressant halon 1301 (CF 3Br) has declined sharply to a limited num ber of essential applications. Production of this chem ical in the industrialized wor ld terminated in January 1994, and the supply of halon 1301 for these e ssential uses i s being m et by established reserves. One of the essen tial uses is for fire protection in m ilitary and commer cial aircraft. To enable relief fro m dependence on thi s environm entally harm ful substance, res earcher s have exa mined a range of chem ical co mpounds as alternatives. The Department of Defense (D oD) Next Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program (NGP ) has been a principal contr ibutor t o this search. NGP projects have exam ined several families of co mpounds, have created or adapted m ethods to screen these chem icals, an d are developing engi neering m ethods for making the best use of less-than-perfect alternatives t o halon 1301 in military aircraft.1,2,3 Supported by the DoD Strategic Environ mental Resea rch and Developm ent Program (SERDP), the NGP is now in its f ifth year, and planning is underway for the rem aining y ears of this e ffort. The N GP Technical Coordinating Committee (TCC) deemed it tim ely to re-evaluate the world of chem istry, identify whic h chem ical fa milies ar e unlikely to contain usable alterna tive che micals, which have been examined suf ficiently to know that the best candida tes have been already identified, and which fa milies are still in need of scrutiny. Studies of this last gr oup would then be included in the resear ch plans for the remainder of the NGP. This report su mmarizes the efforts of a task grou p to perform this re-evaluation. Such an examination requires a set of success criteri a, and these have varied over ti me. Initially , som e looked f or a true drop-in replacement; where all the properties of th e replacement chem ical were so similar to those of halon 1301 t hat compatibilit y with the platfor m was co mplete and no subsequent modification of the fire suppression sy stem was need ed. Others looked for unique products t hat their companies co uld m arket. Some focused on fi nding high fire suppression effici ency ; others looked for compounds t hat were free of an y disq ualify ing proper ty. As the field m atured, several influencing factors emerged: \u0083 For the remai ning essential uses, satisf actory and affo rdable solutions were ha rd to identify. It thus beca me reasonable to consider chemical s with some less-than -fully -desirable behavior if the drawback(s) could be o vercome. \u0083 The list of attributes for a suppressant has evolved. For exam ple, at mospheric lifeti me has been added. Ph ysiologicall y based pharmaco kinetic (PBPK) modeling of the hum an bod y has sho wn that, for cardiac sensitizati on by haloge nated chem icals, the toxic potenc y criterion need not be as limiting as had previousl y been thought. By cont rast, there has been little resolut ion as to an acceptable minimal contribution to oz one depletion and global warming. \u0083 All new weap ons sy stem s are being designed free of ozone-depleting substances, and the U.S. Army has committed to retrofitting i ts ground vehicles with alternate fire suppressants. At present, the NGP is proceeding with its own set of screening criteria to define better where the search for alternative suppressant s is most likel y to be successful. These criteria are: \u0083 Fire suppression and reig nition q uenchin g efficien cy comparable to halon 1 301 a nd hi gher tha n the h ydrofluo rocarbons (HFCs). \u0083 Atmospheric lifetim e short, on t he order of a m onth, to keep ozone depletion, g lobal warm ing, and an y future adverse con tributio ns to a minimum. This is generally a result of such tropospheric processes as photol ysis, reaction with wa ter (hy drolysis), or raining (adherence t o water). 1 \u0083 Toxic potenc y of agent an d com bustion b yproducts sufficiently lo w that brief exposure to an extinguishi ng concentration does not result in an unrecoverable injur y; \u0083 No serious interaction of the agent it s bypr oducts with contacted aircraft materials; \u0083 Availability of co mpatible storage container co mponents; \u0083 Boiling point sufficiently high that a suppressing vol ume fraction of 5 % (at thermal equilibrium ) exists at -40 \u00b0C, the m inimal design temperature for ai rcraft suppression sy stem performance. This boiling point is about 25 \u00b0C. Cons ideration was given to agents that m ight require a s maller concentration for suppression; for example, this boil ing point criterion rises to 35 \u00b0C for a 3 % suppression concentration. Even this is not an absolute criterion, since the engine heats the interior engine nacelle surf aces during flight a nd since it is often feasible to war m the agent storage container. The boil ing point can be as high as 75 \u00b0C if the suppression ta kes place in an environm ent at 22 \u00b0C. Of course if the agent is disp ensed as a mist/powder or via a solid propellant ga s generator (SPGG), the concept of a limiting boiling point criterion is not applicable. Over the y ears, there has been tes ting and even commercializing of azeotropic blends of chemicals. Such mixtures can reduce the negative im pact on peo ple or the environm ent of one of the com ponents. However, az eotropes m aintain their special beha vior over only a narrow range of pressure and temperature. Over the wider te mperature range expe rienced during flight, a u niform mixture may not be maintained ei ther within the storage container or durin g its discharge. In this situation, the container may not fully em pty or the em erging m ixture may vary in com position during the discharge period, each of these resulting in a less-than-specified residence ti me for an extinguis hing concentration. Thus, this project did n ot consider the use of chem icals in blends of an y type. This docum ent, then, revie ws the state o f knowledge of the fitness of chem icals as fire suppressants. In a number of cases, this has been supplemented by the judgment of the authors. Based on this com pilation, the authors indicate chem ical fam ilies that merit further research an d, of t hose, the ones that are the most prom ising. 2 II. HAL OGEN ATED ORGANI C COM POUN DS Compounds c ontaining onl y carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, regardl ess of their chem ical struct ure, are fuels rather than fire suppressants. However, when one or m ore hal ogen atom s are substituted into t he structure, the co mpound gains the abilit y to quench flames. These halogenated h ydrocarbons are commonly called halons. Bromine and iodine atom s are particularly effective at flame suppression, chlorine atoms less so. Remaining hy drogen atom s compromise the suppression efficiency by adding f uel to the fire. Bromine, iodine, and chlorine atoms are also potent depleters of stratospheric ozone. However, iodine- containing co mpounds und ergo rapid tro pospheric ph otolysis and, therefore, have short atm ospheric lifetim es, near-zero global warm ing potential (GWP) values, and lo w ozone depl etion potentia l (ODP) values. Thus, iodine-containing com pounds need no a dditional func tionalit y to provide acceptable atmospheric environm ental properties. On the othe r hand, com poun ds that contain no i odine, but that contain brom ine and/or chlorine m ust posses s func tional groups that make the at mospheric lifeti me sufficiently short to provide acc eptable ODP values. We therefore used the follo wing principl es in considering halo genated h ydrocarb ons as potenti al alternates to halon 1 301: \u0083 To obtain fire suppression performance similar to th at of halon 1301, brom ine or iodine (and perhaps chlorine) m ust be present. \u0083 When no i odine is contained in a halocarbon, som e other functional ity m ust be present to keep the at mospheric lifeti me sufficiently low to provide acceptable ODP and GWP values. \u0083 The com pounds m ust have some fluorine atoms to displace hy drogen in order to decrease or eliminate flammability and, in some cases, to decrease hepatot oxicity (harm to the liver). In this section, we consider all the fam ilies of or ganic com pounds that contain o nly C, H, O, and/or halogen atoms: alkanes, al kenes, We will discuss ea ch of these in turn, starting with m embers of the fa mily that contain iodine and m ay contain any other halogen ; then th ose that contain br omine and may contain flu orine and/or c hlorine; then those that contain chlori ne and m ay contain flu orine; and, finall y, those that co ntain fluori ne onl y. Thus, the term , ple, \"brom ine-containing\" allo ws for co mpounds that m ay also contain chlorine and fluorine, b ut not io dine. C arboxylic acids and their esters are not considered in t his report due to their expe cted low volatilities. 3 A. ALKANES The alkanes are hydrocarbons, i.e., they cont y 1. Iodine-containing Alkanes The alk yl iodides are flammable and have high boiling points. The y are thus not suitable as al ternatives to halon 1301. At the other extrem e of iodinated alka nes are those t hat are fully fluorinated except for the iodine. a. Fire Suppression Efficien cy. The follo wing table and figures sho w cup burner extinguishm ent concentrations for n-heptan e fuel for a num ber of perfluor docarbons and for halon 1301 all determ ined with the same, non-standard, cup bur ner.4 For reference, the n-heptan e extinguish ment volum e and mass fraction s for halon 1 301 with the c up burner specified in the NFPA Standard on Clean Extinguishing Agents5 are 3.4 % and 2 07 g/m3, respectively .6 Note that, generally, as the chain length increases, the extinguishm ent concentration expressed as volum e fraction decreases, but the extinguishi ng concentration expressed as mass per unit volum e incr eases. (See graphs.) The di -iodinated com pound CF 2ICF 2CF 2CF 2I has a lo wer extinguishment y volume than CF 3CF 2CF 2CF 2I, but when expressed as mass fraction , the performances of th e di-iodinated and m ono-iodinated co mpounds are almost identical. Testing with a 56 m3 (2000 ft3) com partment fire indicates that the performance of CF 3I was co mparable to that of halon 1 301, with an y differences being due to distrib ution characteristics.7 00.511.522.533.5 12 34 56 78 Carbon Atom 0100200300400500 12 34 5678 Carbon A tomsExtingui shment Concent ration, g/m3 Formula Ext.

The sim plest and m ost volatile co mpound i n this series, CF 3I, has a very low cardiac sensitization LOAEL (Lowest Obs ervable Adver se Effect Level), a volum e fraction of 0 .4 %,8 althou gh the acute 4 hour rat ALC (Approxim ate Lethal Concentration, essentially an LC 50) is much higher.9 Toxicities of a few other fluoroio docarb ons have been determ ined. Noteworthy is the fact that the toxicities are highl y variabl 2I) has a 2 of 3.3 % 10 whereas 2-i odo-2-(trifl uoromethy l)-1,1,1,3,3,4,4,4-octafluorobuta ne (CF 3C(CF a 1 hour m ouse LC 50 of les s than 0.0 05 %.11 In spite of its relatively high LC 50, the former com pound has a very low cardiac sensitization LOAEL of 0.1 %10, and in this characteristi c 4 resembles CF 3I. The only partially fluorinated fluoroi odocarbons f or which toxi city data have been reported is 1, 1,1-triflu oro-2-iodoethane (CF 3CH 2I), which has a 10 min mouse LC50 of 5 % and a 10 m in mouse anesth etic volum e fraction of 1.2 5 %.12 c. Materials Compatibility. Anhy drous iodoalkanes show good compatibilit y with metals alth ough there is so me possible concern about thei r compatibility with copper . CF 3I in particular showed no serious interaction with a num ber of allo ys, altho ugh t he interac tions were an order of m agnitude larger than with halon 1 301.13 Severe corros ion can occur in the presence of water o wing to hydroly sis, and this is more likely to occur with iodi nated com pounds than othe r organic halides. The com pounds, of co urse, can react with organic poly mers and elasto mers may have to be carefully chosen to limit swelling and degradation. There are both elasto mers and lubricants with which CF 3I is com patible.14 d. Colligative Properties. As iodination increases, boiling point (BP) increases an d volatility decreases, as expected. Volatility also decreases as fl uorine is repl aced by hydrogen. Eventually , however, one reaches a point when m ost or all of the fluorine atom s have been lost that the boiling point begins to dec rease. The i mportant thing is that the boiling point is approxim ately 35 \u00b0C highe r for iodides than 67 16 e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Iodocarbons have a strong tendency to decom pose photol yticall y, resulting in very short atm ospheric lifeti mes. The at mospheric l ifetime of CF 3I is less than 1 da y.20 The atm ospheric lifeti me for releases at higher altitudes is thought to be significantl y shorter. The estimated ODP for CF 3I is less than 0.008 and m ore likel y 0.0001 relative to CFC-11.20 If CF3I were rele ased directly into the stratosphere f rom aircraft, t he ODP would be consider ably hig her; howeve r, anal ysis indicates that high altitude releases are not a si gnificant thre at to stratospheric ozone.21 (Based on figures co mpiled by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy , and commer cial aircr aft of halon 1301 duri ng flight is less than 500 kg a nnuall y, of which about 70 kg are released at altitudes above 27 km (30,000 ft). Because this quantity is so low, e xpected high altitude releases of CF 3I, if used on aircraft, would not be considered a significant threat to the ozone lay er.) f. Overall Assessment. Iodides are effi cient fire suppr essants with low at mospheric environm ental impact. The only one known to have a sufficiently low toxicity and acceptable properties to be applied to fire protection needs is CF 3I, and even t his com pound is unacceptable for use in norm ally occupied areas. There is a sig nificant possibilit y that other iodides ( e.g., hydrofluoroiodocarbons ) could have acceptable toxicities; however, the cost to deter mine this may be unacceptably large. While CF 3I has been well studied as a possible fire suppressant, little effort has been applied to others in t his family. 5 No Further Study Further Stu dy High Priority for Further Stu dy Well studied Lightl y studied X Completely unstudied Estimated 6 2. Bromine-containing Alkanes Here w e cons ider all brom inated alkanes whether or not fluorine and chlorine atoms ar e also present. Exam ple co mpoun ds inclu de halon 1 troposphere. Thus, hy drogen substitution ( which makes the m olecule susceptible to attack by atm ospheric OH) is needed to lim it the at mospheric lifeti me and the ozone dep letion potent ial. However, if th ere are too m any hydrogen atom s and/or carbon- carbon bonds relative to the num ber of hal ogen substituents, t he com pound will be an ineffective sup pressant and may be flammable. This behavior is pr edictable.22 a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. The fi re extinguishment effectiveness of bromine-containing alkanes is well known. Some selected n-heptane cup burner values are shown in the acco mpanying table. Note that halon 1301 exti fr actions measured using acceptab le equipm ent and procedures range from around 2.9 % to 3.4 % . The v alue given he re is that determ ined in a review of data.6 Hydrogenation decreases fire nguishm ent effectiveness ( ation). Methy l brom ide is actually flammable, but can suppre ss a flame.

Halon 1301 appears to be the least toxic of the brom inated alkanes whose toxicit y has been reported. It i s virtuall y non-toxic at design concen trations. Other brom inated alkanes have vary ing analgesic, toxicity , and cardiotoxicity effects. The LC 50 values in the acco mpanying table (all for 4 hour exposures of rats except BFC-12B2, wh ich is a 2 hou r exposure of mice, and methyl bromide, which is an 8 hour expos ure of rats) illustrate th e range of toxicities enco mpassed by this fa mily. In gene ral, brom oalka nes Bromide drous brom oalkanes sh ow excellent co mpatibility with metal s; however, severe co rrosion can occur in th e presence of w ater owing to hydroly sis. The compounds, of course, can react with organic pol ymers. d. Colligative Properties. In general, as the brom ination increases, the boiling point (BP), melting point (MP), and heat of va porization ( Hv) increase. (See following table. The values are ta ken from the GlobeTech Chem ical Database. Refer ences are availa ble upon request.). In general, these pr operties also increase as fluorine is replaced by hydrogen. Eventua lly, however, one reaches a point when most or all of the fluori ne ato ms have been lost that these qua ntities start to decrease. Halon 1301 has the l owest melting point , boili ng point, and heat of vaporization of an y of the brom inated alkanes. With one excepti on, the ODP values ar e long for the br ominated alkanes, and the materials are regulated under the Mo ntreal Protocol. The exception is t he hydrobr omocarbons h methyl regulat ed, the other HBCs are not. Moreover, s ome of these have rel atively low toxicities and/or possibly adequate environmental properties. For exam ple, n- propyl brom ide (CH 3CH 2CH 2Br) has a n relative to CFC-11 of 0.006 and an at mospher ic lifeti me of about 1 1 days.28 Although t hese co mpounds are flammable, th ey can be m ixed wit h HFCs (or ot her halocarbons) to give n onfla mmable mixtures with goo d exting uishment properties.29 f. Overall Assessment. ODP concerns make these co mpounds unacceptable for use and thus f or further study .

Chlorine-co ntaining Alkanes The full y halogenated chlo rofluorocarbo ns have long atmospheric l ifetimes and the chlorine atoms are potent ozone depleters. Elimination of use of th ese co mpounds was the principal reason for the Montreal Protocol. T hus, onl y the hydrochlor ofluorocarbons ( HCFCs), wit h at least one hy drogen atom to allow atmospheric OH radical attack, can be considered. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Chlorine atoms are distinctly less efficient at ef fecting fla me suppression t han brom ine or iodi ne atoms. As examples, HCFC-1 23 (CHCl 2CF 3) has a cup burner extinguishi ng volum e fraction of ap proximately 7.1 % , and HCFC 22 (CHClF 2) has a value of approxim ately 11. 6 % for n-heptane fuel.4 With this reduced che mical effe ct, the phy sical effect of an HCFC is more important; larger molecul es with highe r molar heat capacity requir e a lower mole percent for suppression. However, all HCFCs are signi ficantly less effective than halon 1301. The nonflu orinated m aterials are more likely to be flammable. b. Toxicity. Due to their applications in refrigeration, foam blowing, cleaning, and other processes to which CFCs were formerly applied, a l arge am ount of toxicol ogical work has been carried o ut on HCFCs. Overall, HCF Cs have moderate to low toxic potencie s. They are generally less toxic than brom ofluorocarbons (CF 3Br being a m ajor exception) and m ore toxic than HFCs and PFCs. To xicity is less a drawb ack than environm ental cha racteristi cs. c. Materials Compatibility. Like all halocarbons, HCFCs can be corrosive toward metals in the presence of moisture. However, they are not genera lly corrosive when dry and are less likel y to cause corrosion proble ms than ei ther brom ine-containi ng or iodine-contai ning com pounds. Like ot her halocarbons, HCFCs may require careful selection of polymeric gasket materials to lim it swelling and degradation. d. Colligative Properties. HCFCs are more volatile than correspondi ng brom ine-containing compounds. Thus, suitabl e compounds can be found for m ost or al l applications based on physical properties onl y. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. The major problem with HCF Cs is that their ODP values, though l ow, are sufficiently large that the material s are regulated and t heir producti on will event ually be phas ed out. At best, they can be used onl y as transitional substitutes. f. Overall Assessment. HCFCs have unacceptable env ironm ental pr operties without any redee ming suppression efficiency .

Both perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and h ydroflu orocarbons (HFCs) have been widely studied a s fire suppressants, and there is a very large am ount o f extinguishm ent data available at al l scales. PFC s and HFCs a re only moderately effective as fire extin guishants on a volum e basis (se e the following table of n-heptane cup burner values), since fluorine atoms lack the c atalytic suppression chem istry of the other halogen atom s. As expected, ef fectiveness decreases with increasing hydrogen con tent, with HFC-32 being fl ammable. Compound Formula Ext. Volume Fraction (%) Ref.

In fact, many of these highl y stable co mpounds have no measurable toxicit y. Wh ile the addition of hy drogen i ncreases toxicity , HFCs still generally have low toxicity . Som e HFCs have a sufficiently low cardiac sensitization that the y are allowable for use in norm ally occupied a reas. The ac companying ta ble shows the im portant volume fractions for co mmercially available PFC and FC extinguishants a nd c. Materials Compatibility. PFCs and HFCs are probably the least corrosive of any halocarbons. Problems can still exist with wet materials, but th e high strength of the C-F bond makes hy drolysis difficult. PF Cs are not com patible with some fluor inated poly mers; but com patible elasto mers exist. d. Colligative Properties. HFCs and PFCs have phy sical properties ideal for halon replace ment. These compounds a re more volatile than their brom ine-containing counterparts. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. HFCs and no signi ficant ozone depletion, h owever, HFCs and, in particular, PFCs have long atmospheric lifetim es and high global w arming.

Overall Assessment. These co mpounds have been well studied and are becoming widel y marketed for a wide range of applications.

Iodine-containing Alkenes Iodoalkenes are a fam ily that contains two functionaliti es, both of w hich are likely to contri bute to lower stability relati ve to the alka nes. The carbon-io dine bond is rather weak and the carbon-carbon double bond is reacti ve. Iodi ne-containing com pounds are also subject to hydrolysis. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, no extinguishm ent studies have been carried out on any iod oalkene. The effect of the double bond on extinguishm ent is uncertain; however, it is known that some highl y halogenated, lowe r molecular weight alkenes are flammable.36 b. Toxicity. There are no published data. Due to thei r expected low stability and t he possibilit y of alkylation, iodoalkenes are likel y to be more toxic th an many of the other halocarbons being considered. c. Materials Compatibility. Because of their reduced stability and t he potential f ormation of HI upon hydrolysis, it is expected that materials com patibility will be of concern with iodi ne-containing alkenes. d. Colligative Properties. Volatilit y is likely to be low er than the br omoalkenes. The boiling point of the sim plest iodoalkene, vi nyl iodide, is 56 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C higher than the co mparable brom ide. Fluorination could reduce these values. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. With expected rapid photol ysis and the susceptibilit y of the double bond to attack by atmospheric OH, iodine-conta ining alkenes are expected to have exceedingl y short a tmospheric lifeti mes and near-zero G WP and ODP values. f. Overall Assessment. These co mpounds have been com pletely unstudied as fire suppressant s. A screening study is recommended even though the compounds have possible stabilit y and t oxici ty problem s.

A num ber of flame extinguish ment studies have been carried out on brom ofluo roalkenes and h ydrobromofluoroalkenes. The cup b urner values for n-heptane fuel in the following table have been taken from several sources.34,35,4,31 Most of t hese co mpounds have extinguishm ent concentrations at least as low as ha lon 1301 on a vol ume basis. The substituted ethylenes appear to be significantl y poorer extingu ishing agents than the higher molecular weight materi als. The effect of the double b ond on exting uishment is uncertain; however, it is kn own t hat some highl y halogenated, lower molecular weight alkenes, e.g., CF 2=CFBr, are f lammable.36 Recent unreported work indicates that in larger scal e testing, CH 2=CBrCF 3 greatly outperfor ms HFC-227ea.37 Testing u sing the Dispersed Li quid Agent Fi re Suppression Screen (DLAFSS) apparatus developed by the National Institute of St andards and Technology indicates a fir e suppression capability for CH 2=CBrC F3 comparable to or p ossibly better than th at of halon 130134, although precise co mparison between the two agents is difficult with the DLAFSS apparatus because of differences in their dispersion.

Materials Compatibility. Bromine-containing alkene s will general ly be m ore reactive than the corresponding alkanes. Nevertheless, t here is no r eason to expect compatibility problem s that cannot be overcome wit h suitable materials. As wi th all halocarbons, m etal corrosion will be increased by the presence of w ater, which ca uses hy droly sis. d. Colligative Properties. The requirem ent for at least two carbon atoms (to allow formation of a carbon-carbon do uble bo nd), the pro bable need to use propene and higher m olecular weight d erivatives to obtain good f ire suppression, and t he requirem ent for at least one brom ine ato m, gives these com pounds a higher m olecular weight and therefore a lower volatility than som e other halocarbon fam ilies. To date, the lowest boiling p oint m aterial for which fire ex tinguishm ent testing has been performed has been 2- brom o-3,3,3-t rifluoropr opene, CF 3CBr=CH 2, which h as a boiling p oint of 34 \u00b0C. The full y halogenated propene CF 2=CFCBrF 2 has a boiling poi nt of 28 \u00b0C39, and this m ay represent a lower li mit for the compounds with three or m ore carbon ato ms. Only a few heat of vaporization values have been reported or esti mated f or brom ofluoroalkenes and hy drobrom ofluoroalkenes. These tend to be around 30 kJ/m ol. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Atmospheric lifeti mes, GWP values, a nd ODP values are believed to b e very low for brom ine-containing alkenes. Rece nt, yet unpublished work confirms this.40. Estimated lifeti mes for three brom ofluoroalke nes based on mea sured reactivity towards OH ar e 3.2 day s for CH 2=CBrCF 3, 3.4 da ys for CH 7.3 days 2=CHCF 2CBrF 2. These values i mply very low ODP and GWP values. f. Overall Ass essment. Although the low er volatilit y will adve rsely affect the usage envelope, brom ine-containing alkene s are probably the m ost promising halo n replacements discovered to date. A fuller look at this fam ily is thus warranted. Ther e may be a higher probabilit y of success for st ream ing agent substitutes.

No data are availab le on the exti nguishin g per formance of chlorine-cont aining alkene s. It is expected th at the hi gher energy content of t he double bond will decrease perf ormance rel ative to the corr esponding alkane. A chlorine atom adds less eff ectiveness compared to that provi ded by brom ine or iodine. b. Toxicity. No toxicit y studies on chlo rofluoroalken es and h ydrochloroflu oroal kenes have been reported. It i s known a num ber of nonfluori nated chlorine-cont aining alkene s are rather to xic. c. Materials Compatibility. Chlorine-containing alkene s will be, as a whole, less reactive than the corresponding brom ine com pounds, but higher in reac tivity than t he chlorine-containing alka nes. Nevertheless, there is no reason to expect com patibility problems that cannot be overco me with suitable materi als. As with all halocarbons, metal corrosi on wi ll be increased by the presence of water, which causes hy droly sis. d. Colligative Properties. Little inform chlorofl uoroalkenes and hydrochl orofl uoroalkenes. The phy sical properties of these co mpounds are likely to be m ore suitable for total flood fire protection t han the brom ine-containing alkenes. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Due to the presence of a double bond, chlor ine-containing alkenes are expected to have very low at mospheric l ifetimes, glob al warm ing potentia ls, and ozone depleti on potentials. f. Overall Ass essment. The chlorine-containing alkene s are not expected to have sufficient fire extinguishm ent capabilit y to justif y the studies re quired to better characterize these co mpounds as extinguishant s. Toxicit y also remains a major concern. No Further Study Further Stu dy High Priority for Further Stu dy Well studied Lightl y studied Completely unstudied Estimated X 15 4. Fluorine-containing Alkenes a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Only two compoun ds in this categor y have been investigated for flame suppression. Hexafluoropr opene (CF 2=CFCF 3) has a heptane cup burner extinguishm ent vol ume fraction of 7. 3 %31, and octafluoro-2-b utene (CF 3CF=CFCF 3) is reported to have a cup burner extinguishm ent vol ume fraction of 4 .9 %.41 The latter value may be low since this determ ination is believed to have been made using an apparatus known to gi ve low values in othe r cases. The analogous fully fluorinated saturated com pounds are perhaps slightl y more efficient, 6.1 % 42 and 5.3 % , respectively .31 b. Toxicity. The toxicit y of the few perfluoroalkenes and h ydrofluor oalkenes whose toxicit y has been studied is surprisingly high. CF 3C(CF 3)=CFCF 2CF 3 has a 1 hour mouse LC 50 of 0.01 75 %11; and in an anesthesia te st, all m ice ex posed to a vo lume fraction of 0.8 % to 3.4 % of 1-methy lnonafluoroc yclohexene died, as did all th ose exposed to 0.8 % to 1.5 % of decafluorocyclohexene and to 3.0 % to 7.3 % (6 m in) of octafluorocy clopentene43 On the other hand, the 10 m in LC 50 for CH 2=CHC F2CH 3 is a moderately high 25 % , and the 4 ho ur LC 50 for CF 2=CFCF 3 is 1.12 % .44 The very high molecular weigh t com pound CF 3CF 2CF 2CF 2CH=CHCF 2CF 2CF 2CF 3 has been used as a blood substitute.18 c. Materials Compatibility. Although m ore reactive th an the PFC s and HFCs, hydrofluor oalkenes and perfluoroalke nes are expected to ha ve relatively good corrosion and com patibility properties. Again it is expected that fluoropoly mers may be incom patible with these materials, but other elasto mers are undo ubtedl y available. d. Colligative Properties. The acco mpanying table shows so me of the im portant colligative properties of selected perfluoroalkene s and h ydrofluoroalkenes. The Hv values are at the normal boiling points. I n general, unsaturation leads to a ver y slight incr ease in boiling poi nt when co mpounds are compared to saturated co mpoun ds with t he same number of carbon atoms. The ph ysical properties of the materials are suitable for to tal flood appl ications. Impact. Unsaturation significantly reduces the at mospheric lifetime. For exam ple, perfluoropr opane has a lifetim e of 2600 years46, while h exafluoropro pene has a lifetim e of only 5.8 days.47 Global warm ing and at mospheric persistence will not be problem s with the fluorinated alkenes, and these materials have no oz one depletion potential. 16 f. Overall Ass essment. Perfluorinated alk enes and h ydrofluor oalkene ent atmospheric environm ental properties, b ut they are expected to be no better than t he perfluoroc arbons and HFCs in fire protection and m ay be worse. The only reason to cons ider these materials is if e nvironm ental ly superior HFC-like materials ar e req uired.

The bonds to adjacent atoms or groups are weak ened and thus substitut ed alky nes should undergo react ion in the troposphere. The bond w eakness may also lead to stabilit y and m anufacturing difficulties a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Nothing is known of the fire suppression characteristi cs of haloalky nes. Bromine and iodine woul d impart so me fire suppression capabilit y, but the higher energy content of the triple bond w ill offset this. Com pounds containing i odine or br omine directly attached to a triply bonded carbon are known to be unstable. Dii odoacety lene i s explosive; some brom oalkynes are pyrophoric. The halogen could, of cour se, be attached to an alkyl substituent. b. Toxicity. Nothing is know n of the t oxici ty of the haloalkyn es. In view of the expected low stabilit y, however, toxi city is likely to be hig h. c. Materials Compatibility. It is likel y that haloalky nes will have poorer material com patibility properties than m ost other halocarbons discussed in this report; how ever, nothing concrete is known. d. Colligative Properties. Insufficient data are availabl e on lowe r molecular weig ht haloalkynes to make any determination of ph ysical pro perty trends. More inform ation is available on ver y large iodine- containing alky nes, which are used in organic syntheses. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Tropospheric reactions with tr opospheric OH (and phot olysis) are likely to limit atmospheric lifeti mes and m ake contributions to ozone depleti on and global warm ing negligible. f. Overall Ass essment. Other than the expected good a tmospheric environm ental properties, th ere is no obvious advantage to haloalkynes. Their stability is likely to be low and there may also be manufacturing difficulties.

Ethers These co mpounds contain a C-O-C grouping, which c ontributes to reactivity in the tropospher e. 1. Iodine-Containing Ethers a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Nothing is known about the effectiveness of the iodinated derivatives. There is no reason to believe that the suppression capabilities will significantly differ fro m those of the fl uoroio doalka nes, the h ydrofluoroi odoa lkanes, or equivalent br ominated com pounds. b. Toxicity. Hydroflu oroeth ers and perfluoroethers can have low toxicity . The effect of iodine substitution is unknown, but it is expected that the to xicity will inc rease due to the low C-I bond strength. c. Materials Compatibility. The materials com patibility of iodi ne-containing ether s is unknown. It is possible that such com pounds m ay exhibit slightl y worse co mpatibilit y than the corresponding alkanes due to the small polarit y induced by the oxy gen atom . d. Colligative Properties. Little inform ation has a relatively high boiling point of 122 \u00b0 C at 1 atm .48 It is expected that due to t he higher m olecular weight (all co mpounds must contain at least two carbon atoms and an oxy gen at om) and the presence of iodine , com pounds will have properties that ar e less than suitable for to tal flood appl ication. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. The presence of iodine should lead to s hort atmospheric l ifetimes, as w ith the other iodi nated com pounds. This would lead to ver y low ODP and GWP values. The ether lin kage is likely a secondary contribu tor. f. Overall Ass essment. If the iodine-subst ituted alkanes do n ot produce an acceptable candidate, this family might be worth screening. How ever, the high boiling point is a deterrent for total flooding applications. The onl y reason to use iodi ne-substituted et hers is to provide a way to m odify the properties to im prove toxicit y, perfor mance, st ability, m aterials compatibility, or other char acteristi cs.

Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Some brom ination of these co mpounds is needed to decrease flammability . Onl y two st udies of fire suppression by of hydrobrom ofluoroethers (HBFEs) h ave been carried out. CH 2=CBr(OCF 3)CFCF 3, which is unsaturated, has a cup burner ex tinguishm ent concentration of 3.8 volume percent.35 CH 3-O-CF 2CHBrF has been esti mated to have a heptane cup burner vol ume fraction of 4.2 % .36 Thes e extinguishi ng concentrations seem high, given the presence of a brom ine ato m plus the p hysical cooling f rom the co mpounds ' relativ ely m olecular weights. The hydrobrom ochlorofluoroether CBrF 2-O-CF 2CHClF, has been suggested as an example of a che mical to be tested for fire suppression efficiency .18 b. Toxicity. Some very limited toxicity results are avail able for HBFEs; however, m uch more work is needed to estimate the tolerabilit y of the toxicit y of this family. CH 3-O-CF 2CHBrF has been reported to be a good ane sthetic at a volume fraction of 2.5 %.49 CBrF 2CF 2-O-CH 3 has been esti mated to have a 2 hour m ouse LC 50 of 0.84 % based on a quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR).50 A minim um anesthetic volume fraction of 0.8 % and a minimum lethal volum e fraction of 1. 5 % have been reported for CHFBrCF 2CH2-O-CH3.51 CHF 2-O-CF 2CHBrF has b een reported to be a goo d anesthetic in mice at a volume fraction of 1.9 %52 and CH 3-O-CF(CF 3)CBrF 2 has been reported to produce anesthesia in mice with excitation at a volum e fraction of 5 %.49 c. Materials Compatibility. No inform ation is available on m aterial compatibility for the HBFEs; however, com patibilities better than the hydrobr omofluoroa lkene s and slightl y worse than the HBFCs are expected. d. Colligative Properties. Boiling points for the HBFEs in the Globe Tech Databa se (refer ences available on request) and for HFEs obtained from some HBFE s by substitution of fluori ne for brom ine are shown in the following table. Few data are av ailable for low molecular weig point 2-O-CF 3 (not an HBFE) has been esti mated as -30 \u00b0C.18 This appears to be low. For four com pounds (see table colum n marked HFE) substitution of Br for F causes an average boiling point increase of 52 \u00b0C. Since CF 3-O-CF 3 has a boili ng point of -59 \u00b0C, CBrF 2-O-CF 3 is expected to have a nt of -8 \u00b0C. Si milarly , CH of -24.2\u00b0C, and CH 3-O-CBrF 2 is predicted to h ave a boiling point of 28 \u00b0C. 3-carbon compounds ( e.g., CH 3-O-CF 2CHBr 2, BP = 55.8 \u00b0C) will have marginally acceptable boiling points fo r use as total floodi ng agents. T he HBCFE CBrF 2-O- CF 2CHClF been esti mated Hv = 30.3 kJ/m ol (115 kJ /kg) at the norm al boiling point and a vapor phase heat capacity of 175 J/m ol-K (664 J/kg- K) at 25 \u00b0C.49 e. Atmosphe ric Impact. These co mpounds should have low environmental i mpact.34 Som e hydrogen content is needed to provide sites for atta ck by atmospheric OH sin ce the C-O-C linkage is ins ufficiently polar to pr ovide fast rainout. Onl y limited studies have been made of the ki netics of reactions of brom oethers with OH.53 The lifeti me of CH 3-O-CF 2CHBrF has bee n estimated a s 14 and 50 day s.36 At this time, too few data exist to estimate ODP va lues, but the preceding lifetim e estimates suggest the values would be low. f. Overall Ass essment. These co mpounds may be sufficient, although not outsta nding extinguishants. Before going further, it is essential that we have good inform ation on atm ospher ic environm ental properties. Below, we state that the com pounds have been lightl y studied; in fa ct, however, they are almost unstudied.

No fir e suppression testing has been carried o ut for a chlori ne- containing et her; however, been suggested as representativ e of chlorine- containing et hers for fire suppression te sting.18 HCFEs are likely to have fire suppression efficiencies greater than t hose of the hy drofluoroethers, but well below the efficiencies of brom ine-co ntaining com poun ds. b. Toxicity. In general, fluor ination is pr obably needed to keep the he patic toxicit y reasonable. Some chlorine-cont aining ethers have been considered as anesthetics an d therefore have reasonable acute toxicities (althoug h the y may have be anesthetic in mice at a v olume fraction of 1. 25 %54, and enflurane is reported to be a good anesthetic in mice at a volume fraction of 1.9 % .52 It is expected that the presence of chlorine will make the toxicities a little worse than those of the corresponding hydrofluor oethers, so me of which have reasonable t oxicities. c. Materials Compatibility. No inform ation is available for the materials co mpatibility with H CFEs. These co mpounds are, how ever, expected to have no serious com patibilit y proble ms. They are likel y to have co mpatibilities si milar to, but a littl e more probl ematical, than those of the hydrofluoroethers. d. Colligative Properties. Data are av ailable for a few chlorine-containing ethers, particularly since some have been considered as anesthetics. For methoxyflurane (with two Cl ato ms), BP = 105 \u00b0C54; for enflurane, BP = 56.5 \u00b0C of Hv = 29.4 kJ/m ol (159 kJ/k g) at the norm al boiling point and vapor phase heat capa city = 162 J/m ol-K at 25\u00b0C have been made for enflurane and, under t he same conditions) of Hv = 28.7 kJ/m ol (156 kJ/kg) and vapor phase heat capacity = forane) should have boiling poi nts that are at the edge of acceptabilit y as total floodi ng agents. The vapor pressures of four- carbon HCFCs are likely to be too low. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. In a num ber of ca ses, the prese nce of an ether linkage significantly increases reaction rates with tropospheric OH; how ever, this is not true in all cases.57 It is likely that subs titution of chlorine for fluorine will cause a decr ease (though probabl y small) in atm ospheric lifeti me. Since some hydrofluoroethers are known to have at mospheric lif etimes, in the best of cases, of under a y ear, the HCFEs ar e likely to be, at best, margina lly acceptable . f. Overall Ass essment. Since the HCFEs will operate mainly by he at absorption and are likely to be only marginally better than the hy drofluoroether s in fire suppression, and since these co mpounds are likely to have at best marginally accepta ble envi ronm ental charact eristics, it is re commended that no studies be performed.

This agent can exceed halon 1 301 ef ficiency if del ivered as a mist, thus realizing the end othermicity of vaporization. Formula Ext. Vol. Fr action (%) 2-O-CF Toxicity. Ethers low toxicities due to the low reacti vity of the C-O-C functional group arising from the strength of the C- O bond. Severa l volatile ethers can affect the central nervous system . A su bstantial am ount of data is availabl e for HFCs since a num ber have been considered as alternative ref rigerants and solvents. Most of the HFEs exam ined exhibit relative ly low toxicities and are not m utagenic. A survey of toxicities for HFEs is ava ilable.60 c. Materials Compatibility. HFEs are exp ected to have co mpatibility properties at least as good a s those of halon 1301.

A large am ount of ph ysical pr opert y data is available for the HFEs. The two-carbon com pounds will, of course, have the lo west boiling poi nts. The boi ling point of CHF 2-O-CF 3 is -35 \u00b0C 61 and that of CHF 2-O-CHF 2 is 5 \u00b0C.62 The fully fluorinated material, CF 3-O-CF 3, has a boiling point of -5 9 \u00b0C. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Ethers that contain no i odine, brom ine, or chlorine have no ODP; how ever, atmospheric l ifetimes may still be a problem . In f act, perfluoroethe rs are expect ed to have atmospheric lifeti mes similar to those of the perfluorocarbons and t hus to be partially fluorinat ed to be acceptable. Lifetim es and GWP values as low as 0.3 y ears and 3 9 (100 year time horizon, rel ative to CO 2) have been found f or HFEs.57 However, so me HFEs have considerab ly longer lifetim es and higher GWP values. f.

Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Fire suppression da ta are al most completely unknown f or fluorinated carbony l com pounds. A m ajor exception, however, is dodecafluoro-2-methy lpentan-3-one, CF 3CF 2C(O)CF(CF 3)2, which has a prop ane cup burn er heptane extinguishm ent volum e fraction of 3.5 % .73 This c an be com pared with values of 3.6 % for halon 1 211 and 4. 3 % for halon 1 301 w ith the same fuel.73 Unfortunately, data for n-heptane extinguishm ent wi th this perflu orinated keto ne have not been reported. Hexafluoroacetone, CF 3COCF 3, has a cup bur ner extingu ishm ent volum e fraction of over 6 %. b. Toxicity. Lower aldehy des attack exposed moist tiss ue, especially eyes and m ucous me mbranes. Higher aldehydes penetrate deeper into the respirator y tract and affect the lungs. Many m embers of the family are mutagens, and all have anest hetic propert ies. Ketones a re less toxic but the y can act as narcotics and as neurotoxins. Hexafluoroactetone is known to be have a re latively low toxicit y. The 4 ho ur LC 50 value is greater than 10 %,and the cardiac sensitizati on NOAEL is 10 %.73 c. Materials Compatibility. Carbony l-containing com pounds will un doubtedl y be more corrosive than the corresponding HFCs or PFCs. The full y fluorinated com pound CF 3CF 2C(O)CF(CF 3)2 is reported to show no reaction with a var iety of metals at its boiling point.73 Som e results for int eractions wit h elasto mers have been reported; however, testing is still under wa y.73 d. Colligative Properties. Since fluorine-containing aldehydes and ketones must contain a carbony l group an d should av oid ha logen atom s on the alpha c arbon, structu ral requirem ents indicate relatively high m olecular weights com pared to, e.g., the HFCs. There is one fluorinated ke tone reported to be a fire extinguishant , CF 3CF 2C(O)CF(CF 3)2. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. ODP is not a problem with these co mpounds; however, GWP values and atmospheric persistence must be consid ered. Ca rbony l com pound s can undergo phot olysis and may also undergo phy sical removal, depending on the water solubilit y. Reac tion with hydroxy l free radicals requires the presenc e of hydrogen atom s. Rate cons tants for reactions with hy droxy l free radicals and estimated quantum yields and absorpti on cross secti ons for phot olysis indicate that aldehy des will have short atm ospheric lifetim es, on the or der of a few hours to appro ximately one month. 69,70,69 The rate constants for reactions of non-haloge nated ketones with h ydrox yl free ra dicals are relatively large, and the atmospheric lifetim es will be on the order of da ys. In addition, the se co mpounds undergo photol ysis in the troposp here. The method of W uebbles and Connell72 used to es timate lifeti mes due to hydrogen atom abstraction, however, shows that halogen substitution greatly increases the at mospheric lifeti mes. Thus, halogenated k etones may have low GWP values onl y if the photol ytic lifetim e is sufficiently short. Without absorption cross sections for com pounds of interest, photoly sis estimates cannot be made. CF 3CF 2C(O)CF(CF 3)2 is expected to ha ve an atm ospheric lifet ime of 3 t o 5 days and a 100 year GWP of 1 (com pared to CFC-11). f. Overall Ass essment. In the absence of t he recent resu lts reported for CF 3CF 2C(O)CF(CF 3)2, there ketones as exti nguishants. This is still true for the aldehydes; however, at least so me of the fully fluorinated ke tones may have acceptable environm ental an d toxicity characteristics.

No ex tinguishm ent studies have been made for any iodi ne- containing ar omatic. Although com pounds containin g iodine are usually good extingu ishants, the large number of carbon atom s (at least six) may suppl y significant co mbustion energy and this m ay negate much of the suppression characteristics. b. Toxicity. No inform ation is available on the toxicit y of iodine-conta ining fl uoroar omatics. It is expected that such com pounds will have toxicities simila r to those of the iodine-c ontaining alkanes, so me of which are known t o have very low cardiac sensitization levels.8,10 c. Materials Compatibility. The material s com patibility properties are totally unknown; however, the iodine-contai ning arom atics are not expected to be si gnificantly m ore corrosive than the iodine-containing alkanes. d. Colligative Properties. The iodine-containing arom atics will ha ve very large m olecular weigh ts and high boiling points, even when fluorina ted. e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Due to the presence of iodine, iodinated aromatic s are ex pected to have very short atm ospheric lifeti mes and low GWP and ODP values. f. Overall Ass essment. These very large molecules c arry a large fuel burden and have low vapor pressures. It is unlikel y that suitable iodine-containi ng arom atics can be found for total flooding.

Only one extinguishment study has been made for a percent.64 Altho ugh com pounds containing bromine are usually go od ex tinguishants, the large number of carbon atom s (at least six) may suppl y significant co mbustion energy and this m ay negate much of the suppression characteristics. The com pound expected to have the highest volatilit y, brom opentafluorobenzene, is flammable (flash point 87 \u00b0C).74 b. Toxicity. Few data are av ailable on bro mine-containing flu oroaro matics. A 2 h our m ouse LC 50 of 0.38 % has b een estimated for brom opentafluorobenz ene using QSAR methods.50 Exposure of m ice to 1.8 % to 2.4 % of this compoun d pro duced no anesth esia, and all survived. QSAR methods have also been used to estimate a 2 hour m ouse LC 50 of 0.5 % for 2-brom oheptafluorotol uene, 0.4 % for 3- 0.4 % for 4-brom oheptafluorotoluen e.50 c. Materials Compatibility. The material s com patibility properties are totally unknown; however, the brom ine-cont aining arom atics are not expected to be significantly more corrosive than the bromine- containing al kanes. d. Colligative Properties. The boiling poi nts for brom ine-containing aromatics are very high.

Bromopentafluorobenzene C6BrF 5 134 75 77 C6BrF 4CF 3 152 78 e. Atmosphe ric Impact. Like the alkenes, h ydroxyl free radicals can add to arom atics. At about room temperature m ost OH r adical reactions studied to date proceed by addition to the aromatic r ing rather than b y abstr action of a h ydrogen atom . Rate cons tants for the reac tion of hydroxy l free radicals with aromatic co mpoun ds are similar to those observed for the alkenes.79 Of particular interest is the 298 K rate constant of k OH = 2.2 x 10-13 cm3/molecule-s and approxim ately 3 x the nonfluori nated analogs are somewhat faster: k OH = 1.59 x 10-12 for benzene and 7. 8 x 10-12 cm3/molecul e-s for n-propy lbenzene.80 Thus, fluori nation of the ar omatic ring decrea ses the reaction rate with OH. O ne can calcul ate the first order rate constants for the two fluorinated co mpounds as k 1 = k OH [OH]. This gives k 1 = 2.1 x 10-7 s-1 (t1/e = 1/k 1 = 54 days) for hexafluorobe nzene and k 1 = 2.9 x 10-6 s-1 (t1/e = 1/k 1 = 4 da ys) for n-prop ylpentafluorobenzene . One can use the method of Wuebbles and Connell72 to esti mate fir st-order rate constants and atmospheric lifetim es for a series of aromatic co mpounds of i nterest. The estimation m ethod gives k 1 = 8 x 1 0-8 s-1, (t1/e = 145 days) for hexafluorobenzene and k 1 = 3 x 10-7 s-1, (t1/e = 39 da ys) for n-propylpentafluorobenzene. These rate constants ar e a little smal ler than those deter mined from the experim ental second-order rate consta nts above. Thes e values indicate that aro matics have an excellent potential for environm ental acceptabilit y, even with brom ine present. 35 f. Overall Ass essment.

N-heptane cup burn er extinguish ment volum e fractions have been reported4 for 1,3-dichl % , 447 g/m3). Much of this effectiveness is due to the large heat capacities of these heavy com pounds. b. Toxicity. Some chlorine-containin g aromatics are known to be carcinogens ( e.g., ne, 1,4- dichlorobenz ene, hexachlorobenzene); xicity data are available for chlorine-containing fluoroarom atics. There is l ittle reason to believe that such com pounds would have exceptionally high acute toxicities. c. Materials Compatibility. The material s com patibility properties are totally unknown; however, the chlorine-containing arom atics are not expected to be significantly more corrosive than the bromine- containing al kanes. d. Colligative Properties. The chlorinated aromatics are expected to have hig h boiling points and low volatilities, even when fluorinated. 1,3-Dichlorote trafluorobenzene has a boili ng point of 151 \u00b0C and a melting point of 73 \u00b0C.81 The normal boiling p oint of chloropentaflu orobenzene is 117 \u00b0C. e. Atmosphe ric As with the bro mine-containing arom atics, h ydroxyl free radicals can add to these co mpounds, resulting in atm ospher ic lifeti mes possibly withi n an acceptable range. f.

All mice died in 6 ho urs after 10 m in exposure to a vol ume fraction o f 0.5 % to 0.9 % of (trifl uorom ethyl)pentafluoroben zene; pentaf luorobenzene produced ane sthesia in mice with all surviving.43 c.

Nitriles Nitriles are organic com pounds containi ng the -CN group. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. No fir e suppression tests have been conducted on nitrile compounds, a nd there is no evidence or reason to belie ve that the nit rile group itse lf possesses an intrinsic fire suppressi on capabilit y. Nonhalogenated nitriles are known or a re expected to be flammab le. Fluorinatio n may well reduce this, and t he resulting com pounds would act m ainly as ph ysical suppressants. The addition of brom ine or iodine woul d impart chem ical flame inhibition t o nitri les. b. Toxicity. Most nitriles are moderately to highl y toxic. Propionitri le is quite toxic, apparently throug h metabolism of the cy anide i on. One-third of rats exposed to a volum e fraction of 0. 05 % (500 ppm by volume) of propio nitrile , butyronitrile and yronitrile are by skin co ntact or inhalatio n.84,85 There are no p ublished data on the hi ghly fluorinat ed nitriles or nitriles containing bromine or iodine. c. Materials Compatibility. Nitriles are not inherentl y highl y corrosi ve toward metals. They do attack some poly meric materials. Nitriles are slowly hydroly zed, particularly in the pre sence of acid s or bases, to give carbo xylic acids and ammonia; however, the ne t change in p H (indicative of corrosive t endencies) is nom inally zero since both a weak base and a weak a cid are for med. d. Colligative Properties. The following graph shows the variati on of boiling poi nt, melting point and heat of vapori zation (at or n ear 25 \u00b0C) for linear nitriles containing 2 throug h 6 car bon atom s.86 The simplest nitrile, acetonitrile (methy l cyanide) has a bo iling point of 81.6 \u00b0C and other nitriles have higher boiling poi nts. The freezing poi nts for c ompounds up to 6 carbon atoms are all b elow 80 \u00b0C except for acetonitrile, which is -43.8 \u00b0C. Ha logenation is expe cted to cause significant property changes. For exam ple, trifl uoroacetonitrile has a surprisingly low boiling point of -64 \u00b0C.87 -150-100-50050100150200 23 456 Number of Carbon nsic ODP, and no es timate has been made of their GWP values; however, consideration of atmospheric c hemistry (see below) indic ates that GWPs should be negligible (assu ming relatively rapid removal by rainout). Halogenated nitriles, however, could have signif icant ODP values and GW P values, dep ending on the degree of halogenation and the ty pe of halogen atoms present. The approxi mate r ate constant for react ion of OH with acetonitrile at 298 K is is 19 x 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1.79 x 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 for ethane, both at 298 K. Thus, the presen ce of a nitrogen atom in the nitriles does not appear to increase the re action rate with OH (co mpared with alkanes) significan tly. Using a globally averaged OH concentrati on of 9.7 x 105 molecule/cm3 88, one calculates an esti mated lifeti me for acetonitrile (three hydroge n atom s) based onl y on reaction with OH of 1.53 years and for propionitrile (5 hydrogen ato ms) of approximately 2 months. The polarity induced by nitrogen causes nitriles to be completely (e.g., acetonitrile) or somewh at (e.g., propionitrile) water soluble. This greatly increases the probability for relatively rapid rem oval by rainout. Some atm ospheric hydrol ysis could also occur. This is expected to be negligible for hom ogeneous gas phase reactio ns, but could occur heteroge neously on a tmospheric w ater droplets. The addition of fluorine atoms to d ecrease flammabili ty will decrease th e reactio n rates with OH and will also decrease the water sol ubilit y, both changes increasing the at mospheric lifetime. f. Overall Assessment. It appears unlikely that a nitrile could be designed to have desirable values of all the needed properties. However, it is suggested that a cursory examination of the possibility for inherent fire suppression capabilit y of the nitrile group (possibl y using CF 3CN) be pursued. A positive result might stim ulate a clo ser look at thi s family.

Organic Nitrates and Nitrites Organic nitrates and nitrites are , grou -ONO 3ONO). a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. The com bustion properties of nit rates and nitrites are fairly well known, prim arily because both t ypes of com pounds are of ten explosive. No fire suppression t ests have been conduct ed using ni trates and nitrites, and there is no evidence or reason to believe that these groups possess any intrinsic fire suppression capabilit y. It is not clear whether the addition of brom ine or iodi ne would be suff icient to stif le the explosive tendencies. b. Toxicity. Nitrates and nitrites have relati vely high toxi cities. In the case of nitrat es, methemoglobin formation is the prim ary toxicity cause. Nitrites are also known t o induce methem oglobin for mation and, have even ca used hum an death by this route.90 (Methem oglobin is the oxidized f orm of hem oglobin in which the iro n in the heme com ponent has been oxidi zed fro m the ferrous (+2) to the ferric (+3) state. This renders the hem oglobin m olecule in capable of effectively trans porting and releasing oxy gen to the tissues.) A 4 hour LC 50 of 0.13 % has b een reported for rats.91 c. Materials Compatibility. To date, no i nformation has been obtaine d on general materials compatibilities of nitrates and nitrites. d. Colligative Properties. The following graphs show the varia tion of boiling poi nt, melting point and heat of vapori zation for some nitrates and nitrites wit h 1 thr ough 3 carbon atoms. (These data are fro m a variety of sources, but primarily from the NIST Che mistry WebBook.) The boiling point data are very uncertain due to the instabi lity of the nitr ates ni trates ha ve no intrinsic ODP, and n o estimate has been made of the GWP values. Halogenated nitril es, however, could have si gnificant ODP values and GWP values, dependin g on the degr ee of haloge nation and the type of halo gen atoms present. A relatively large am ount of data has been reported for reaction of nitrates and nitrites with OH.79 The approxim ate rate constant at or near 298K for reactio n with OH is 3.4 appr oxim ate rate constant at or near 298 K f or reaction with OH i s 12 x 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 propyl nitrite . These can be co mpared with recommended values of 0. 84 x 10-14 cm3 15 x 10-14 cm3 molecule -1s-1 all at 298 K. Thus, the nitrates and esp ecially the nitrites have 42 reaction rates with OH somewhat higher than tho se of the correspondin g alkan es. Using a globall y averaged OH concentrati on of 9.7 x 105 molecule/cm3 88, one calculates e stimated lifeti mes l nitrate of, respectivel y, 1 year, 2 4 days, and 19 days. For m ethyl nitri te, ethyl nitrite, a nd propy l nitrite the values are 3 months, 7 da ys, and 5 days. The ad dition of halo gen atoms, such a s fluorine, will d ecreas e the reaction rate s with OH. The nitrates and nitrites are slightl y water soluble, a propert y that increases the probabilit y for removal by rainout. f. Overall Ass essment. While the nitrates and nitrites are expected t o have low atm ospheric lifeti mes, the absence of any proven i nherent fire suppression capabilities due to the nitrate and nitrite gr oups, the high t oxicit y, and, in particular, the expl osive te ndencies makes these co mpounds unacceptabl e for study .

Research from the National Indust rial Research Institute of Nagoy a has focused on fluoroalky lamines, with an emphasis on perfluoroalky l derivativ es, as fire sup pressants.92 The inhibiti on effect 3)2(CF=CF 2) on f lame propagation has been measured by determ ining the lam inar burning velocit y for a m ixture of 9.5 % methane, 90.0 % air, and 0.5 % inhibit or, at an initial tem perature of 298 K and a pressure of 101 kPa. All of the fluoroal kylamines inhibited flame propagation less effi ciently than CF but m ore efficientl y than HFC-227ea (CH 3CHFCF 3). Calculations showed that the inhibiti on effect of th e fluoroalky lamines was c aused not only by phy sical factors, but also by a chem ical process in which fluorinated species capture co mbustion chain c arriers (H, O, and OH) to for m stable HF molecules. The i nhibition efficiencies of fl uoroalky lamines were found to be higher than those kanes since fluoroalky lamine deco mposes to reactive fluoroalky l radicals in the lower te mperature region of each fla me.93 Ab initi o molecular orbital calculatio ns indicate that fire suppression by pe rfluorom ethylamines is due , in part, to reactions of the trifluorom ethyl radical, which can be easily released from perfluoroa by dissoci ation of C-N bonds.94 Others had previousl y found t hat CF 3 acts a s a che mical inhibitor.30 b. Toxicity. Amines with at least partiall y fluorinated alky l groups are the most likely to be considered as fire extinguishants. Fluorination will lower or e liminate flammabilit y and is likely to decrease toxicity by decreasing polarity . Some extre mely limited toxicity data have been reported for partially fluorinated amines.62 The LC LO for mouse inhalation has been as 500 mg/m3 for 2,2,2-trifluor oethylamine, (CF 3CH 2)NH 2.27 Some genotoxicit y and cytotoxicit y testing has been carried out on flu orinated am ines using Chines e ham ster lung cell cultures.95 c. Materials Compatibility. The perfluori nated am ines are known to have excellen t material compatibility. Som e of the higher m olecular weight pe rfluoroam ines have been used as inert fluids in electronics testing. The m ore highl y polar less fluorinated am ines are known to attack metals. d.

Compound Ext. Volume Fraction (%) SF6 11 SF5Br 4.2 SF5Cl 13 SF5SF5 11 b. Toxicity. SF6 has an exceedingl y low toxicit y; however, the closely related co mpound S 2F10 is highl y toxic. Of considerable concern is the toxicit y of combustion products, such as SO 2, that could form during fire extinguishm ent. c. Materials Compatibility. SF6 is quite inert and has had extensive use as a dielectric fluid. T oo little work has been perform ed on the derivat ives to esti mate their materials co mpatibility. d. Colligative Properties.

Overall Ass essment. Hexavalent sulfur has no significant chemical suppressi on contri bution, nor does it lead to improved atm ospheric en vironm ental pr operties. Thus, no furt her stud y is reco mmended. No Further Study Further Stu dy High Priority for Further Stu dy Well studied Lightl y studied X Completely unstudied Estimated 47 B. Sulfides and Mercaptans Sulfides and mercaptans contain di valent sulfur n ot attached to an oxygen at om: R1-S-R 2 and R-S-H. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Since the non halog enated co mpounds are generally flammable, only the highl y halogenated com pounds are of interest . No fire suppr ession tests h ave been conducted on these, and there is no evidence indicating that the -S- group itself possesses an intrinsic chem ical fire suppression capabilit y. A sulfur diox ide cycle has been proposed to inhibit com bustion b y removal of hydrogen atoms.101 Added brom ine or iodine woul d impart chem ical flam e suppression effect iveness. b. Toxicity. Most organic sulfides are toxic. Moreover, chlorine subs titution in the beta position can give rise to hi ghly toxic sul fur mustards ( e.g., ClCH 2Cl). y with fluorine subst ituents has been repor ted. The mercaptans tend to be highl y reactive. c. Materials Compatibility. Sulfides and particularly mercaptans are generally reactive toward metals, particularly copper and co pper allo ys. d. Colligative Properties. The following table includes some boiling points and he ats of vaporization.102,103 Of particular interest is the decrease in boiling poi nt with fluorinat ion. Compound Boiling point (kJ/mol) 6.3 28.8 CF 38.6 no intri nsic ODP, and no es timate has been made of the GWP values. A significant am ount of ki netic data are available for reactions of sulfides and mercaptans with OH79; however, no kin etic information is ava ilable for halogen -containing derivatives. The reco mme nded rate constant for react ion of OH w ith dim ethyl sulfide is 460 x 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1at 298 x 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1. Thus, the pre sence of a sul fide atom appears to increase the r eaction rate with OH significa ntly. Using a globally averaged O H concentration of 9.7 x 105 molecule/cm3 88, one calculates an esti mated lifeti me for dimethyl sulfide based only on reaction with O H of 2.6 day s. Highe r molecular w eight sulfides with m ore hy drogen atoms have larger rate constants with OH and ev en lower at mospheric lifeti mes. Thus, the sulfides appear to have intrinsically short atm ospheric lif etimes. Halogenation will decrease the reacti on rates owing prim arily to rem oval of h ydrogen atoms. f. Overall Ass essment. The sulfides suffer from several drawb acks: no distinctive fire suppression efficiency and potential t oxicity, reactivity, and materials co mpatibility problems. However, the possibilit y that atm ospheric lifetim es co uld be ver y short for brominated com pounds m akes a screening study of the smaller bro mofluorosulfides desirable.

Toxicity. Extensive toxico logical studies have been made on dimethy lsulfoxide (DMSO), the simplest of the sulfoxide com pounds and a widely us ed solvent. D MSO is one of the least toxic organic chem icals known. Its m easured LD 50 values (oral, derm al, and inhalati on) sho w it to have a m uch lower acute toxicity than ethanol, acetone, and other comm on solvents. D MSO, however, does have the unique abilit y to penetrate hu man skin and this is so me cause for concern. c. Materials Compatibility. Dimethylsulfoxide is known to attack m ost poly mers; however, it has a relatively good com patibility with m etals. Sim ilar ch aracteristi cs are expected fo r other sulfoxides. No compatibility studies have been carried out with t he fluorinated sul foxides. d. Colligative Properties.

Phosphorus Acids and Es ters Phosphor us forms a very large num ber of acids and est ers with a rather com plicated chem istry. The primary singl e-phosphor called ph osphoro us acid, a name now reserved for the hy pothetical acid P(OH) 3); and y called h ypophos- phoro us acid, a nam e now used for the h ypothetical alternative structure PH(OH) 2). Ph osphor ic acid is triprotic, ph osphonic acid i s an d hypop hosp honic acid is monoprotic. O=P(OH)(OR) 2, phosph onate esters: O=PH(OH)(OR) an d O=PH(OR) 2. These are written as the \"phosphite\" forms P(OH) 2(OR) and P(OH)(OR) 2, where they can be con sidered as derivatives of th e hypot hetical phosph orous cert ainly exist onl y in the phosphonate form s with P=O and P-H bonds. A series of very comm on com pounds in cludes the trialky l and tria ryl \"phosphites.\" These materials appear to ex ist as two interconvertable forms: P(OR) 3, which can be considered as derived from the hy pothetical acid P(O H)3, and O=PR(OR) 2, which can be considered as derived from phosphonic a cid. In m ost cases, the stab le com pounds have the phos phonate structure with a P=O bond. For historical reasons, however, the compounds are still m ost often named as phosphites and given t he structure P(OR) 3 rather than being named as phosphonates, with the structure O=PR(OR) 2. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. A sig nificant am ount of flam e suppression testing has been carried out o n a few esters of phosphorus-contai ning acids.104,105 Trim ethyl phosphate ((O=P(OCH 3)3) shows a more pronou nced effect o n flame velocity than Cl 2 and Br 2.106 Phos phate esters a re of particular interest as fire suppressants since they are diffic ult to i gnite tim es more effective t han nitrogen on a m olar basis, and about 4 tim es more effective than halon 1301 at suppressing opposed flow diffusion flames.108 It has been concluded that ph osphorus-c ontai ning com pounds are more efficient flame inhibit ors than CF 3Br, with the inhi bition determ ined by the phosphorus content .109 However, in suppressing cup burner flames, DMMP appears to be no m ore eff ective than CO 2 on a m ass basis.110 b. Toxicity. The toxicities of the acids of phosphorus and th eir esters are highl y variable. Nevertheless, this fam ily of com pounds generally has, on an averag e, a moderately low toxicity, at least for those compounds c ontaining non-halogenated alky l groups. The com bustion pr oducts will include t he phosph orus acids. c. Materials Compatibility. In the absence of h ydrolysis, the phosp hate esters have relatively good materi als co mpatibility. The free acid s will attack metal s. d. Colligative Properties. Acids of phosphorus and t heir esters have low, often unacceptably low, volatilities and high boi ling poi nts. Some exam ples are given in t he following table.15 It is anticipated that fluorinati on m ay help s omewhat: P(OCH 2CF 3)3 has a boiling p oint of 131 \u00baC co mpared with 156. 5 \u00baC for the non-fl uorinated com pound. Additional fluori nation is expe cted to furthe r decrease the boiling point and increase the volat ility. 51 Compound ric Impact. Some phosphor us com pounds are known to be ozone de pleters if released in the stratosphere. Moreover, stratospheric (and tropos pheric) rem oval reactions of phosphorus are relatively unknown. One can propose reactions such as PO + O 3 PO 2 + O 2 coupled with PO 2 + O PO + O 2 that could deplete ozone. Nevertheless, it seem s unlikely that phosphor us com pounds would have any glo bal environm ental im pact. f. Overall Ass essment. Phosphorus compounds are highl y effective at suppressing som e types of flames, yet poor at suppre ssing others. Most work to date has em phasized alky l phosph onates and s. Low volati lity rema ins one of the m ajor problem s with phosp horus compounds a s flam e suppressants. Phosphorus com pounds containing fluoroalky l and hydrof luoroalky l groups, however, are often nonflammable and have hi gher volatiliti es; they shoul d be given hi gh pri ority for additional study .

Phosphonitriles Phospho nitril es are compounds, p ossibly cy clic, co ntaining the -P =N- unit. A common example is P3N3Cl6. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness.

The phosph onitriles are ex pected to hav e very good materials compatibilities, due to some extent to their high m olecular weights. d. Colligative Properties. The sim ple halogenated pho sphonitriles ( e.g., are low volatilit phos phonitri les have even highe r boiling points; of the simplest, P3N3(OCH 2CF 3)6, has a boi ling p oint of at 0.02 kPa.

As with the ph osphorus acids and esters, it is unlikel y that phosph onitriles would have a ny global environm ental i mpact. This is particularly true due to t heir very low volatilities. f. Overall Ass essment. A num ber of phosphonitriles h ave been show n to be excellent extingu ishants in laboratory and carefully controlle d field conditions; however, the exceedingly low volatilities make it unlikel y that these could be practical total floodi ng extinguishants unless delivered as mists. T o the extent m isting is practical for suppressing aircraft fires, this fam ily is worth a f urther look.

The f ollowing tabl e shows the high effectiveness of co mpounds containing direct phosphor us to halogen bonds i n reducing the bur ning velocities of hexane flames relative to halon 1 301 (CF 3Br).109 Mu ltiple values for a particular com pound are from different investigators as reported in the surve y paper cited. No te that these results are true for low conc entrations, where chemistry is believed to pla y a major role. At higher concentrations, the effects of hea t capacity and dilution may make th e relative effi ciencies smaller. POCl 3 is about 1 0 times more effective than an equivalent am ount of chlorine.112 Of particular interest is that th ere appears to be little difference between the chlorine-containin g and the brom ine-containing compounds. Th is may indicate that phosp horus pla ys a primary role. Flam e inhibition results do not alway s translate to flam e suppression efficiency. There is one report113 of PBr 3 effectiveness on real- scale fl ames, indicating an effectivenes s two orders of magnitude better than halo n 1301.

Compounds containing direct phosph orus t o halogen bonds h ydrol yze readily , forming injurious phosphorus-cont aining acids and halides. For exam ple, phosphorus tri bromide will hydrolyze to give H 3PO 3 and HBr. Alth ough there is so me indication that h ydrolysis is likel y to be lower for fluorine-p hosphor us bo nds than for bonds of with other halogens, hexafluoroc yclotriphospha zene (P 3N3F6) has been shown to be to xic in a manner consistent with hydrolytic for mation of acids.114 Further st udy is needed to determ ine whether perfluorinated co mpounds will have a sufficiently low hy drolysis rate to give the m an acceptable toxicit y. c. Materials Compatibility. Owing to read y acid form ation from hydrolysis, com pounds of phosph orus containin g phosphorus-halo gen bon ds are e xpected to b e highl y corrosive toward metals. Materials compatibility may be less of a problem for such com pounds as PF 3 and O=PF 3, where the rate of hydrolysis may be lower. d. Colligative Properties. The adjacent tab le contains data for several phosphorus halides15,18. As expected, volatility decreases with d ecreasing fluorine content and increasing bromine content.

Thus, despit e the expected or known hi gh toxicities and corrosiveness, it would be valuable to verify the flame suppression data. Further, it would be useful to examine the possibl y more stable, totall y fluorinated co mpounds, PF 3 and O=PF 3.

Nonfluori nated phosphi nes are flammable, and it is not cl ear that fluorin ation will de crease this. For exam ple, P(CF 3)3 is reported to be spontaneousl y flammable.115 b. Toxicity.

Only com pound s where most or all of the g roups are halogen atom s are stable. This is due to two factors. First, direct substitution stabili zes the higher oxi dation state (+5). Second, there is decreased steric bulk from halogen atoms than from organic substituents. Halogen atoms attached to phosphorus are, however, subject to hydrol ysis, leading to si gnific ant toxic hazard. c. Materials Compatibility.

Copper-containing Compounds This includes inorganic an d organic co mpounds containing di valent or m onovalent Cu. a. Fire-Suppression Effecti veness. The existing data on the fire suppression efficiency of these compounds is contradictor y. CuO was found t o be inef fective for suppression of a methane flame128 and was char acter ized as a ther mal inhibitor.124 Cuprous c hloride (CuCl ), however, was found to be an effective inhibitor in m ethane fla mes. T he inhibiti on effectiveness of CuCl relative to CF 3Br is 4 to 12 based on flame spe ed measure ments in methane/air f lames.116 Dol an and Dem pster128 found that 2O, CuO, CuCl, and CuCl 2 were all ineffective at suppressing the ignition of methane/air flames. b. Toxicity. Copper is one of several metals that are esse ntial to life. C opper m etal is non-to xic. T he inhalation of dusts, fum es, and m ists of copper salts , however, can cause congesti on t and mucous is 470 mg/kg.129 is 200 m g/kg. Cop per chloride and sulfate have been reported as causing irritation of t he skin. Cupro us oxide is irrita nt to t he eyes and upper respiratory tract. c. Materials Compatibility. There are no known issues. d. Colligative Properties. The inorganic salts ar e all s olids and would need to be used as a dispersed aerosol. As shown in t he following tabl e, the bo iling points of t he organom etallic co mpounds could be considerably lower. Whether fluorinati on woul d bring any of the m into a usef ul range for dispersion as a neat fluid remains to be seen. Compound BP (\u00b0C) 422 e. Environmen tal Impact. Copper is bot h an essential and potential ly toxic element.121 There are health related effects associated with either too little or too m uch in the environment. There are concerns that copper pl ays a role in t he cataly tic formation of chlorinated di oxins duri ng incineration. Agricultural soils with a limit of 2 kg to 3 kg Cu per year are considered accepta ble. In Switzerland, the limit for drinkin g water is 1.5 m g/kg Cu. f. Overall Ass essment. The fire suppressi on effectiveness of copper-containing c ompounds is still open to question. A short set of screening tests woul d indicate whether further exam ination is warranted.

Titanium-co ntaining Compounds These include com pounds containing tetravalent Ti bound to inorganic or organic ligands. The +1 and +3 oxidatio n states exist, but h ave not been studied. a. Fire-Suppression Effecti veness. Only one titanium -containing c ompound (Ti Cl4) has been investigated, and its fire suppression efficiency is high. The coefficient of effectiveness of TiCl 4 relative to CF 3Br is 5.5 based on fla me spe ed measure ments in hy drogen/air and hexane/air fla mes.106,126 Data on suppression concentrations are absent. Other co mmon titanium com pounds are high-m elting solids, which make t hem unsuitable for use as f ire suppressants. b. Toxicity. Titanium metal is non-to xic. T hus, the harmfu l effects of so me of these com pounds derive from products of the anion (e.g., hydroc hloric acid in the case of titani um tetrachloride). Titanium is not absorbed or accu mulated i n the hum an body. The toxicity of TiCl 4 is high (in halation): the L C50(mice) is 10 m g/m3 for 2 hrs. c. Materials Compatibility. TiCl 4 is highly reactive and corrosive. It liberates HCl on contact with H2O. Colligative Properties Compound (\u00b0C) MP (\u00b0C) Hv (kJ/m ol at BP) TiCl 4 136 -30 39 e. Environmen tal Impact. It was suggested that titanium should no t be considered within the scope of human monitoring. Titanium dioxide is classifi ed as a nuisance dust.121 Monitoring m ay be necess ary in the case of other titanium com pounds as organic titani um derivatives. f. Overall Ass essment. While TiCl 4 is an effective sup pressant and does have some volatility , it is not suitable for routine use as an exti nguishant because of its tendency to liberate HCl. Other common Ti compounds, s uch as TiO 2, are solids and do n ot appear to have pro perties that wo uld m ake them more attractive can didates than other metallic compounds r ecommended in this report.

Manganese-containing Compounds These are compounds containing Mn b ound to inorganic or organi c as Mn+2. Synt co mpounds, however, are known in nearly valences between -3 and +7. a. Fire-Suppression Effecti veness. There are practically no data on fire suppression pr operties of manganese- containing com pounds. Manganese acet ylacetonate is a very effective inhibit or based on data obtained fro m an ethanol/air counterflow burner exp eriments. It was found to be more effective than iron pentacarbonyl on a m olar basis.119 Methy lcyclopentadieny l as an antiknock fuel additive. b. Toxicity. Although inorga nic manganese compounds tend to be l ow in toxicit y, the m ore volatile organom etallics (those containing m etal to carbon b onds) are likely to be m ore toxic. Fum es and dust of manganese compounds can cause centr al nervous s ystem and pulm onary system damage. Chronic poisonin g is possible for exposures over several months. LC 50 (rat, inhalation, 7 hr) for MMT is 76 mg/m3 and LD 50 (rat, oral) is 50 mg/kg.129 c. Materials Compatibility. There are no known issues. d. Colligative Properties. Compound BP (\u00b0C) MP (\u00b0C) 2 1017 613 e. Environmen tal Impact. Manganese com pounds do not present any known environm ental r isks.121 There are so me regulations on the m aximum allowab le levels. The maxim um allowable concentration at workplaces f or an 8 hour day is up to 5 m g/m3 in the U.S.121 f. Overall Ass essment. There is a paucity of data on t he fire suppression properties of these compounds, but what little there is point s to a high degree of effect iveness.

Antimony-containing Compounds Antim ony may exist in oxi dation states -3, +3, +4 or +5. More th an 3000 orga nic ony co mpounds are known. a. Fire-Suppression Effecti veness. The fire suppressi on efficiencies of antim ony containing compounds a re high. T he coefficient of effectiveness of SbCl 3 relat ive to CF 3Br is 4.6 based on flame speed measurem ents in hydrogen/air an d hexane/air flam es.130,126 Data on extincti on concentrations of antim ony com pounds are absent. Fire suppression da ta are availab le for the foll owing antim ony corresponding iodides (SbI 3 and SbI 5) are also stable, but have not been tested for fire suppression effec tiveness. b. Toxicity. Most antim ony-containing co mpounds are highl y toxic via oral, inhalation and intraperitoneal routes. Locally, these compounds are irr itant to the skin and m ucous membranes. Toxicit y (inhalation) o f SbCl 3 is ver y high; the T CLO(human) is 73 m g/kg.129 c. Materials Compatibility. Antimony tri chloride is hi ghly reactive and corrosive. It liberates HCl upon contact with H 2O. d. Colligative Properties. Compound BP (\u00b0C) MP (\u00b0C) SbCl 3 283 73 SbCl 5 3 79 SbBr 3 280 96.6 e. Environmen tal Impact.

There are industrial standards lim iting worker exposure to particulates.121 Zoller131 cites evide nce for the introducti on of int o the environm ent throug h incin eration and d umping. There are industrial standards for lim iting workplace exposure to Sb particulates, which range from 0.2 mg/ m3 to 2 mg/m3. f. Overall Ass essment. The potential as fire suppressan ts is offset by concerns about the hi gh toxicit y and environm ental i mpact of these co mpounds. No Further Study Further Stu dy High Priority for Further Stu dy Well studied Lightl y studied X Completely unstudied Estimated 65 H. Germanium-containing Compounds These are compounds containing di valent or tetraval ent Ge bound t o inorganic or organic liga nds. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. Although data on t he interaction of germ anium-containing compounds with flam es is limited, there is so me indication that some of these com pounds may posses a high degree of fire suppression efficiency. The coeffi cient of effect iveness of GeCl 4 relative to CF 3Br is 2.2 based on flame speed mea surements in hexane/air fla mes.106 It is not clear whether the observed inhibiti on is due to the Ge itself or the abilit y of the GeCl 4 to deliver Cl ato ms into the reaction zone of the fla me. b. Toxicity. Germanium compounds are considered to be of low toxicity . Little is known about the toxicit y of organic germ anium compounds; the y may resem ble other organom etallics in having higher toxicit y than inorganic for ms. The toxicity of GeCl 4 is moderate (irritation to ski n, eyes).129 c. Materials Compatibility. Liberates toxic fumes of chlorides when heated or upon reaction with H2O [2]. d. Colligative Properties. Compound BP (\u00b0C) MP (\u00b0C) (kJ/m ol BP) GeF 4 -36.5 GeCl 4 83 -49.5 35 GeBr 2 150 143 GeBr 4 186 26 e. Environmen tal Impact. Unknown. T here are no air or occupation al standards for germanium , except ger manes in the USA. The ecotoxicit y of these co mpounds is also considered to be low.121 f. Overall Ass essment. Althoug h there i s evidence that indicat es the germ anium halides are effective suppressants, this potential is offset by cost and m aterials co mpatibility issues. No Further Study Further Stu dy High Priority for Further Stu dy Well studied Lightl y studied X Completely unstudied Estimated 66 I. Silicon-containing Compounds These co mpounds contain tetravalent Si bound to norganic or orga nic ligands. a. Fire-Suppression Effecti veness. Data on flame su ppression dem onstr ate ineffectiveness o f silicon containing co Burni ng velocit y measurem e (SiCl 4, Si(CH 3)4) indicate that silicon com pounds may have some inhibition effectiveness at low concentration additions.106 List of studie d pounds: SiCl . b. Toxicity. Compounds containing silic on directl y bonded to halogens are highly toxic owing to rapid hydrolysis of the silicon-halogen bond. Limited testing of industrial chem icals indicates that stable silane derivatives have a low toxi city.129 A number of siloxanes used industrially have a low toxicit y. Toxicit y of SiCl 4 is moderate via inhalation route .129 c. Materials Compatibility. The silicon halides, including SiF 4 and SiCl 4, liberate acid gases ( HF and HCl) upon re action with H 2O. Colligative Properties. Compound BP (\u00b0C) MP (\u00b0C) ol BP) -70 32 Si(CH 3)4 27 27 -65 e. Environmen tal Impact. Silicon is a common element and signif icant terrestri al environm ental impacts due onl y to silicon itself are unlikely. Ther e are industrial standards lim iting worker exposure to particulates. Estim ations reporte d indic ate that silicon com containing br omocarbon substituents should have at mospheric lifeti mes on the order of da ys and ODP values less than 0.02.114 f. Overall Ass essment. Com pounds containing a silicon-halogen bond are unacceptable due to their tendency to liberate HCl (o r other acid gases) upon reaction with H 2O; organosili con com pounds, such as TMS, are flammable. There do not appear to be any other m embers of this fam ily of com poun ds having properties that would m ake them superior candidat es to the other co mpounds recommended in this report.

Iron-containing Compounds These co mpounds contain Fe bound to i norganic or organic ligands. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. The f ire suppression efficiency of iron-containing com pounds is high. The coefficient of effectiveness of iron pentacarbony l and ferrocene relativ e to CF 3Br is 50-10 0 based on flame spe ed measure ments in methane/air and hexane/air fla mes.106,132,133 Measured ext inction concentrations for iron pentacarbony l are 1.7 % (ethanol flam e134) and 0.23 % for methane flame (0.01atm ).135 Ewing et al., fo und 0.08 % to 0.1 % for K 4Fe(CN) 6.3H 2O in an n-heptane fla me.118 The list of iron containing com pounds for w hich flame su ppression and/or extinction data exists include: iron com pounds have relativel y low toxicity. Highl y vol atile iron compounds a re more likel y to be t oxic. Iron pentacarbony l is highl y toxic, a lung irritant, and causes damage to kidne ys and liv er.114 The toxicity of ferrocene, however, to be m odera te (oral): LD 50(rat) =13 50 m g/kg.129 c.

None of the transition m etal co mpounds are expected to show global e nvironm ental im pact due to the metal itself. f. Overall Ass essment. The high flam e inhibition effectiveness of these co mpounds has alread y been established, but no flam es or fires have been suppressed by an iron- containing com pound. There is also the issue of their effective d elivery to the fire, which is being addressed in other N GP projects.

Tin Compounds These co mpounds contain either divalent or tetrav alent Sn bound to inorganic or organic ligands. a. Fire Suppression Effectiveness. The f ire suppression efficiency of tin-containi ng com pounds is expected to be high. The coeffi cient of effectivenes s of SnCl 4 relat ive to CF 3Br is 5.7 based on flame speed measurem ents in hydrogen/air an d hexane/air flam es.106,126 The fire suppression effici encies of the following ti n containing co mpounds have been investigated: SnCl 2, SnCl 4, Sn(CH 3)4 Toxicity. The biolo gical effects of tin co mpounds a re almost exclusively determined b y the nature and the num ber of grou ps bound to the ti n atom .121 Inorganic tin salts are of low order of to xicity. Tin halides, including S nCl2 and SnCl 4, are known to unde rgo rapid hydrolysis form ing acid halid es, which are toxic b y inhalation.129 Some organot in com pound s exhibit acute toxicit y that generally decreases in the order R 3SnX > R 2SnX 2 > RSnX 3, where R is a cov alently bound organic liga nd and X represents an anionic group attached to the tin via an electronegative atom such as a halogen or ox ygen.121 c. Materials Compatibility. The tin halides are highly reactive and c orrosive due to the form ation of HCl and/or ot her acids upo n contact with H 2O.129 d. Colligative Properties. Compound BP (\u00b0C) MP (\u00b0C) Hv (kJ/m ol at BP) mental im pact of water soluble, inor ganic tin com pounds is minim al.
