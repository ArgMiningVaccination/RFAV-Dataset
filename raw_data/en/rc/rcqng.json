These data suggest that natural- and vaccine-induced antibodies can still neutralise these variants, but at lower levels. Importantly, the P1 'Brazilian' strain may be less resistant to these antibodies than first feared. Professor Gavin Screaton, lead scientist on the study, said: \"This study extends our understanding the role of changes in the spike protein in escape from the human immune response, measured as neutralising antibody levels. The results suggest that P1 might be less resistant to vaccine and convalescent immune responses than B1351, and similar to B117.\" In the pre-print publication, [available on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.435194v1), the authors report on the neutralization of these strains when using blood samples from both people who have natural antibodies generated from a COVID-19 infection and from those with antibodies generated from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca and BNT162b2 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. These data show a nearly three-fold reduction in the level of virus neutralisation by the antibodies generated by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccines for the B.1.1.7 (Kent) and P.1 (Brazil) variants when compared to the original 'Victoria' strain, and a 9-fold and 7.6-fold reduction respectively against the B.1.351 'South Africa' strain Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigation on the Oxford University vaccine trial, said: \"These further efforts to investigate the relationship between changes in the virus and human immunity provide new insights that help us be prepared to respond to further challenges to our health from the pandemic virus, if we need to do so.\" The authors comment that as P.1 and B.1.351 contain very similar changes in the receptor binding domain, it was assumed that the neutralizing antibodies would be similarly affected, meaning that vaccination will likely still provide some protection against P.1. They believe that the drop in vaccine efficacy against mild to moderate disease against B.1.351 is likely a reflection of the mutations occurring outside the receptor binding domain. They further highlight that given the large reductions in neutralization tires, developing vaccine constructs to B.1.351 should be the greatest priority for vaccine developers globally.

It is based in purpose-built laboratories on the University of Oxford's Biomedical Research Campus in Headington, one of the largest concentrations of biomedical expertise in the world. With more than 400 active researchers and around 70 employed in administrative and support roles, the Centre is an international leader in genetics, genomics and structural biology. We collaborate with research teams across the world on a number of large-scale studies in these areas. Our researchers expend close to \u00a320m annually in competitively-won grants, and publish around 300 primary papers per year. Oxford University's Medical Sciences Division is one of the largest biomedical research centres in Europe, with over 2,500 people involved in research and more than 2,800 students. The University is rated the best in the world for medicine and life sciences, and it is home to the UK's top-ranked medical school. It has one of the largest clinical trial portfolios in the UK and great expertise in taking discoveries from the lab into the clinic. Partnerships with the local NHS Trusts enable patients to benefit from close links between medical research and health care delivery. The University of Oxford has been placed number 1 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for the fifth year running, and at the heart of this success is our ground-breaking research and innovation. Oxford is world-famous for research excellence and home to some of the most talented people from across the globe. Our work helps the lives of millions, solving real-world problems through a huge network of partnerships and collaborations. The breadth and interdisciplinary nature of our research sparks imaginative and inventive insights and solutions. Through its research commercialisation arm, Oxford University Innovation, Oxford is the highest university patent filer in the UK and is ranked first in the UK for university spinouts, having created more than 200 new companies since 1988.
