Summaries Of The News: [ Despite Internal Strife, NRA's Clout Still Evident After One Phone Call Convinces Trump To Sideline Background Checks ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/despite-internal-strife-nras-clout-still-evident-after-one-phone-call-convinces-trump-to-sideline-background-checks/) President Donald Trump spoke with NRA chief Wayne LaPierre about the possibility of universal background checks. At the end of the call, the president reassured LaPierre that those were off the table. Meanwhile, following Trump's claims that mental illness was at the root of the recent mass shootings, federal officials made sure no government experts might contradict him. Agency staffers were warned not to post anything on social media related to mental health, violence and mass shootings without prior approval. Other news on gun violence and safety focuses on young voters and Facebook sellers. [ The New York Times: N.R.A. Gets Results In One Phone Call With The President ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/trump-gun-control-nra.html) President Trump spent at least 30 minutes on the phone Tuesday with Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, the latest conversation in an aggressive campaign by gun rights advocates to influence the White House in the weeks since the back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. The call ended the way that Mr. LaPierre had hoped it would: with Mr. Trump espousing N.R.A. talking points in the Oval Office and warning of the radical steps he said Democrats wanted to take in violation of the Second Amendment.

The president reportedly asked LaPierre whether the NRA was willing to give in at all on background checks. LaPierre's response, the sources said, was unequivocal: \"No.\" With that, \"the Rose Garden fantasy,\" as the NRA official described it to me, was scrapped as quickly as it had been dreamed up. (Plott, 8/20) [ The Washington Post: Trump Tells NRA Chief That Universal Background Checks Are Off The Table ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-tells-nra-chief-that-universal-background-checks-are-off-the-table/2019/08/20/deae5b5a-c39a-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html) Trump told LaPierre that the White House remained interested in proposals that would address weapons getting into the hands of the mentally ill, including the possibility of backing so-called \"red flag\" laws that would allow the police to temporarily confiscate guns from people who have been shown to be a danger to themselves or others. Nonetheless, the president's conversation with LaPierre, which was first reported by the Atlantic, further reduced hopes that major new gun-safety measures will be enacted after the latest round of mass shootings.

And we're looking at different things,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. He didn't elaborate on what areas he considers lacking, talking instead about looking at mental-illness issues.

Before he ran for president in 2015, he supported restrictions championed by Democrats, but now he fears upsetting his hardcore Republican supporters \u2014 especially as he heads into what polls indicate will be a difficult reelection race.

Richard Blumenthal said Tuesday that he and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham are \"very, very close\" to introducing \"red flag\" legislation to curb gun violence.The bipartisan bill would assist states in adopting red flag laws by creating a federal grant program. The grants would go to law enforcement \"so they can hire and consult with mental health professionals to better determine which cases need to be acted upon,\" Graham, R-S.C., said in a statement.

Kim Reynolds said Tuesday she will \"take a look at\" multiple ways to prevent gun violence, adding that she has already done a lot toward that goal. But Reynolds did not take a position on any specific gun-related laws. Some Republican elected officials including Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, say they support the concept of \"red flag\" laws. Those can allow police or family members who see warning signs in others to seek a court order temporarily blocking that person from accessing a gun. (Sostaric, 8/20) [ WBUR: Mandatory Gun Insurance? San Jose Mayor Says It's Part Of The Solution ](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/08/20/gun-insurance-san-jose-mayor) Less than a month after a mass shooting in California, San Jose is considering a proposal that would make it the first city in the U.S. to require gun owners to carry liability insurance. Mayor Sam Liccardo, who introduced the legislation last week, says the mandate would follow the \"harm reduction\" approach used with car insurance: rewarding safe behavior, while covering the cost of accidents and neglect.

A Health and Human Services directive on Aug. 5 warned communication staffers not to post anything on social media related to mental health, violence and mass shootings without prior approval. That alarmed some government mental health experts who said they felt muzzled at a moment when many Americans were searching for answers to the U.S. epidemic of mass shootings, said three agency employees. (Abutaleb and Wan, 8/20) [ The Hill: Federal Health Officials Were Ordered Not To Post About Mental Health After Trump Linked It To Shootings: Report ](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/458183-federal-health-officials-were-ordered-not-to-post-about-mental-health) An HHS employee told the Post he had \"no doubt this was meant to prevent anybody from making any statements that might contradict the president.\" \"We understand we're not supposed to contradict the president, but it's not typical\" for the administration to mandate senior officials clear social media posts, he added.

The students are speaking out for the first time since 31 people were killed in one weekend in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio. They hope their plan \u2014 unveiled Wednesday morning \u2014 will be considered by President Trump as well as his Democratic presidential rivals and will serve as a catalyst for a surge of youth voters next year.

Marketplace at a time when more mass shootings in the U.S. have renewed the debate in Washington over access to firearms. The Marketplace feature, which Facebook launched four years ago, enabled its more than two billion users to buy and sell almost any secondhand item by clicking a button on their home page. However, the private sale of many items, including guns, is specifically forbidden under Facebook policy.

As early as Wednesday, DHS could release new regulations that replace those protections. The New York Times takes a look at this history, the impact and the frustrations that have come from the agreement. In other news on immigration: more states sue over \"public charge\" rule, officials say detainees won't be vaccinated for the upcoming flu season, and the government eyes a California location for a new shelter. [ The New York Times: The Flores Agreement Protected Migrant Children For Decades. It's Under Threat. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/flores-migrant-children-detention.html) Nearly 35 years ago, long before the current mass influx of Central American families making their way to America's southern border, a different and more brutal migrant crisis was unfolding. In El Salvador, government death squads were stalking suspected insurgents. Farmers, human rights activists and even priests were being caught in the crossfire. The widening civil war would leave more than 75,000 people dead, and send tens of thousands of people fleeing to the United States.

The final rule, which will likely require court approval before it becomes effective, outlines standards for the care of migrant children and families in the custody of federal immigration authorities.

We Found Substantive, Sloppy Mistakes. ](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-rushed-on-a-sweeping-immigration-policy-we-found-substantive-sloppy-mistakes) This month, the Trump White House unveiled a new policy it had aggressively pushed through the regulatory process that makes it much harder for low-income immigrants, especially those who had used public benefits, to come to or remain in the United States. The proposal \u2014 known as the \"public charge\" rule, since it creates a complicated test to determine whether an immigrant is \"likely to be a public charge\" \u2014 has the potential to dramatically restrict who's allowed to settle in the country. And many people who work with immigrants, including social service providers and local and state governments, are worried that it will scare them away from using benefits they and their families need to thrive.

The states and city join a growing list of entities suing over the change, one of the Republican administration's most aggressive moves to restrict legal immigration.

The proposal, which was posted earlier this month on the Federal Business Opportunities website, comes at a time when the number of minors in federal custody has dipped since the beginning of the year but still remains at historic highs.

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has enacted emergency regulations that would stop a planned federal shelter for unaccompanied migrant children in Northwest Washington. The emergency rules prohibit the city's child welfare agency from licensing facilities housing more than 15 residents. That would block a 200-bed shelter that a federal contractor is trying to open in the Takoma neighborhood, part of the Trump administration's efforts to address a surge of minors apprehended at the southern border without a parent.

Department of Veterans Affairs officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

He had their lives in his hands, prosecutors said in unsealing their indictment. But his addiction and attempts to cover it up with lies and dangerous practices \u2014 even after VA paid for a lengthy inpatient treatment program \u2014 led to multiple deaths and other life-threatening trauma for veterans, they said.

As a result, he continued reviewing sensitive patient medical information while intoxicated, potentially issuing incorrect or dangerous diagnoses for thousands of veterans. In at least three cases, investigators believe that directly resulted in patient's deaths. On two of those occasions, the indictment says, Levy doctored medical records to make it appear that other pathologists agreed with his mistaken work.

The effort didn't lead to any real action, and the toll of death and addiction climbed.

[ The Associated Press: Guidelines Say More Women May Need Breast Cancer Gene Test ](https://www.businessinsider.com/guidelines-say-more-women-may-need-breast-cancer-gene-test-2019-8) More women may benefit from gene testing for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer, especially if they've already survived cancer once, an influential health group recommended Tuesday. At issue are genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. When they're mutated, the body can't repair damaged DNA as well, greatly increasing the chances of breast, ovarian and certain other cancers.

The hospital announced the milestone Tuesday, joining with GE Healthcare to open and staff the 8,000-square-foot center, to be known as CareComm. The center will use data to track patients at every stop of their care, streamlining operations and eliminating the chronic delays so common at hospitals. As a result, officials said, patients will receive better care and the hospital expects to save millions.

The House has only passed piecemeal drug pricing reforms and House Democrats have publicly feuded over how to approach larger, systemic issues, like how the government can best negotiate over the price of drugs.

Last month, American Regent began selling a product called Selenious Acid Injection, which is used for total parenteral nutrition, a way to provide nutrients to patients who cannot eat food.

Zolgensma, the first systemic gene therapy of its kind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved, appears to cure in one shot a rare muscle-destroying disease that can be a death sentence for infants and toddlers. (The kids still carry the gene mutation; they just don't exhibit the eventually fatal symptoms.) It's also the world's most expensive medication.

For example, Medicare spent $13.4 billion on the Nexium acid reflux pill between 2011 and 2017, but could have saved $12.7 billion if, instead, prescriptions were written for generic copies of the older version of the drug called Prilosec.

Yet two of the latest ideas are standbys of the left: foreign importation and pricing penalties, which are more about politics than results for patients.

Pritzker: \"I was proud to sign ... laws expanding insurance coverage for children whose allergies require lifesaving EpiPens ...\" ...As a physician, the hoopla seemed strange. What insurance company would not already cover a lifesaving, standard-of-care medicine like epinephrine? Wouldn't the company risk significant liability if somebody died as a result?

Today, I am concerned about efforts to blame mental illness and people with disabilities as a cause for the mass shootings that plague our country. Leading the erroneous charge is President Trump, who says \"mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger\" in mass shootings, refers to perpetrators as \"mentally ill monsters,\" and suggests a solution of \"involuntary confinement\" for some with mental illness.

But when it comes to addressing America's gun problem, Mr. Trump has proved both conventional and weak. As the shock fades of this month's back-to-back massacres in Texas and Ohio, he is poised to disappoint yet again.

President Trump was promising \"very meaningful background checks\" in the wake of two gruesome mass shootings. He insisted that congressional Republicans would \"lead the charge\" for new gun legislation, which would have been a tectonic shift in the politics of guns that only sustained pressure from a figure such as Mr. Trump could possibly have produced.

[ The Hill: The Unanticipated Consequences Of Vaping: Implications For Policy ](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/458083-the-unanticipated-consequences-of-vaping-implications-for-policy) The pervasiveness of e-cigarette vaping has significantly increased among all age groups despite emerging evidence that the practice may be harmful. Some of the features of the devices contribute to these concerns. The e-cigarette inhalation system delivers nicotine as an aerosol instead of smoke. The emissions are lower than those found in combustible tobacco products. However, particles are smaller in vaping compared with combustible cigarettes and result in more toxic chemicals reaching deeper into the lungs. Vaping increases exposure to heavy metals, such as nickel, tin, and lead. Some \"buttery\" flavors contain diacetyl, a chemical linked to serious lung disease. A number of other chemicals are released during vaping which are potentially hazardous, including acetaldehyde, benzene, cadmium and formaldehyde, to name a few. (Sue Andersen, Diana H.

A month later, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed a rule requiring hospitals to make more price information publicly available. The lack of price transparency behind these efforts is the driving force behind my company \u2014 but even if it means taking attention away from what we're doing, I wholeheartedly support these moves.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who every now and then sounds like she has room for a step-by-step approach. Harris and others who have decided against full-blown Medicare-for-all should be commended, not ridiculed as \"small thinkers\" for eschewing an enormously costly and choice-averse concept at a time Americans want discrete, concrete things (e.g., low drug prices). By listening to experts and voters, watching poll numbers and thinking strategically about how to beat Trump, Harris likely made the best political decision, long-term, for her campaign.

Yet it is not the sole cause, so it is easy for the remaining small band of climate change deniers to disavow its true impact.
