It is adminstired by \"laying on hands\" and is based on the idea that an unseen life force energy flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If our life force energy is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress. However, if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy. The word \"Reiki\" is the combination of two Japanese words: Rei, which means \"the wisdom of a higher power\" and Ki, which means \"life force energy\". Therefore, Reiki is actually \"spiritually guided life force energy\". A treatment feels like a glowing radiance which flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person, including body, emotions, mind and spirit which creates many beneficial effects, including relaxation, feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results. Reiki is a simple, natural, safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that anyone can use. It has been effective in helping numerous conditions and ailments creating a beneficial effect. It also works in conjuction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. Reiki works with your chakra energies to achieve balance. Chakras are energy centers found in the midline of the body. There are seven primary chakras and they govern our psychological properties. Chakra is the sanskrit word meaning \"wheel\". These energy centers are spinning vortexes of energy which transmit spiritual, physical, mental and emotional energies. The seven chakras correspond to specific aspects of consciousness and have specific functions and characteristics. Each chakra is associated with a color and and vibrates the energy of this color. The chakras have varying levels of activity. The main focus in working with the chakras is to create a balance of energies and to create harmony in our consciousness between physical and emotional energies. We use Reiki to achieve this balance. A Reiki session lasts approximately 30-60 minutes and the patient remains fully clothed. One of the simplest ways to help balance the entire chakra system is to place a stone of the appropriate color on each area. This will give the chakra a boost of it's own vibration without altering it's energies or the overall harmony of the system. It is believed that the interaction between the stones and the chakras will return the chakra to a healthy vibration, which in turn helps heal the physical body. "}
