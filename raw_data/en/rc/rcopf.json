The 124 participants represented moststates, the United States Department of Agriculture and other publicagencies.The conference is held to improve the policy education efforts ofthose extension workers responsible for public affairs programs. Inturn, this should help citizens faced with solving local and nationalproblems make more intelligent and responsible decisions.Specific objectives were: 1) to provide timely and useful informa-tion on public issues; 2) to explore different approaches to conduct-ing public policy education programs; and 3) to share ideas and ex-periences in policy education.The Farm Foundation financed the instructional staff for, and thetransportation of one individual from each extension service to, thisconference which is planned in conjunction with the National PublicPolicy Education Committee. The Foundation also financed publica-tion and distribution of these proceedings which are made availableto state and county extension personnel, teachers, students andothers interested in increasing understanding of public policy issues.Larry D.

Lee, Jr.Mississippi State UniversityThe intervention of the United States government in agriculture inthe twentieth century is an explainable response to the basic charac-teristics of agriculture that generate instability, over-production anddepressed prices. The concentration of large benefits among rela-tively few producers and diffusion of costs over a large non-farmpopulation make policy reform difficult. The policies in place sincethe 1930s have had both positive and negative consequences from asocietal perspective. While farm policies have gradually become lessdistortive, less expensive and increasingly sensitive to a broader ar-ray of social concerns, such as the environment and food safety, theystill reduce the overall efficiency of the U.S. economy, regressivelyredistribute income and wealth, and divert the attention and energyof policymakers away from more pressing rural and social problems.Increasing the public's understanding of the consequences of alter-native policies is essential for policy reform and is both the oppor-tunity and awesome responsibility of public policy educators. THE STATUS OF AGRICULTURE IN 1993Marty StrangeCenter for Rural AffairsFive trends characterize American agriculture: Export depend-ence, diminished opportunity for beginning farmers, increasingly in-dustrial production systems that reduce access to open markets, theprivatization of science and interest in sustainable farming. Policyissues raised by these trends include the need to harmonize environ-mental, social and economic objectives of commodity programs, res-toration of credit programs aimed at beginning farmers, more effec-tive enforcement of anti-trust laws that address vertical market313 arrangements, redirection of publicly-funded agricultural science tonational policy objectives, and trade policy that seeks a more re-strained role for the U.S. farmer in the world food system. A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVEON CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGESIN U.S. FARM POLICYChip ConleyHouse Committee on AgricultureAgriculture policy is being pressured to change from directionsother than administration policies to reduce government involve-ment. Deficit reduction legislation passed in 1993 made only modestreductions in agricultural commodity program spending. Agricultureappropriations provide one means of changing policies through pro-gram reforms and reductions in program spending. The NationalPerformance Review to \"reinvent government\" will be anothersource of change as will trade policy liberalization and regulatorychanges. Budget pressures, beginning in 1995 when a new farm billmust be written, will challenge agricultural interests and pol-icyrnakers to make the most of diminishing federal resources. FARM GROUP PERSPECTIVEON U.S. FARM POLICYHarry BellAmerican Farm Bureau FederationThe 1994 farm bill will do much more than set prices. Interests out-side and inside agriculture will load legislation with measures thataddress food safety, land use planning, wealth redistribution, con-servation practices, government spending and trade. Environmentaland consumer groups will use the farm bill to mandate their brand ofpolitically correct agriculture. Various factions within agriculture willdebate food safety, chemical use, biotechnology and food costs, con-servation, sustainability and research for alternative crops and alter-native uses of traditional crops. The public policy message fromAmerica's farmers to youwe need your help to develop practicalapproaches to today's farming challenges and common sense waysto farm better, more economically and environmentally. 144 AN EVOLVING PUBLIC POLICY EDUCATION PUBLIC POLICY IN A CHANGING SOCIETYOtto DoeringPurdue UniversityMany believe government is not working. Remedies include a dif-ferent decision process, new values and new institutions. However,major changes in the nation itself must not be ignored. We are nolonger the. world's only economic powerhouse, our demographicsare different and fundamental values have already changed. Policydecisions are difficult because of an increasing and divisive focus onthe distribution of wealth and power. We need to better identifydrivers of change and core issues of concern to society if public pol-icy is to be more accessible, participatory and constructive for mostcitizens. INNOVATIONS IN PUBLIC POLICY EDUCATIONAlan J. HahnCornell UniversityChanges occurring in public policy education during the past fiveto ten years include: 1) richer and more complicated discussions ofadvocacy, 2) movement toward a genuine merger of content andprocess, 3) a richer and more complicated picture of how educa-tional impact happens and 4) development of better language to talkabout objectives and impacts. The emerging public policy educationconcept resonates with a widely-recognized societal need for betterways to practice politics. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESCLUTION APPROACHES TO .CONFLICT MANAGEMENTRonald C. FaasWashington State UniversityFor years, extension public policy educators have placed theirfaith in the standard alternatives/consequences model's three com-mon steps: 1) clarify the problem or issue; 2) develop alternatives;and 3) identify consequences of each alternative. An essential corol-lary of this model has been the notion of \"the teachable moment.\" 515 By extending the \"teachable moment,\" Alternative Dispute Resolu-tion can be seen as an enhancement of the alternatives/conse-quences model. COLLABORATIVEDISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSESRobert M. JonesFlorida State UniversityThe traditional use of litigation for dispute resolution can be timeconsuming and expensive, and has not always produced fair andwise solutions. Over the past decade, Alternative Dispute Resolution(ADR) processes such as mediation, negotiated rule making and pol-icy dialogues, have become more common features upon the publicpolicy landscape. ADR and Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) arevoluntary processes that involve many interests in a facilitatedormediated--face-to-face negotiation. The impartial facilitator, oftenselected by the participants, assists in defining issues, exploring theparties' mutual interests and those that divide them, generating andassessing options and reaching an acceptable solution. These con-sensus-based negotiations, in which the agreements must satisfy allparticipants' interests, have the potential for broadening the optionsavailable to those seeking an acceptable balance between conflictinggoals. USE OF ADR IN EXTENSIONPUBLIC POLICY EDUCATION PROGRAMSAND ROLES THAT EXTENSION CAN PLAYIN DISPUTE RESOLUTIONLeon E. Danielson and Simon K. GarberNorth Carolina State UniversityThe public policy educator has many roles at his or her disposal:Information Provider, Technical Advisor, Convener, Facilitator andProgram Developer. The increased importance of issues program-ming and the increased priority given to measurement of results arecreating additional pressures to take a \"resolution-of-the-issue\" ap-proach toward public policy education. Extension public policy edu-cators can respond by incorporating concepts and techniques fromdispute resolution into their ongoing public policy education pro-grams. This may involve an expansion of the group facilitation roleto include Issue Facilitation (citizen participation, interest-based ne-gotiation and consensus building) and adding the roles of Promoterto of Dispute Resolution andMediator. This change will require in-creased training on facilitation and mediation skills, provision of newteaching materials and increased support from extension administra-tion. FRAMING PUBLIC ISSUESAND WORKING WITH THE MEDIAJo Ann Myer ValentiBrigham Young UniversityHow the mass media frame an issue influences audience percep-tion, discussion and attitudes of acceptance or rejection, and impactsthe likelihood an audience will act on the issue presented. Thispaper argues that issueframing provides media with their mostpowerful effects and offersrecommendations for improving mediarelations and media attention to issues on the rural and farm agen-da. The paper also summarizes a moderated dialogue between thosein the audience at the 1993 National Public Policy Education Con-ference in Clearwater Beach, Florida, and a panel of journalists. BUILDING COALITIONS FOR EDUCATINGAND PROBLEM SOLVING:PROCESS, ROLES, WARNINGS AND STYLESFOR EXTENSION INVOLVEMENTFielding Cooley, Andy Duncan and Judy BurridgeOregon State UniversitySome educators pay close attention to planning the coalition build-ing process; others eschew process planning and operate by the seatof their pants. In either case educators can profit from using a vari-ety of styles when participating in learning and problem solvingcoalitions. Fielding Cooley's section of this presentation outlines acoalition building process and corresponding roles. Andy Duncandeals with some issues of practical application in the field and, final-ly, Judy Burridge relates roles and practice to issue education styles. 717 EDUCATIONAL COALITIONS,POLITICAL COALITIONSAND ROLES FOR EXTENSIONAlan of consensus-seeking coalitions is a reasonable goal for public policy educators; advocacy coalitions should probably be avoided. As extension increasingly works in coalitions, it needs to ar- ticulate a public policy education role that is both complementary to others and widely recognized as Unique and import,nt. HEALTH CARE REFORM ETHICAL ISSUES IN HEALTH CARE REFORMMark H. WaymackLoyola University ChicagoWhy is there a moral necessity for health care reform? What is the moral failure of our current health care delivery system? The cur- rent ethical crisis in health care delivery is rooted in our holding at least three different, conflicting conceptions of the ethics of health care delivery. First, we believe in an individual's right to medicalcare. Second, we regard health care as a business, obliged to theethics of business. Third, we believe the health care system has a moral obligation to care for and promote the public welfare. Jug- gling all three \"ethics\" simultaneously is responsible for our current moral predicament. HEALTH REFORM: WHAT THE CLINTON PLANAND ALTERNATIVESMEAN TO RURAL AND URBAN AMERICAEdward F. HowardAlliance for Health ReformHighlights of the Clinton health reform plan include universal cov- erage, managed competition within a budget, a standard benefitspackage, insurance reform and establishment of an overall limit for 818 N Ihealth care spending. States would set up alliances, administeringsubsidies for low-income people and low-wage employers, certifyinghealth plans, and running data collection and quality improvementprograms. Alternativesinclude two less intrusive \"managed com-petition\" proposals, an incremental plan featuring \"medical savingsaccounts,\" rather like IRAs and a \"single-payer\" Canadian-styleplan. We will have a health plan passed within the next year be-cause the political casefor reform is overwhelming. HEALTH CARE REFORM: THE IMPLICATIONSFOR HEALTH DATA SYSTEMSRonald C. YoungKansas State UniversityHealth reform, whether at the state or national level, will requiregreater attention to health care data base development. This paperreviews many of the issues that have faced states as they strive toimplement health care data bases and thereby draw policy implica-tions for national systems development. The general purpose of theinformation system must be clearly understood by policymakers,system managers and users alike. Like the purpose of the system,the scope, the control, the content and the use of the system will de-termine its nature and its effectiveness in supporting health care re-form. A CASE STUDY OF EXTENSION'S RESPONSETO HEALTH CARE REFORMLorraine GarkovichUniversity of KentuckyCurrent proposals for health care reform may not address the spa-tial inequalitiesthe differences in life chances that arise merelyfrom residential location in rural or urban placesthat affect accessto health care in America. Extension can help rural citizens focus thedebate so reforms address their limited access to health services. 1 9 e. PUBLIC ISSUES EDUCATION AND THE NPPEC PUBLIC ISSUES EDUCATION AND THE NPPECWalter J. ArmbrusterFarm FoundationPublic policy education evolved to allow extension staff to effec-tively educate on controversial public issues without taking a posi- tion. Public policy education specialists have always dealt with a wide range of topics, although the most visible educational materialsof the National Public Policy Education Committee (NPPEC) focusprimarily on agricultural commodity policy. The issues-alternatives-consequences model combines content expertise and process meth-odology. In recent years, the content embraced, as well as process developments, have expanded the usefulness of public, policy educa-tion. The current interest in public issues education provides realopportunities to increase extension staff understanding of how to ef-fectively educate on controversial issues. PUBLIC ISSUES EDUCATION:A COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM INITIATIVETO IMPROVE PUBLIC DECISIONSAyse C. SomersanUniversity of Wisconsin-ExtensionThe Cooperative Extension System has defined Public Issues Edu-cation as \"educational programs which have the objective of enhanc-ing the society's capacity to understand and address issues ofwidespread concern.\" The vision is to become the premier educa-tional resource to Americans as they relearn the practice of demo-cratic politics. The goal is to assist the citizenry to become active andproductive participants in the public decision-making process. The action agenda calls for Cooperative Extension staff' at all levels toembrace this effort and to build their content and process capacities. The expected outcome of the initiative is improved quality of publicchoices. 2010 PUBLIC ISSUES EDUCATION AND THE NPPECB. L. FlinchbaughKansas State UniversityIt is time the National Public Policy Education Committee (NP-PEC) truly broadens its base. Extension education on public policyissues must cut across many disciplines to provide the input citizensneed, in the Jeffersonian sense, to make informed decisions. Thereis room for family issues, national resource issues and, yes, evenprice and income policy for farmers. There is room for all of us toapply our unique expertise! The record on farm bill issues needs tobe replicated on other issues. It is time to fill the vacuum with someoxygen. What shall we call it? Public policy education, issue-basedprogramming, public issues education? That is immaterial! ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY: THE REGULATORY POLICY:THE LEGISLATIVEAND REGULATORY AGENDAMichael T. OlexaUniversity of FloridaEnvironmental policy issues of interest to agriculture and likely tobe addressed by the 103rd Congress include nonpoint source pollu-tion, wetlands, endangered species and pesticide issues related tofood safety and minor-use pesticide registration. If successfully ad-dressed through law, there still remains the problem of implementa-tion through regulation. The challenge for agency action will be toshape and implement regulations acceptable to diversified interests.The objective of this paper is to highlight the policy issv.s incur-rent legislative agenda, note the challenges for implementation ardbriefly address the opportunities that this agenda holds for exten-sion. 2111 IMPACTS OF REDUCED PESTICIDE USEON THE PROFITABILITYOF THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SECTORCharles Hall, Ron Knutson, Ed Smith,Sam Cotner and John MillerTexas A&M UniversityThis study determines the impacts of reduced chemical use onfruit and vegetable crops. Specifically, the yield and per unit cost im-pacts of eliminating the use of insecticides, fungicides and herbicideswas evaluated, as well as the impacts of a 50 percent reduction inthe number of applications. The impacts generally were substantialbut highly variable among regions and crops. The fresh marketcrops tended to experience larger yield reductions than the proc-essed market crops. Sweeping pesticide-use reduction involvingmore than one pesticide category would have more adverse (syn-ergistic) impacts on yield than strategies targeted toward particularpesticides. IMPACTS OF EPA DAIRY WASTE REGULATIONSON FARM PROFITABILITYRonald D. Knutson, Joe L. Outlaw and John W. MillerTexas A&M UniversityWith the initiation of dairy waste regulatory activity in Texas andFlorida during the early 1990s, questions have arisen regarding theimpacts of these regulations if extended throughout the UnitedStates. The Agricultural and Food Policy Center (AFPC) system ofrepresentative dairy farms provided A unique opportunity to evalu-ate the impacts of these regulations on dairy farm profitability if ex-tended to all other states. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICYAND NATURAL-RESOURCE-BASEDECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTTim PhippsWest Virginia UniversityEnvironmental policy involves trade-offs among alternative re- source uses, economic development and environmental quality. Formining, there are trade-offs between the economic value of the re- source and the environmental costs of extraction, processing and2 212 use. Forestry presents the perplexity of a resoul ce that has one typeof value when it is harvested and a mutually exclusive value as astanding forest. Fisheries add the complication of a resource that,has, in many areas, been severely damaged by nonpoint sources ofpollution. Finally, outdoor recreation is a crosscutting issue affectedby environmental quality and the decisions on forestry and fisherymanagement. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY: IMPACTS ONNATURAL-RESOURCE-BASEDECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTRobert Phillip JonesSoutheastern Fisheries AssociationClean air, clean water and clean land policies, if totally imple-mented, would have dramatic positive impacts on the economic de-velopment of the fishing industry. Public policy issues that need tobe re-examined include flawed science, netting ban, allocation of re-sources among user groups, water quality, endangered species, ma-rine mammal protection, coastal zone use, turtle excluder devices,by-catch reduction devices and transfer of marine resource manage-ment to game and fish commission. The elimination of commercialfishing would have monumental social and economic costs. Thereneeds to be a well-thought-out public policy toward production offood from the sea. TOURISM, NATURAL ENVIRONMENTSAND PUBLIC POLICYClyde F. Kiker and Andrew SeidlUniversity of FloridaTourism, although a significant economic sector worldwide andthe major sector in locations such as Florida and the Caribbean, hasreceived little explicit attention by economists and policy analysts.Especially poorly understood is the relationship of tourism to its nat-ural and social settings. Few explicit public policy forums exist fordealing with the wide array of unfolding issues. The dominant publicpolicy perspective of tourism is as a component of economic growth,as a means of increasingemployment. Issues concerning the qualityof the social and environmental Fe'ttings are just beginning to beraised. There are public policy c I ucation opportuaities in areaswhere tourism is an important sector and introduction of systematicinstitutional approaches can lead to improved public participation insetting the direction of tourism.t 3 The Status of Agricultureand Rural America 24 RURAL AMERICA AND THE INFORMATIONREVOLUTION: AN EXPLORATION OFPOSSIBILITIES AND POTENTIALITIESDavid Pearce SnyderConsulting FuturistOn the Threshold of the Twenty-first CenturyThe remarkable improvements sustained by American agricultureover the past century havecontributed immeasurably to our nationalquality of life, to our economic strength at home and our stature inthe larger global community. In spite of these singular achieve-ments, however, rural America appears not to have prospered allthat much, and the present outlook for the family farm is prob-lematical at best. In 1900, 60 percent of all Americans lived in smalltowns and rural areas, with more than 40 percent of us actually liv-ing on the land, on farms. Today, 25 percent of the U.S. populationlives in rural areas and just 1.9 percent on farms proper.Of course, 25 percent of 250 million Americans is still 62 millionpeople; a large rural nation by any standard. In fact, in absolutenumbers, our rural population is greater today than at any time inthe nation's history. A more troubling trend is the recent apparentdecline in rural prosperity. Median household income in rural areashas fallen or remained stagnant for most of the past twenty years,and poverty in rural areas has risen substantially.By 1990, rural poverty rates had begun to match U.S. urban lev-els, with 20 percent of rural households earning incomes at or belowthe poverty level. The slow growth and faltering prosperity of ruralAmerica are noteworthy when compared with the fact that, over thepast century, the amount of acreage under cultivation in Americahas essentially doubled from 25 percent of all U.S. land in 1890 to 51'percent in 1990, and there has been a twentyfold increase in annualagricultural income, from roughly $5 billion in 1890 to $100 billion in1990.The conventional explanation for rural decline in the face of bur-geoning agricultural productivity has been the \"industrialization\" ofAmerican farming through successive waves of technology. Againsta backdrop of rising andfalling national economic prosperity andepisodic surges in population, the march of technologic progressacross rural America hassteadily increased agricultural productivitythrough the replacement of labor by capital-intensive equipment and 1725 supplies. Simultaneously, workers, made redundant on the landover the past century, found economic opportunity in the citieswhere industrial technology created an endlessly expanding demandfor labor.So long as cities continued to offer attractive employment to sur-plus rural labor, the process of agricultural industrialization dis-rupted farm families' lives, but did not serve as a barrier to thesteady, generation-to-generation rise in their prosperity. Less fortu-nate were the generations of small farmers who remained on theland and always depended on non-farm earnings for- most of their in-come. So long as agriculture remained labor intensive; rural Amer-ica was densely populated with farmers,. farm workers and theirfamilies who needed a full range of basic goods and services. Thismarketplace demand, in turn, generated salaried employment toaugment the characteristically inadequate small farm income.Unfortunately, the workers made surplus to the agriculture sectortook their incomes with them when they migrated to the city. Withthe departure of that income, there was less demand for the retailtrade and consumer services that once provided supplemental em-ployment for the small farmers and their families. Over time, thosefarmers who adopted industrial technologies and scale of operationsprospered, while small-scale farmers increasingly operated at themargins of the economy and technology, to be wiped out by the hun-dreds of thousands during periods of economic downturn, such as1981-1983.Ultimately, technology changed the fundamental nature of farm-ing in America. Before the Industrial Revolution, the production offood and fiber was the dominant economic activity in the UnitedStates and, with the exception of a few bulk commodities, involvedmostly small-scale producers competing in local or regional markets.Today, in our mature industrial economy, a combination of produc-tion and distribution technologies have afforded America's farmersthe advantages of industrial-scale operations and access to massivenational and international markets, enabling fewer than 4 percent ofall establishments-100,000 farmsto produce more than 50 percentof the gross sales of the entire U.S. agricultural sector.The concentration of American farming into an ever-shrinkingnumber of larger and larger producing units is an entirely predict-able consequence of the industrialization of agriculture. Economistshave long understood the propensity of mature mass markets to be-come oligopolistic. And while farming is not nearly so concentratedas steel making or auto manufacturing, the underlying forces are thesame. Economies of scale give the large, well-managed producer somany competitive advantages over smaller producers in most massmarkets that, eventually, all small producers are either absorbed orotherwise eliminated from competition. There are no \"mom-and-2618 pop\" steel mills, no friendly neighborhoo refineries in mature,labor-intensive industrial America. A straight line extrapolation ofthe industrial model upon the U.S. agricultural sector suggests that,eventually, the traditional family farm will simply become unviablein the face of industrial-scale economics.Basically, America's small family farms have beenand will con-tinue to bethe victims of industrial era productivity-enhancing ag-ricultural technology. In fact, during the past twenty years, agri-cultural productivity has risen much faster than that of the nonfarmU.S. workplace, so that those displaced by greater efficiency on theland cannot easily find new careers in cities already filled with un-employed industrial workers made redundant by increasingly pro-ductive foreign manufacturers. Recently, moreover, the productivityof foreign farmers has even begun to challenge our once seeminglyunique capacity to increase the output of America's farms to feed notonly ourselves, but much of the rest of the world.Much of the rest of the world is now using the same technologiesthat have explosively increased our own agricultural productivity.The \"Green Revolu tion,\" its most powerful weapons first createdhere in America, has swept across the farmlands of the world, boost-ing the food production of both developed and developing nationsalike. Because of greater national self-sufficiency, the total volumeof world bulk crop exports has declined since the mid 1980s, as hasthe U.S. share of those exports. In response to the twin realities ofour own continuing increases in productivity and falling foreign de- mand, the U.S. has already taken more than 100 million acres ofcropland out of production in the past ten years, nearly a 30 percentreduction. Moreover, the conversion of the old Soviet Bloc to freemarket economics and private land ownership seems likely to makethe world's last great grain importer self-sufficient within less than adecade, further reducing global demand for America's surplus out-put.Taken together, the parametric trends of the recent past are con-verging to project a compelling vision of agriculture in Twenty-firstCentury America, in which 90 percent of commercial agriculturaloutput will be concentrated in the hands of fewer than 50,000 farmfirms, franchisees, co-ops, and holding companies. The remainder ofour agriculture sector in such a scenario would be made up of onemillion or so part-time, boutique and \"hobby\" farmers. Assumingthe continuation of agriculture productivity improvements at post-WWII rates, plus shrinking foreign demand and stable domesticmarkets, another 100 million acres of land are likely to be withdrawnfrom cultivation in the United States by 2025, with the number ofrural residents actually beginning to fall sometime shortly after theyear 2000.If the mass industrialization of our agriculture continues, humanhabitation will recede from the land, even in areas that are agri- 1927 culturally productive. Farmers, mostly salaried employees by 2025,will live in the still-dwindling numbers of viable rural communitiesmostly county seatsor in new communities built around interstatenighway junctions and interchanges. Many farmers and farm fami-lies displaced from agricultural production in this scenario will re-main trapped on the land, unable to find improved economic oppor-tunities in the cities. Characteristically, this is likely to drive ruralmarriage and fertility rates down to match urban rates. The ultimateevolution of this vision would be a Twenty-first Century rural Amer-ica in which most farmers will commute out to work at agriculturalproduction sites from towns that will increasingly be scattered likesocial oases in vast uninhabited \"deserts\" of high-tech, high-yieldfarmland.Happily, past trends alone do not dictate the future, although theyare powerful forces that instrumentally shape our institutions, oursocial utilities and our uses of technology. Equally powerful in shap-ing the future are future trends and developments. Free trade, forexample, if adopted worldwide, would almost certainly be a bo-nanza for U.S. agriculture, opening literally billions of mouths toAmerica's bounty as the superior free market producer of food. Un-fortunately, the expansion of free trade is dependent upon politicalaction, which is not reliably forecastable. However, demographicscan be reliably forecast, and the United States is already the world'sthird largest domestic market (254 million). With the passage ofNAFTA, that will expand to include Mexico's 90 million and Cana-da's 27 million. That 370 million is projected to grow to more than 550million people by 2050, as North Americaincluding the UnitedStatesis expected to experience the fastest population growthamong all of the mature industrial nations.With projected domestic market growth in the hundreds of mil-lions of people, U.S. agriculture obviously need not fear extinction,nor even, perhaps, acreage reductions. But what about the familyfarm and rural, small town America? Will these cultural icons of ourpast survive into our future only as distant memories, rural life farmmuseums and segments of history disks? Are there future realitiesthat will alter the long-term industrialization of American agri-culture? More importantly, are there compelling public interests orreasons for contravening this free-market trend, and are there legiti-mate policy options for doing so? To consider these questions at allmeaningfully, it is necessary to put them in the larger context of thenation as a whole and, in particular, of what is going on in the rest ofthe world's biggest economic enterprise, the United States of Amer-ica.The United States in the 1990sDuring the 1980s. U.S. nonfarm employers spent $1 trillion on newproduction technology, and their productivity did not go up any fast-2820 er than it did in the 1970s when they spent only $300 .billion on pro-ductivity-enhancing capital goods. From 1945 through 1965, U.S.productivityand personal incomeincreased about 3 percent peryear. In the past twenty years, by comparison, productivity andcompensation rose an average of .7 percent to .8 percent per year;less than inflation! As a result, real weekly wages for salaried U.S.workers during the same time period have actually fallen nearly 20percent, from $315 per week in 1972 to only $255 per week in Oc-tober, 1992. Median household income remained more or less un-changed over the same period, but only because millions of wivesand mothers entered the work force to augment their families' de-clining earnings.The failure of $1 trillion in new workplace technology to signifi-cantly improve U.S. productivity dismayed many observers, includ-ing the employers and stockholders who spent the money, and thesupply-side economists who had designed the credit policies and taxincentives to encourage the expenditures in the first place. Subse-quent economic reviews of the decade, plus research into tech-nology transfer and innovation rates, quickly revealed the source ofour failed expectations and the true nature of this momentour mo-mentin history.To begin with, it is now clear that America is in the middle of agenuine techno-economic revolution; the sort of transformationalevent about which historians write entire chapters in textbooks. Aswith all technological revolutions, the important reality is not thetechnology itself, but what the technology enables society to do. Inthe case of our own \"moment\" in history, computers and their relat-ed technologies are enabling us to shift from labor-intensive produc-tion to information-intensive production. By increasing the informa-tion content of every product and service, plus every operation andjob of every productive activity, and then equipping every employeewith the skills, resources and authority to make the best-informedplans and decisions, the productivity of every institution and everyworker can be hugely increased!But it will not happen overnight . .. or evenin a decade.It appears to take a generationforty to fifty yearsin order to in-corporate the full productive potential of a fundamentally new tech-nologic capability throughout all the levels and all the functions of allthe private and public institutions in an entire national economy. Itis, after all, a big project. Large systems are inherently stable, madeso by the considerable inertia of their multiple internal, inter-con-nected sub-systems. In a system the size of America, there are liter-ally hundreds of thousands of large sub-systemscorporations, fed-eral, state and local government agencies, schools, hospitals,churches, etc.each with spheres of interaction, overlapping con-cerns and both shared and conflicting interests. 2129 75Z- 60Z -Figure 1.

And, of course, thetechnology itself takes time to evolve. The first commercial com-puters (1953-1954) were fifteen-foot-long electro-mechanical technol-ogies weighing several tons, not at all like the electronic mini-mar-vels of today. And, while the 586-chip machine (introduced in April,1993) is five times more powerful than the 486-chip machines (whichwe have Ilot yet fully mastered), they are only one-fifth as powerfulas the 686-chip technology projected to hit the marketplace by 1996or 1997. Computers clearly have not yet fully evolved.All around us there is ample evidence that large systems changeslowly. But, just as importantly, they do change. And, over time,even incrementalism will produce revolutionary change. In the caseof America's current \"incremental revolution,\" the data suggest weare nearing the midpoint of our transition from labor-intensive pro-duction and management to information - intensive production andmanagement (see Figure 1). The data also show that, during the firsthalf of this forty- to fifty-year transition, the rate at which new, high-value jobs are created lags behind the rate at which existing high-value jobs are eliminated from labor intensive operations. It is thisphenomenon more than anything else that has led to the decline inaverage weekly wages in America, and the commensurate stagna-tion in family income both in the cities and the countryside.3 022 e Clearly, it is in everyone's interest for the nation's employers to ac-celerate the rate at which they create new, high-value, information-intensive jobs. Fortunately, the experience of the 1980s has shownus how to do this. Even so, revolutionary change is never easy. It in-volves us all not merely in one \"paradigm shift,\" but many \"para-digm shifts,\" changes in institutional cultures, in the collective ex-pectations and in the personal identities of every segment of theAmerican society and economy.It is, perhaps, comforting to know that the United States will notbe passing through this turbulent transformation alone. We will be inthe company of the other mature industrial nations of the world. Infact, as the inventors and developers of the new information technol-ogies, we entered this revolutionary period in the early 1970s andbegan to encounter significant structural job displacement about tenyears ago. The other mature industrial nationsnotably those inWestern Europe and the British Commonwealth and Japanen-tered the cycle about ten years later than the United States andhave only begun to experience serious structural unemployment inthe past two or three years.In all of the mature industrial economies, the temporary inefficien-cies of economic restructuring have had similar effects. Long-termincome growth has stagnated, constraining public sector revenuesand necessitating reductions in government programs. Millions ofjobs have been permanently eliminated, and underlying levels oflong-term unemployment have risen. In the United States, unionshave commonly accepted substantial reductions in pay and benefitsin exchange for continued employment, while German steel andauto workers have accepted four-day work weeks and, in Britain,where miners' unions have refused to make such concessions, thegovernment has simply shut down the coal mines.The mid-career displacement of hundreds of thousands of middle-class workers has provoked another common phenomenon through-out the industrial world: the rise of right-wing nationalist and racisthate groups and political movements, as those who have lost eco-nomic security seek redress by attacks on immigrants and minoritieswhom they blame for their diminished expectations. Such socio-po-litical turbulence is, of course, characteristic of periods of techno-eco:iomic transition, as historic accounts of Britain's original Indus-tial Revolution make clear. In the early Nineteenth Century, mobsof displaced workers stormed through the streets of Nottingham,Manchester and Leeds, breaking into mills and smashing the powerlooms whose prodigious output had eliminated their jobs.Thus, the recent economic stagnation in rural America must beconsidered in the larger context of the nation's economic restructur-ing. Current administration proposals to eliminate thirteen of forty-three U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agencies, 1,200 USDA 2331 field offices and 7,500 employees are much more a reflection of sys-tem-wide revenue constraints than they are the result of a nationalsentiment to reduce our commitment to progressive farming. Risingpoverty is not a special problem of rural America, but a commonproblem of all America. And the future of U.S. agriculture, like thefuture of U.S. manufacturing, banking or retailing, will be muchmore dependent on how U.S. farmers use new technology to addvalue to their operations than it will on American agriculture's abilityto mobilize political support for new farm programs or foreign tradeinitiatives.Lessons from the Eighties, Strategies for the NinetiesWhile the $1 trillion that American employers spent on workplacetechnology during the 1980s did not increase our productivity, it didbuy us a lot of valuable experience. In particular, we began to un-derstand the true nature of the information revolution and whatmust be done to derive improved performance from electronic info-com technology. The lessons of the 1980s, while learned principallyin America's factories and offices, are equally relevant to America'sfarms and rural communities. The universal application of theselessons, in turn, will be essential to the revitalization of all sectors ofthe U.S. economy and the restoration of our competitiveness andprosperity.To begin with, it is now clear that, in the Twenty-first Century, weare all going to be \"information\" workers. This does not mean wewill all have college degrees, wear tailored clothing and spend mostof our time at desks in offices. There will still be millions of blue col-lar and consumer service jobs in the Twenty-first Century, but alljobsfrom the shop floor to the executive suite, from the farm andforge to fast foods and pharmaceuticalsevery job will have moreinformation content in it. Moreover, to perform these jobs, it will benecessary for the worker to be able to use information to makeimportant decisions on a daily, hourly and moment-to-moment basis.In the words of Harvard professor Shoshona Zuboff in her prescientbook, The Age of the Smart Machine, in the 1990s, we are all going tobe \"informated.\"Already, hotels are training their bellmen to conduct structuredexit interviews of departing guests. Rental car lot attendants arebeing equipped with palm-top computers to calculate rental charges,record complaints and print receipts at carside. By the end of thedecade, essentially all factory workers will not only be expected touse computers on the line, but to use statistical process control andPereto analysis, and to work in performance improvement teamsmade up not only of co-workers, but representatives of suppliersand customers. Retailers are already being provided with ever-more-detailed, real-time information regarding which combinations 24 of products, promotions and display arrangements produce the high-est profits.Farmers, too, will increasingly be informated. Computerized ex-pert systems will improve crop and animal yields while reducingcosts. Electronic networks are providing a growing number of farm-ers with easy access to the latest agricultural research and moment-to-moment info, mation on future commodity demands and prices.Mounting pressure from ecologists to cleanse farming of all chem-icals in order to protect consumers and the environment from agri-cultural pollution is likely to force more stringent regulations uponfarmers, thereby accelerating the growth of organic farming with itsconsiderably more sophisticated information requirements. Produc-ing for global marketsand for more culturally diverse domesticNorth American marketscan also be expected to substantially in-crease the diversity of information required by food producers tocompete effectively.Distinctive Enterprise Attributes in the Information AgeBy purposefully incorporating more information into all of theirplanning and decision making, farmerslike those in all other pro-ductive enterprisescan improve the marketplace performance oftheir operations in three specific ways:Adaptive Enterprise. Under the industriai system of mass produc-tion for mass markets, individual enterprises have characteristicallyconcentrated on producing a limited number of outputs for a specificset of buyers or customers year-in, year-out. An interruption eitherin the supply of raw materials or customer demand generally leavesthe industrial-style producer at the mercy of external forces, with noalternate sources of supply or alternative buyer for the organiza-tion's products or services.The \"informated\" enterprise, by comparison, maintains an up-to-date inventory of alternate suppliers, distributors and buyers. Theinformed producer also knows the full range of outputs its existingresources may be used to produce. In anticipation of probablechanges in its operating environment, the adaptive enterprise \"infor-mates\" (trains) its employees to be able to perform a variety of tasks,as opposed to the single skills of industrial age workers. In fact, byinforming itself about probable changes in economic, technologicand social externalities, the informated enterprise is able to take ad-vantage of changes in its operating environment, creating new prod-ucts and meeting emerging marketplace demands, even as the rigid,reactive industrial-style producer seeks protection from the effects ofexternal change and longs for the good old days of \"business as usu-al.\" 2533 Precise Enterprise. As electronic info-corn technology continues torapidly increase the ease and reduce the cost of accessing andapplying useful information to all of our decisions, plans and designs,all products and services will be more precisely tailored to the spe-cific needs of individual buyers or users. Human factors engineers,for example, will incorporate ergonomic characteristics into the de-sign of all tools, work stations and production equipment, dramat-ically increasing general levels of user productivity over the nextgeneration of durable goods. Already, information products, frommass mailings and magazine advertising to in urance policies andcredit cards, are being targeted at narrower and narrower specificmarkets, and manufactured goods are about to follow.Laser tailors in London and New York are measuring customersand cutting out perfect suits \"while you wait.\" In Japan, retail salesoutlets of the National Bicycle Company offer customers a standingmodel bike that is universally adjustable to each buyer's measure-ments. Data from the floor model, set to an individual buyer's speci-fications, are transmitted to the factory which manufactures thecustom bike within two weeks for only 10 percent more than a mass-produced bicycle. A growing number of producers of manufacturedhousing in Japan and the United States design customized homes forclients on computers that produce drawings, specifications and partslists for rapid assembly. And the Iacocca Institute at Lehigh Univer-sity, Bethelem, Pennsylvania, has produced a proposal, 21st CenturyManufacturing Enterprise Strategy, that envisions an American autoindustry that, within fifteen years, will be able to build and delivercustom-made, defect-free cars within three days of receiving theorder from the dealer.Efficient Enterprise. One important result of the greater pre-ciseness with which informated operations make plans and decisionswill be the increasing efficiencies of such operations. In this context,the concept of efficiency includes, but goes considerably beyond,traditional economic notions of the productive uses of capital, laborand raw materials to incorporate the environmental costs of usingalternative production processes and resources. Over the next tenyears, the \"Total Quality\" movement and the environmental move-ment will converge in the informated enterprise to make manifest afundamental operating principle originally coined by Henry Ford:\"If it doesn't add value, it's waste!\"As we get better and better at applying all available information tothe design of all of our products and the processes by which we pro-duce and distribute them, we will gradually eliminate the great bulkof scrap material, harmful by-products and residual waste of all en-terprise, including agriculture. Our ability to add value by adding in-formation to all of our productive activities, including farming, will 3 426 be crucial to sustaining the economic survival and prosperity ofthose activities.Transformation to Information-Intensive FarmingIn the abstract, the vision of a mature, information-intensive U.S.agricultural sector is enormously appealing. Instead of concentratingalmost entirely upon twenty-five to thirty commercial crops for mostof their income, America's informated farms would be producing arich mix of products ranging from food and flowers to fibers, dyesand pharmaceuticals. Researchers in the United States, Great Brit-ain and The Netherlands have already produced therapeutic pro-teins in the blood and milk of farm animals for substantially lowercosts than the same compounds produced in the laboratory. And,around the world, geneticists have announced ongoing break-throughs in producing vaccines-in plants, as well as bio-polymersnatural plastics that will degrade in landfills. Genetic engineering isalso improving the efficiency with which the environmentally safefuel ethanol can be produced from cellulistic bio-mass.Transgenic research also shows great promise for increasing thevalue of plant and animal food products, by improving their taste,appearance, texture and preservability. But the outlook for trans-genic foods is, at this moment, problematical, due to the legitimateconcerns of some portions of the scientific community about the un-known cumulative effects upon humans of consuming large amountsof genetically altered material that does not occur in the natural eco-system. While this debate is likely to constrain the widespread intro-duction of transgenic food crops and farm animals in the UnitedStates, the use of transgenic farm products as a source of fiber, fuel,chemicals and materials is likely to grow rapidly from now on.So long as consumer preference and environmentalist pressurecontinue to foster the growth of organic food production, informa-tion-intensive farmers will be better able to keep up with new devel-opments in this rapidly expanding field, as well as with theemergence of new marketplace demands. And, should concern overecological degradation from chemical intensive, industrial-stylefarming ultimately lead to the legislature's mandating of organicfarming, electronic information networks would be critical to Ameri-can agriculture's ability to make such a changeover without disas-trous reductions in output and concomitant price increases.Expanded exploration of the world's 250,000 naturally-occurringplant species for potentially desirable commercial characteristics willalso be a source of greater diversification in agricultural productionas farming becomes moreinformation intensive. The New York Bo-tanical Garden has just signed a $3 million contract with a majorpharmaceutical company to search through its collection for medici-nally beneficial plants. Similarly, the increasingly rich ethnic mix of the U.S. population, combined with freer international trade in agri-cultural products, will offer ever-increasing diversity of marketplace'demand for the output of America's farms.Starting Now: Some Purposeful InterventionsHaving made themselves \"adaptive, precise and efficient\" by theirdiligent use of information and information technology, U.S. farmerscould begin to reverse the effects of mass-market industrializationand restore family farming as a viable basis for long-term prosperityin much of rural America. By adding more information to every as-pect of their operations, a large proportion of small farms should beable to identify high-value niche markets for which they can profita-bly produce. But such a scenario is unlikely to occur without somepurposeful interventions in national farm policies and programs. Inparticular, three interventions would be instrumental to revitalizingfamily farming and small town America:1. The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) and its RuralElectric Cooperatives, having satisfactorily accomplished theiroriginal mission, should now be redirected to install an informa-tion \"info-structure\"--for rural America, in-cluding electronic informatidn networks, common-use databases, program libraries and learning systems, etc., linkingfarmers, extension agents, agricultural research stations, com-mercial suppliers and buyers with one another. A principal ob-jective of the REA should be to link all of America's farms byfiber optic cable. This new Rural \"Computerization\" Admin-istration and its Rural \"Information\" Cooperatives should en-courage the acquisition of computers and other electronic infor-mation technologies by individual farmers and farmhouseholds, through subsidies, bulk purchases and low costloans. While America's prosperous farms are already moving toinformate themselves, most smaller, marginal farms are un-likely to invest in info-com technology without assistance andencouragement.2. While the Agricultural Extension and Home Extension Serviceswill need to continue pursuing their traditional missions, theymust--between now and the end of the Twenty-first Centurygive priority to making America's farmers sufficiently \"info-competent\" that they can make full productive use of com-puters and the productive knowledge and power tools theymake available. During the 1980s, employers learned that, inorder to get the full yield out of new workplace technology, itwas necessary to spend one dollar on training for every dollarspent on technology. The speed with which potential userslearn mastery to apply a new technology is the principal gover-nor of an organization'sor a nation'soverall r ,te of tech-nology adoption.36.28 If the REA were to be given the mission of installing ruralAmerica's info-structure, an obviousand crucialrole for ex-tension would be to assure that all rural Americansespeciallythose in the agricultural communityare able to use the newtechnologies to their fullest potential. Given the relatively. smallnumber of the total population directly involved in farmingordirectly in-putting to farms and directly taking output fromfarmsit should be possible within ten years to make agri-culture the first entire sector of the U.S. economy to be com-pletely equipped and trained to make full productive use of in-formation technology. In addition to substantially reducingUSDA's costs to perform many of its various information, edu-cational and regulatory roles, the informating of the nation's ag-ricultural community would set the stage for the de-indus-trialization of farming, creating a new economic base for ruralAmerica.3. As technology and training improve the capacity of farmers tobe \"adaptive, precise and efficient,\" rural economic develop-ment programs, poliCies and practices should increasingly shifttoward promoting new agricultural enterprise. Farm-to-marketelectronic networks should enable farmers throughout the na-tion to locate and develop niche markets nationwide, just asNineteenth Century farm-to-market roads enabled farmers toreach regional markets with their products. Given moderntransport, burgeoning foreign and domestic markets for special-ty produce can be met by farms throughout the U.S. ethnicmarkets, gourmet markets, restaurant markets, organic mar-kets, industrial and research markets, etc.Electronic networks will permit the rapid organization of pro-ducer cooperatives and the easy sharing of information amongpeers which is essential for widespread producer innovations inall forms of commerce. Electronic networks would also make iteasy for food processors and packagers to assemble consortia of suppliers for specific ingredients required by new productlines. Individual farms or farm partnerships could process andpackage pre-prepared foods themselves targeted at specialtymarkets and advertised over electronic bulletin boards. Farm-ers who are unusually proficient in particular product lines, orin coaxing high yields out of marginal land, would be able tosell their expertise to colleagues around the world.Keeping Rural America RuralInterestingly, there are a number of promising potential nonfarmforces for economic development in rural America today. In aboutone-half of the nation's 2,000 rural counties today, the population isgrowing as fast as the national average, or faster! In more than 500 2937 rural counties, population in the 1980sgrew at least three times fast-er than the nation's average, as population has migrated out of near-by cities and suburbs into the countryside. This reversal of the cen-turies-old urbanization trend has also been noted in Western Europeand, on both sides of the Atlantic, the explanations involve a numberof similar factors.To begin with, as advanced technology and organizational re-en-gineering have reduced the labor required for manufacturing, fewerfactories need to be located near large labor pools, During the firsthalf of the Twentieth Century, individual steel mills typically em-ployed 1,500 to 3,000 workers, with the largest having more than15,000employees. Such operations had to draw upon large labor re-serves that only cities possessed. But, now that technology hassqueezed85percent of the labor out of 1950smanufacturing, newsteel mills required only 175 to 350workers, and they are being lo- cated in places such as Crawfordsville, Indiana, and Plymouth,Utah, not Cleveland and Pittsburgh. new auto plantsrequiringroughly just 1,250 employees-7-are now popping up in Smyrna, Ten-nessee, and Normal, Illinois, not in Flint or Detroit.The reason for the urban-industrial out-migration is straightfor-ward enough. Cities are expensive places in which to live and work;land costs are high, labor costs are high, tax rates are high. Con-fronted by increasing foreign competition from countries with cheaplabor, a growing number of U.S. industrial firms have been movingfrom the cities and suburbs to the countryside, where business oper-ating costs are typically 15percent to25percent lower than in adja-cent metropolitan areas. While some economists and demographersbelieve that the fifteen-year spurt of \"greenfielding\" high-valuemanufacturing operations into rural areas is now beginning to de-cline, others believe that the migration of manufacturers into thecountryside will continue unabated, draining economic vitality fromthe city and bringing it to the land. Policy interventions, such as thecreation of \"enterprise\" and \"empowerment\" zones by federal andstate governments, will clearly have some impact on this aspect ofthe rural future.Whether greenfielding remains an important source of future ruralgrowth, other trends seem likely to sustain a rural revitalization.Some states, such as Kentucky, are promoting the al, ailability oftheir skilled, under-employed rural work force to urban employersvia electronic networks. Electronic information technology will per-mit telecommuting, both by salaried workers and the self-employed.These folksdesigners, editors, graphic illustrators, researchers,software writers, consultants, etc.can live anywhere they choosethat the info-structure permits. A large share of this small, butrapidly growing, population is choosing to live in rural areas becauseof the high qualityand relatively low costof living. And thesepeople are bringing their incomes with them. 3038 The twin virtues of low cost and high quality are also drawing an-other rapidly-growing flow of migrants into rural Americaretirees.About 40 percent of retirees who move inter-state when they retirenow end up in rural areas,and in those 500 rural counties experienc-ing the most rapid growth rates over the past twenty years, relocat-ing retirees represented half or more of their growth. Recreationaldevelopment has also boosted rural economies since the 1970s, oftenin conjunction with planned retirement communities and \"full serv-ice\" condominium developments. While the popular image of resortdevelopments is that.they are set in sites with golden beaches orsnow covered ski slopes, agrowing percentage are found along mid-western rivers, in the lakes of the Ozarks and among the hills andponds of northern Michigan.These in-flows of population and employment have already begunto revitalize large areas of rural America. But, where they have oc-curred, these developments have necessarily changed the characterof rural America. While the U.S. Department of Commerce extolsthe opportunities offered by \"non-urban growth centers\"i.e., pros-pering rural areas served by regional airports and interstate high-waysthese new communities are strikingly different from tradi-tional, \"small town\" America. Modern commercial development\"suburbanizes\" rural areas, turning them into continuous strip mallsof fast food clusters, auto dealerships, retail chain outlets and trailerparks. If rural America is to remain a unique cultural entity, it mustretain its low density populations, scattered sparsely across a land-scape, of productive andprofitable working farms, and not five-acre\"farmettes.\"This does not mean we should attempt to bar the suburbanizationof rural areas. To the contrary, the migration of footloose industriesto rural areascorn- -)n to all mature industrial nationsis clearlyan adoptive phenomei, nof the free market that is beneficial to na-tional economies in the aggregate. Similarly, it would be inappropri-ate to use policy intervention to prevent the withdrawal of agri-cultural production from marginal farm land, or the draining ofpopulation from regions in which the industrialized mass productionof commodity crops represents optimum land use.America's two million square miles of rural land should be man-aged as the multi-dimensional national asset it is, and not simplyshaped to look like a single uniform ideal of what a rural landscapeought to look like. In this respect, the USDA should take its leadfrom the U.S. Department of the Interior, which has made a commit-ment to institute a comprehensive plan of \"ecosystem management\"for all public lands. America's agricultural lands should be regardedas a finite resource ofinestimable value. Land that is marginalshould be removed from production, renewed and husLandedagainst a future time when rlimatalogical changes, ecological disas- 3139 ters or the growth of global population may require that such landsbe returned to production.Similarly, rural land that is suitable for raising a wide variety ofhigh-value agricultural products should be utilized in an environ-mentally sound manner to meet appropriate marketplace needs byfarmers whose mastery of information technology enables them tobe \"adaptive, precise and efficient\" commercial enterprises, ratherthan captive providers of a handful of bulk products at commodityprices to food processors and packagers who add most of the per- ceived value and make most of the profits. In summary, just as we are reinventing business, government, education and health care forthe post-industrial era, we must also reinvent agriculture for thetwenty-first century. 40.32 OBSERVATIONS ON AGRICULTURAL POLICY,POLICY REFORMAND PUBLIC POLICY EDUCATIONJohn E. Lee, Jr.Mississippi State UniversityMuch has been written in recent decades by economists about theinefficiencies, injustices and environmentally degrading conse-quences of traditional U.S.agricultural policies, especially com-modity price and income support policies. Yet farmers and many oftheir supporters continue to press for these traditional policies andCongress continues to produce them. And the general public seemsrelatively .disinterested.All of this is highly frustrating to agricultural economists andothers who feel strongly that agricultural policy needs reform. Oneresult has been a spate of new theories and explanations about whyagricultural policy is \"un-reformable.\"Is it foolish to waste any more resources debating and analyzingagricultural policy? I do not think so. We should remember that thepolicies of the New Deal, which we still have in modified form, didnot get put in place overnight. They were the products of at leasttwoperhaps fourdecades of intensive debate, false starts andmany frustrated initiatives.Even then, those policies might not havebeen adopted had it not been for a national economic crisis of histor-ic proportions. So maybe it is not unreasonable that major new di-rections in agricultural policy may take a few decades of debate.And wouldn't it be ironic if a modern-day financial crisisthe na-tional budget deficitbecame the catalyst for sharply curtailing thepolicies that descended from the New Deal and thereby set the stagefor a new era of rural policy?Moreover, it is really not hard to explain why we got the New Dealpolicies, why they are hard to reform and what it will take to ulti-mately bring about reform.Basically I treat four themes in this presentation: the past and pre-sent of agricultural policy are explainable; present policies do notserve the public interest very well; these policies can and will begradually reformed; and extension public policy educators should beheld accountable for their contributions to the process and outcomeof that reform. 3341 \"4 -efWhy Government Got More InvolvedThe roots of modern agricultural policies come from the turbulentperiod between World War I and World War II. In retrospect, thepolicy developments of that period are explainable. Let me give youmy view of four factors explaining public interventiongovernmentinvolvement in agriculture in a major wayin the first half of the1900s.Economic and Physical Characteristics of AgricultureFirst of all there are some basic characteristics of agriculture,some unique to the United States, that help explain the temptationsand pressures for government to become involved in agriculturalmarkets.Farming is a biological process. This means production is inher-ently unpredictable and highly variable. Weather variations causeproduction variations. These, in turn, cause price variations. Farm-ers react to price variations and sometimes that makes the variabilityworse. Thus, farming is not like manufacturing cars or televisionsets.The cobweb effect of disruptions in supply is important because itcould mean wasted resources in production, unstable food supplies(including export disruptions) and undependable incomes to farm-ers. Thus, at various times, both producers and consumers havesought government involvement in agriculture to reduce instabilityof supplies and prices.Resources in agriculture are relatively immobile. Land often hasfew alternative uses. It is kept in production as long as it can pro-duce something that returns at least the out-of-pocket costs of pro-duction. Of course, land can be used for houses, shopping centersand recreation purposes, but only a small part of the land can beused this way. That was especially true in the 1930s and earlier. La-bor was a bit more mobile in U.S. agriculture than was land, but notmuch more. Many farmers felt they were not qualified to do any-thing other than farm. Prior to WW II, there were few off-farm jobsreadily available to farmers and farm workers. Thus, the labor re-source was said to be \"trapped\" in farming.Capital goods (barns, machinery, specialized facilities, etc.) in ag-riculture often have few alternative uses. Liquid capital, of course, ishighly mobile and can quickly be moved to other parts of the econo-my. The importance of immobile resources to farm policy is thateven though returns to land, labor and capital goods may be verylow, these resources continue to be used to produce longer thanwould be the case in some other industries. Capital stock continuesto be used to produce until it wears out, and labor stays in farminguntil the next generation comes along. As for land, the cropland 4 2 base in farming has stayed about the same throughout the century.As a result of all this resource immobility, there is a chronic tenden-cy toward over-production and depressed prices and incomes.In recent decades, the mobility of some agricultural resources, es-pecially labor, has increased. Nevertheless, over most of the last six-ty years, resource productivity has grown faster than demand forfood. The level of resources needed in agriculture has declined fast-er than resources have been withdrawn from the sector. The resulthas been depressed prices and below-average returns on investmentin farming. The importance of this characteristic of the farming sec-tor will becorne apparent shortly.Farmers are price-takers, not pric-makers. In the United States,the farming sector has come closer to being a purely competitivemarket than most other sectors of the economy. Unlike automobilemakers and other businesses in which a few large firms dominatethe market, there are too many farms for any one of them to belarge enough to set their own prices. Prices are determined by theaggregate forces of supply and demand (in the absence of govern-ment programs). Thus, individual farmers are not constrained byconcerns about how more or less production on their farms will af-fect prices. But, what farmers do in total does determine prices.Agriculture has had rapid technological change and productivitygrowth. This is not so much a generic characteristic of agriculture asa basic fact of U.S. agriculture since the 1930s. During most of thetwentieth century, and especially since the 1930s, there has beenstrong growth in the productivity of resources used in farming, oftenfaster than total demand has grown.This means the supply curve has been shifting to the right fasterthan demand has been shifting. In other words, the amount farmersare willing to supply at any given price has been increasing fasterthan the amount people are willing to buy at that price. The net re-sult has been downward pressure on prices (real prices of basiccommodities have trended down over time).Food demand has grown slowly. The United States, like most mod-ern it dustrial nations, is a \"food mature\" economy. This means thatmost of the population is relatively well-fed and well-clothed. As in-comes rise, not much of the additional income is spent on food. Ineconomists' terms, the income elasticity of demand for food is low.Furthermore, most of the additional expenditure on food is for serv-ices and value-added to food rather than to increased volume of foodconsumed. Population has also been growing slowly. The net resulthas been slow overall growth in demand for basic food at the farmlevel.Demand for food has been price inelastic. Since the 1930s, and es-pecially since the 1950s the amount of food consumed by people in35 43 the United States has not been very responsive to price. That meansif the price of food goes down, consumers do not eat much more,and if the price of food goes up, consumers tend to sacrifice some-thing else before they quit eating. The degree of responsiveness toprice changes varies by type of food or commodity. Demand forfoods perceived as more basic responds less, and demand for foodsthought of as luxuries or less essential is more responsive to pricechanges.The observation that the demand for food is price inelastic, or rel-atively unresponsive to price changes, has an important implicationfor farm policy. A reduction in supply leads to a proportionatelygreater rise in price. This raise.; the value of total revenue. Thetemptation to raise farm revenues by artificially reducing supplies onthe market has bedeviled agriculture and policymakers since thebeginning of modern agricultural policy in the 1930s, and some kindof supply control has been a consistent feature of farm policies formost of the last sixty years.Combined effects of basic characteristics of agriculture. When thecharacteristics listed above are put together, it is easier to under-stand why agriculture has been viewed as unstable, risky and un-profitable, The pressures that lead to over-production, depressedprices and incomes, and instabilityand the inelastic demand forfoodhelp explain why the solution has always seemed to be to con-trol supply, create artificial shortages and raise prices. Since no onefarmer acting alone could raise prices by cutting his/her production,it seemed logical to have government be the agent to control produc-tion in order to get higher prices.Incidentally, rarely have farmers relied solely on supply manage-ment programs to raise prices. Through the political process, theygot the higher prices guaranteed first. Once higher prices were set(through loan rates and other price support tools), farmers and theirorganizations could then lobby for liberal treatment and loopholeson supply controls. Their efforts often succeeded, and that meantover-production, or production beyond what could be sold at thehigher prices. But that was the government's problem!Many of these basic characteristics of U.S. agriculture are com-mon to agriculture worldwide, and most, if not all, apply to the in-dustrial and food-surplus nations. Societal Values and BeliefsThe second major factor explaining public intervention has to dowith societal values and beliefs. An \"agrarian fundamentalism\" hasbeen a dominant feature of the American culture from the earlydays of nationhood. This agrarian philosophy is a notion that farmingis a morally superior occupation--work that is closer to God and 4436 nature. This philosophy has never been well articulated and stemsfrom a mixture of ideas and roots from many sources. ThomasJefferson espoused it. He argued that a nation of small freeholderswas the best way to protect a democratic society. Small \"family\"farmers were seen to be honest hard workers who had a vested in-terest in the common good, because as freeholders they owned apiece of the nation.This societal value was still powerful in the 1930s when a majorityof people still lived in rural areas and had some direct or indirectconnection to farming. Even today, many Americans are still onlyone or two generations removed from rural or farm life and canidentify with the problems and benefits of farm living. The \"familyfarm\" still enjoys strong emotional and political support from theAmerican people.Economic Feasibility of Providing Assistance to FarmersThird, by the 1930s, farmers were a small enough part of the totaleconomy that it was economically and politically feasible to maketransfer payments to them. When most Americans were farmers,farming was most of the economy. When farmers were doing poorly,the economy and public revenues did poorly. It was simply not feasi-ble for a minority of the population to make transfer payments to themajority population.As farmers became a smaller part of the total economy, providingsome assistance to them was not only viewed sympathetically by theurban and non-farm population (many with recent farm roots), butwas also increasingly financially feasible and less burdensome tonon-farm taxpayers.An observation: In general, poorer nations of the world, whosefarmers make up a large part of the population and whose farmerstend to be even poorer than the rest of the population, tax agri-culture. Wealthier industrialized nations, whose farmers make up asmall part of their population and whose farmers tend to bewealthier than the rest of the population, subsidize farmers.In both cases, national wealth is regressively redistributed. Thisseemingly perverse situation is merely a matter of practical expedi-ency. In many poor nations, taxing agriculture is one of the fewways to get public revenue to invest in the rest of the economy. Inrich nations, the rest of the population can afford, often at very smallper capita costs, to support agriculture, and the political sympathy isthere to make it happen.1930s Economic and Social ConditionsThe fourth factor that served as a catalyst for major governmentintervention in agriculture was the economic and social crisis of the 3745 1930s. After the collapse of grain export markets following WorldWar I, economic conditions in rural America were severely de-pressed for more than two decades. The Great Depression of the1930s merely exacerbated the poor conditions that had prevailed inagriculture during the 1920s. During this period, most farms weresmall and their owners poor. Yet farming was still the predominantactivity in most rural parts of the country and, in the 1920s, ruralpeople were still nearly half the total population.Thus, the large number of economically depressed peoplea bigpart of the total populationconstituted a major social problem aswell as an economic problem for the nation. Addressing the prob-lems of the rural population was a high priority during the 1930s, andproviding financial assistance to farmers was one way policymakersthought they could help.So, there you have my explanation for why the U.S. governmentgot involved in modern farm policies. The basic conditions of agri-culture led farmers to seek intervention on their behalf; strongagrarian values and beliefs gave the nation's people and pol-icymakers warm fuzzies about helping \"family farmers\"; the growthin industrial wealth and the decline in numbers of farmers relative tothe non-farm population made it possible to redistribute wealth fromnon-farm to farm; and a national economic and social crisis lit thematch!Characteristics of Policy ResponsesAgricultural policies since the 1920s and 1930s have focused heav-ily on improving financial conditions for producers of selected com-modities (an inherent unfairness), especially feed grains, foodgrains, cotton, oilseed and dairy products. Those policies have beenvaried and complex, but there have been some common charac-teristics.Supply ManagementAlmost continuously since the 1930s, U.S. agricultural policy hascontained some element of supply control.Since farmers were too numerous to act in concert to managesupply (some farmer organizations tried and failed), the federal gov-ernment has acted as their monopoly agent or manager. But, gov-ernment has not always managed well.Supply controls have sometimes been mandatory and sometimesvoluntary (with incentives offered to get cooperation).The objectives of supply management have been several:Increase commodity prices by \"shorting\" the market (with inel-astic demand, this also increased revenues to farmers). 4638 Reduce treasury costs of price support programs.Assure a more stable supply of commodities to meet domesticand export needs.Supply controls used in U.S. farm programs have tended to be in-direct controls. Most often, for broad-acre crops, the attempts havebeen to control supply by controlling one major input, land. Mean-while, no limits were put onother inputs such as fertilizer,pesticides, water and new technology. In fact, these other inputs, in-cluding the credit to buy them, were often subsidized. Farmers alsogenerally took their least productive acres out of production. The re-sults have been slippage in land control and ineffective control ofsupply.For most commodities, supply control has meant control of U.S.production. There are exceptions, such as sugar, whereby highprices are maintained by limiting imports.Price and Income SupportsSince the late 1930s, supply control programs have been accom-panied by price and income support programs. Although the earlierrationale for production controls was to reduce supply and strength-en prices, productioncontrols in recent decades have come to beseen by farmers asthe political price that must be paid to get accessto price supports.Prices have been supported in several familiar ways includingnon-recourse loans, targetprices with deficiency payments andother price support mechanisms. Price StabilizationSeveral government-sponsored storage programs have been de-signed to stabilize prices by taking supplies off the market duringtimes of surplus and putting them back on the market when thereare shortages. Thesestorage programs have been less than fullysuccessful because of the political temptation to use them to raiseprices and incomes, rather than to smooth out supplies and prices.Import quotas and barriers and marketing orders are other tools ofprice stabilization.Risk ReductionWhile the aforementioned characteristics of modern U.S. agri-cultural policy have transferred some farmer risks to the rest of soci-ety, there have also been specific risk reduction programs, such asfederal crop insurance and loan guarantees. 4 7 Demand ExpansionAnother recurring theme in U.S. farm policy has been the interestin strengthening commodity prices and producers' incomes by ex-panding demand for farm-produced products. Examples of such pro-grams include: food stamps for the poor to expand domestic foodconsumption; disposal of surplus commodities to needy groups andcharities; food aid for other countries; research on development andmarketing of new products ranging from foods to bio-fuels; autho-rization of commodity \"check off\" collections for market-expandingresearch and promotion programs; support for private industrygroups to set up overseas programs to promote use of U.S. farmproducts; export credits and credit guarantees; direct export sub-sidies; and public investment in research and technology to help theUnited States be a low cost competitor in world markets.Consequences of U.S. Agricultural PoliciesU.S. agricultural policies and programs have been put in place toachieve several stated and implied objectives. Among these are sta- bilization of farm commodity supplies and prices, enhancement ofproducer incomes, assurances of adequate supplies of affordablefood and preservation of the \"family farm\" structure of the farmingsector. Most serious analyse = suggest that some of the intended ben-efits have been achieved, accompanied by many unintended side ef-fects and longer-term consequences.Programs reduced risk and supported a technological revolution inU.S. agriculture. Price support provisions of farm programs didreduce risks in farming by stabilizing prices and increasing short-term profitability. With reduced risk, farmers were more willing toborrow money to invest in technological improvements and lenderswere more willing to lend. This tendency was abetted by the estab-lishment of new credit institutions just to serve agriculture and bycredit subsidies. These new developments coincided with the avail-ability of a stream of new technologies in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.This technological revolution greatly increased the productivity,production capacity and global competitiveness of U.S. agriculture.Agricultural policies improved farmers' incomes but gains were dif-ficult to maintain. Clearly, producers of some agricultural com- modities had higher incomes in some years because of the variousprice support and subsidy programs. But the higher incomes con-tributed to forces that undermined the longer-term value of this in-come. Studies have shown that much of the higher income wascapitalized into higher asset values, especially land values. Farm-ers received the benefit of these higher values of assets only if theyowned the assets. The higher asset values also became higher long-er-term fixed costs of production, and ultimately led to pressurefrom farmers to increase subsidies to offset the higher costs. Thus, 4048 the short-term gains in farmers' incomes led to a distortion in assetvalues, especially land, and contributed to an upward cost-pricespiral.Support policies led to over-investment in agriculture. Higher in-comes and subsidizedcredit led to over-investment in machineryand equipment, capital facilities and various new technologies. Asa result, the tendency tooverproduce farm commodities was com-pounded and greEter reliance had to be p...t on supply control pro-grams. Because domesticdemand for farm products did not keeppace with growth in capacity to produce, exports also became acritical outlet for excess production. When exports did not expandas rapidly in the 1980s asin the 1970s, the over-investment in theU.S. agricultural production capacity became unsustainable, andfor the first time since the 1920s and 1930s, there was a massivewithdrawal of capital from the farming sector and a major deflationin asset values (Lee). This was a very wasteful and painful adjust-ment, but one that could beattributed in part to the policies thatled to over-investment.Agricultural policies fostered major structural change in the farm-ing sector. The combination of increased stability, productivity andtechnological change led directly to fewer and larger farms. This isbecause individual farmers or workers could directly managelarger and larger operations as technology was substituted for la-bor. Larger and more efficient tractors and equipment meant onefarmer could farm much larger tracts of land on a timely basis. Thetechnology revolution also meant farmers became less self-suffi-cient; that is, they became more dependent on non-farm suppliersof fuel, chemicals, seeds and other supplies and the credit to buythem. This also meant more of each dollar of income from com-modity sales went to pay outside suppliers rather than being re-tained by the farmer who previously had produced most of the nec-essary inputs on thefarm. The smaller net margin per dollar ofincome meant farmers had to increase sales volumes to maintainacceptable net incomes. Smaller farmers had to choose whether toincrease the size of their operations to maintain competitive farmincomes, to get out of farming altogether, or to supplement theirfarm incomes with off-farm income. As a result of these forces,which are partly due to the agricultural support policies in placesince the 1930s, agriculture has been transformed from a low-tech-nology, labor-intensive industry to a high-technology, capital-inten-sive industry with much greater concentration of production infewer, larger farming operations (a good summary is found inTweeten). In the 1930s there were more than six million farms inthe United States. Today there are about two million farms. farm-ing about the same total acreage, producing a several-fold increasein total output, with one-half of the value of all production comingfrom about 75,000 large farms (Peterson and Brooks). 4149 Agricultural policies have distorted resource prices and use. As aresult of incentives to over-invest and to use alternative inputs tooffset limits on the amount of land that could be planted to a specif-ic crop, the mix of land, labor and purchased inputs used to pro-duce some crops is different from the most efficient mix that wouldbe used if there were no distortions caused by agricultural pro-gi-ams. More chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used to getmore production because land use has been limited by supply con-trol programs. Supply controls that limit only land use have encour-aged investment in irrigation systems. The inefficiencies in use ofnational resources, especially capital, resulting from distortionscaused by farm policies, cost the overall economy thousands ofjobs.Consumer effects of agricultural policies are mixed. The effects ofcurrent U.S. agricultural policies on the cost of food are small.Products made from basic commodities such as grain probably costless than they might cost otherwise because programs for thesecommodities tend to stimulate over-production and lower pricesand, currently, purchasers buy the commodities at market prices,not target prices. Also, the existence of support programs for morethan five decades probably means the United States has larger pro-duction capacity, larger supplies and lower market price thanwould otherwise have been the case. Also, the abundant suppliesand low prices of grains mean more plentiful supplies of livestockproducts. For some specialty commodities, such as sugar, peanutsand milk, consumers pay more because of the way support is pro-vided to producers of those commodities. Take peanuts, for exam-ple. The policies set a very high guaranteed minimum price, re-strict production to drive market prices up to the guaranteed price,and provide import barriers to cheaper foreign peanuts. The resultis fewer peanuts at higher costs to consumers.Overall, U.S. consumers have access to abundant food at lowcosts, allowing them to spend more than 85 percent of their in-comes for other needs and desires. However, the distortions in re-source use because of agricultural policies have caused some otherconcerns for consumers. These concerns are food safety and envi-ronmental degradation. The food safety concerns came from heavyuse of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that may leave unsafe res-idues on food or contaminate drinking water. Some of the environ-mental concerns also stem from the heavy use of chemicals and themore intense use of land and water because of the supply controland support programs.Benefits and cost of U.S. agricultural policies have been distributedunevenly. While modern farm policies and programs were original-ly put in place to assist a farm sector that was economically de-pressed and disadvantaged, the programs continue even though 4250 today's typical commercial farmers (defined as those with annualproduction value of $100,000 and more) have incomes greater thanthose for average non-farmers. and wealth many times greater.The result is a regressive redistribution of income from taxpayersgenerally to operators of commercial farms. Further, studies showthat even among farmers, 80 to 90 percent of farm program directbenefits go to 10 to 15 percent of all farmers (Whittaker). Manyfarmers get no benefits at all if they do not produce the com-modities covered by the farm support programs.For producers of some specialty commodities, such as sugar, pea-nuts and milk, the benefits of the support programs are capturedby a small number of producers, while the costs are borne by tax-payers and consumers.To the extent that higher incomes resulting from support programsget capitalized into higher land values, the beneficiaries are land-owners. If these are non-farm landlords, they get the benefit whilefarmers who rent the land have to pay higher rents.U.S. agricultural support programs have provided assistance pri-marily to farm operators and asset owners, not to farm workers.Thus, the costs of some major technological improvements, such asmechanical cotton harvesters, have been borne almost entirely bythe displaced workers and their families.The distributions of benefits and costs of various agriculture sup-port programs are neitherwell-documented nor well-understood,but they are clearly uneven.Treasury costs of U.S. agricultural policies have been high. In re-cent decades, most of the direct costs of farm support programshave been borne by taxpayers rather than consumers. This is be-cause producers of grains, cotton and oilseeds receive most of their.benefits as direct \"deficiency\" payments, rather than through ar-tificially high market prices. For milk, both consumers and tax-payers have to pay because treasury costs are incurred to buy ex-cess supplies, creating anartificial shortage and resulting in con-sumers paying higher milk prices.Most of the treasury costs of modern U.S. farm programs havebeen incurred since 1980 (Rapp). The 1985 farm bill lowered loanrates (support prices) to let market prices prevail and providedsupport through direct income (deficiency) payments. The resultingprograms were more market-oriented but also more expensive.Some U.S. agricultural policies have fostered protectionist borderpolicies. As is the case in most industrial countries, protectionistborder policies have to be established to protect domestic supportprograms. High support prices require import controls to keep buy-ers from substituting cheaper foreign commodities for domestic 4351 kcommodities. This is especially the case today in the United Statesfor sugar, peanuts and dairy products.What Have We Learned?First, I believe it is fair to say the United States has not had a com-prehensive food and agriculture policy. What we have had is an in-come enhancement policy for producers of selected commodities.The policies have been essentially of, by and for commercial andlarger producers of those commodities. For the most part, our pol-icies have ignored or put low priority on farm workers, consumers,environmental interests, food safety and rural problems. Obviously,this is somewhat of an over-statement. Recent comprehensive farmbills have included titles on many of the aforementioned topics. But,it is still true that commodity price supports and income transfers tocommodity producers have been the consuming interest of the agri-cultural establishment.I believe this is gradually changing, partly because there are nowbroader interests represented around the policy negotiating table.Environmental programs such as water quality, wetlands, the Con-servation Reserve Program (CRP), etc. and food safety programsare certainly becoming more prominent features of agricultural leg-islation. But hired farm workers and migrant laborers are not likelyto see much regarding their interests in traditional farm bills. Effortsto ensure worker safety and health have mostly originated outsidethe agricultural establishment and have often been opposed byfarmers and their representatives.A second and more positive general observation is that there havebeen some successes.The establishment of new, agriculturally-oriented credit institu-tions and stabilization/support of commodity prices in the 1930sand 1940s, combined with the new technologies resulting frommajor public investments in research, made possible the surge inproductivity that modernized American agriculture, lowered thereal cost of food and made it possible to devote the vast majorityof the nations non-land resources to improving other aspects ofthe quality of life. This is a huge contribution and should neverbe unappreciated. But it is not necessarily a rationale for con-tinuing current programs into the future.Recent reforms have reduced distortions in prices and resourceallocations. Replacing loan rates (support prices) with targetprices and deficiency payments was a major step in the directionof a more market-oriented production sector. Also a combinationof fixed program yields and \"flex\" acres (a reduction in the cropeligible for subsidies) means that, at the margin, as much as one-fourth or more of the production of affected commodities is beingproduced for market prices. These recent developments have 5244 also forced farmers to reduce costs and improve their com-petitiveness in world markets.There have been improvements on the environmental front. Soilerosion is far less a problem today than fifty years ago. No-tilland reduced. tillage are common in some areas. Our pesticidesare safer and used more judiciously (a far cry from the dayswhen we sprayed DDT on everything and threw the empty con-tainers in the creek). Compared to the 1950s, 60s and 70s, we aremore likely today to preservewetlands than drain them, and, ingeneral, we are far more conscious of water quality and long-term sustainability than were previous generations.Food is safer to eat and less likely to be as fatty and salty as inthe past. We are also more conscious of food safety and healthfuleating habits.A third observation is that often the programs put in place do notachieve the intended objectives, and often there are unexpected andunintended side effects, especially in the longer run. Examplesabound and this audience is familiar with them. These outcomes re-sult in part from lack of clarity and consensus about objectives ofpolicy, failure to conduct adequate prior analyses of probable effectsof policies, slippage between policy and implementation, and gener-al unawareness on the part of policymakers and their constituents ofthe consequences of specific policies.My fourth observation is that the legislative successes of the com-modity organizations and the single issue interest groups havecaused the general farm organizations to re-examine their strategiesand to focus their energies more narrowly on commodity/producersupport policies in recent years, in contrast to their representingrura' interests more broadly earlier in the century (see Browne for amore in-depth treatment of this point). This probably also caused theU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to become more narrowlyfocused on traditional commodity support and trade policies in the1970s and 1980s, at a time when many in society were expressing in-terest in agricultural matters from a broader perspective. This tend-ency on the part of USDA was likely reinforced by the restructuringof the agriculture committees, especially in the U.S. House of Repre-sentatives.A fifth observation is that our policies have often been very ineffi-cient in achieving objectives such as income transfers.Sixth, policies established long enough to build up a benefittingclientele, are hard to reform, even though the situation originally ad-dressed by the policies may no longer exist. More on this shortly.Finally, and to the point of this conference, the public's under-standing of the agricultural economy and of agricultural policy isabysmal. This is true even among farm and rural people, to say 4553 nothing of the urban folks. This ignorance is not unique to agri-cultural policy. But what does it say for the effectiveness of decadesof public policy education? This lack of public understanding makesit possible for special interests to develop policies that serve themwell, but which may not be in the long-run interests of society atlarge or even of the agricultural industry.At this point it serves the purpose of my thesis to briefly summa-rize my view of the status of agriculture, especially the farm produc-tion sector, and the policies for that sector.Summary Status of U.S. Agriculture and PolicyWhat is the status of the American farm sector? That question canbe answered in terms of financial conditions, organization of thefarm sector, financial structure of the sector and in many otherways. For the sake of dialogue, let me throw out a perspective onthe status of U.S. agriculture, especially the farm production sector.The farm sector represents less than 2 percent of the nation'sgross national product (GNP) and labor force (the proportion con-tinues to decline) and less than 10 percent of the rural economy. Inpart that is a tribute to the success of investments in science and ed-ucation, which allow providing a growing value of output with a de-clining drain on the nation's resources. This has permitted an abun-dance of food and fiber while freeing up resources to invest in otherimprovements in the material well-being of the population. That isthe ultimate mark of a sector's success!As an aside, most of rural America was populated to develop thenatural resource based industries: agriculture, forestry and mining.All these industries have seen rapid technological advances, mean-ing that fewer and fewer people are required for more and moreoutput. Thus, the amount of cropland and forest land has stayedabout the same, but relatively few people are required to do thework. This has led to a natural depopulation of the countryside; aphenomenon having nothing to do with low commodity prices orhard times in farmingnor with evil plots in corporate headquartersor government offices.So, we have a vigorous agricultural sector that is highly com-petitive, producing an abundance of food for our tables, but requir-ing very few people. How few? The more than 6 million farms of1940 are now down to around 2 million. Of these, 75,000 farms pro-duce one half of all the value of production. About 550,000 to 600,000farms produce 90 to 95 percent of all agricultural production or virtu-ally all commercial agricultural output. The rest of the producers, onaverage, are not poor, do not farm for a living and often do not evenidentify themselves as farmers. Within that set, of course, there isgreat diversity, from wealthy weekend hobby farmers to Black oper-ators of small North Carolina tobacco farms living in poverty.54 For the most part the 550,000 to 600,000 farms that make up thecommercial farming sector are competitive and doing as well or bet-ter financially than clothing stores, restaurants and other small busi-ness sectors of the economy. In a given year, some farms make aprofit and some lose, but that is not greatly different from other sec-tors of the economy. It is not unusual for other small business sectorsto experience 10 percent and higher annual failure rates (based ondata in Miller). In all of the 1980s, the toughest decade since the1930s, the United States never had a farm business failure rate thatexceeded 3 percent per year. In fact, in the 1980s the proportion offarmsgoing out of business for all reasons was not out of line withthe long-term trend. The drop in farm numbers, the smallest of anydecade since the 1930s, occurred primarily because of fewer new en-trants than normal (Stam).The 550,000 to 600,000 largest farms not only produce most of thenation's agricultural products, but the average income of their oper-ators is above the national average for all households, their networths typically far exceed those of non-farm households or com-parable small businesses, and they receive most of the benefits offederal subsidy programs. In fact, since virtually all the deficiencypayments and other direct subsidies go to producers of three com-modity groups (feed grains, food grains and cotton), approximately90 percent of total direct deficiency payments go to about 200,000(about 10 percent) of all producers.Thus, while the price and income support programs do transferseveral billion dollars each year from taxpayers that on averagehave less income and wealth than the farmers receiving it (called re-gressive redistribution of income), there is little evidence to supportclaims that we would suffer a shortage of food and fiber withoutthose payments. Moreover, because of the way we go about sub-sidizing agriculture, it costs about $1.40 to transfer $1 to farmers(Roningen and Dixit). Were it not for farmers' distaste of transparentwelfare, it would be cheaper just to forget the programs and writechecks directly to farmers each year.Meanwhile, the \"small family farmers,\" those other 1.5 million orso farmers whose names areinvoked in support of farm welfare, getvirtually no benefit from farm programs. In fact, we could greatly in-crease farm prices and do relatively little to affect the general well-being of small farmers and in the process wipe out our foreign mar-kets and have to shrink our agricultural plant dramatically).This farm sector that provides an abundance of output with asmaller and smaller proportion of the nation's resources does so inways that are less erosive and environmentally damaging than in tilepast. Better practices, safer chemicals, alternatives to chemicals andgreater sensitivity to long-term sustainability are products of publicand private investment and better technology and better education. 4755. We still have problems in this regard but we are moving in the rightdirection.In short, we have an agricultural sector that is providing evergreater abundance and quality at declining real cost to consumersfor a declining share of national resources and doing so in ways thatare increasingly sustainable for the longer term. The policy failures,if that term is appropriate, are not those of technological progressand structural change, but rather those of failing to adjust sector as-sistance policies to present day realities (if we were starting fromscratch today, would the public stand for putting in place a set ofprograms like those we inherited from the 1930s?) and failure ofpublic policy to match investments in technological improvementsthat provide a net benefit to society with investments in easing theburden on those who bear the brunt of the economic and social ad-justments to the technological changes.With regard to the latter point, most of the rural-based rhetorictoday about problems attributed to \"low farm prices\" is really a re-flection of the pain of those who lose in the adjustment process thataccompanies technological progressdying small towns, erosion ofrural public services (health, education, etc.), youth leaving ruralareas in search of jobs elsewhere, elderly left behind, nostalgia, lossof the familiar, e cc., etc.all part of the economic, social and psy-chological cost cf changr. and progress. The response should not beto stop change z nd progress, but to have those who benefit from theprogress (society in general) share some of that benefit to ease thepain of adjustment, especially for those least able to afford it.Why Is Policy Reform So Difficult?For years, economists have been demonstrating that current andtraditional agricultural policies lead to distortions in resource prices,misallocation of resources, reduced economic efficiency, environ-mental degradation and even some regressive redistribution of in-come and wealth. In at least two decades of agricultural policy con-ferences, including this one, economists have rehashed these find-ings and then shared their puzzlement over the intransigence ofestablished policies. I even detect an air of resignation among econo-mists, as though accepting that the body politic just somehow doesnot grasp the obvious \"truths\" is we define them.I believe the slowness of policy reform is logical and explainable.Recall the earlier statement that as farmers became a smaller part ofa large industrialized economy, providing some assistance to them ina time of crisis (the 1930s) was not only viewed sympathetically bythe urban and rural non-farm population, but was also increasinglyfinancially feasible and affordable by non-farm taxpayers. In otherwords, large transfer payments could be made to a relatively small 4856 farming population at relatively small per-capita costs to the largenon-farm population.Once in place, farm assistance got institutionalized and, as farmerscontinued to become a smaller part of the population, that assistancebecame more difficult to reform. As a general rule, in instances inwhich a few people enjoy large benefits whose costs are widely dif-fused across many other people, policy reform is difficult. When pol-icy reform poses threats to the large transfer payments from societyto farmers, especially large farmers, those beneficiaries have boththe incentive and the means to wage a defense of their benefits.Since reform generally implies only small per capita gains to the restof society, debate about policy reform generally falls on disinterestedears among non-farm interests. You can guess the usual outcomes ofthose battles.It is somewhat ironic that farmers have long worried about theirdeclining numbers on the presumption that declining numbers meandeclining political clout. In fact, it is their relative fewness that hasgiven them their clout. With the number of producers receivingmajor benefits being relatively small, with agriculture still physicallyhighly visible on the landscape and with every senator having someagriculture in his/her state, conditions are right for continued incomeand wealth transfers to farmers.Several factors aid and abet the status quo. One is the structure ofcongressional committees which permits most of the debate aboutagricultural policy to be confined to the committees made up of a rel-atively small number of congressional members whose political com-mitment is to established beneficiaries of existing programs andwhose political fortunes also benefit substantially from that commit-ment. An occasional Don Quixote to the contrary, most members ofCongress not on the committees see little political capital in doinganything other than endorsing the recommendations of the agri-cultural committees. To improve their clout, agricultural interestshave aligned themselves into specialty groups to focus their lobbyingefforts on the even smaller congressional subcommittees that dealwith their specialty.Another factor making it easier for current beneficiaries of farmprograms and their congressional supporters to get away with theirprotection of the status quo is the combination of misperceptions andignorance about agriculture on the part of most of the population.This ignorance permits the use of rhetoric about saving the familyfarm, saving rural America and assuring that we do not run out offood to defend programs that: transfer most of the subsidies to farmsquite .-fifferent from those in the minds of sympathetic city folks;haveto do with the well-being of moss people and communitiesin rural areas; and have virtually nothing to do with the adequacy of 4957 food supplies. Reducing this ignorance is the key to policy reform. Itis also our responsibility as public policy educators.Why Is Policy Reform Important?With the costs of farm programs in the $8 to $12 billion range an-nually, out of the $1.5 trillion federal budget (about .7%), the cost offarm programs is no longer a rallying cry for reform. One could elim-inate all farm programs having direct and indirect transfer paymentsand hardly make a dent in the federal deficit, let alone the budget.A more important reason to reform farm programs is their inher-ent unfairness. As I have already discussed, they simply make nosense because they regressively redistribute income to those whoare either wealthy or could cope without that additional income, anddo little for people really in financial need. In the process they leadus to pursue distortive domestic policies and protectionist trade pol-icies.But, the most important reason to reform farm commodity andtrade policies is that the continuing preoccupation with them divertsthe energy of our people and the national leadership away from de-velopment of policies that address widespread rural poverty, urbanand rural hunger, creation of a new rural economic vitality, and ahost of other problems far more important than whether theAcreage Reserve Program (ARP) on rice should be 5 percent or 10percent. These bigger problems should be shaping a whole newagenda and sense of purpose for the USDA. The emphasis and en-ergy and endless debate over continuing adjustments in, and man-agement of, past farm legislation and planning for the upcoming 1995farm bill while major rural social and economic problems remain un-solved, are examples of fiddling while Rome burns!Public Policy Educators and Future Agricultural PolicyThis conferenceand our jobsare about public policy education.The job of educators is to educate. Education is not simply the shar-ing of our own knowledge and biases, but rather it is teaching peo-ple how to think for themselves. The operative current fad word is\"empower.\" This means helping people learn how to find and proc-ess information such that their decisions maximize the satisfaction oftheir values and goals.Those who have been empowered and motivated to seek andprocess information may even come to reevaluate some of what theyhad held as basic values. This is because some of those \"values\"may not be fundamental values at all, but rather old manifestationsof values based on beliefs about the relationships between the oldmanifestations and more fundamental values. But if in the process ofgathering and objectively processing new information, such people5850 become convinced those relationships, in fact, do not hold, they arelikely to question the 1..anifestation they had previously thought of asa fundamental value.For example, suppose you are an agrarian fundamentalist; youhold dear the concept of an agrarian society or the agrarian lifestylebecause you feel people who work the soil and work with animalsare closer to nature and therefore more likely to be keepers of the societal valueshonesty, decency, God-fearing--that really areimportant to you. Further, you support, let us say, high price sup-ports because you believe they preserve the agrarian lifestyle andtherefore perpetuate .behavior consistent with your basic values. Butall of the above becomes questionable if you accumulate and processinformation convincing you that high price supports do not, in fact,assure the preservation of an agrarian society and, furthermore, thatfarmers are no more honest, decent and God-fearing as a group thanare carpenters, salesmen orperish the thoughtagricultural econ-omists.Questioning is a part of the educational process, whether it leadsto changing or reaffirming one's beliefs. Equipping people for pro-ductive questioning is simply a part of helping people learn aboutgathering and processing information.The \"information\" learners need to process includes not only \"sta-tistics\" and research results, but exposure to divergent views andthe rationale behind those views. The know-how to process that in-formation includes knowing how to critically evaluate the informa-tion, which may lead to seeking more information.This may all sound a bit abstract, but it is what we, as public pol-icy educators, are all about. Public policy education is hard work. Itis much harder than traditional technology transfer whereby yourelay to the customer the results of research or demonstrate im-proved practices. Even with technology transfer, you have to teachfarmers and others how to evaluate the new information and maketheir own decisions. But it is much easier to convey the test results ofa new crop variety or the comparative environmental impacts ofnew arid old practices than to conduct educational programs in areasthat tend to impinge on people's values and beliefs.One of the big challenges in public policy education is to avoid thetemptation to share one's own biases or views on \"right\" and\"wrong\" policies. I suppose some of that occurs in non-policy areastoo; e.g., county agents who tell farmers what practices they \"ought\" to follow rather than teaching farmers how to evaluatealternative practices for themselves. But, the problem seems to bemore pervasive and dangerous in the area of public policy. Also,farm policy tends to be more controversial and we, as public policyeducators, are sensitive to controversy. Thus xtension workersand others involved in outreach have few qualms about talking with 51.59 constituents about a new plant variety, but we often tremble at theprospect of conducting policy education, especially when the stu-dents are already on record with their viewsloud and clear.How do we make progress? First, I believe we should all be betterstudents regarding agricultural policy. It is essential that people inthe public policy education business be fully knowledgeable aboutthe evolution of agriculture and agricultural policy, about the funda-mentals of agriculture and society that drive policy and about how toanalyze the consequences of alternative policies.Second, in order to be better educators, we have to be better stu-dents of the learning process. That is, we really have to work atbeing better at helping people learn how to think for themselves andhow to find the fodder for that thinking. The extension \"learningworkshop\" that preceded the Orlando American Agricultural Eco-nomics Association (AAEA) meetings in August of this year washelpful, as are the workshops conducted annually at this conference.Perhaps we need to adapt and improve on those workshops and in-corporate them more widely in in-service training in the states.Another thought. Perhaps scholars and practitioners should beconvened to draw up some national standards for evaluating thecontent and effectiveness of public policy education programs.Those standards could be used as guidelines for state and federalprogram reviewers.I believe the future direction of public policy for agriculture de-pends very heavily on how producers and their representatives viewtheir vested interests as being affected by alternative policies, andon how well the rest of the population and its leadership understandthe state of agriculture and the consequences of agricultural policy. Itruly believe in the effectiveness of transparency in policy. Despiteall the. ,farm policy conferences that have been held, and the publicpolicy education programs underway, U.S. farm policy and its do-mestic and global effects are not transparent to the vast majority ofthe American people. Correcting that condition is our challenge.It is important that public policymakers themselves understandthe consequences of alternative policies and the effectiveness ofalternative approaches to achieving policy goals. I am convi, edsome of them already understand much of what I have discussed inthis paper. But leaders cannot go farther than followers will follow.Thus, if we want better policy from the Congress and the admin-istration we have to have an educated public demanding better pol-icy from their leaders. Policymakers do represent the sentiments ofthe majority of their constituents, and agricultural policy at any pointin time probably reflects the state of perception and policy literacyon the part of producers and the general public.6052 ConclusionI was asked to share some of my biases and observations. I havedone as I was requested in the hope of stimulating useful dialogue.In keeping with my role of sharing biases, let me end with a forecastof the direction of agricultural policy over the next two decades.Commodity support programs will not end abruptly in the near fu-ture but will slowly fade into the background and become less andless the center of attention. The budget will continue to constrain ex-penditures, but that could mean expenditures continuing in the $6 to$12 billion range for several more years. Budget pressures couldforce some creative thinking about the tools of farm assistance. If theHouse and Senate conferees agree to eliminate the wool and honeysupport programs this year, that will set a precedent. But the prece-dent will more likely be applicable to minor commodities than to thebig three: cotton, grains and oilseeds and dairy. The clout for thosemajor, widely-produced commodities is still substantial.Commodity support programs will also slowly become less attrac-tive to producers. As pointed out earlier, because of fixed programyields, 0-92 type programs and reductions in the acres eligible forpayment under the flexible acreage program, the proportion of grainproduction covered by target prices and deficiency payments is nowlikely below three-fourths and declining. In time this could reduceprogram participation and hence effectiveness of supply manage-ment.Also, traditional commodity policy will fade into the backgroundbecause of the pressures of other issues and constituencies. Alreadymore than half of the USDA's budget goes for food stamps and food assistance programs. More than one third of USDA's employeeswork for the Forest Service. The farm assis tance programs accountfor less than one-fourth of USDA's budget. Still, the secretary of ag-riculture tends to be consumed by traditional farm commodity policyissues. This is true because we are always in the process of imple-menting a recent farm bill, managing existing legislation or prepar-ing for a new farm bill. This is also true because we have an ac-cumulation of sixty years of farm programs that require a continuousflow of day-to-day operational decisions by the secretary. However,as new issues are around longer, and laws and regulations begin toaccumulate for those new issues, more of the secretary's attentionwill be drawn to necessary decisions in the management of thoseprograms, and she/he will be less preoccupied with traditional com-modity programs. That is already beginning to happen for environ-mental programs and, to a lesser extent, for food safety. As the at-tention of the secretary is forced to shift, and as new infrastructureand political alignments develop around the new issues, the char-acter of the USDA will change also; more than it already has. -5361 Finally, within the next five to ten years, the generation of peoplewho have staffed the USDA and the congressional committees dur-ing the post World War II period, mostly white males with farmbackgrounds, will have retired. In fact, within the next two yearsUSDA is projecting that about half of its senior executives will retire.These are the experienced people who have grown up with andmanaged the traditional agricultural policies for the past three orfour decades. This retiring generation will be replaced in the USDA,congressional committees and Washington lobby groups by a gener-ation that comes largely from an urban background and, particularlyin USDA, is more reflective of the larger population mix. This-newgeneration will be talented and competent. But their understandingof, and their emotional commitment to, agriculture will be differentfrom those of their predecessors. Moreover, because of their back-grounds, they will bring to their jobs less of a farm perspective andmore of a broad orientation toward a whole new array of social, en-vironmental and economic issues. In that environment and with allthe other changes gradually taking place, agricultural policy will bea whole new ball game. REFERENCESBrowne, William P.

It has almost become fashionable to observesophistically that \"agriculture-dependent counties\" represent a smallminority of rural America.The point is usually made politically. Agriculture has dominatedrural politicsreally, has denied rural policy a place at the table.The advocates for rural America want liberation from the good ol'boys and agrarian fundamentalists who run the farm programs anddrown out any talk of the rural poor or rural business or the ruralcommunity.I understand this resentment toward agriculture. And because Iunderstand it, I want to do something about it. To do somethingabout it, however, you cannot ignore it. You have to critique it andrespond to its flaws. American agriculture in the latter stages of thetwentieth century has serious problems. I want to address those inthe limited space available here, leaving other important rural topicsto others.Major Problem AreasI summarize five major problem areas quickly, then turn to somepolicy issues that relate to them:Export DependenceThe chimera of salvation by export still haunts U,S. agriculture.From Shays' Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion until this day,American farmers have been persuaded to believe in the exportmarket as the solution to their financial problems. In fact, it has beenprimarily growth in domestic food expenditures that has given U.S.agriculture most of its good times. Export markets have provenfickle, volatile, low priced and highly elastic. Commodity programshave encouraged specialization in many of the crops most vulnera-ble to export disruptions. And from the time we have shipped maplesugar on back hauling slave trade boats, the export market hasnever been as moral as wehave told ourselves. It is not to feed the 5563 4 world, it is to make a buck, no matter the consequences for peoplein the developing world.Diminished OpportunityThe decline in the number of farmers in the 1980s was more theproduct of reduced entry than it was of accelerated exit from farm-ing by those forced out or retiring. The victims of the farm crisiswere not only those whose farms were lost, but those whose dreamswere lost; it was not only family farmers who were diminished, butfamily farming as an institution. As a result, American agriculture isaging. Today, there are twice as many farmers over age 65 as thereare under age 35. In Nebraska, the number of farmers under age 25fell by 43 percent between 1978 and 1987, while the number over age65 increased by 16 percent. The latter group increased their landholdings by more than 40 percent as well, as land they sold on con-tract to younger farmers was returned under duress, and as thoseolder farmers with substantial equity picked up bargains at the bot-tom of the land market beginning in 1986. Today, active farmersover age 65 farm one-fifth of Nebraska. National figures are similar.Industrial StructureThe quest for convenience, portion control and reduced dietaryfat has pushed the meat industry toward a regimented, quality-con-trolled consumer product. The revolution that took place in poultryproduction in the 1960s and 1970s is well underway in pork and willsoon follow in beef. The changes in pork production are based onnew genetics and systems technology in pork production facilities.These changes are encouraging large-scale production and verticalarrangements (primarily contracts) that resemble franchising, inwhich producers provide labor and facilities in return for pigs, feed,medication and a prescribed management system. A University ofMissouri survey concludes that about 16 percent of hogs marketed in1991 were sold by contractors. Until recently, most of these contractswere between large, independent contractors and smaller grower-producers. Recently, large packers, especially those locating in newpork-producing regions, like Seaboard Corp. in Oklahoma andSmithfield Foods in North Carolina, have established major contractarrangements in order to assure supplies for large new packingplants and some of the large independent contractors like Tyson'sFoods and Premium Standard Farms have entered the packing in-dustry. The principal structural changes that follow are 1) loss ofopen markets for independent producers, 2) greatly increased con-centration in production and processing, and 3) diminished access tonew technology.Privatization of ScienceIf much of the new genetic and management technology is pro-duced in the private sector, it is also kept there either for use by the6 456 =innovator or for exclusive licensing to large agribusinesses that shareit only with their subordinates. This is true, not only in the livestocksector, but in all areas touched by biotechnology. The legal and in-stitutional changes making it possible to patent life forms have pro-vided a profit motive to agricultural science that has rarely existed.The principal threat to the public interest rests not so much in thepossible diminution of public agricultural science (such as less fund-ing), but in the potential corruption of public agricultural science asscientists seek both the security of life in public institutions and thereward of profit in service to industry.Resource Conservation and Sustainable AgricultureOne of the refreshing trends has been the awakened concernabout resource conservation and environmental protection. True,some of it is forced by society onto reluctant farmers, but there is agrowing segment of American agriculture that recognizes farmersare on the front line of expo-;ure to environmental health risks asso-ciated with some modern farming practices and that realizes farmershave used some purchased inputs excessively. In Iowa, farmershave reduced per-acre application of nitrogen fertilizer on corn by19 percent in five years without any loss of yield. The result: an esti-mated $40 million per year improvement in net farm income. Inshort, many farmers are finding out that efficiency can be improvedby reducing inputs rather than increasing them. Sustainable agri-culture thus builds on both e Avironmental and economic founda-tions, and interest in it is growing.Policy IssuesThese trends provoke many policy issues, some of which are brief-ly summarized here.The Rehabilitation of Farm ProgramsFarm programs do not accomplish many of their stated objectivesand they are increasingly an embarrassment of special privilege leg-islation. A handful of large, well-off farms specializing in some of themost resource-intensive crops reap a disproportionate share of thebenefits, while smaller farms and especially those with resource-con-serving crop rotations are comparatively disadvantaged by the struc-ture of the farm payments.Worse, because the larger farms have so much political clout, theyweigh in heavily to protect their privileges at the expense of otherfarmers when budget cuts are imminent. This spectacle of a priv-ileged few bellying up to the federal trough in hard times in order toreceive subsidies for doing a disproportionate share of the environ-mental damage cannot continue. 5765 At minimum, program benefits have to be targeted to the family-sized farmers whom the public continues to believe should receivefederal assistance, and more of the benefits have to be tied to envi-ronmental performance.Best targeting options:1) Eliminate the \"three-entity rule\" that allows large farms to ar-tificially subdivide in order to receive multiple payments and ef-fectively double the maximum payment they are allowed.2) Establish a \"graduated flex acre\" program. Flex acres are theportion of a farm's crop base on which any crop can be plantedand harvested, but on which no payment is received. Underthe \"graduated\" approach, the portion of base allocated to flexacres would be lower on a farm's first portion of production(say, 40,000 bushels of corn), then higher on subsequent por-tions.On the environmental front, an environmental reserve should beestablished through which farmers receive diversion payments in re-turn for :educing production through \"green\" practices, such as re-storing wetlands, planting grass strips on contours and along water-ways, reducing yield goals by reduced fertilizer and chemicalapplication, and establishing crop rotations that include resourceconserving and soil building crops. The reserve could be partiallyfunded with money saved by the stricter targeting suggestionsabove.Also, it is crucial that conservation and production goals, currentlyin tension with the commodity programs, be harmonized. A greatopportunity exists on this front in the expiration of the ConservationReserve Program. More than 36 million acres of highly-erodible landhave been removed in whole-field (and sometimes whole-farm)blocks at an average cost to the government of $50 per acre. Thebenefits of this program might be extended to more acreage at muchless cost if some land could be re-enrolled on longer-term contracts(twenty-five years or more) under partial-field enrollments. Thisway, grass waterways, field windbreaks, grass buffers and filter strips would provide conservation benefits, not only to enrolledacres, but to adjacent cropped land as well. Cost per acre benefittedwould be much less.Finally, it is vital that the Integrated Farm Management ProgramOption (IFMPO) established in the 1990 farm bill be strengthenedand effectively implemented. Under IFMPO, farmers can plant andharvest resource-conserving crops on base acres without losing defi-ciency payments on those acres and without losing base in futureyears. It was adopted in order to remove some of the programpenalties now faced by farmers who use crop rotations, but it has 58 been thwarted by administrative indifference and sometimes in-subordination.Role of Public CreditCongress went a long way in 1992 toward restoring the integrityand historic mission of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA).That mission was to serve as lender of last resort providing modestlevels of credit to capable farmers who could not get credit else-where but who, with supervised credit assistance, could graduateinto commercial credit within a few years. Over the decades, FmHAbecame the lender of least resistance to rapidly expanding farmsand, especially in times of financial stress, was called on to be everyfarmer's distress lender. Overwhelmingly, the much-publicized de-linquency in FmHA's portfolio has been among the larger farms thatwere not part of the agency's historic mission, but who were forcedon the agency by aCongress and several administrations eager toquiet concerns in the financial community about farm failures.In 1992, Congress passed legislation providing a priority for begin-ning farmers in the sale of inventory farmland acquired by FmHA inthe debt settlement process with other farmers, and enacted the Ag-ricultural Credit Improvement Act establishing the first credit pro-gram aimed at leveraging private capital to help beginning farmers.With most commercial lenders requiring 40 percent or more downpayment, beginning farmers have not been able to compete forfarmland even in the relatively low market prices of the late 1980sand early 1990s.Under FmHA's new program, beginning farmers who can mustera 10 percent down payment can receive a low-interest loan for tenyears for another 30 percentof the purchase priceenough to estab-lish commercial credit. At the reduced interest rate, the level of as-sistance actually provided the farmer under this approach is greaterthan the assistance traditionally provided when FmHA makes loanson 100 percent of thepurchase price on a thirty-year note at interestrates equal to the cost of money to the government. The new ap-proach spreads the money among more farmers, costs less per farm-er assisted, provides morefinancial help and leverages the privatemarket.The program only lacks vigorous implementation, but with theClinton administration preoccupied at this time with plans to re-organize the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (USDA), it seems un-likely to get it soon.Market AccessThe blessings of a market system are only realized if there aremarkets available to all competitors. The gravest threat to the future 596 7 leeof the family farming system is the loss of markets, especially live-stock markets long vital to the entry of new producers. The newmarket structures and institutional arrangements emerging in thepork industry call for a new generation of anti-trust policy designedto maintain competition.First, Justice Department guidelines need to be updated to givefull effect to the intent of the Clayton Act, intended to prevent con-centration by horizontal mergers before they are accomplishedto\"nip the weed in the seed\" as the framers of that act put it. Currentguidelines call for little or no.action unless the Herfindahl Index (thesum of the squares of the market shares of all firms in an industry)exceeds 1,800, and even these guidelines have been liberally ignoredon the excuse that alleged increases in economies of scale justifyconcentration. But the logical extension of that argument is that theindustry ought to be nationalized, a fate no one wants to see.Second, we need new policy toward vertical arrangements as theyrelate to competition. It is clear that some of these arrangementsthreaten access to markets for independent producers.An important precedent may be a case involving a contract dis-pute between Allied Grape Growers, a producer cooperative, andHeublein, a wine and liquor manufacturer. The two entered into acomplex joint venture in which Allied agreed to supply grapes toHeublein. When the deal soured, Allied sued and Heublein an-swered that the contract was no good because it violated anti-trustlaws.The court agreed. Under the contract, which only Allied couldbreak, Allied supplied an average of 24.2 percent of the grapes infive California regional markets. This foreclosed a substantial shareof the market to other producers and placed Allied in a position tocontrol market prices. The arrangement violated both Section 3 ofthe Clayton Act (,prohibiting exclusive dealing and tying contracts)and Section 1 of the Sherman Act (outlawing contracts in restraint oftrade (Mueller, undated).Third, the relevant market for enforcing anti-trust laws in the live-stock sector is the local or regional market, since most cattle andhogs are slaughtered within 200 miles of where they are produced.Until now, most Justice Department actions have been premised onnational market concentration levels, hardly relevant to a pork pro-ducer or cattleman who, on a good day, can only get two local bidsfor his product.And, finally, if packers are offering different prices to differentproducers for products of like quality, they may be guilty of pricediscrimination unless they can show that the price differences aredue to real differences in procurement costs, or are offered only tocompete with other packers, or do not adversely affect competition. 6860 There has not been much anti-trust action in the area of price dis-crimination lately and it needs to be revisited as a policy issue.New Public Agricultural Science MissionIn the 1970s, a series of extension publications mused quietly overwhether there would be a need for public research and extension ifagriculture became highly concentrated. There is no need to museanymore. The answer is plain to see for all but the innately naive:\"No.In the age of private agricultural science, there is a need toredefine the mission of the land grant university system. At leastpartly, that mission has been redefined by Congress to include sus-tainable agriculture.The 1990 farm bill set out six national purposes for federally-funded agricultural research which includes: \"enhance the environ-ment and the natural resource base upon which a sustainable agri-cultural economy depends.\"Of course, the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education(SARE) program carries the banner of this purpose, but, important-ly, the National Research Initiative (NRI), with its far heftier budget,is mandated to emphasize sustainable agriculture as well, and to di-rect at least 20 percent of its funds into \"mission-linked systems re-s'arch.\"Extension has been included in the sustainable agriculture missionbut, unfortunately, not in the budget.More funding is needed for sustainable agriculture in both re-search and extension. It could be that a more people-centered agri-culture is the only real hope for public agricultural science in an eraof increasing privatization of science.7) Role of U.S. Farmer in World Food SystemThere is less than meets the eye to free trade. In the past tenyears, the develo, ed nations have waxed eloquent about the theo-retical virtues of free markets, especially in agriculture. When oil-ex-porting developing nations from Nigeria to Mexico suffered financialhardships in the oil glut of the 1980s, they built up unmanageabledebts. Multinational banking institutions responded by forcing themto devalue their currency as part of an austerity campaign, makingfood imports more expensive and exports cheaper, hence improvingtheir balance of trade and, with it, their ability to repay loans to thedeveloped world. Sure it was hard on the poor, but it paid the note.Meantime, the developed world was fast apace engaging in itsown dirty little agricultural trade wars, lifting border prices, extend- 6169 ing export subsidies, increasing quotas, building walls against im-ports and greasing the export chutes. All the time we lecturedpietistically about free trade and used our financial might to imposeit on debt-ridden nations, we raised barriers on our own marketsand dumped our surpluses on other markets. Free trade is theoreti-cally pure, but practically speaking, it has always been somethingthe rich force on the poor.The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) may beculminated in the next few months and it will include an agriculturalagreement, but it will accomplish relatively little in breaking downthe trade hypocrisy of the developed nations of Japan, Europe andthe United States.The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), on theother hand, simply furthers policies already underway in both Mex-ico and the United States to integrate the two economies, especiallyagriculturally. Mexico has steadily opened its markets to America,going so far as to amend its constitution to allow land acquisition byforeigners and to permit holders of communal plots (called \"ejidos\")to alienate their holdings, which date to the Mexican Revolution. Asa result, ejidos are rapidly privatizing and consolidating, manyunder the auspices of joint ventures with U.S. investors. Some whooppose NAFTA on the grounds that it will devastate the peasantryof Mexico have not looked lately. They are being devastated any-way. NAFTA merely institutionalizes and accelerates a process welltinderway.But NAFTA also holds some promise for a more responsible kindof free trade. The side accords negotiated to appease labor and envi-ronmental movements primarily in the United States contain someunprecedented provisions to mitigate the potential damage done tocommunities as a result of trade liberalization. Most careful observ-ers agree the agreements do not go far enough to give teeth to theregulatory dog or freedom to the politically oppressed in Mexico (theright to sue for minimum wages is an empty right if they can throwyou in jail and throw away the key). Whether they go far enough topersuade a majority of the United States Senate to ratify the treaty isanother matter.But there clearly could have been more here, especially in theform of a North American Development Bank funded by bordertaxes and authorized to engage in broad development efforts onboth sides of the border to help displaced people and battered com-munities. From the beginning of its own economic integration, Eu-rope recognized the need to balance the equities between the richand poor regions it was trying to integrate. And Europe has beenmoderately successful at it, but with a top-to-bottom income gap onlyabout one-third the size of the gap between per capita incomes inthe United States and Mexico. 627 0 Absent development efforts to balance growth and mitigate dam-ages to communities, it is clear that apologies from economists not-withstanding, capital and jobs will move south to the border areasand the cities, while commodities and products move north. It willnot be much different for agriculture. Under USDA's most optimisticprojection, U.S. feed grain exports under NAFTA are likely to in-crease by an amount equal to no more than one percent of our an-nual production (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1992). But, ac-cording to the International Trade Commission, as many as 2,000,000peasants may be displaced from agriculture. It is better than maplesugar for slaves, but not a lot. REFERENCESMueller.

DC: No is-suing office listed, 1992. 6371 A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVEON CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGESIN U.S. FARM POLICYChip ConleyHouse Committee on AgricultureAs of this writing, Congress can claim two significant agriculturallegislative accomplishments: the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993(OBRA) and the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of1993. Also nearly finished is agriculture appropriations legislation forfiscal year 1994.The first legislative accomplishment, OBRA, is a combination ofspending reductions and tax increases designed to reduce the feder-al deficit nearly half a trillion dollars from fiscal year 1994 to fiscalyear 1998. Of that amount, a projected $3 billion is to be saved fromagriculture commodity, conservation and crop insurance programs.There is criticism from some quarters that half of the $3 billionreduction will not be realized as true expenditure reduction. Criticsargue that some measures related to crop acreage reduction pro-gram levels are specific to conditions in the Congressional BudgetOffice baseline, which are unlikely to be realized and, consequently,will not result in any savings. Other legislated reductions require theadministration to make program changes within its discretionary au-thority and that it already announced prior to the drafting of legisla-tion. Requirements to reduce excess losses in the Federal Crop In-surance prod ram are cited as an example of changes theadministration had already announced. It is also argued thatchanges in the timing of outlays, such as the requirement to repaysoybean loans within the same fiscal year they were originated, donot truly reduce government costs.The second significant piece of legislation, the Emergency Supple-mental Appropriations Act (Supplemental), reflects the president'srequest to provide emergency flood relief to the Midwestern states.Nearly $2.7 billion in disaster assistance is available to farmers incur-ring crop losses resulting from 1993 disasters. The cost may well ex-ceed the $2.7 billion estimate, however. The Senate struck the re-quired 50 percent proration of payments which were authorized inthe 1990 farm bill. Moreover, there is no absolute limit on total pay-ments because the Supplemental requires the use of CommodityCredit Corporation funds should demands for disaster assistance ex-ceed $2.7 billion. Finally, the Supplemental has been designated as72 64 =\"-an emergency requirement, thus exempting it from provisions of the1990 Budget Enforcement Act that would otherwise require offset-ting reductions in other appropriations.The agriculture appropriations bill, in conference report form,awaits Senate action, having passed the House in early August.Some changes may still occur in Senate deliberation, but the $71 bil-lion of budget authority is not likely to change significantly.How do the events thus far in this congressional session suggestagriculture will fare in the future? It is still too early to draw specificconclusions, but some themes begin to emerge. The Clinton admin-istration has not revealed itself clearly with regard to agriculture,but it does not appear to have the ideological bent against govern-ment involvement in agriculture demonstrated by the first Reaganadministration and, to a degree, the Bush administration.The Clinton presidential campaign had endorsed the 1990 farm billpolicies but questioned their implementation. Some reductions in ag-riculture spending, proposed as part of the administration's econom-ic program, seem to echo previous Reagan-Bush proposals. Theseinclude increased user-fees, federal crop insurance program re-forms, reduction in rural electrification subsidies, and reduced pay-ment acres for income support payments to farmers. Some policies,such as \"means-testing\" farm program payment eligibility based onoff-farm income, suggest a populist inclination to target assistance tosome notion of \"small\" farmers. Proposals for increased rural devel-opment program expenditures also reflect a desire to \"invest\" in theeconomically deprived. The administration's request for a disasterrelief supplemental appropriations bill underscores a desire to helpthose clearly in need. These inclinations may be repeated in Clintonfarm bill proposals in 1995.Despite the conservative nature of the proposals to reduce agri-culture spending, the total cuts, $7 billion in mandatory spendingover five years, was less than a third of the $22 billion proposed byPresident Bush in his 1990 budget submission for fiscal 1991. The $3billion reduction in farm spending in 1993 OBRA was less than aquarter of the $13.6 billion reduction in 1990 OBRA even thoughboth bills were projected, over a five-year span, to reduce futuredeficits nearly $500 billion, of which about $100 million were at-tributed to gross reductions in mandatory spending programs.For the moment, pressures to change agriculture appear to comefrom directions other than the budget reconciliation process as tit eyhave since 1981. The agriculture appropriations bill awaiting finalapproval illustrates this. It seeks reforms or reductions in programsthat have come under criticism such as federal crop insurance, theMarket Promotion Program, and restrictions on export promotion oftobacco and on funding of Women, Infants and Children clinics thatdo not prohibit smoking and on school lunch programs that require 6573 offering whole fluid milk. Also debated was the elimination of fiscal1994 funding for the honey program.Other reductions, such as the limitation of annual enrollment inthe Wetlands Reserve Program to 50,000 acres, were made to pro-vide additional funding to other Appropriations Committeepriorities. These reductions were considered necessary because ofthe budget caps, continued in the 1993 OBRA, that froze appropria-tions spending at, or below, the fiscal 1993 level. This is a trend thatwill likely continue in the future as capped appropriations spendingwill force programs to compete just to maintain their real 1994spending levels. Even greater competition will con .e from \"invest-ment\" initiatives announced by President Clinton as part of his eco-nomic program.Further changes to agriculture will be proposed in the Clinton ad-ministration's National Performance Review as part of the effort to\"reinvent, government.\" The introduction already made containsproposals to transfer the Food Safety Inspection Service from theU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to the Food and Drug Ad-ministration, eliminate the wool, mohair and honey programs, andclose and consolidate USDA agency field offices.Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of these developments from alegislative perspective is their drifting from the legislative jurisdictionand vehicles over which the Agriculture Committees have primarycontrol. In the past, a multi-year farm bill has been the venue for de-bate and votes on such issues. Today, we see the debate happeningin the Appropriations Committee and, in the case of reinventing gov-ernment, before committees concerned with government operationsand other jurisdiction. That means not only less control over legisla-tion and floor rules governing that legislation, but also repeatedvotes on issues. The honey program, for instance, will not only havebeen debated and voted on three or four times this year as part ofOBRA and appropriations bills, it will still face legislation under theNational Performance Review proposals.Trade issues, principally the North American Free Trade Agree-ment (NAFTA) and trade liberalization under the Uruguay Round ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), hold thepromise of net benefits for American agriculture. It is unclear whenimplementing legislation will appear before Congress. however.While the administration has a NAFTA agreement in hand, it facesdaunting opposition in the House. Majority Whip David Bonior hassaid he thinks three-quarters of House Democrats will opposeNAFTA. This makes its passage questionable at best.The trade agreement in GATT has yet to be concluded in spite of theexpiration of the congressional fast track resolution in December of thisyear. Though the focus of negotiations has shifted to non-agriculturalissues, because of the Blair House agreement between the United(466 States and the European Community, the new French government ismaking declarations that seek to undermine the Blair House accordand may be eliciting German support for their position.Of interest is the possible interaction of NAFTA and GATT. Thereis no requirement that NAFTA legislation be taken up beforeGATT, but its defeat would appear to have a most deleterious effecton GATT negotiations, shoring up the French position to underminethe Blair House accord. It appears some of the agricultural NAFTAopposition may be more anti-GATT in naturesuch as that of somefarm commodity interests to Section 22 quota protectionwith hopethat a defeat of NAFTA would lead to a failure in the GATT negotia-tions. All this suggests the legislative outlook, both strategy and out-come, is unclear, which isunfortunate because it may be agri-culture's best legislative initiative for some time.'There is some good news on the regulatory front. The Clinton ad-ministration has released a policy statement on wetlands protection.Regarding agriculture, the statement announces that recently com-pleted agency rule making will assure that about 53 million acres ofprior converted cropland will not be subject to regulation under Sec-tion 404 of the Clean Water Act. In addition, the statement desig-nates USDA's Soil Conservation Service (SCS) the lead agency onwetland delineations for agricultural lands and provides that SCSand other involved agencies will use the same procedures to deline-ate wetlands.In a similar spirit for pesticide legislation, the Clinton administra-tion has indicated it will propose food safety legislative alternativesto the Delaney clause, a 1950s provision of law that requires thepresence of no carcinogenic agents. This is particularly important since courts have held that Delaney is an absolute standard,overturning the de minimus standard for pesticide residue that hasbeen used for some time. Such a court ruling threatened the use ofmany currently registered pesticides.For the longer term, we must look to the 1995 farm bill. As statedearlier, a Clinton farm bill might have a structure similar to the 1990farm bill, with populist overtones. Though the president's farm pol-icy may seek to preserve a large measure of the budget resourcesfor farmers, larger budget policy concerns may not permit this.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has just released the Au-gust update of its 1994 budget outlook. Taking account of the re-cently passed OBRA and recent macroeconomic changes, the CBOprojects the deficit to decline from $266 billion in fiscal 1993 to $190billion in fiscal 1996 and then to increase to $360 billion by fiscal 2003.More importantly, the deficit increases its share of Gross DomesticProduct every year, from 2.5 percent in 1998 to 3.6 percent in 2003.This is largely the result of double digit growth rates in Medicare 6775 and Medicaid, the only major spending categories to increase fasterthan growth in the economy.These projections suggest that more budget cuts face Congress be-fore the deficit ceases to be an economic problem. The analysis ofthe deficit's increase, growth in health care program spending, sug-gests at which area the reductions might be best directed, but it isquestionable if this will happen. The Clinton administration healthcare reform proposals are expected to increase access to health in-surance and health care. Health care reform, when finally passed,may further reduce the Medicare and Medicaid spending levels, butit will unlikely alter the cost structure of providing health care, atleast over the next five years. Consequently, in 1995, the Clinton ad-ministration and Congress may feel the need to further reduce en-titlement spending. To attempt to stem the growth, additional cuts inhealth care programs may be in order, but other entitlement pro-grams will not go unscathed.Congressional budget committees will not likely focus on popularhealth care programs only. They will likely seek significant reduc-tions in other entitlement programs such as agriculture, veterans, orfederal retirement, even though these programs represent 2 per-cent, 5 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of 1998 health care pro-gram outlays. Agriculture, with two million farmers, may have thesmallest constituency of these three, and budget committees may re-member that agriculture took only a $3 billion reduction in the 1993OBRA. If they believe only half were true program reductions, andrecall the $2.7 billion in disaster assistance, budget committees mayseek reductions in agriculture similar to the 25 percent of projectedspending obtained in the 1990 OBRA.Reductions of this magnitude may lead agriculture committeesback to reductions in payment acres, the most obvious means toreduce deficiency payments, which are the bulk of annual com-modity program outlays. New approaches also may receive consid-eration. One alternative might be to convert income support pay-ments into some form of conservation/environmental paymentsmade for compliance with so-called sustainable cultivation practices.These payments would not in themselves reduce expenditures, butwould broaden the political constituency for payment to farmers.Revenue insurance, in one form or another, may be considered as apolicy that could reduce commodity program spending while provid-ing producers a means to manage risk associated with crop loss andmacroeconomic factors that have affected farm income beyond thereach of traditional farm programs.Pressure for legislative changes will continue to confront agri-culture on several new fronts. The question for agricultural interestsand policymakers is whether they will look forward, and adapt, tochanges or resist and fight rearguard battles, perhaps dissipating thegovernment resources available to agriculture. 6876 FARM GROUP PERSPECTIVEON U.S. FARM POLICYHarry BellAmerican Farm Bureau FederationKeeping rural America vibrant and vital is essential to Farm Bu-reau. Our members, four million families strong, live and earn theirlivelihood primarily in rural areas.The preceding speakers presented some of the numerical, statis-tical demographics of rural America. America's farmers andranchers are those demographics. We are the people and the econo-my, at least a significant portion.The nation's attention this year has been drawn to rural Americaas a result of natural disasters. Nightly television news showed farmhouses ripped from their foundations by raging floodwaters and dustbillowing around a farmer's feet as he walked the rows of his dehy-drated crop. These and similar scenes evoked sympathy. Rural peo-ple are grateful for the aid and assistance they have received so far.But the need will continue after the television spotlights fade.Disaster programs implemented by the federal government are inplace. The programs and regulations must be handled with commonsense and compassion. A tremendous job of rebuilding and restruc-turing faces rural inhabitants. We need a helping hand, not a heavyhand, from government.In the Midwest, more than one thousand levees were breached.Millions of acres were flooded. Now, with the water receding, somepools remain.Farmers want to get back to their farming. Some outside of agri-culture have already suggested that many of the levees should notbe rebuilt. They want the flooded land left alone. Some even wantthe flooded land classified as wetlands since there has been waterstanding on it for more than two weeks. Most have not mentionedcompensating the landowners involved. The federal government issaid to be considering a buy-out of landowners as a lower cost alter-native to rebuilding the levees. That's still talk, though.Temporary assistance programs for flood and drought sufferersalike are already in place and helping those who need it. And we inrural America are grateful. As we look to rebuild and improve ruralAmerica, rural development will be a policy catchall for manyvoices. Many will be well-meaning, many will be self-serving. 6977 I expect the term \"rural development\" will be heard loudly andoften as we write the next farm bill. The 1995 farm bill will do muchmore than set prices. Interests outside and inside agriculture willload the legislation with measures that address food safety, land useplanning, wealth redistribution, conservation practices, governmentspending and trade.Who will be involved? Everyone who wants to further their partic-ular point of view. Of course, there is the administration. PresidentClinton was elected to control spending and reduce the deficit. I stillwant to believe he. will try. But I also see he tends to be influencedby the last interest group that talks with him and he certainly tries toarrange compromises with all concerned.Secretary Espy, as our administration point man, has his particu-lar belief that farm programs should address and enhance rural de-velopment. We believe he is dedicated to serving production agri-culture, but he has a track record of yielding to pressures from socialplanners. There are many other new appointees, as well as thoseyet to be named to fill open positions in the department, who willplay a role. Others who will control the legislation are, of course,those who will write it and vote on itour legislators and their staffs.This is a new Congress-25 percent of the House of Representativesand 14 percent of the Senate were not there the last time a farm billwas written. We have an opportunity with our old friends and thisnew blood.Environmental and consumer groups will seek to play a large rolein the discussions. They are already planning for it. There is noquestion, no doubt in my mind, that environmental groups will seekto further erode our property rights in the next farm bill. They willuse the farm bill to mandate their brand of politically correct agri-culture.It is getting to the point that farmers may soon question the valueof the farm program. The University of Missouri estimates that, withdeclining base yields, flex acres and other modifications, farm pro-gram par'icipation is worth as little as $10 an acre to a corn growerand $20 an acre tr, a wheat grower. That may not be enough tocause some producers to stand in line at the Agricultural Stabiliza-tion and Conservation Service (ASCS) or to jump through the reg-ulatory hoops those outside agriculture are imposing.Politicians and special interest lobbyists will not be the only onesseeking to influence farm legislation. Within agriculture we will seevarious factions operating. Those who do not participate in farm pro-grams will look to protect their interests, and there will be the con-tinuing big farmer versus small farmer debate, with more lower-in-come producers adding their voices. In-fighting among commodities7870 probably will not be much different than what we have gonethrough in the past.Because of the direction of our opponents' interests, we will be en-gaged in debates over food safety, chemical use, biotechnology andfood costs. We will talk about conservation, sustainability and re-search for alternative crops, and alternative uses of traditionalcrops. Farm Bureau,following the policy guidelines established byfarmers, will work to maximize our ability to farm and make a profit.I want to make one more observation about the future of ruralAmerica, one much closer to home. To look at our future, let us lookat the recent past.The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) was founded in1919. Farm Bureau owes its founding to the land grant system's Ex-tension Service. Early on, many state legislatures required that acounty have a Farm Bureau before an extension agent could behired. The idea was that, with an organized Farm Bureau present,the agent would have a ready audience of local farmers handy. Thelatest information on agriculture and improvements for rural livingcould then be carried from the university to the farmer by the agent.The system worked extremely well. Eventually, farmers wantedto do more through their Farm Bureau. They wanted to form co-ops, lobby for legislationand speak out on civic issues. Farmerswanted their organization to be a moderating voice for all aspects ofagriculture. So the direct tie between Farm Bureau and land grantuniversities was cut.Yet, there is still a close connection, a very close bond. We areproud of our ag schools and our extension system. But farmers fearwe are losing our agriculture professionals, that extension servicesare drifting away fromthe original purpose. Traditionally, academicwork paid for by the public focused on teaching and research thatfostered growth. Today, many in agriculture feel the direction, thescope and the goals of extension and university research are chang-ing. We see and hear all too often of a change in direction, a changecited as necessary to build an urban constituency. This is done withthe idea that funding will be more easily accomplished or justified.We think we see the land grant system joining the urban migra-tion. Rightly or wrongly, this is a common perception out in thecountry. Why do we believe this? Some examples:We se,. federal funding to the land grant system increasingly di-rected into non production-oriented areas.We see tax-supported research projects awarded on the basis ofpolitical fads.We hear of research results being suppressed because the resultsare not what wereexpected. Projects conducted in Iowa and 7179 Texas were both terminated without publication because ex-pected levels of agricultural chemical contamination in run-offand groundwater did not materialize. Research procedures werenot questioned but the results were. Sound science took a backseat to the political urge for environmental correctness.Just as bad, much of the available research money is now beingspent on projects that verify and defend conventional agriculturalpractices. Most of these practices were developed and dissemi-nated by the Extension Service in the first place. Now we mustdefend best management practices from baseless charges madeby those with far less knowledge. This takes time and money thatcould be put to far better uses. Since research dollars are alwaysin limited supply, farmers would like more say in what projectsare undertaken.In Farm Bureau we are increasingly learning that if we want an-swers from the scientific community, we are expected to author-ize and pay for a special study. Farmers need answers if agri-culture is to have a role in any public policy debate. Whether theissue is pesticide residue tolerances, rural health care and costreform, trade barrier reduction, or the impact of restrictingchemical use on minor cropswe have had to fund studies to getanswers. These are issues of importance to all farmers, to allrural residents and, it could be argued, to all citizens. I thinkthey should have been addressed routinely, rather than as an ex-tra-curricular consulting opportunity.Farmers fear other developments in the Extension Sep vice aswell:We see a push toward organic, sustainable agriculture. I think Iknow what sustainable means, but I also think everyone has their own definition. My definition includes the word \"profit-ab;e\"because without profit there is no permanence. Some ofthese project reports on sustainable agriculture ignore profit, andare, therefore, ignored by farm families.We can always use improved marketing procedures and tech-niques.We believe there will be tremendous opportunities for farmersthrough new uses of existing commodities.We expect new plant varieties, better integrated pest controlmeasures, innovative machinery and enhanced animal produc-tion techniques.We need help determining the best management practices wecan use, those that accomplish the goals society establishes foragriculture while being environmentally friendly as well. 728 0 Many of you in this room can play a major role in maintainingAmerica's agricultural superiority. That is the public policy messagefrom America's farmers to you today--,-we need your help in devel-oping practical approaches to today's farming challenges. We needyour help developing common sense ways to farm better, more eco-nomically and environmentally.Some in government and elsewhere would have us jump from ourcurrent method of farming toother methods, untried or unproven.But farming is an evolutionary science and your teachings must ac-commodate evolutionary change. To be of the greatest help to thefarm community, programs must reflect that evolution through ameasured, tested approach. Please do not join the rush to embracethe latest fad or prove the popular cause.Farm Bureau is proud to work with you. We have in the past. Wewill in the future. You can help provide us with the answers weneed so we can give the people of the United States and the worldthe agricultural production system they need.Just last month, several heads of agriculture met with the AFBFboard of directors. We visit regularly with both land grant school ag-riculture deans and Extension Service directors. We enjoy the al-liance that has developed over the decades. And Farm Bureau is thefirst group to speak up in defense of higher budgets for our landgrant schools.We have a partnership built on more than seventy-five years of co-operation and mutual respect. Working together to build ruralAmerica, our accomplishments will continue to be unparalleled andunequalled anywhere in the world, anytime in history. 73 -44 An EvolvingPublic Policy Education 82 PUBLIC POLICY IN A CHANGING SOCIETYOtto DoeringPurdue UniversityThe scope of this topic is broad enough to be beyond predictionand almost beyond imagination. It is also questionable whether oneclose to the topic can comment with dispassion and see the forest forthe trees. I remember Jim Watson's criticism of the narrowness ofBritish biologists in the 1950s, especially their non-interest in bio-chemistry and their tendency to \"waste their efforts on useless pol-emics about the origin of life or how we know that a scientific fact isreally correct\" (Watson, p. 46). I will try to be different.I am going to start from the widely held view that there is some-thing wrong with public policy today. I will contrast some differentviews about what is wrong with public policy (and its formation),identify some major common touchstones of these, look at some his-torical experience, and then venture a few of my own opinions.Many believe that citizen democracy is not functioning, represent-ative government has failed, and the primary role of public policyleaders is to reconnect citizens to their political world. But, in assess-ing any problem, we need to start by asking why we are where weare todaybecause people are not generally stupid, and there aregood reasons why they are doing what they are doing.Daniel Yankelovich, in his book Coming to Public Judgment,assesses the problem as follows: Americans are not worried abouttheir political freedom and their political liberty is not endangeredthey take it for granted, and among other things this allows them tofocus on their material well-being. What is dangerous is the erosionof participation (p. 1). Implicitly he is also talking about the erosionof the effectiveness of participation. Contrast this with the total-itarianism of both the right and the left which spurred participationto extremes as part of the mechanism of social control. We saw thisin Nazi Germany and in 100 percent voter turnouts in Communistcountries, but this is not the sort of participation Yankelovich is talk-ing about.Several factors have led to this erosion of participation (which co-incidentally erodes the impact of participation and may lead to a de-cline in the freedom to participate). His assessment is that \"few in-stitutions are devoted to helping the public form consideredjudgments\" (Yankelovich, p. 4). Yankelovich, the quintessential 7783 pollster, blames part of this on the opinion polls and the media. Hebelieves opinions expressed at the moment are not the judgmentspeople would actually make. \"The quality of public opinion is goodwhen the public accepts responsibility for the consequences of itsviews and poor when the public, for whatever reason, is unpreparedto do so\" (Yankelovich, p. 24, italics Doering's).What is important to Yankelovich is a process that gets people topublic judgment. This process includes three phases: consciousnessraising, working through and resolution. This is none other than ourbasic public policy education model of problem identification, eval-uation (assessing alternatives and their consequences) and choosinga solution (based on facts and values).One reason such public judgment is short circuited is that themedia is not doing its job. He points out that the media does lots ofconsciousness n ising with little attention to alternative solutions andtheir consequees (the working-through process). The media alsofalls down in agenda settingnot correctly identifying the problem,i.e., symptoms rather than the problems themselves become thefocus. Both of these limit the process of coming to public judgment.Yankelovich also believes there is a problem with the \"Expert-Public\" gap. This is especially important during the working throughstage. What is the public to think when the experts disagree? Part ofthis difficulty arises from major differences between expert and pub-lic opinion (even when the experts agree!). He summarizes these dif-ferences as follows:Expert OpinionPublic OpinionAn empirical proposition. A value judgment.Can be validated. Cannot be validated.Personal preferences Personal preferences.are set aside. are major focus.Criteria of quality Criteria of qualityis validity. is acceptance ofresponsibility forone's views.Many misunderstandings between experts and the public origi-nate in \"the differing points of departure each side takes to variousissues\" (Yankelovich, p. 92). The technocratic view of the world andthe difficulties in communication between experts or elites and thepublic are a major theme for Yankelovich. They figure prominentlyin the inferred causes of the problem he identifies as \"sources of re-sistance\" (Yankelovich, pp. 181-189). These are:1. A self-centered view of the world.2. Threats to the status of experts. $1178 3. Modernism as an ingrained philosophy of learning behavior (in-strumental rationality and the culture of technical control).4. The worship of Science.His view is similar to the kind of skepticism exhibited in the late1800s by Mark Twain (read Connecticut Yankee ..) and others to-ward the dominance of technology and the technical elite. There aresome interesting messages here for those who consider themselvestechnical specialists who know what ought to be done.In summary: the message from Yankelovich is that public opinionon which policy is based today is ill-formed and incompletelyformed. What is needed for good public policy is what he calls publicjudgment. Some of us would see public judgment as the product of atraditional public policy education experience that integrates effec-tive problem identification, consideration of a range of alternativesand their consequences, and the final decision which includesvalues, facts and an acceptance of the consequences in making thefinal individual judgment.Frances Lappe has another view (and describes another part ofthe public policy elephant) in her book Rediscovering America'sValues. She believes we should use our values as guides for the waywe decide and conduct policy. My immediate response to that state-ment is to reflect upon the difficulties Woodrow Wilson brought uponus when he began doing this in the conduct of foreign policy. This leaves me with some disquiet, and a feeling that this may worksometimes, rather than with a ringing endorsement of this approach.Lappe continues: \"We have institutionalized our values, thesevery institutions are now introuble, and we have thus lost thestrength and freshness of the application of our values (through in-stitutions) to considering appropriate policy.\" As we read further, itbecomes clear Lappe is concerned about some very specific values.Lappe focuses on the Liberal belief of self-centerednesstheHobbes and Bentham idea of the basic competitive nature of manwhich causes real problems when debating or deciding publicissues. In the past, this competitive individualism was mitigated byWestern religion even though Liberal thought sanctified institutionslike private property and the market in a way that further mitigatedagainst useful and productive common decision making. In the Lib-eral tradition, private property's role was to provide \"a source of in-dependence against state power and other individuals.\" Also, themarket did not require any \"consensus about community needswhile directly expressing individual desires\" (Lappe, p. 10).Lappe not only defines the Liberal (with a capital \"L\") traditioncorrectly, but also effectively uses Adam Smith as a counter argu-mentsomething to make conservative economists gnash theirteeth. She says Smith thought the individual's sense of self worth 7985 was embodied entirely within society and that there were externalrules above individual human accountability. There is something ofa chicken-and-egg difficulty here about priorities and precedencethe individual or the common good.Lappe wants society to have a sociologist's or cultural anthropolo-gist's view of the world (not realizing that the old cultural anthropol- .ogy tradition has been ridden out of that profession). A democraticgovernment is not to be just a means to an end, but prized throughcertain community values in its own right. (What we see here is a\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" view of democracy). Lappe holdsthat today, private property and the market should not be institu-tions just for protecting or enhancing the individual but should be-come mere \"devices subordinated to our socially defined needs\"(Lappe, p. 13). Property rights become rights of membership. AdamSmith's broader concept of social justice plays in here as well. WhatLappe calls for is a change in the dominant set of traditional Liberalvalues as a solution for inappropriate policy that is based upon an in-appropriate vie w of the world and an individual's place in it.Lappe is advocating changing society (societal values) to changepolicy while Yankelovich is advocating changing the process throughwhich the public expresses its wishes about policy decisions. Is soci-ety misinforming policymakers so we have to change the process, oris the nature of today's society such that we have to change it (itsvalues) to get \"good\" policy? Alternatively, are institutions at fault?I, for one, am certainly not going to answer this question for you!Typifying the institutional approach, Harry Boyte comments that,\"Institutional politics is the practice in most large organizations andin government, it involves a strongly hierarchical structure, a lan-guage of rational calculation of individual costs and benefits, and alargely one-way information flow. This is what has left most peoplein the roles of spectator and political consumer today. It's what peo-ple love to hate\" (Boyte, p. 5, italics Doering's).Benjamin Barber refines this distinction claiming, \"It is almost asif there are two democracies in America: the one defined by nationalparties and presidential politics and bureaucratic policies, a remoteworld circumscribed by Washington's beltway, walling in the politi-cians even as it walls out the citizens; and the other defined byneighborhood and bis,2k. associations, PTAs and community actiongroups, an intimate domain no larger than a town or rural countywhere women and men gather in small groups to adjudicate differ-ences or plan common tasks. With something of a pejorative sneer,we call the first \"politics,\" cynical about the corruption of politicians,skeptical about the competence of voters or about the possibilities ofparticipation in affairs so complex and institutions so bureaucratized.But about the second we wax exuberant, celebrating its spirited 8086 good-n-_;ghborliness and restless activity, though we scarcely associ-ate it with politics or democracy at all\" (Barber, p. xi.).Clearly there are very different views about what these people seeas the basic problem of public policy today. It is fair to ask at thispoint whether these commentators are addressing symptoms ratherthan causes. None of them explicitly deal with:1. The tremendous economic changes since the Second WorldWar, wherein our nation started as the dominant economy inthe post war period and is now being forced to accept a lesserstatus.2. The great changes in demographics over the last generationthat include changes in density, age distribution, ethnic com-position, and comparative well-being.3. The demise of the American melting-pot ideal.4. The critical role of elites in changing or setting societal values.(One would certainly have expected Lappe to focus on this).5. The rapidly changing view of what is \"correct\" politically.There have been a number of extremely important historicalchanges. Among them are the changes in the nation's economy andshifts in regional power as well as the changing power shifts relatedto demographics. Our notion of what is \"progressive\" has changedit is no longer equated with the populist views of the late nineteenthand early twentieth century.We have seen the demise of the Victorian-based reforms thatshaped what good and appropriate societal activities were for sever-al past generations. These include a further change in the role andplace of women todaya further evolution from the Victorian ac-complishment of placing women and children in a protected statusless subject to physical abuse. We have seen great changes in the ex-pectations for, content of, and quality of education. We have seenchanges in the definition of public and private ethics away from thepuritanical Victorianism, some of which may have been hypocritical,but some of which fostered accepted behavior, trust and sharedideals between individuals. (This change made the savings and loanscandals possibleand the public does not seem to care that muchabout it, as long as the costs are paid later!). Finally, we have seenthe demise of the folklore of personal honesty, thrift and hard workwhich served as an important stimulus to productivity and a sense ofcommunity responsibilitysomething Lappe does not take into ac-count when talking almost exclusively about the competitive Liberaltradition. All of these are major factors if we are to try to explainwhy we are where we are today.'..loupled with this has been a critical change in the basic content ofour national policy in America. In the past our national agenda in- 8187 eluded: the establishment, defense and consolidation of the nation;the settling of the land; and the populist social reform goals to makesociety bettereducating, protecting and giving opportunity to theyoung and the less fortunate on the one hand and, on the other, at-tempting to limit the scope of the powerful and wealthy to preventtheir taking advantage of their position. All of this took place duringa period of growing national wealth and prominence based upon asuperb natural resource endowment easily capable of supportingour growing population.Today, there is no overriding national agendalittle sense of na-tion building or of building a national culture. There are fewershared ideals, where previously many opinion setters shared a com-mon agenda including some degree of social responsibility. We facea declining resource base for essential production inputs and pres-sure on basic life resources like air and water. Most importantly, thecritical economic questions being faced tod:..y are divisive ones overpower, wealth and income distribution. People scramble to get alarger share for themselves with less focus on economic growth foreveryone. The compensation for Fortune 500 CEOs has gone fromthirty-five times their workers' average pay in the mid-1970s to 143times in 1992 (Wall Street Journal, p. 1). We see fights over majoreconomic stakes in the debate on national health care. Some worryabout the distribution of resources going increasingly toward the oldrather than the youngothers are concerned about the declining at-tention given to investment in the future which is being sacrificed forcurrent consumption.All of these are major factors if we are to try to explain why weare where we are today, and many of the commentators on our na-tional dilemma focus instead on merely jiggering the present systemto get us somewhere else. Jiggering the system will not have suffi-cient impact to alter the paths of so many loaded trains that have al-ready gathered speed in other directions.There have been many basic changes in our society, its make-up,its values, and in the resources available to support it. This will haveto lead to changes in the way society decides issues under almostany view of where our society should be going.The nature and content of current and future public policy is justvery different from what it was in the past and will evolve into some-thing different in the future. These new issues are stressful on thedecision process in different waysall of which will require that de-cisions be made differently from the way they were in the past.Given this change in society and in the basic nature of the criticalpublic policy issues for society, I would not expect just a process re-form such as Yankelovich suggests to meet our public policy decisionmaking needs. I would not expect a sudden shift to Lappe's more so-cially-based set of values to do the je', either. In fact, we already88 82 have seen some very important shifts in valuessomething that doesoccur as a matter of course in open societies. For example, animportant redefinition of property rights has already taken place. Inthe dispute over the preservation of wetlands, those who own wet-lands have lost some of the discretionary rights over their propertyto the general public that prefers to preserve this resource.My own bias leads me to believe there may be real value in tryingto modify decision-making institutions so national decisions receivemore of the attention and participation of the individual as Boyteand Barber suggest. But progress here is not made in a vacuum. Wewill have to do a better job identifying the changes in society andpublic policymaking that have already taken place and try to bettergauge their impact upon current and future policymaking. This mustbe part of the definition process of the causes of our current dilem-masthe \"why we are where we are today\" that should have a log-ical explanation. If we cannot make this identification, we may bechasing symptoms. If we cannot speak with some accuracy and au-thority about why we happen to be investing less today in our youthand more in our elderly we are unlikely to provide a good basis forthe public to ask if they want to continue in this direction or changeto another path.Tim Wallace pointed out in our discussion that change is made atthe periphery (the local level, the more modest decision), and thatwe do accomplish a great deal by aiding this process. I agree withthis, but believe we need to try to keep a broader focus to ensurethat we deal with core societal issues and also with the question ofmore effective consideration of public policy issues determined atthe center of government.Jerry Howe raised the critical question of institutional changenot only for decision making but also for implementing new policies.If our changing society makes a new policy shouldn't we pay atten-tion that institutions also change to make that new policy happen?The answer is certainly yes.Both of these are important considerations. I would add that I amnot sure exactly what direction the public policy process or publicpolicy education should move in, but we should be moving some-where different from where we are today. My view is that where weare today still reflects a past that is no longer with us in terms ofissues, values, priorities and the decision making process itself.We must do a better job identifying the major drivers of policychange that operate today and tomorrow, and as part of this processdo a better job identifying those issues that are (and will be) relevantto society. This is all the more difficult because we do not have anidentified and commonly shared national agenda. We are dealing in-stead with narrower issues and concerns over which there is not uni- 838'9 versal agreement. But, this is where we are, and these have to bedealt with.I am convinced the success of Perot in gaining as large a vote ashe did in the 1992 presidential election sterns from his focus on issuesof concern to the public that were being ignoreci or not dealt with bythe two major parties. Given the megalithic structure of our two na-tional political parties today, they are increasingly less flexible inshedding old concerns and taking on new ones. This inflexibility ispart of what Boyte and Barber are talking about. The cost andmedia structure of the political process we have today give even lessopportunity for ventures like Teddy Roosevelt's Bull Moose party.However, it is increased flexibility to take on new public issues anddeal with them effectively that will, in my view, be the critical hall-mark of how effectively we, as a nation, cope with the future.

HahnCornell UniversityWhat is new or different about public policy education comparedto five or ten years ago? Here are four things that seem new to me:First of all, we have richer and more complicated discussions of ad-vocacy. Most of us acknowledge that we advocate for education andfor better-informed decisions; many advocate for more participationand for attention to specific issues or concerns; some advocate forparticular types of solutionsin the form of, for example, \"any solu-tion as long as it takes environmental consequences nto account\"(Hahn, Greene and Waterman). We are more likely to admit thatbiasspeech or behavior that can be interpreted as advocacyisunavoidable. We pay attention to the argument that learning re-quires passion and advocacy is more passionate than neutrality. Wetalk more about balance and fairnessabout the need to include, re-flect and respect all viewpoints on an issue and the value of aimingfor mutual understanding and the search for mutually acceptable so-lutions.Some of us still argue that educators should be objective (House),while others insist objectivity has its drawbacks and advocacy has aplace in the educator's repertoire (Hite). In either case, we in-creasingly feel compelled to give reasons for our positions. We bringto more conscious and deliberate attention the choice of whichstance we think is more ethical, which one best fulfills our responsi-bility to the public that pays our salaries, or which one we have rea-son to believe will be more effective in promoting learning and con-structive action on ptessing public issues. Those, it seems to me, arethe important questions to be thinking and talking about.The second change I see is that we are getting closer to a genuinemerger of content and process. Although I know it's an over-simplification, it has always seemed to me that, historically, publicpolcy educators were long on contentabout farm issues and farmpolicy, for examplewhile community developers were long onprocess. We are now getting past that dichotomy. In a recent com-parative evaluation of eleven projects funded by the Kellogg Foun-dation, my colleagues and I noted that projects and people that start-ed with an emphasis on information provision often moved in thedirection of increasing attention to dialogue, process assistance, local 8591 Nfocus and intensity of interventions (Hahn, Greene and Waterman).Examples: They added discussion groups to conferences and thenlearned that better discussions occurred when the groups were in-structed to come up with policy recomme idations. They investedheavily in developing educational materials, but eventually realizedthat creating dialogue among diverse interests had a bigger impact.They uncovered a more important role for extension at the countylevel than they appeared to have envisioned at the beginning, andthey adopted strategies like offering mini-grants to support local fol-low-up activity.In those projects, content specialists frequently identified a criticalrole for process assistance, made connections with process spe-cialists, and developed their own process skills. Most likely, theyalso learned a lot about the unique challenges of presenting tech-nical information in the context of public issues. (With the benefit ofhindsight, I wish we had made more inquiries about that in our workfor Kellogg). I suspect some of the content specialists learned thereis no such thing as neutral informationthat every piece of informa-tion is good news for some parties to an issue and bad news forothersand they may have found the alternatives-and-conse-quences framework helpful. I would guess they also learned infor-mation is most helpful when it addresses questions to which partici-pants in an issue agree they need answers and that it helps whencontent specialists let people know that they know information alonewill not resolve the issues. I think we need to make more effort totap the lessons content specialists have learned and to help themshare their lessons with one another.I need to acknowledge that some of the Kellogg projects alsolearned about the limits of processabout the need to provide infor-mation as well as dialogue in order to rise above the pooling of igno-rance. It simply happened that most of the Kellogg-supported proj-ects were led by content specialists whose learning was often in theprocess direction. I would expect projects led by process specialiststo exhibit more learning in the other direction. There is clearlylearning that needs to take place in both directions. Process spe-cialists can increase the impact of their own work by refining theirability to connect it with the work of content specialists.The third change I see is that we are developing a richer and morecomplicated picture of how educational impact happens. We stillknow it is sometimes as easy as laying out the issues, the options andthe consequences for key policymakers, who then use the knowl-edge they have gained from us as they make decisions. But we alsoknow that it is sometimes a lot more complicated. What prevents pol-icymakers from acting is often lack of agreement rather than lack ofknowledge. They may need help in reaching agreementor help inhelping their constituents reach agreement. In still other cases, pol-icymakers are not our primary audience. We may be working with citizens who do not understand the policy process very well at alland who need a lot more than a laying out of the issues, the optionsand the consequences before we can say the educational process iscomplete.To meet these more complicated challenges, we are learning thateducation needs to begin with people's everyday concerns and thelabel \"policy\" can be a turnoff. We are learning that process as-sistance as well as content is neededand this includes the educa-tional process as well as the policy process. We need to help peopleunderstand policy-making; we need to link our educational interven-tions to the evolution of the policy process; and we need to be sen-sitive to how different people and groups learn. We are also learningthat a single, one-shot educational event is often not enoughthatthere needs to be ongoing contact and a sequence of activities inorder for education to have an impact on individual learning or onthe issues. We are learningor at least we have a hypothesisthat1) vublic policy education for newcomers to the policy process iseasiest ;n the local arena; 2) impact on issues requires some kind ofmatch between the scope of the audience and the scope of the issue(in other words, educating people in Illinois about the national farmbill is a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not likely to have much de-tectable impact on the farm bill, at least in the short run); and, con-sequently, 3) the valuable goal of helping newcomers have an impacton state or national issues will not be realized without a fairly com-plex, long-term, multi-level educational strategy.The fourth change I see is that we are finding better language to talkabout our objectives and impacts. When we evaluate our work, wecontinue to do it most frequently in terms of impact on individuallearners. Did their \"KASA\"their kno -fledge, attitudes, skills or as-pirations (behavioral intentions)change? But we are at least as in-terested in impacts on issues or on the policymaking process. Welook for such impacts; we talk about them and take pride in them.Examples from the Kellogg projects (Hahn, Greene and Waterman):\"References were made in the governor's rural health strategymeeting to things learned during the project's educational program.\"\"There had been antagonism between two school districts, but theyparticipated together in the project's educational program and arenow talking about cooperation.\" \"Creation of the state rural devel-opment commission was a direct result of the project's statewideworkshop.\" \"Language drafted for the county zoning law incorpo-rated protection of groundwater resources as recommended by proj-ect participants.\" Note that the impacts here are not primarilychanges in individuals (though changes at that level are certainly in-volved), but changes of a more general, or collective, nature in howissues are addressed, talked about or dealt with.Anecdotal evidence of this sort is easy to find. We simply need tohe more systematic in looking for such evidence and recording it. I 8793 sometimes wonder if we have do. - relatively little of this becausewe are afraid of success. Have we been inhibited from evaluatingimpacts on issues because reporting them may imply that we havebeen successful in advocating particular outcomes? Do we worrythat asking about impacts on issues might be interpreted as evidenceof a desire to influence outcomes in a particular direction? If so, Ithink the situation is changing. We are beginning to find the lan-guage to talk about the impacts we want to haveand to report theimpacts we have hadin terms that are publicly defensible. By that,I mean talking not about Specific outcomes or influences in particu-lar directions, but about something broadersomething that willseem positive to reasonable people on all sides of an issue and espe-cially to the great numbers of citizens who do not like any of the ex-treme positions. An appropriate measure of success (or failure), forexample, might be to document something like the extent to whichwe have provided constructive assistance in moving issues towardresolution in ways that reflect the perspectives of policymakers andaffected parties on all sides of the issue.Such a conception of goals-and-outcome measures brings us closerand closer to the heart of widely-recognized shortcomings in the waypolitics is practiced in our culture. We have a political system thatseems unable to respond effectively to a growing array of publicproblems. Americans hate politics, according to E. J. Dionne, Jr.,because political discourse has become polarized, ideological andunauthentic. rolitics has ceased being \"a deliberative processthrough which people [resolve] disputes, [find] remedies and [move]forward\" (p. 322). \"When Americans watch politics now,\" Dionnesays, \" ...they understand instinctively that [it's] not about findingsolutions. It is about discovering postures that offer short-term politi-cal benefits\" (p. 332).Interviewers who talk at length with ordinary citizens find theyknow perfectly well that public issues are complicated (Sanders;Harwood; Gamson; Graber). They know there are no easy answers.They know that compromises and creative problem solving areneeded. The fault they find with politics is not that it is too complex,but that it oversimplifies and polarizes and fails to explore the am-biguous gray areas between the extreme positions. Studies relyingon qualitative interviews suggest citizens are not apathetic eventhough they want nothing to do with politics as it is currently prac-ticed (Harwood). They lor_, for a politics they can trust, and, aboveall, they want solutions that are fair (Sanders; Hochschild). Theywould like it if things worked out in their fo,. or, but, if forced tochoose, they opt for outcomes that are fair for everybody. I know atleast two studies that reached that conclusion. In one, in whichtwenty-six individuals in Utica, New York, were interviewed atlength, no less than half of the interviewees mentioned at least onepolicy they approved even though it hurt them personally (Sanders). 88 Examples include a tavern owner who favored a higher drinkingage, a retired person who favored budget cuts even though his pen-sion would be smaller, and a defense worker who believed defensespending should be cut.Interviews with policymakers reveal a similar degree of dissatis-faction with politics, but many of them have only limited views ofhow relationships with citizens could be different (Harwood). Pol-icymakers' interactions with citizens tend to be limited to one-on-oneconversations or shouting matches at meetings at which issues havealready reached the boiling point. Neither situation lends itself to thedevelopment of wide-ranging mutual understanding. Many pol-icy-makers see policy-making as a burden that they are not expectedto share. They believe they are supposed to have the answers or, ifthey do not, that it is their job to find them. They envision little pos-sibility of a larger role for citizens.At least some policymakers, however, appreciate opportunities toget beyond the surface of public opinion and to understand why peo-ple hold the views they do (Perry). They like it when citizens have achance to get a better understanding of issues and see they are notblack and white. In a California case reported in the Journal of Ex-tension, city officials who were \"frustrated by the 'no-win' attitude atpublic meetings and the lack of community leadership on pressingissues\" asked extension to help create a citizen \"sounding board\" to\"analyze important community issues, report potential solutions andtheir consequences, and make recommendations\" (Rilla and Re-edy). In New York, a state legislator who had groups on all sides ofan issue \"yelling\" at him asked extension in one of the counties toget industry, environmental, community and legislative representa-tives together to come up with recommendations for educational orlegislative responses. (The issue involved spraying herbicides onutility right-of-ways. It was related to me in a personal conversation).I am sure many of you could cite similar examples.Evidence like this points to a widely-recognized societal need thatis awfully close to what I believe is our evolving understanding ofpublic policy education. Am I in too much of a dream world if I envi-sion extension playing a prominent role in filling this critical niche?Extension is badly in need of a new public image. It has tried toshake a too-narrowly-agricultural image, but, as I see it, has movedin so many different directions it is hard for anyone outside the or-ganization to make sense of it--even those who have great respectfor its work. We are evolving a conception and a practice of publicpolicy education that resonates with a widely recognized societalneed, and that conception and practice have the potential to be acommon theme woven through every extension program. We havereached a point at which Pat, ick Boyle, former director of extensionin Wisconsin, has called public policy education a \"path to politicalsupport\" and a recent Extension Committee on Organization and 8995 Policy (ECOP) position statement envisions extension in the twenty-first century as \"known for benefiting society\" through its ability toaddress controversial issues, facilitate public discourse, provide rele-vant knowledge and increase the likelihood of collaborative solu-tions. I think we are getting there. The question is whether we willdo so in time. REFERENCESBoyle, Patrick G. \"Public Policy Education: A Path to Political Support.\" Epsilon Sigma Phi Newsletter, p.

FaasWashington State UniversityFor many years, extension public policy educators have placedtheir faith in the standard alternatives/consequences (A/C) model.Among the variations promoted at the National Public Policy Educa-tion 'Conference for more than four decades, the alternatives/conse-quences model has at least three common steps: 1) clarify the prob-lem or issue; 2) develop alternatives; and 3) identify consequences ofeach alternative.An essential corollary of this A/C model has been the notion of\"the teachable moment,\" defined as an unspecified, but generallyshort, period of time bounded by: 1) when people are not interestedin the issue and 2) when the lines are drawn between fightingparties. In other words, teaching alternatives and consequences willnot work very well if people do not pay attention, due to either indif-ference or intolerance. As so eloquently stated by one of ourpanelists, \"Teachable moments occur when stakeholders are con-cerned enough about a public issue to participate in an educationprogram, yet not so fervent that they would be unable to accept ob-jective information.\"The two plenary presentations by Otto Doering and Alan Hahnraise challenges about innovative public policy education in a chang-ing society. Some fundamental questions include:How is the problem defined and by whom?How are the alternatives identified and by whom?Concerning evaluation of the alternatives, how are the criteriafor choice selected and by whom?I believe these questions raise some serious implications for howextension educators conduct public policy education, with whomand when. As we examine new methods for how to conduct publicpolicy education and with whom, I suggest there is a need and anopportunity to expand the notion of \"the teachable moment.\" In par-ticular, as we are increasingly faced with highly contentious issuesthat tend to escalate more quickly, the timing dimension of when wecan conduct education, and for how long we are able to remain en-gaged with the audiences and the issue, becomes critical.We planned these three concurrent workshops on \"Skills for En-hancing Education About Public Issues\" to address some of these 9197 fundamental questions and to explore new methods for enhancingthe A/C model. In examining \"Alternative Dispute Resolution(ADR): Approaches to Conflict Management,\" consider the pos-sibility of rethinking the teachable moment. Specifically, by payingcloser attention to the elements of \"who\" and \"how,\" we may beable to stretch out the \"when.\" I suggest a general proposition that\"the teachable moment\" can be extended by approaches designedto involve the broadest possible spectrum of people affected by theissue in the definition of the problem, in the generation of alter-natives, and in the identification of criteria by which they evaluatethe alternatives. In this sense, alternative or collaborative disputeresolution can be seen as an enhancement of the alternatives/conse-quences model rather than a replacement for it. 92 COLLABORATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTIONPROCESSESRobert M. JonesFlorida Growth Management Conflict Resolution ConsortiumFlorida State UniversityPeople are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they havethemselves discovered than by those which have come into the minds ofothers.Blaine PascalImportance of Collaborative Dispute ResolutionPublic Problems in a Democratic SocietyIn his remarks at the 1992 National Public Policy Edil..:,.t.;on Con-ference, Michael Briand from the Kettering Foundation discussedpublic problems in a democratic society. He said there is no singlestandard, rather multiple perspectives on what is the \"public inter-est.\"Shared Power Context. As described by John Bryson and BarbaraCrosby, no one institution or organization is in a position to find andimplement solutions to the problems that confront us as a societyinother words, no one is in charge! Their hook, Leadership for theCommon Good: Tackling Public Problems in a Shared Power World,sets forth how to think and act more effectively in a shared powercontext. Dimensions of a shared power context include:Increased complexity, uncertainty, turbulence and risk.Fragmentation, division and separation.Individual versus societycompetition versus cooperation.Declining capacity to manage and to govern changing role ofelected leaders.Solutions that can be implemented only when a critical consen-sus is created and sustained.Public Decision-Making Trends. In their work on consensual ap-proaches to resolving public disputes, Lawrence Susskind andJeffrey Cruikshank suggest that this country's public policy processis in the throes of decision-making paralysis when it comes to takingaction on important and controversial public issues. Another deci-sion-making trend is new mandates for public participation in 70s/80s(with tools for this evolving). 9399 Emerging Collaborative Leadership Models. An effective publicleader will realize that the solution does not lie outside the public butwithin it. What should .be done becomes clear only as members ofthe community deliberate together. Effective public leaders do notassume the problem is already defined, but solicit a variety of per-spectives and seek to integrate them into a new genuine communityperspective on the problem. A community leader is one who helpsthe community find its voice and set its direction.Goal of Public Policy EducationThe goal of public policy education is to increase understanding ofpublic issues and policy, as outlined by Barrows and Danielson.Collaborative Dispute Resolution Efforts. Over the past decade,dispute resolution processes such as mediation, negotiated rule mak-ing and policy dialogues have become more common features uponthe public policy landscape at every level of government. Theseprocesses, which are sometimes referred to by catch-all titles such asAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) or Collaborative ProblemSolving (CPS), have been most commonly used on an ad hoc basis toresolve conflicts that arise during policymaking or policy Implemen-tation. These are structured public learning processes achievedthrough face-to-face engagement in defining problem(s); generatingalternative ways to solve the problem(s); and selecting a solution thataddresses the interests, needs and values of the differentstakeholders.Common Roles. Collaborative dispute resolution efforts and publicpolicy education share a focus, on the role of convener, promoter of asound process and neutral process manager.Collaborative Dispute Resolution ProcessesDefinitionThe traditional use of litigation and administrative and electoralprocedures for dispute resolution has not always produced fair andwise solutions. Litigation can be time consuming and expensive. Di-rect participation, for the most part, is discouraged and communica-tions become distorted. Adversarial relationships make complianceand implementation.problematic. Although a winner is declared anda decision is rendered, the dispute may not be resolved and the los-ing interests may redirect their efforts to block decisions.Collaborative dispute resolution is a voluntary process that in-volves many interests in a facilitatedor mediatedface-to-face ne-gotiation. The impartial facilitator, often selected by the participants,assists in defining issues, exploring the parties' mutual interests andthose that divide them, generating and assessing options, and reach-1.694 Figure 1.

The agreements are reached by consen-sus, not by majority decision (Figure 1). These processes supplementconventional dispute resolution forums, and they are most often initi-ated when the normal decision-making process has proven ineffec-tive.

Growth management in Florida is alegislatively-created system that regulates the amount, timing, loca-tion and character of development through comprehensive planningon the local, regional and state-level. It is a decision-making processthat seeks an acceptable equilibrium between development and en-vironmental conservation; between the demands for public servicesgenerated by growth and by the supply of revenues to pay for thosedemands; and between progress and equity. Reaching and main-taining this equilibrium is an inherently conflictual activity that callsfor new collaborative tools and approaches.A consensus has emerged within Florida's growth managementcommunity on the value and need for better approaches to resolvinggrowth-related conflicts. Mediation and facilitation have a specialrole to play in the implementation of comprehensive plans, in inter-governmental coordination, and in resolving environmental and so-cial problems brought on by rapid growth. In the past, the growthmanagement system directed such conflict to adversarial last-resortforums such as administrative appeals, the courts or the legislatureto declare winners and losers. In contrast, the CRC is dedicated tohelping parties focus on reconciling their interests through jointproblem solving negotiations, often assisted by a mediator or facili-tator.Program Orientation. The CRC serves as a catalyst for helpingbuild a better system for meeting the growing demand for collab-orative services with an adequate supply of highly qualified andcompetent mediators and facilitators. In light of lessons from othercontexts, the CRC does not see the development of a public sectormediator corps as the long-term solution to handling increased use ofcollaborative approaches. However, in the future, many profes-sionals within the public sector will be called upon to assist in design-ing and facilitating collaborative group processes. Both strengthen-ing the market for mediator/facilitator services and developinggreater internal collaborative skills and resources are critical to theultimate success of this experiment. During the first five years, theCRC bps focused on demonstrating collaborative dispute resolutionapproaches. This has led to greater use and institutionalization of 96102 these processes. Over the next five years the CRC will focus on thesupply side by improving the quality of mediation services, continu-ing to demonstrate consensus policy development and helping de-sign appropriate systems for handling recurring disputes.Casework. Through its involvement in growth management con-flicts, the CRC seeks to demonstrate better ways for Floridians tobuild consensus on growth management issues, solve problems andresolve conflict. Its goals include: resolving or promoting the resolu-tion of growth management disputes through collaborative disputeresolution methods; designing and promoting implementation of col-laborative dispute resolution in recurring conflicts; and promotingconsensus-based policy development, including legislation, agencyrules and local planning and regulation. The CRC manages a refer-ral listing of mediators and facilitators.Education and Training. The CRC's education efforts seek to fun-damentally change the perception of growth management as an in-herently combative and adversarial process to one that seeks tosolve problems and equitably balance compelling claims through col-laborative dispute resolution processes. Its goals include: informingdecision makers about the nature, value and appropriate use of col-laborative dispute resolution; training professionals r,presentingpublic and private interests in growth management conflicts in theskills necessary to effectively participate in collaborative dispute res-olution; enhancing the practice standards of professional mediators,facilitators and agency staff serving as neutral intervenors throughtraining.Examples of Applications. Within Florida's growth managementcontext, CRC has assisted in several ways. As an institutionalbroker, the CRC is a university-based service center promoting theuse of collaborative approaches to solving problems. In its service,education and research/role, it is involved with research and curric-ulum efforts in urban planning, public administration, law and com-munications. CRC has facilitated: large group consensus building onpolicy (ELMS III); community problem-solving and collaborativeplanning, by convening a dialogue on balancing economic develop-ment with conservation (South Walton County); and mediation ofplanning and environmental disputes.Collaborative Dispute Resolution OpportunitiesCollaborative dispute resolution processes can be used in exten-sion programs, or other direct service, to facilitate visioning proc-esses for local communities or problem solving on policy problems.In the area of research, these processes can facilitate visioning proc-esses for local communities or problem solving on policy problems.In the area of research, these processes can facilitate research eval-uation and documentation, teaching and student involvement in ac- 97103 tive learning. The President's Commission on Sustainable Develop-ment also presents new opportunities in helping build a sustainabledevelopment dialogue.Collaborative Dispute Resolution ResourcesNational Institute for Dispute Resolution (NIDR), L Street,N.W., Washington, DC 20036 (202)466-4764. Contact: Thomas Fee.This private, nonprofit institute is the only grantmaker in the UnitedStates devoted exclusively to conflict resolution. It offers grants,technical assistance and information in several program areas, in-cluding public policy, the courts, higher and professional education,community justice and innovation. NIDR's higher education pro-gram has produced a large inventory of teaching materials. Pre-pared for use in law schools and graduate schools of business, plan-ning, public administration and public policy, some modules aregeneric and may be modified for use in other disciplines. NIDR alsoprovides support for public policy dispute resolution, having helpedcreate state dispute resolution programs in sixteen states.National Council of State Dispute Resnlution Offices. Created inJune, 1992, at a NIDR-sponsored leadership summit in Columbus,Ohio, this council serves as a forum for information exchange andtechnical support among the staffs of state offices of dispute resolu-tion that promote and provide dispute resolution services withinstate government. Although not all of the offices are located withinstate agencies, each has established a clear relationship with at leastone branch of state government. The relationship between stategovernments and the offices distinguishes them from other privateor nonprofit dispute resolution providers. The link between disputeresolution and public policy can be very beneficial. The offices are aproven, effective way of institutionalizing this link.University Centers.

This league also has been a leader inpromoting collaborative efforts at the local level.ConclusionIn conclusion, consensus-building approaches are not replace-ments for the traditional methods of resolving disputes. They are10 498 creative supplements that engage the affected interests within acommunity in a legitimate public policy debate. These are not win-ner-take-all situations, but consensus-based negotiations in whichthe agreements must satisfy all participants' interests. These ap-proaches have the potential for broadening the options available tothose seeking an acceptable balance between conflicting goals.When dispute resolution Is appropriately used it can be a very ef-fective tool for addressing tough problems and crafting policy. Al-though dispute resolution is by no means a panacea, these tech-niques can result in significant savings in time, expense and rela-tionships. Even when dispute resolution is used and full agreementis not reached, the issues demanding resolution are usually moreclearly understood and outlined and the relationship between theparties has usually improved, thus easing resolution through an-other, more traditional channel..

GarberNorth- Carolina State UniversityPotential Extension Roles in Dispute ResolutionMany roles can be played by the extension educator in public pol-icy education and alternative dispute resolution (ADR). The rolechosen will depend on many factors, including the particular issuebeing addressed, timing of the educational program with respect toevolution of the issue, the degree to which positions have hardenedamong target audiences, the skills/interests of the educator, and thelevel of support from extension administration.Policy Education RolesWe identify five policy education roles. These are grouped by\"content\" and \"process\" because both are normally needed for suc-cessful public policy education programs. Content roles include: In-formation Provider (offers facts or concepts that are authoritative, orrelates his or her own experience as input into the decision-makingprocess); and Technical Advisor (helps stakeholders sift through thefacts and interpret them in different contexts).Process roles include: Convener (someone who takes the initiativein bringing people together to deal with an issue. Once the partieshave been brought together it is possible for the convener to assumeanother role); Facilitator (a person or team selected by participantsto help format the meetings, set the ground rules for discussion andfocus participant attention on the process); and Program Developer(helps develop a long-range plan for the educational program and aset of short-run actions to implement the.plan. This role might con-tain both content and process dimensions, content in that it concerns\"what\" is contained in the program, and process in that it is con-cerned with \"how\" it is carried out).Traditional Alternatives-and-Consequences ApproachThe alternatives-and-consequences approach typically involvesthree main steps: clarification of the problem or issue, development 10 6100 of policy alternatives, and identification of the consequences of eachalternative. After proceeding through these steps it is assumed an in-formed citizenry will make good policy choices.However, our experience has shown that, regardless of the publicpolicy role being played, groups still may not be able to make andimplement policy choices once the public policy education, alter-natives-consequences process has been completed and extensionhas become less involved. The policy process may stop or be side-tracked, stakeholders may become frustrated, policies and plans arenot implemented, and issues are not resolved. In addition, the in- creased importance of issues programming and the increasedpriority given to measurement of results have increased pressure totake a \"resolution-of-the-issue\" approach toward public policy edu-cation. Bingham (p.6) suggests that the adequacy test of consensusbuilding and joint problem solving often is how agreements arereached and whether they are adequately supported through theimplementation process.Dispute k, esolution in the Public ArenaIn the public arena, dispute resolution involves resolution of publicissues through citizen-participation processes, interest-based nego-tiation and consensus building. (Notice the emphasis is on process,not content; furthermore, interest-based negotiation and consensusbuilding focus on decision making or policy choice. We choose tolabel these processes, along with group facilitation, as issue facilita-tion.) Thus, facilitation skills that have evolved out of \"small group\"facilitation typically taught in traditional leadership developmentprograms need to be supplemented by collaborative process/dispute resolution skills as well as citizen-participation processes that aremore appropriate for the more complex social setting in which issuefacilitation takes place.Let us be clear what we mean by the three processes:1. Citizen-participation processesare intentionally-planned proc-esses designed to bring citizens together with representatives ofpublic and private organizations to make public choices. To besuccessful, the process design must be explainable and agreedupon by all parties.2. Interest-based negotiationemphasizes the own/other parties \"interests,\" rather than \"positions\" or \"proposedsolutions.\" This focus on interests and avoidance of positionsallows the invention of new alternatives that satisfy mutual in-terests. These may be non-policy alternatives.3. Consensus buildingis a method for making decisions that allmembers of the group can support. The method encourages themutual education of parties, the creation of joint knowledge,101 107 the generation of multiple options and the selection of an optionthat satisfies mutual interests; it is a process for resolving con-flicts, not just surviving or managing them (Institute for ConflictAnalysis and Resolution, p.2).Expansion of Public Policy Education RolesThe traditional public policy education paradigm can be effective-ly modified through adoption of these alternative dispute-resolutionprocesses and principles to focus more effectively on the resolutionof public issues. In doing this, the public policy educator continues towork with interested parties in an agreed-upon process role. How-ever, they work during and beyond the policy choice phase, not justthrough the identification of the alternatives and consequences.First, the Facilitator role would be expanded from emphasis onsmall group facilitation to issue facilitation. Issue facilitation shouldcontinue to be viewed as an educational contribution, because it in-volves learning an alternative resolution process (as opposed to liti-gation or arbitration) and the mutual education of involved parties.Second, two new alternative dispute resolution (ADR) roles wouldbe added: Promoter of Dispute Resolution (one who suggests theparties consider facilitated collaboration. He or she should also beprepared to recommend competent facilitators); and Mediator (onewho w )rks with the disputing parties individually or collectively toincrease their skills in collaborative problem solving; or one who as-sumes middle position intervening, interposing, reconciling differ-ences, thereby bringing about consensus and settlement).Content roles identified for policy education, that is, informationprovider and technical advisor, remain appropriate. Thus, we sug-gest an extension of traditional public policy education roles ratherthan replacement. Dispute resolution techniques are essential if theissue is so controversial that education is impossible. However, wedo not visualize the dispute resolution and mediation roles identifiedhere as only being useful in cases in which the alternatives-and-con-sequences \"teachable moment\" has been lost. Most notably, issuefacilitation techniques should be useful at all stages of the educa-tional process, as v ould the content roles and the other process rolesthat remain unchai ,ged under an ADR approach.Examples of ADR Related Extension ProgramsThe following list of activities and projects on facilitation and dis-pute resolution are examples of the various ways extension person-nel have already incorporated ADR concepts and techniques intotheir public issues and public policy education programs.Facilitation Programs1.

This project focused on getting technical forestry information into public policy discussions, getting more people involved in forestry issues, developingmore effective methods for helpingpeople understand the issues, and providing more research- based information in policy debates. Goals included settlement of natural resources issues through policy development, dispute resolution and citizen action alternatives. Process skills used came from Module 6 of Working with Our Publics and involvedthe alternatives-and-consequences approach; discussions of facts, myths and values; models of decision making; and related concepts.3. University of California Extension. Leigh Johnson and Valerie Me llano. San Diego Bay wetlands and water quality project. Ef- forts combined techniques from three approaches to resolving public policy issues: public policy education (California's \"Lad- der for Policy\") whereby alternative policies and their conse- quences were identified; National Issues Forum procedureswhereby well-researched background information was devel- oped to educate participants on issues and policies; and facilita-tion and mediation techniques through which it was possible to help citizen groups work together to develop enduring agree- ment on issues and policies.4. University of Nevada Extension. Mike Havercamp and Dave To- rell. Have participated in a wide variety of activities as mediators and facilitators in both dispute resolution and consensus-building processes. Training programs, fact sheets and other materials on mediation, facilitation, shared visioning and alternative dispute resolution have been prepared. A \"Natural Resource Issues Conflict Management and Mediation Team\" has been formed jointly between California and Nevada to address public land issues. Activities include involvement in a mule deer/cattle graz- ing controversy near Susanville, California; the Tahoe Basin Watershed Planning project; \"conflict avoidance\" efforts in an elk introduction project; and training in Ely, Nevada, on conflict resolution and coordinatedresource planning. Projects to followwill involve the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, Nevada Department of Wildlife, a rancher and several public constituencies.5.

Several ex-amples of ADR applications as part of on-going projects. In con-flict management, examples include dealing with livestockgrazers and public land managers on issues related to watershedprotection and access to petroglyphs; and dealing with publicland managers, recreation, wildlife, livestock, rural communitiesand Native American interests on public land and associated pri-vate lands. Mediation examples include dealing with agriculturaland wildlife interests to reduce \"mutual animosity\"; and devel-oping a rangeland monitoring system (related to data. collection)for the Forest Service that has reduced the number of conflictswith livestock interests.Lessons Learned/Educational Needs of Extension EducatorTo support agents and specialists interested in expanding theirrole(s) to include ADR concepts and activities, new training needs tobe offered. Among other things, this training needs to include issuefacilitation and mediation skills. Skill training should include exten-sive role-playing practice in a risk-free setting and involve variousscenarios. Also, a summary of ADR resources available for exten-sion's use should be developed. Because ADR has been developingfor twenty years, materials, case studies, resources centers, person-nel and experience are extensive. We should not reinvent the wheel.There is a need for increased support from extension administra-tion because of the additional risks taken by educators becoming in-volved in ADR of controversial issues. This support may be coming.Conflict resolution is one of four competencies proposed by the Ex-tension Committee on Organization and Policy (ECOP) Personneland Organizational Development Committee, along with strategicplanning and management; coalition and group system building, andresponding to and facilitating change.Successful role performance will require that the extension edu-cator be seen as having no professional interest or affiliation thatwould interfere with his or her responsibility for helping the partiessatisfactorily resolve the issue. Perceived individual bias by any of the parties, whether or not it is warranted, will negate effective roleperformance of the extension educator.It is our belief that public policy educators should evaluate wheth-er or not incorporation of dispute resolution concept s and techniqueswould improve their programs. According to O.E. Smith, director ofthe Oregon State University Extension Service, the importance ofdeveloping dispute resolution skills and competencies cannot beoveremphasized: \"Extension's survival may very well depend upon our ability to acquire, utilize, and help others use these skills. Thepolitical and social environment in which we must live and operate 106112 will no longer permit the protective blanket of \"non-biased\" educa-tion. The extension policy of non-involvement, of simply presentingthe technical facts, will not suffice\" (Smith, p. 10).We have identified several examples from throughout the nationthat demonstrate how dispute resolution can be incorporated intoextension programs. Fact sheets, training handbooks, videos andother materials are becoming available. It is up to us to adapt themto our own use. REFERENCESBingham. Gail.

JO. 113107 FRAMING PUBLIC ISSUESAND WORKING WITH THE MEDIAJo Ann Myer ValentiBrigham Young UniversityMass media frames influence audience perception, discuss:on andattitudes of acceptance or rejection of an idea; framit:g often deter-mines the likelihood of an audience to act on the issue presented.What an audience brings to a media experience or messageaudi-ence schemascontributes to their news interpretation, but framingmay provide media with their most powerful effects, and some re-searchers suggest this is especially true for newly emerging issues(see Hornig, for example).Traditional arguments about media impact have media eitherweighing in with very powerful effects,limited effects or those heftyenough only to maintain the status quo. Oftentimes, maintenance ofstatus quo delivers a resounding punch as mass communicationscholars Sandman, Sachsman and Rubin warned us some time ago.This paper summarizes the main points of a presentation about theimportance of modern media framing and how those who deal withrural and farm issues might improve media attention to those issues.It also attempts to condense the results of what was actually a work-shop or working dialogue between those in the audience at the 1993National Public Policy Education Conference in Clearwater Beach,Florida, and a panel of journalists. For more than two hours duringan afternoon session, media experts and national sources of informa-tion about rural and farm news discussed news values, the media'sfarm news agenda, media process and gatekeeper styles.News ValuesEarlier in the conference, a futurist demonstrated one of media'smost important roles when he used a series of newspaper headlinesto talk about the past, report current conditions and predict the fu-ture. Although there is no small amount of discomfort when thosewho understand media process see an \"expert\" reporting history viaUSA Today headlines, it is true that one of media's primary contribu-tions is to record history. Other media roles are to inform, to surveythe environment (either as \"watch dog\" or \"lap dog\"), to entertain,to educate and to make a profit. None are surprised that the last isthe most important. Given these standard roles, the following list ofwhat makes an issue or event newsworthy seems reasonable. News114108 should be: new information, unusual, interesting, timely, surprising.It should also be about change, impact, conflict or human interest.However, the most significant factor in newsworthiness is proximity.Where your news occurred in relation to the newspaper or news sta-tion or their market area and the localness or obvious immediateaudience-involvement elements of a story are critical in getting cov-erage. Localization alone is not the primary concern, but proximityof the story to the reporter's beat also plays a role in whether yournews is covered.Coverage of some farm or rural issues may decline if informationis framed as science or environmental news. Recent studies con-ducted by Scientists Institute for Public Information (SIPI) and a1993 Harris poll found a drop in newspaper science sections fromninety-six in 1990 to forty-seven in 1992. However, those same stud-ies found that reader interest in science has not similarly declined. A1993 SIPI survey found four in ten American adults actively consum-ing science news, while 56 percent of the sampled public reportedwatching programs about science, nature and technology. Some 34percent say they are involved with science news on a daily basis. In-deed, 75 percent of the respondents said science news is as impor-tant as education news and more than 60. percent felt science news isas important as crime, financial, political or entertainment news.The SIPI/Harris survey also found important gender differences inhow the public responds to science stories. Women are more inter-ested in news articles dealing with children's health or health care ingeneral, while men's interest peaks more with energy or tech-nological breakthrough stories.Clearly, there is audience interest in landfill and incineration newsstories, the impact of global climate change on farming and foodsupplies, and the emergence of new foods through genetic engineer-ing. Rural America's issues easily meet news value criteria. How-ever, we face the task of pointing out to some news editors the im-portance and profitability of reporting our news if the issues areseen as science stories. There is more comfort in the findings thatgovernment continues to be media's preferred information source.The News AgendaIn spite of the public's continuing lack of confidence in local, stateand federal governmentthey typically report greater trust andassess higher knowledgeability for doctors or nonprofit environmen-tal or consumer groupsthe media look to government officials andgovernment press releases or reports for both story ideas and back-ground data. That may explain why, in repeated content analyses ofmedia reporting on science and environmental issues, we find halfare \"yardstick\" stories, telling us how much, how little, how often 109 115 and so on, and half are neither alarming nor reassuring, but provideneutral, explanatory information on a subject.Regardless of what issue has made it to the media agenda, we canbe assured of the following truisms about media's coverage: 1) Infor-mation will be accurate; 2) Any errors will mainly be sins of omis-sion; 3) Stories will be journalistically balanced; 4) \"Factoids\" of sci-ence or technological information will be presented without muchcontext; 5) The focus will be on issues immediately relevant to thepublic; 6) The news will not be sensationalized; 7) The informationwill be accessible to most readers (or viewers/listeners); and 8) Ifthere are weaknesses in the reporting, there is plenty of blame to beshared equally between the journalists and the sources of their infor-mation, generally, a government source (see Lewenstein for thesource of this modified list and other research on science and themedia).While this may suggest a meaningful news agenda, a healthy doseof reality in terms of the media's perception of public interests canbe found in Table 1, a compilation of issues covered by televisiontalk shows in a randomly selected week. We should be remindedthat the audience for these twenty-some shOws is substantial in mostmarkets. On the other hand, not to give the television medium theappearance of terminal flakiness, Table 2 lists TV's prime time line-up, and we can see that five of the ten most watched shows are Table 1.

There is a place for rural andfarm issues on television's agenda.Media Process and FormatsKnowing how to present information in the most useful form isprobably as important as providing newsworthy items and crediblesourcing for stories. A news release is often no more than a wastedtree. It is no secret that most (some report as high as 80 percent) ofall press releases received in a day will end up unread, unopenedand certainly unused before they hit the recycle bin. Public relationseducators, at least the good ones, are teaching their students toknow when to send a news brief or advisory, and when to preparefull wire copy or a news report (see Valenti for when not to do avideo news release [VNRJ). Other formats often more appropriate toconsider in providing mediated messages are: fact sheets, features,op-ed commentary, letters to the editor, backgrounders or positionpapers. Sometimes an arranged meeting with an editorial staff mem-ber or columnist results in more effective future handling of yourissues than anything sent through the mail or faxed no matter howskillfully prepared.The key to successful media relations is knowing both the mediumand its individual style and knowing the specific individualtheright journalistfor your story. The \"reader friendly\" newspapersof the '90s are concerned with anchoring, providing a consistent easeof knowing what is where and offering newsbriefs; in-depth \"extra\"sections to provide more information to readers on a selected sub-ject; enhanced visual appeal, more color and tone; more effective or-ganization, usually beginning with mastheads; theme days, withTuesday or Thursday generally set as the science/health/medicineday; leisure, magazine-style reading sections; and much more storytelling rather than the old and tired inverted pyramid. Of course, theabove is all true of the better newspapers. You may not always dealwith the leaders in the industry, so do not forfeit all of your standardinverted pyramid releases just yet. The message is to know what isbest, what is preferred and what is most effective for getting yournews into your targeted medium.Gatekeepers Are People TooWhile it is still true the average journalist is an under 40, Anglo,white male with a college degree, the characteristics of U.S. newsprofessionals are beginning to change. The percentage of womenand minorities working in the media is increasingslowlyand thedifferent perspectives they bring to news may shift more, if not a dif-ferent, attention to rural and farm issues. Recall the earlier reportedgender differences in science and environmental issues.117 But, for the purposes of this session, the panel reflected some ofthe best current representatives from environmental journalism andscience writing. Panelists Booth Gunter, environmental beat spe-cialist for The Tampa Tribune, and Michael Nyenhuis, science writerfor The Florida Times-Union, have between them many years ofaward-winning reporting. Samples of their work, particularly recentarticles on natural pesticide developments and the Ben late contro-versy, and land and farming issues in Florida's Everglades, cic,.mon-strate the journalistic principles we would like to see more often. Butit is important to note that even these two same-state-based, similar-ly good reporters are individuals and bring style and format prefer-ences to their relationships with sources of information.These proceedings allow only a brief synopsis of the question andanswer period that dominated this session. Some of the highlightsfollow. Q:Q&A with Media PanelistsHow do I find the right media person to tell me how to framean urgent rural housing need? We have homelessness in ruralareas too.A: Homelessness is. already on the agenda. It is a great issuehuman elementfor getting media's attention. Key points areproximity and what reporter has been covering this issue.Some have a \"conspiracy theory\" about newsrooms and thinkwe all know what the other is doing or that we are a bunch ofpuppets only doing assigned stories. Truth is we come up withmost of our own story ideas (both panelists agreed that 70 per-cent of their story ideas came from personal initiative or inter-est).Your job is to know who at the paper would be interested inthis story. One resource and a way to start is professional asso-ciation membership directories; the Society of EnvironmentalJournalists (SEJ) has a reputable membership. Call reporterswith your idea and as a way to get to know them.Frankly, the rural homeless sounds like an easy televisionpiece, lots of visual opportunities. Start with a fact sheet andkeep going on to the next person until you find the reporterwho sees this as a good story. Keep coming hack. Rebuild yourfact sheet with new information at every opportunity.Q: What counts in journalism? What are you after other thanawards?A: Placement. We want our work on the front page. Recognitionfrom our peers comes from work well done. The ultimate is a 112 Pulitzer, but we also want to make a difference. We feel ourpower as journalists is to right wrongs. We want to feel we arecontributing to solutions to society's problems. Fairness andaccuracy is what the reporter takes home. Ultimately, our sto-ries have to be about people.Q: What is the process for determining whether a story is givenin-depth coverage or treated as just a caption?A: Lots of different staff may be involved in one news item. Thereporter writes the story and someone else (copywriter) writesthe cutlines for photos and the headlines. When you see a badheadline, you can bet the reporter is just as upset as you are.The problem is that many headline writers are young and in-experienced. Headline writing is an art, a real skill. What youare talking about is an industry process problem. It is like theold inverted pyramid. That form does not allow us to get thereaders' attention and build some interest in reading the storyin the first place. Telling a story is a softer approach and allowsus to grab the audience, but remember, the reporter is thestory teller and the more skilled writer. It is another good rea-son to forget releases and just send straight information or tellus the basics. We will write the story. If we need more back-ground or information, then provide the standard news releasestuff.The Washington Post's media critic says each edition of a paper'should have at least one item for the reader to chew on, some-thing like an in-depth feature. That is where extension storiescould easily fit. That is a whole lot different from USA Today'sshrink-every-story style. So it depends on which medium youare after.Remember that there are major differences between printmedia and radio or television. TV is not in trouble for gainingaudiences. Newspapers are holding steady, bu#. not gainingnew readers, so the effort is focused on attracting new, young-er readers. Radio provides you with a youthful audience, tele-vision reaches the masses, and newspapers today are still get-ting you to policyrnakers and opinion leaders. One day wehope a younger audience will access newspapers through theirPCs.Q:Communications people at universities seem t, believe we arein trouble if we give the edge to one reporter over another.What is the b. st way to \"sell\" a ..tory idea?A: The Universiti of Florida (UF) is a good example of what notto do. They send out dozens of eight inch stories directly overthe AP wire on a regular basis. That is no good if they want ashot at a longer in-depth piece. We are not going to report on a 113119 Q:story that another desk has already run as a news brief and,frankly, one panelist stopped even opening the packages of re-leases that arrive from UF. They are old by the time he getsthem and he is not going to waste time reading them. On theother hand, the special publications, like magazines, sent fromuniversities or industry provide story ideas and are generallymore useful. If you really have a good story, call or fax a newsadvisory to a reporter in advance of some massive release.Most news operations receive PR Wire or similar services.(Both reporters noted the uselessness of most press con-ferences, especially if travel of any distance is required).Again, the key is to establish and build a relationship with thereporters you want to cover your issue(s).What do you prefer from us as sources, neutral information orshould we be taking advocacy positions on policy education?A: First, keep in mind that television has less than thirty secondsto tell the whole story and print has limited rcom to quote you.It is difficult to deal with neutral information from an educator,a non-advocate. We need your neutrality in backgrounding.Not pitching the story, but educating us about what the storyis. You are more useful in providing us with the \"why\" of thestory. Then, we look for balancing in presenting points ofview.Q: How can we do better soundbites?A: Reframe the question and give the answer you feel is mostimportant to the audience's understanding of the issue.What should we do when reporters make a real mistake, a se-rious error in print?A: Reporters will generally stand by their notes, and their editorsare expected to back them up. If there has been a genuinemisunderstanding or failure to hear accurately what was said,then your best move is to call that reporter and politely try tocorrect the misinformationremember, you are building a re-lationship. And you can always write a letter to the editor of-fering praise for a story well done when it is appropriate, andsuggesting corrections in a report that missed something ormisreported something. Letters in print are much strongerthan retractions and, if well written, you have not severed aneeded relationship by forcing the issue and causing a row.You need the reporter to be informed; let us assume your issueis not going away tomorrow.Q: REFERENCESHornig.

EXTENSION INVOLVEMENTFielding Cooley, Andy Duncan and Judy BurridgeOregon State UniversitySome educators pay close attention to planning the coalition-build-ing process; others eschew process planning and operate by the seatof their pants. In either case educators can profit from using 'a vari-ety of styles when participating in learning and problem solvingcoalitions. Fielding Cooley's section of this presentation outlines acoalition-building process and corresponding roles. Andy Duncandeals with some issues of practical application in the field and, final-ly, Judy Burridge relates roles and practice to issue education styles.THE COALITION-BUILDING PROCESSFielding CooleyIn building coalitions, it is helpful to know the events likely tooccur or those that might be needed to increase the chances of suc-cess. The goal here is to describe coalition building as a flexible, iter-ative process rather than a linear sequence of events.According to Webster's New World Dictionary, a coalition is an al-liance of factions for a specific purpose. There are different kinds ofcoalitions; some are made up of members who agree to band to-gether to gain advantages over others, i.e., political parties, lobbyingassociations, nations and businesses. I am concerned, rather, withcoalitions made up of members who have little or no initial agree-ment on values, goals or strategies. They usually form around theneed to solve community or regional problems through consensusand group learning. An example is the Oregon Watershed Improve-ment Coalition (OWIC). Sometimes, as in the case of OWIC, they justseem to happen with limited strategic planning. In other cases, suchas the Lane County (Oregon) Child Abuse Forum in which I acted asa process consultant and facilitator, leaders and organizers attemptto map out a coalition-building process.The process can have nine stages that do not always occur in thesame order. Experience indicates some of the stages may even occursimultaneously. Putting the stages into three phases helps us conceptu-alize the iterative cyclical nature of the coalition-building process.122116 The Coalition-Building ProcessPhase 1EmergenceIssues and concerns have heated up, risen to the sur-face, and factions with a stake in the issues (stakeholders) have beencalled to an initial meeting by a convener. There is enough readinessto work together to warrant further activity.Stages:1. The Issues Domain or Community Situation The context inwhich the issues \"live,\" hence, the place where coalition solu-tions are tested and recycled. A place to begin, end, or renew.2. The Emergence of Issues Issues and stakeholders are recog-nized in the public arena.3. Readiness to Collaborate Readiness of certain factional rep-resentatives to work together around an issue(s) is determinedby gathering data prior to forming the coalition or through ob-servation during initial contacts and meetings.4. Emergence of Conveners and Stakeholders (members) One or more people who believe that certain stakeholders couldform a coalition take the initiative and call the first meetings.Representatives of factions agree to continue meeting andmembers are accepted.Phase 2StabilizationCoalition members understand each other's values,interests, goals and preferences. Norms, procedures and rules foroperating are established and form the basis for future work.Stages:5. Recognizing Values, Interests and Directions Open discus-sion of members' values and interests and their preferences re-garding the issues at stake. Establishing overarching goals thathelp focus collaborative efforts.6. Getting Operational Agreements Development of group agree- ments on norms, procedures and rules for how the coalitionworks.Phase 3ActivationWherein work on the issue, i.e., learning, problem-solving, action-planning, implementation, evaluation and sometimesrenewal and redirection, is accomplished.Stages:7. Gathering InformationData on issues is collected and present-ed by and to the group as a part of the learning and problem-solving process. 117123 8. Establishing Common Ground and Agreement on Issues Find-ing the decisions, solutions and actions on which the coalition canact.9. ImplementationWherein solutions and plans are activated andevaluated.The roles one might play during the emergence phase include edu-cator, technical specialist, leader, organizer, secretary, participant,spokesperson and convener. Skills to be played include networking,meetings management, facilitation and assessment.In the Stabilization Phase, when an educator leads a discussion, con-flict often surfaces around disagreement on values, goals and proc-esses or how to operate as a group Therefore, the conflict manage-ment role is needed. Conflict management calls into play the skills ofproblem solving, mediating, negotiating and facilitation. The leaderrole may again be required to help set the proper direction.The activation phase requires skills in problem solving, decisionmaking, action planning and evaluating. Doing those things againbrings into play the roles of conflict manager, leader and organizer.Implementation of decisions in particular requires leaders, organizersand spokespeople. Skills are needed in maneuvering through the pol-itics of the public policy arena and in mediating the development of\"win-win\" solutions. Gathering and providing information brings theeducator and technical specialist roles into play. Other roles includesecretary and spokesperson.The coalition-building cases with which I am familiar involved mem-bers constantly collecting data. Information is not always gathered inthe classical research sense but often directly from observation in thefield and through members' network of associates and access to institu-tional data banks.In case histories of coalitions, it is common to find coalition-buildingstages occurring in different sequences. The skills and roles identifiedin this paper can pop up almost anywhere in the coalition-buildingprocess. Even in coalition-building cases in which little advance plan-ning is done, knowing how roles and skills might relate to and affectthat process should increase the likelihood of developing successfulcoalitions.AN OLD WARNINGAndy DuncanThe Extension Service: Process is our most important product.Even if you have not spent much time around a land grant univer-sity you have probably heard that joke or one like it, though it mayhave been aimed at some other organization or an individual. Thereis constant grumbling about groups and people who would rather124 118 \"talk than do,\" who are more interested in the \"how to\" than thehoped-for result.What does this have to do with the ranchers, environmental advo-cates, loggers and, especially, the extension professionals in thevideo you just watched about the Oregon Watershed ImprovementCoalition (OWIC), and what does it have to do with Fielding's analy-sis of the coalition-building process and roles for extension in thatprocess?I believe \"process backlash\" represents a significant danger toproponents of extension involvement in coalitions that promotelearning and problem solving. But, before I elaborate, let me explainthat I have not done studies of coalitions. I am a professional com-municator, a listener and an observer, as anyone in my field mustbe.I am here today for two reasons. First, because I got \"up close andpersonal\" with OWIC members while co-producing the video aboutthe coalition. For almost a year, I immersed myself in the historyand inter workings of this coalition, which happens to be the typethat allows people who are usually at odds to educate one another.Second, I am here because for three years or so I have been a mem-ber of the leadership team of the Oregon State University ExtensionService's Public Issues Education Initiative. In that capacity I havebeen, in a sense, working between public policy education spe-cialists like many of you and county extension agents and area spe-cialists. Let me be honest. That is an ugly place, at times.I imagine many of you are experts on group processes. I do notknow about your states, but in Oregon I have seen county extensionagents cringe when you use the word \"process.\" I shudder to thinkwhat the reaction of those agents might be if, with no tip-toeing intothe topic, Fielding started delivering his presentation about howcoalition building is a \"flexible iterative process rather than a linearsequence of events,\" arid about the roles these agents could play invarious phases and simultaneous stages.Academics want data. I do not have any. But my guess is that themajority of county agents are quite familiar with the importance oftackling assignments in a systematic way, of using a sound process.What they also are familiar with, I suspect, is that a significantnumber of potential coalition members have little tolerance for \"thegovernment\" leading them, or even being involved with them, inanything.Now, I realize lots of extension specialists and agents appreciatehow important the process is in building a coalition. They probablygrumble about others who \"shoot from the hip,\" hitting the wrongtargets (perhaps wounding innocent bystanders and inciting riotousgroup behavior). But, frankly, my impression is that public policyspecialists do a much better job of communicathig with the \"process-125119 is-important folks\" than with the \"just-do-it crowd.\" In fact, I thinkpublic policy specialists have a serious communication problem withthe \"just-do-it\" types. Let me use a couple of examples to illustrate:Last spring, at an Oregon workshop intended to improve exten-sion professionals' skills in areas linked to public issues educationwork, I heard a county agent remark about coalition building that\"there is a real danger in a process or system. People may feel it ismanipulative, like leading sheep.\" Later I heard this same agent ex-plaining, in a pretty animated way, how a natural resource issuesconsensus group he was involved with quickly went from \"confron-tation to visioning\" and spent a long time on that so members of thegroup could vent their energies on how the land \"could be andshould be,\" rather than on how they disagreed with one another.This agent still claimed to have no use for \"process people\"after he had become involved as a subject matter specialist in acoalition-building process he apparently felt was constructive. Whythe paradox? I will not attempt to identify all the possible sociologicaland psychological factors. I will tell you what it seemed like. Itseemed like his intense interest in the issues the coalition was ad-dressing just plain overpowered his fears about negative reactionsfrom people who might feel manipulated by a process (I suspect thisperson's actions offer a clue about what to emphasize in order tocommunicate effectively with people leery of process).Recently, while philosophizing about how to build coalitions, an-other critic of \"process people\" told me he believes \"they use thosebig words so you'll think you need them. That is part of the stinkingproblem.\" How about some emphasis, he added, on common sense?How about emphasizing the importance of truly caring about theissues you are trying to deal with, so that comes across to the clients?How about more emphasis on the importance of real expertise insubject matter closely related to the coalition's field of interest?Wild rambling? I do not know. You can find support for a range ofviewpoints. For example, these last comments do not seem incom-patible with Lesson #8 in the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's ClusterEvaluation Final Report on Innovative Public Policy Education Proj-ects (Greene, Hahn and Waterman, pp. 25-26):Public policy education can be effective in the absence of a for-mal coalition, but not in the absence of the spirit or broad in-tentions of a coalition, specifically, the commitment to mean-ingfully incorporating diversity by offering policy alternatives that reflect different points of view and, at root, different valuesin the form and function of the program offered.In that same evaluation, a coalition member said, simply: \"Coali-tions should be bound by a purpose and not by a structure (p. 26).... 120126 It may appear that I am \"with\" the process critics, arguing againstthe importance of Fielding's analysis of the coalition-building processand roles for extension within that process. I do not mean to. I thinkhis process model is valuable. I am simply issuing the warning thatthere are other ways of looking at coalition building that might bemore valuable to certain extension agents, specialists and others. Or,at least, there are approaches that might \"ease\" certain individualsinto studying a model like the one Fielding described.Bill Krueger, the extension specialist and department head whospearheaded the Oregon Watershed Improvement Coalition, told methis about his experience:When I got involved with OWIC I didn't know anything aboutsocial sciences or coalition building. I hadn't had any educationin the theory or practice of how you get people to do variousthings or what you should do to get people to do things. We justjumped into it and decided that what we needed to do was tostop the fights that were beginning about natural resourcesand to help people get the best information they could to makedecisions. That's really all it was.I do not believe Bill Krueger. I do not believe \"That's really all itwas.\". And I wish we had more down-to-earth information on thenuances of how he and practical-minded extension professionals likehim play roles in the building of coalitions. I think it would engageagents and specialists who find much of the literature of process too\"ivory tower.\" I suggest you involve more people like Bill Kruegerin your future meetings.Maybe what is needed are more diaries, not journal articles?ISSUE EDUCATION STYLESJudith A. Burridge\"Issues don't polarize, stuckness.does.\" What educators and facili-tators need to do is to be able to adventure or operate in an ad hocmanner when people get stuck (Friedman). Issue educational styleshave br.ien discussed by the two preceding speakers. I would like toemphasize that the style or process used by an issue educator needsto fit the audience with whom s/he is dealing. You have listened toA ady Duncan who has described Bill Krueger's method of dealingw.th conflict. His process skills are covert in his style of delivery andhe takes pride in stating he wants nothing to do with \"that processstuff.\"Fielding, on the other hand, discussed a process of coalition build-ing and developed the study guide to go with the satellite programwe just viewed. Both emphasize the use of process skills in order to 1211 2 7 reach educational goals. Furthermore, others say if you know proc-ess, you don't need to be an expert in the subject being discussed.I would like to suggest that extension educators need to balancetheir use of process skills and educational expertise in order to haveoptimum outcomes in public policy education. While sitting in aFamily Community Leadership meeting with volunteers and staffmembers, a question was asked, \"Now, what process is occurringhere?\" Wayne Shull, the staff member who was the presenter, did aquick analysis of what process was taking place. My thought was,\"My, he's smooth, we weren't aware of the process techniquesbeing used.\" When process is obvious it may become annoying anddistract from the issue being discussed.Demands for extension education are changing. 0. E. Smith, di-rector of the Oklahoma State University Extension Service, uses thisdiagram (Figure 1) to illustrate current expectations of extension ed-ucation. Early in the century, expectations for agricultural extensionprograms centered on production solutions and usually involved asingle discipline in the solution. During the boom years of the 1950sproblems became more complex and required expertise that crosseddisciplines. In agriculture, this was accomplished by marketing andmanagement education as well as education about production. Basicproduction, marketing and management education are needed for Figure 1.

Smith, Oregon State University Extension Service, 1989128122 today's complex agricultural oroblems, but the added dimension ofinformation, education and interpretation of public policies, emerg-ing issues and government regulation is also required. Today's prob-lems require that we reach beyond the university and extensionwalls and seek cooperation with other agencies (Smith).When looking at Smith's model, consider it from a different per-spective. Look at the curved lines describing the demands as pro-duction education, enabling education and public issues education,or, using the popular analogy, catching the fish for them, showingthem how to fish or letting them figure out how fishing is done.Extension faculty, if they are going to be successful, must analyzetheir style of teaching, and the learning styles of their audience.They must be able to adjust their facilitation and teaching styles to fitthe learning styles of their clientele. I suggest borrowing on Hersheyand Blanchard's leadership model (Hershey and Blanchard) to viewissues education from the styles of the teacher/facilitator and learn-er/participant (Figure 2). oA roFigure 2.

On thehorizontal axis is plotted process skills. Consideration should begiven to balancing the styles of both the facilitator and the partici-pants. When they are not synchro nized, either subject matter ex-pertise or process skills may become annoying. It is not as importantwhere you are on the quadrant as it is to balance your style withthose of the participants.There are many styles involved in how we pl.ocess information.Michael Quinn Patton talks about sending students to a county com-missioner's meeting to learn how the politicians process information.Do they use logic? Do they use storytelling? Do they like the dialecticmodel? they \"big picture\" or \"little picture\" people? His mes-sage: adapt your style of delivery to get what you want (Patton).R. J. Hildreth, retired director of the Farm Foundation, whenteaching FCL volunteers about public testimony, suggested balanc-ing the emotional (normative) and the logical (positive) as a processof presenting information to decision makers (Hildreth).Adaptability of facilitators' styles with that of participants is theway to of getting from stuckness to working together on solutions toissues and problems.

HahnCornell UniversityCoalition building is not an end in itself. It is a complicated andtime-consuming process that undoubtedly has some intrinsic value,but not enough to justify taking time and energy away from otherthings we could be doing. Coalition building has to be viewed as ameans to an end. Its value comes from what can be done in coali-tions that cannot be done by a single organization working alone.Public policy education has at least five requirements that makecoalition building worthwhile (Hahn, Greene and Waterman): 1) Itneeds to describe and explain multiple perspectives on the issuesunder consideration or create a forum in which each perspective isrepresented. 2) It needs to ensure balance or fairness in the treat-ment of each perspective. 3) It needs to include both technical infor-mation and process assistance. 4) It needs to reach multiple audi-ences, including citizens as well as policymakers and groups ondifferent sides of an issue. 5) It requires the ability to address issuesselected or defined by citizens or policymakers rather than by theeducators themselves. Each of these things can be done by a singleorganization, but they can often be done more easily or more effec-tively if two or more organizations join together.An educational coalition is a coalition that makes educational pro-grams with such characteristics possible. I cannot think of any easyrules about what the membership of such a coalition should be. Itshould have whatever membership is necessary in order to reflectmultiple perspectives, to give balanced attention to them, to providethe necessary content and process assistance, to reach multiple audi-ences, and to address the issues the way they need to be defined. Inour comparative evaluation of eleven Kellogg-funded projects, weconsidered recommending that a coalition for public policy educa-tion should include representatives of all points of view on the issuesbeing addressed, but we stopped short of that (Hahn, Greene andWaterman). What we did say is that there should be some real dif-ferences among the partners. Otherwise, why bother with a coali-tion? We also said there needs to be a substantial degree of parityamong the partnersat least to the point at which participants arefeeling pressure to seriously consider unwanted or uncomfortableadvice. Some of the coalition partners we interviewed said they 125131 valued the pressure to do things they knew they would not do if theywere not involved in a coalition with other organizations.Educational coalitions can be distinguished from political coalitions(a distinction suggested by participants in one of the Kellogg-fundedprojects), and there are two kinds of political coalitions. An advocacycoalition is a coalition of like-minded groupsgroups that find com-mon interests in a particular issue even if they disagree on every-thing elseand who join together for the purpose of enhancing theircollective ability to influence public decisions in their favor.(Sabatier uses the term \"advocacy coalition\" with similar meaning).By contrast, a consensus-seeking coalition is one that attempts to in-clude all the relevant perspectives on an issue for the purpose oflearning about one another and searching for possible commonground on which they can take public action or advocate public deci-sions. The expectation or hope is that such actions or decisions willhave a greater likelihood of approval and successful implementationbecause none of the relevant perspectives have been left out.Development of a consensus-seeking coalition could be a long-term goal or vision for a public policy education program. The di-alogue and mutual understanding that such coalitions aim for is anequally good goal for public policy education. If an educational coali-tion can be created with the all-encompassing membership of acoalition-seeking coalition, I think that would be great, and it shouldbe done. But insisting that no educational work should be done be-fore every viewpoint is represented in a coalition is an unreasonablydifficult standard to meet. Moreover, I do not believe everybody hasto be represented in order for an educator to have the ability tobring all points of view together. Bringing them together can be thegoal of an educational program without being the starting point.Advocacy coalitions, on the other hand, should be avoided by pub-lic policy educators. I suppose there is no inherent reason why acoalition of like-minded groups could not plan and implement an ed-ucational program that seeks a balanced understanding of all pointsof view. But I think it would be unlikely. Such a coalition, like asingle organization working alone, will find it difficult to address thefive characteristics of public policy education programs mentionedearlier. There will be strong pressure on educators to promote thecoalition's shared interests at the expense of a balanced treatment ofother points of view.Educators do, of course, experience pressure to join and supportadvocacy coalitions. When I presented some of these ideas in NewYork a few months ago, a horticulture agent said, \"That's exactlywhat the green industry in my county wants me to do.\" HP asked myadvice, and the best I could offer was, \"Try and help the green in-dustry understand that it is in their interests to have other perspec-tives included because stable solutions to the issues the green indus-132126 try cares about are not likely to happen unless all points of view areunderstood and taken into account.\" An educator who simply com-miserates with a client group about the stupidity of the opposition isnot doing anyone any favors.Another important point was raised at that same meeting. An agri-culture agent from another county said she was surprised no onehad talked about the down side of working in coalitions. She said, ifextension does everything in collaboration with other organizations,there is a danger funders will say extension is duplicating the workof other agencies and making no unique contribution. In her view,that is a dangerous image to have in times of scarcity when fundersare looking for excuses to cut budgets. That has been my nightmareas wellthat extension will be ready to become a leading public pol-icy education agency at just the time its funders decide to eliminatethe organization.The agent's comments underline the importance of finding betterand better ways to articulate a unique educational role regardingpublic issues. An extension association director told a story at thesame meeting about a water quality coalition in her county in whichextension was involved. At some point, the county legislature madea decision to formalize the coalition as a Water Quality ManagementAgency, and extension got left out. It had to fight its way back in anddid so by persuasively arguing that it had a unique public educationrole to contribute.Articulating that role, and living up to it, is the flip side of workingin coalitions and is equally important. Extension needs to collaboratein order to do a good jobespecially in public policy education be-cause of the characteristics mentioned earlierand to help others doa good job. But it also needs to have a role that it plays in coalitionsthat is complementary to others and widely regarded as unique andimportant. If my nightmare is defunding just when extension gets itspublic policy education act together, my dream is that extension willhave a widely held image as the agency that does educational pro-grams on important issues, addresses the public as well as private di-mensions of the issues, brings pertinent information to bear, andhelps everyone understand all sides of the issues. Its reputation fordoing those things will be the reason people participate in its pro-grams as well as the reason other organizations collaborate with it incoalitions. REFERENCESHahn. Alan J..

WaymackLoyola University ChicagoThe subject of health care reform is much in our minds these days.On the one hand, it is difficult to find anyone who admits to beingopposed to health care reform. On the other hand, I think we mayall easily foresee it is going to be extremely difficult to come up witha health care reform program that will satisfy everyone. So, if almosteveryone agrees it needs fixing, why is it so difficult for people toagree on what we should do to \"fix\" the health care system?I want to show that there are at least three different anglesthreedifferent perspectiveson health care and the \"ethic\" of healthcare. Each of these three perspectives has its own peculiar \"ethic\"and these ethics are all too often conflicting. Furthermore, not onlydo we find different people with different ethics approaching thisissue from these different perspectives, usuelly each of us feelspulled by more than one perspective. Thus, for any health care re-form program to really prove ethically satisfying and successful, itmust somehow bridge or go beyond these disparate perspectives.Let me begin by outlining the different ethics of each of the threeperspectives.Health L are as a Positive Moral RightAs a nation, we have come to regard health care as something of amoral right. That is, individuals have a right to health care, and if aperson has insufficient economic resources to pay for such care, weas a society have an obligation to see that poverty is not an obstacleto receiving health care.Behind this view is the assumption that health care is somehowmorally different than other goods and services in our society. Wefeel no moral obligation to purchase a Cadillac Seville for each andevery citizen. We even feel no moral obligation to purchase a usedcar for someone so he or she may drive it to and from work. Neitherdo we feel we must purchase a big screen television for each house-hold that cannot afford one out of its own economic resources. Buthealth care, somehow, is importantly, morally different.There are various kindsarguments used to support this posi-tion. One might argue, for example, that if one's health is compro-mised, then one is unable to participate in our society. One does not 131135 have the samt access to the goods and services, jobs and rewards,as healthy people. Thus, our commitment to moral egalitarianism, toequal opportunity, requires that we, as a society, ensure that eachand every citizen has access to health care. Indeed, equal oppor-tunity would appear to dictate not only that everyone have access tohealth care, but qualitatively equal health care.This moral commitment to the moral equality of individuals is al-ready present in our national system of organ distribution for trans-plantation. No one can use his or her wealth in this country to pur-chase an organ, thus excluding people of more meager resourcesfrom the chance for an organ transplant to save or improve theirlives. Rather, each and every one stands in a linetake a numberand wait. The only thing that is supposed to advance you faster inline is a severe crisis in your medical status such that if you do notreceive that organ soon you will die.A different kind of moral argument. for this position might be onederived from a view of human life as \"sacred,\" as being beyondprice in its worth. Since life is sacred in a way that automobiles arenot, we have a moral obligation to ensure that fiscal stinginess onour part does not result in the unnecessary loss of human life.I said earlier that we, \"as a nation,\" hold to this view. Evidencefor this claim can easily be found in the language behind the Medi-care and Medicaid acts of almost thirty years ago. The Medicare actexplicitly states that every older American should have access to the\"best\" medical care available without regard to his or her ability topay. A similar spirit is behind the Medicaid program--that we, as anation, have a moral obligation to ensure that extreme poverty notbe a barrier to access to quality health care.This moral view, that each individual has a positive moral right tothe highest quality health care, is an important assumption behindthe Clinton health care reform proposals. Notice three key reasonsthe Clinton team offers for the necessity for reform:1. First, there are currently some 37 million persons in Americawithout any health insurance. Furthermore, a like number ofAmericans are grossly under-insured.2. Second, even securely middle-class Ameri !ans are in greatdanger of losing their health care insurance. Since insurancecompanies are in business to make money, they are inclined toavoid subscribers who will make heavy use of medical services.Hence, health insurers are apt to find ways to limit benefits tocurrently enrolled members, and are extremely apt to deny en-rollment to applicants with existing medical conditions. Sincethe cost of medical care can be so ghastly high these days, with-out decent health insurance the average middle class family canquickly become impoverished by a single major illness, Indeed, 132136 the Clinton committee argues many l&mericans are scared awayfrom starting small businesses because they cannot afford thehigh premiums insurance companies may demand. As the Clin-ton health care reform committee argues, middle class Ameri-cans are afraid to switch jobs because of the prospect of losingtheir health insurance; and they are scared that through cata-strophic illness they may lose meaningful coverage even if theydo not lose their jobs.3. The Clinton committee is eager to assure Americans it will notration care. It holds we should be increasing access to care, notrestricting access. Hence, the Clinton reform proposal is ex-plicitly anti-rationing. It is not a reform program designed towithhold or ration services.What ties each of these three points together is the notion thatAmericans should not be vulnerable to loss of access to health care.Rather, access to health care should be guaranteed morally. Clearly,such reasons for health care reform only make sense if one is com-mitted to the position that each individual has a positive moral rightto health care.Not surprisingly, the American Medical Association (AMA) is infavor of health care reform. Physicians, at least at times in their pro-fessional historyand the late twentieth century has been one ofthose timeshave held that they have a moral obligation to promotethe medical welfare of their patients as individuals. Clearly, if a pa-tient cannot obtain medical services because of an inability to pay,then that patient's medical interests are not being best served.Hence, the AMA has come down squarely on the side of universalaccess. (Of course, one may be cynical and point out that physiciansare liable to have more income-producing business if there is gov-ernmentally paid universal access, but I leave that point for a fewminutes).Clearly, if we believe health is a positive moral right of each andevery individual, then the existing health care system (insofar as itcan even be called a \"system\") is a moral travesty. Each and everyday millions of Americans are denied access to basic, primary healthcare because they cannot afford it. Many of them get sicker andsicker until what had been a simply correctable, treatable problembecomes a life threatening nightmare.The way health care is now delivered (or not delivered) to individ-uals shows little or no respect for a positive moral right to healthcare. To meet this moral demand in a minimal sense will require ahealth program providing universal coverage. And in a strongersense of egalitarianism and the value of human life, a suitable healthcare reform proposal should provide not only for access to minimalhealth care, but rather for the highest quality health care available. 133137 Health Care and the Ethic of BusinessHealth care has never been a completely charitable endeavor.Through the ages, physicians have typically felt some professionalmoral obligation to provide some care to the indigent, but (at the pro-fessional level) it has usually been at the margins. After all, physi-cians, like most of us, have themselves and their families to financial-ly support.With regard to hospitals, the story is a bit more complex. Formuch of the history of medicine, the economically advantaged re-ceived their health care in the home. Physicians made house visitsand, when necessary, nurses or other care givers were available,either from family or from hiring. Hospitals, for the most part, werecharitable institutions designed to provide a place of care for thoseso destitute as to not have care available in the home. But as medicalscience and technology developed, the hospital became an integrallocus of health care delivery, whether for rich or for poor. Then, thepost World War II period saw a mushrooming of employer-paidhealth insurance programs, such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Thismeant hospitals would receive adequate reimbursement for the hos-pitalization of a far greater portion of the American population thanever before. Finally, the institution of Medicare and Medicaid, near-ly thirty years ago now, meant hospitals were being compensated forcare that previously had been charitable. Not surprisingly, our no-tion of hospitals as charitable, philanthropic institutions has changedto hospitals as business institutions.Naturally, the health care industry responded to market forces.The demand for physician specialists, trained in the ever broadeningranges of medical technology, forced up specialist incomes and en-couraged more medical students to eschew general practice in favorof specialties. Hospitals that had on hand the latest in medical equip-ment attracted these specialist physicians and their patients (andtheir revenue!). Hence, hospitals rose to the challengethey ex-panded and modernized their facilities and installed the newest, glit-ziest technology as it rolled off the production line.In at least some areas, the health care industry as a business hasbeen enormously successful. America is, without doubt, the leaderof the world in terms of medical expertise and innovation. We surelyhave more MRIs, CT Scans, laparoscopic equipment, etc. per capitathan any other country. The attractiveness of our hospitals, as wellas the opportunity for high income, has made America the benefi-ciary of a world- wide physician brain drain. Some of the most tal-ented medical minds and hands from numerous countriesBritain,Canada, Indiahave brought their considerable talents to benefitthe people of Americawell, at least to those who can afford theirservices. 138134 As with most any economic commodity, there will be some whocan afford the best andothers who cannot. Health care has provento be no exception. A veryfew people can afford a Lexus auto-mobile, fewer still a Jaguar br Rolls Royce. A few more have accessto a Cadillac. Many Americans, on the other hand, can manage theprice of a Ford Taurus, a Toyota Corolla, etc. Nearing the bottom, afew can only manage a Hyundai. And woe be unto those who pur-chased a Yugo, that import from a country that no longer reallyexists. And finally, there are many Americans who cannot affordany automobile. Very fewAmericans would look upon this and crymoral turpitude. The health care industry, analogously, is only be-having according to the same marketplace laws of behavior as auto-mobile manufacturers.Lest one rush to condemn such practices in the health care indus-try, please remember it is we who have insisted the industry behavein this fashion. We flock tothe specialists when we feel the need. Weprefer the hospitals with the best hotel services and the best tech-nology. We prefer to take our business to the physician with whomwe are comfortable. Thehealth care industry is only doing what weask of it: operate according to the ethic of business.From this perspective, physicians, hospitals, insurers, even drugcompanies are not moral villains. They are simply acting accordingto the ethic of business.Still, even from this perspective, there is a need for health care re-form. We feel as though the industry has gotten away from us, it hasslipped out of our control and now the spiraling costs of healthcarearound 14 percent of our GNPeconomically threaten us. Wefind it more and more difficult to compete in the international mar-ketplace because our health care costs, borne largely by employers,are far, far greater thanthose of any of our competitors. And if thereal buying power of middle class income has been stagnant for thelast decade, it is at least partly because of the double digit rise inhealth care premiums employers have been faced with most years.Vastly higher employer-paid premiums must mean less money avail-.able for real wage increases. So that we have some sense of whatwe are talking about, let me note that we currently spend around$3,500 per person 'nnually on health care. Individuals pay for onlyabout 20 percent oi that figure out of pocket, the rest being pickedup by employers and government. Think what kind of pay increasethat could mean for a typical, middle income family of four! TheClinton reform proposals argue that costs must be containedandthey are surely right.How did we get into this pickle, where we seem to be spending farmore on health carethan any of us would appear to want? Thestraightforward answer points to how most Americans are insulatedfrom medical expenses. Since the advent of widespread health in- 135139 surance (the second half of this century) Americans have paid lessand less of their health care expenses out of pocket. The bulk comes from employer-paid premiums and government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. So, although it is partly my money in a very distant sense when I receive medical care, the reimbursementmechanism is so removed from me as an individual that I do not di-rectly feel the expense. Hence, whereas when it is most definitely my budget that feels the pain when I buy an automobile for myself, itis not my personal wealth that feels the pain when I receive expen- sive medical care. So, while I might settle for a Ford Taurus (or in my own case, a well used Volvo), when it comes to my and my fami-ly's health care, I have no real incentive to economize. Hence, I de- mand the best of whatever medical care has to offer.No wonder our expenditures on health care are so high!In one sense, health care reform is already underway. In response to these economic forces and constraints, employers have turned to cost-effective, managed care programs to limit the growth in whatthey must spend for health care as a benefit to employees. And the Clinton reform proposal clearly embraces this notion cm' management of health care expenses.Health and the Social EthicFinally, we also regard health as a social good. It is not in our na- tion's own best interest to have a populace wracked and consumedby disease. From even the most cynical view, sick people do little to contribute to economic production and income taxes. A healthy workforce can produce more than a sick workforce. From a more generous point of view, few of us would disagree with the statementthat suffering is bad and health is good. But when regarded as a so- cial good, the question is not simply how much health care is in the best interests of the individual (that was our first moral perspective). Rather, the question becomes how much health care is in the best interests of society, given our limited resources and the welter ofother good and services that are of value. For example, how much should we spend on health as opposed to education? As opposed to public housing? As opposed to law enforcement? As opposed to our physical infrastructureroads, utilities, etc.?Consider the case, for example. of the Lakeberg Siamese twins, Angela and Amy. The twins were born at Loyola University Medical Center, joined at the abdomen. They shared several major organs, including the liver and a malformed six-chambered heart. Medical opinion was that Amy had no chance of long-term survival; Angela,if separated from Amy, hada 1 percent chance of survival. The Loyola physicians recommended against doing the surgical separa- tion, urging instead that the twins be allowed to die. (I should men- tion that the Loyola physicians recommended against surgery not 1361 4 0 primarily on the cost consideration, but rather because they be-lieved it would constitute pointless suffering for both of the twins).The Lakeberg parents, rejecting the advice of Loyola physicians,opted to go to Children's Hospital in Philadelphia where pediatricsurgeons were willing toperform the surgery, even though theyagreed the chances for long-term survival were 1 percent.Now I have no idea what the costs will be at Children's in Phila-delphia. But I can suggest that the costs at Loyola were in the neigh-borhood of $1 million. As a society, are we willing to pay for that pro-cedure one hundred times with the likelihood of saving one life inthe long term? That would be, according to a crude calculus and ig-noring the huge costs at Children's in Philadelphia, a willingness tospend one hundred million dollars to save one life. I doubt many ofus would consider that aprudent investment.Oregon has taken the lead here. In a bold experiment, the stateranked several hundred medical interventions according to their im-portance and cost-effectiveness. Each year, the legislature is to de-cide how much money it can allocate to the Medicaid program. Itthen runs down the ranking of medical interventions and (using epi-demiological statistics) draws the line where it estimates the statewill spend that much money if it pays for all the interventions abovethat line. Not surprisingly, immunizations are near the top, as areappendectomies, antibiotics for bacterial infections, etc. Near thebottom are such items as liver transplants and intensive care unitcare for AIDS patients atthe end stages of the disease.I am sure you are all able to see how these three different moralperspectives on health care offer a recipe for conflict.A health care reform program that satisfies our rhetoric of healthcare as a moral right ofthe individual would presumably cover theLakeberg twins. It would pay for liver and pancreas transplants. Butsuch a program would devastate the economy and draw much need-ed funds away from other social goods such as schools, housing,roads, defense and job opportunities.A program that treated health as simply an economic good and/orservice would do nothing to extend coverage to the uninsured. Andin the cold calculationsof the marketplace, the suffering of econom-ically marginal people will not be heard.A program that regards health care simply as a social good wouldinevitably reduce patient choice (something the Clinton committeeseeks to preserve), not only in terms of physicians, but also in termsof what services they may receive, e.g., health as a social goodwould most certainly not fund the Lakebergs, nor would it fund mostof the intensive care unit care delivered in our nation's hospitals.So any health reform program that adheres to just one of theseethics is doomed to moral failure according to the other two. 137141 By the same token, it is hard to see that any reform program could satisfy all three at once. The Clinton program would seem to empha- size universal access, while trying to also accommodate economic concerns by means of insurers competing for the buSiness of the\"health alliances.\" The committee imagines that administrative costs and fraud can somehow be made to vanish and then whatever is needed will miraculously be ,paid for. A more jaded view would sug- gest that if we want to pay less for our health care and also extend coverage to the currently uninsured, then ultimately we must buyless health care per capita. In the words that our economists are wont to use, \"There's no free lunch.\"Is there any way out of this unfortunate position? Or must we be cynics and conclude that any reform proposal is doomed to failure?I am convinced the only way for us to really make progress toward an effective, and morally needed, health care reform is to openly ac- knowledge the moral legitimacy of each of these three perspectives at one level; but then we must go beyond that. It will be necessary for us to engage in a meaningful discussion of how to balance these disparate moral commitments. To do that we must go beyond these three perspectives, we must get above them to a higher level of mor- al value that can arbitrate between them. That is, we must work out a notion of what we want health care to do for us, as individuals andas a community. We must have a higher sense of what the good lifeis for us as individuals, and what would constitute flourishing for our social community. Only then will we be able to see how medical care fits into that larger picture, of which it must inextricably be a part.I only hope that we may have the ability and the courage to under- take such an enterpriseour very future, moral and economic, is certainly at stake. 138142 HEALTH REFORM: WHAT THE CLINTON PLANAND ALTERNATIVESMEAN TO RURAL AND URBAN AMERICAEdward F. HowardAlliance for Health ReformAlthough I come from Washington, DC, these days, I started life asa Pennsylvanianand you may not know that Pennsylvania hasmore rural elderly residentsthan any other state.Before going further, let me offer you a word about the Alliancefor Health Reform. It emerged from the ashes of the Pepper Com-mission, for which I served as counsel. Jay Rockefeller, who chairedthe Pepper Commission, agreed to collaborate with me on a non-partisan, non-profit effort to educate opinion leaders on the urgentneed to address the health reform agenda. The board also includesSenator Jack Danforth (R-MO) and many who differ on what anideal health reform plan might be, but they agree on the need to actquickly rather than wait for that ideal to arrive.Our country stands on the brink of comprehensive, fundamentalreform of its fatally flawed health care system. For the first time in ageneration, we have a real chance to defuse the ticking bomb ofhealth care costs that threatens nothing short of an economicmeltdown in just a few short years.I will not describe in detail the current health care crisis in Amer-ica. Mark Waymack did a good job of that. But let me reiterate a fewsimple facts so we all start from the same page. It is not that mostAmericans do not have access to some of the most sophisticated, ad-vancedand expensivehealth care technology available in theworld.But it is a national disgrace that 37 million Americans lack insur-ance coverage at any timeand more than 60 million will be withoutcoverage sometime in the next two years.What is more, tens of millions of Americans with coverage under-stand they are a pink slip or a diagnosis away from falling throughthe cracks.Meanwhile, skyrocketing health care costs are eroding family in-come, governmental fiscal capacity and business competitiveness.As most of you know, rural America has some special problemswith health care. Non-metro areas have a higher percentage of peo- 139143 ple without insurance, higher infant mortality rates, fewer physi-cians and other providers, and fewer visits to those providers.Today I have been asked to help you focus on what the Clintonplan contains and what the major alternatives are likely to be. Inshort, I am supposed to function as a \"Washington insider.\"A few months ago, I received a fund-raising letter from Con-gressman Bill Archer, a Republican member of the House Ways andMeans Committee. He offered me the chance to contribute $5,000 tothe Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. In exchange, Iwould be able to attend a series of breakfast briefings by House Re-publicans on health care reformconveying information withoutwhich, as a Washington insider, I would find it impossible to do myjob. I chuckled and tossed the letter away.But James Carville, the irrepressible Clinton White House advisor,got the same letter, and wrote back to Congressman Archer, \"I'vebeen called a 'stupid and pathetic country bumpkin,' ... compared to David Koresh, . .. and blamed for a 65-point drop in the stockmarket. But never have I been called anything so repugnant ... as a Washington insider.\"We have a chance to make quality, affordable health care a realityfor the tens of millions of Americans who now lack itand a real chance to bring peace of mind to the majority of Americans whohave coverage, but rightly fear that they, too, could lose that securityany time. All Americans, in rural and urban areas, will have theirlives touched by the coming reforms. So be careful who you ask for insight.We have come a long way in health reform in a relatively shorttime. Health care in the 1988 presidential race, for example, was a secondary issueless important than crime, drugs, taxes, education,abortion. In Iowa, before the 1988 caucuses, George Bush told an in- terviewee he would give long-term care \"the attention it deserves.\"But by the fall of 1991, health care became the major issue in theupset defeat of Dick Thornburgh for the Pennsylvania Senate seat.Harris Wofford told voters, \"If every criminal in America has theright to a lawyer, then every working man and woman in Americashould have the right to see a doctor when they're sick.\" The politi-cal landscape has not been the same since:After eighteen months of meetings, Senate Republicans agreed on a reform plan and announced it three days after the Pennsylvaniaelection,George Bush, whose advisors were feuding publicly about whetherhe ought to have a health plan before the 1992 election, had one be- fore the New Hampshire primary.144140 Exit polls in New Hampshire and elsewhere showed health care asa solid #2 concern,behind the economy, in voters' minds. In thegeneral election, health care virtually tied with deficit reduction asthe second most important issuebut was a solid #2 (51-31, witheducation third at 18 percent) among those who voted for Bill Clin-ton.Bill Clinton did not start his quest for the presidency in 1992 as thecandidate most concerned about reforming the health care system.Remember, his advisers kept the campaign focused on \"the econo-my, stupid.\"But by the time President Clinton delivered his State of the UnionAddress, he was fixated on health care reform: \"All our efforts tostrengthen the economy will faillet me say this again, I feel sostrongly about thisall of our efforts to strengthen the economy willfail unless we also take this yearnot next year, not five years fromnow, but this yearbold steps to reform our health care system.\"He then designated First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to head hisTask Force for National Health Care Reform. And while the Clintonhealth reform proposal, sketched in a position paper and a majorspeech in September, 1992, may not have changed the direction ofthe campaign, it has profoundly changed the debate about the shapeand urgency of health reform.And you do not really need a Washington insider to get a prettyaccurate look at the health plan President Clinton will present toCongress next Wednesday night. All you need is a copy of Time,Newsweek or yesterday's Wall Street Journal. But on the theory thatyou have been so busy atthis conference you have not had a chanceto read any of the popular accounts, let me hit the highlights for you.Universal coverage. The Clinton plan would build on the existingemployer-based system of coverage by requiring all employers topay for 80 percent of the costof a standard plan for their workersand dependents. Employees would be required to accept the cover-age and pay the remainingshare of the premium in the plan of theirchoice. Since 85 percent of the uninsured are either workers or inthe family of a worker, that one step takes us roughly 85 percent ofthe way toward dealing with the problem of the uninsured. The un-employed and anyone else not connected with the work force wouldget coverage through a regional health alliance, with subsidies avail-able for families with incomes up to 150 percent of the federal pover-ty line (about $21,500 for a family of four).Those currently receiving Medicaid acute care coverage would befolded into this new plan for private coverage. Employer require-ments would be phased in, as states get up and running, with all ofthem in place by 1997. As a cushion against the possible loss of jobs 141195 in small businesses, the contribution of the smallest, lowest-wagefirms could not exceed 3.5 percent of payroll.Managed competition within a budget. By the time he made themajor health care speech of his campaign before Merck & Co. em- ployees in Rahway, NJ, on September 24, 1992, Bill Clinton had ex- plicitly ruled out the \"play-or-pay\" approach he favored early in thecampaign primaries. (In play-or-pay, employers either provide cov- erage for employees and dependents or pay a payroll tax toward thecost of covering them in a public insurance plan).In Bill Clinton's new plan, soon to be formally transmitted to Con-gress, employers would still face a requirement to contribute towardthe cost of coverage, but there would be no tax or public coverage option (thus causing some to describe the plan as a \"play or else\" proposal). In a play-or-pay plan, the lower the payroll tax rate, themore employers would find it advantageous to drop coverage, paythe tax and let government handle employees' insurance. Thischange has the advantage of responding to critics who saw the pub- lic plan as a stalking horse for national health insurance. The disad-vantage, in the eyes of single-payer advocates, was exactly the same: They argued that by leaving insurance companies with a cen-tral role to play, Clinton's plan would preclude true and complete re- form.States would establish one or more risk poolscalled regionalhealth alliances: Under the plan Clinton outlined, new state or re- gional cooperatives or pools would be set up to arrange the purchase of coverage for all residents (except Medicare beneficiaries and em- ployees of very large enterprises). Coverage would be purchasedfrom a selection of qualified health plans, expected to be mainly managed care networks of providers and insurers. The allianceshave a size advantage that would let them negotiate lower rates from the health plans, or networks, and collect from them informa- tion that patients could use to shop among plans. Hence, the al- liances would be able to \"manage,\" or regulate, competition for pa- tients among the plans on the basis of quality and cost.A standard benefits package. Every plan would offer a standard set of benefits, defined for all by a national health board. Prescription drugs would be included as would primary and preventive care and limited mental health benefits. Separately, states would be given federal funds to set up limited long-term care programs for severely disabled people of all ages and incomes, and Medicare would be ex- panded to include a separate prescription drug benefit. Comparisons among plans would be greatly simplified. Individuals could buy addi-tional coverage at their own expense.Insurance reform. Today's practices that allow insurers to avoid covering those thought to pose a larger chance of filing claims would 142146 be banned, and plans would be required to charge everyone in agiven area the same average ratea so-called \"community rating.\"Setting the budget. A national health board would set an overalllimit for spending on health care, both public and private. Thoselimits would be translated into \"capitation fees\"in effect, premiumtargets, for each regional health alliance. Each year those targetswould be adjusted upward by the national board. Alliances wouldthen keep overall spending at or below the targets. The targetswould be gradually brought into line with growth overall in the na-tional economy.States would be responsible for setting up alliances, administeringsubsidies for low-income people and low-wage employers, certifyinghealth plans, and running data collection and quality improvementprograms.They could choose to establish a government-run insurance planthese days called a \"single-payer plan.\"Regional health alliances could be state agencies or nonprofit or-ganizations, governed by employer and consumer representatives.It is appropriate to ask how well this device will fit in rural areas.The problem with managed competition, of course, is that in ruralareas there is preciouslittle competition to manage.When Iowa recently asked one of managed competition's intellec-tual parents, Rick Kronick, to evaluate the state's capacity to imple-ment that strategy, he concluded it would probably work . ..in DesMoines. The concentration of providers and population was too lowin the rest of the state to yield enough \"competition\" to be managed.Yes, everyone will eventually have a \"health security card.\" But,as Dan Hawkins of theNational Association of Community HealthCenters points out, giving an insurance card to Americans in someareas is like giving anAmerican Express card to a Tibetan monk: anice gesture, but with little practical effect.Alliances, according to the draft plan circulating, would have sev-eral tools with which to address the question of how to ensure ade-quate health services in rural areas.On their own initiative, alliances will be able to create additionalplans to serve rural areas, or require urban plans to serve rural al-liance areas, or offer long-term contracts to plans serving ruralareas.Beyond the alliances, the Clinton plan mentions (with few specificsyet):Federal loan guarantees for community-based organizations inrural areas for capital improvements. 13/1 7 Federal grants to develop telecommunications capacity, to link rural providers with health care centers.The National Health Service Corps would be expanded.Tax incentives would encourage physicians and other professionalsto practice in rural areas.Supplemental services would be provided through the publichealth system for low-income populationsservices like transporta- tion and outreach, for example.Academic health centers would help develop information andreferral structure for special services.And there will be a general effort to produce more primary care professionalsreforming medical education, reweighting physiciancompensation, and other steps.What will all this cost? By the year 2000, about $83 billion in new federal spending:$30 billion in subsidies to low-income people and low-wage busi- nesses.$28 billion for long-termcare.$17 billion for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.$8 billion for public health, full insurance deductibility for the self- employed, and overall administration.The rest of the new resources would be used to reduce the federal budget deficit.What is controversial, of course, is where to find these new re- sources.In April, the Alliance for Health Reform held a forum examining the strengths and weaknesses of various new taxes. But the bruising budget battle just concluded soured completely the atmosphere for raising much new revenue. So the administration suggests that in the year 2000:$16 billion in \"sin taxes\" anda corporate surcharge for large nesses.$46 \"savings\" from Medicare.$40 billion in \"savings\" from Medicaid.$16 billion from the effects of the mandate.$13 billion in other federal savings.And here is a safe prediction: this proposal will not pass by voice vote. Some would say the 748 health interest groups in Washington will slow movement toward enactment to a stop.There are many alternatives being offered by those groups and various lawmakers in both parties. Here is a brief listing of the major ones:1. A less intrusive \"managed competition\" proposal by Represent- ative Jim Cooper (D-TN) and other members of the Conser-148144 vative Democratic Forum. It contains no employer mandateand would tax the value of benefits received by employees be-yond the standard package.2. A similar proposal has been endorsed by the Senate Republi-can Health Task Force, headed by Senator John Chafee (R-RI).3. An incremental plan featuring \"medical savings accounts,\"rather like IRAs, that would encourage people to spend moresparingly a large initial amount each year, by allowing them tokeep what they do not spend on health care.4. A \"single-payer,\" or Canadian-style plan, endorsed by almostninety House Democrats (led by Representative Jim McDer-mott (D-WA) and several Senators including Paul Wellstone (D-MN).Already the Clinton plan has been attacked by RepresentativeMcDermott for lack of immediate cost controls, and by Senator PhilGramm (R-TX) as simultaneously threatening fiscal disaster and de-struction of the health care system as we know it.Interest groups have been cautious in their comments. Jim Toddof the American Medical Association calls it a step in the right direc-tion. The American Hospital Association says it is willing to discussoverall budgets. Senator Chafee has been saying sympathetic thingsabout the Clinton plan.What happens in Congress will unfold over the next six to twelvemonths, and will be complicated by the dozens of committees andsubcommittees seeking to exert jurisdiction over at least part of theplan.What is more, the attitudes of the American people, to which Con-gress responds, are muddy as well.We worry about losing insurance ourselves, and worry about thosewho have no coveragebut not so much that we are willing to paymuch to solve that problem.We favor requiring employers to cover their workersunless itmeans a loss in jobs.We want to rein in costs, but we also want the highest-tech equip-ment and procedures, and we want it tomorrow morning within aten-minute drive.As a result, the president and his allies have a tremendous sellingjob to do. Their strategy is clear: appeal to the uneasiness many ofus have about our future coverage. The second sentence of the draftplan reads, \"Americans lack security.\" You will hear that theme re-peatedly in the next few months.My own view is that we will have a health plan passed within thenext year. There is a compelling moral case for reform and an equal-14549 ly compelling economic case. But the reason I am so hopeful is thatthe political case for reform is overwhelming. Bill Clinton's chancesfor reelection would be incredibly enhanced by passage of a planthat provides peace of mindand faili.n.e to have such a plan inplace would be a serious blow to those chances. Additionally, scoresof Congressional delegates have made similar commitments. I be-lieve getting progressive, comprehensive reform is within our graspand I intend to do all I can to bring it about. Please, help in thatimportant venture. 150146 HEALTH CARE REFORM: THE IMPLICATIONSFOR HEALTH DATA SYSTEMSRonald C. YoungKansas State UniversityHealth care reform, whether at the state or national level, will re-quire greater attention to health care data base development. Re-gardless of the operational specifics of an eventual reform plan, thor-ough planning will be needed to establish an information system suf-ficient for the needs of policymakers, consumers, providers andthird-party payers alike. The process of system planning and opera-tion will demand policy decisions at many levels: national, state,local, public and private.This short paper is not intended to cover all possible policy issuesthat may arise in the development and operation of health care in-formation systems. Rather it is intended to review many of the issuesthat have faced states as they strive to implement health care databases and thereby draw policy implications for national systems de-velopment. This review should also reveal that policy debatesaround health care reform and health care information systems rep-resent more than arguments about the best methods of health carefinance and delivery. They embody a national discussion about theway we view ourselves as a nation and about the basic values wewant to guide our social interaction.The issues raised here represent a mixture of concerns that areboth applicable to the health care sector specifically and to the de-velopment of any information system generallybe it health care,automobile manufacture or financial control of a large corporation.The schemata outlined here are not presented as the only viable ap-proach. They serve primarily as a point of departure for the furtherrefinement of policy analysis in the area of information system de-sign in the support of health care reform.Health care reform, both at national and state levels, nas pro-ceeded with reference to three guiding principles: Quality, Accessand Cost. That is, reform should improve access to care withoutlowering its quality. Indeed, reform should include improved meth-ods of quality control. Additionally, reform should control costs ofcare and enhance public understanding of the factors driving thecosts of care. At the state level, these principles have generally beenembodied in information system development. The following set ofissues surrounding national health reform information system devel-147 151 opment should be considered in the context of these same princi-ples. PurposeThe general purpose of the information system must be clearly un-derstood by policymakers, system managers and users alike. Is thesystem's primary (or only) purpose that of program administration,control and planning? Or is it also intended as a resource for medi-cal, social science and other types of research? What are the possi-ble purposes for which the system will be used?In general, an information system exists to answer questions thatits users may pose. In the early stages of system development, plan-ners should consider as many questions as possible that its userscould advance. The nature of the questions will help inform the pur-pose and content of the information system.ScopeThe issue of scope, both in terms of information system contentand data acquisLion responsibility, is paramount. Many single-payer-style and n anaged-competition-style health reform plans fore-sec \"national data clearinghouses.\" The policy questions associatedwith national entities such as these refer to the extent of centraliza-tion that will be required for health reform information systems to beeffective. Will clearinghouses or similar types of organizations be therepositories and managers of centralized, national systems or willthey serve as coordinators and consultants to a less centralized ar-rangement of regional and/or state information systems?Regarding the content of the information systems, policy decisionswill need to be made regarding the type of information that will begathered. Will the information be primarily oriented toward healthcare service utilization? Will the system include information on otherkinds of information such as health delivery system structure aswell? That is, will existing resources such as medical equipment,physician numbers and specialty distribution be included?The scope of system content wili largely determine the scope of re-porting responsibilities. That is, if scope were limited to utilizationdata, providers would probably have primary responsibility for re-porting to the system. In some reform plans, third-party payerswould also bear reporting responsibility for utilization. Dependingon reform plansingle payer, managed competition, play or pay orsome otherand depending on the scope of data content, reportingresponsibilities will differ. 152148 Control and IntegrityOperational control and integrity of a health information systemare no less important than that of any other data system. Beyond thetechnical issues of data base control that occupy systems managers(e.g., hardware compatibility, data structures, record linkage, ap-propriate software, system security), there are public policy ques-tions that must be addressed regarding data acquisition and datause. They range from agency responsibility to user authorization.In order to manage information systems as significant as thosewhich will be required under health care reform, the designation ofa responsible agency (or agencies) will be important. It will be decid-ed whether existing agencies can handle the role or whether one ormore new agencies will need to be established. Additionally, deci-sions will be made regarding the amount of power those responsibleagencies will acquire to control the system and enforce compliancewith its rules.The designation of system control and reporting responsibilitieswill determine, in part, the reporting channels that data supplierswill use. In a centralized system, it is more likely that data supplierswould report directly to national level agencies. Decentralized sys-tems may require that data suppliers report only to their state or re-gional agencies.National health reform will require a greater uniformity in datacollection. Managers of a national system will likely release report-ing guidelines that will demand uniformity of data elements. Deci-sions will be made standardizing the definitions of each data elementcollected.The standardization of data elements is related to the need for sys-tem flexibility. As the health care delivery system itself changes, oras demands by data system users change, it will be necessary tochange the data system. System managers and policyrnakers will bepressed to ensure that inflexibility in the information system does notinhibit flexibility and change in the health delivery system it isintended to support. Improved and more efficient methods of healthcare delivery should not be impeded because the elements of an in-formation system cannot be changed to accommodate their exist-ence.The issue of user access to a national health care information sys-tem will no doubt constitute a major public policy issue. Currentlythere are innumerable proprietary health care data bases belongingto insurance companies, hospital associations, government agenciesand otht.r organizations. The degree to which these organizationsallow access to their systems varies greatly. 14915 3 I In contrast to the current array of proprietary data sets, the ulti-mate user of a national information system will be the public. How-ever, the degree of access any individual or collective user will enjoymust be determined. Who will be allowed access to the data and thedegree to which they have access will be important public policy de-cisions. Users permitted direct access to raw data will likely have anadvantage over those limited to uniform data extracts or sets ofstandardized reports in electronic or printed form. How user rightsand responsibilities are distributed will be the subject of significantpublic scrutiny.Consumer/PatientThe information requirements of a national health system con-cerning the individual and family consumers of care will surely in-crease. The greater the requirements for individual information, thegreater the likelihood that individual privacy could be compromised.Yet, for the health delivery system's protection, for the individual'sprotection and for the ability of the system to provide useful informa-tion, many delicate decisions concerning the amount of informationto collect about individuals and families will be made.The collection of consumer and family information will begin witheligibility to be covered under the plan. Decisions concerning con-sumer eligibility for access to the system will be necessary. Most cur-rent health reform plans require citizenship or some form of legalresidency before an individual will be deemed eligible for coverage.Health data systems generally require unique consumer and/orpatient identifiers, usually a number. The unique identifier will berequired to track each individual's use of the health delivery system.For instance, in a system with benefit portability wherein individualsretain coverage as they change employers, it may be the case thatthe individual will also carry along deductibles and benefit limits ashe or she moves. Today, if an employee changes employers andthereby insurance coverage, the new insurer will usually begin ac-counting deductibles and limits anew regardless of the individual'sprior payment history. A national health information system will re-quire more uniformity in the tracking of the individual's use of thehealth care system and will retain a longer memory concerning indi-vidual utilization.Beyond individual data collection, decisions will be made regard-ing the extent to which a national health information system willkeep population-based information for use in more systematic healthanalyses. With universal coverage, demographic, health status andepidemiological information will become even more important whenidentifying populations at risk for clinical attention. In addition, so-cial and economic information about individuals and populationsmay be required to anticipate the degree to which clinical need is1514150 translated into economic demand for services. Depending on thepayment mechanisms in force under health reform, failure to cor-rectly anticipate system utilization could cause serious financialproblems for any national health system. Policy decisions will be re-quired to establish the degree to which a national health care infor-mation system will be used for such purposes.ProviderA national health information system will require certain informa-tion about health care providers. How much information and howdetailed it should be will be subjects of ongoing policy debate. Aswith consumers, unique identifiers for providers will be a necessity.The identifiers will apply to both individuals (e.g., physicians) andcorporate entities. It may be an important distinction to determinewhether -a free-standing clinic is independently owned or part oflarger entity (e.g., owned by a local hospital). If it is not independ-ently owned, it may receive the identifier of its parent organization.How these kinds of corporate relationships are tracked will be thesubject of some policy decision. The identification method will likelyneed to be uniform throughout the country regardless of the healthplan implemented.StructureThe way in which the structure of the health care system is moni-tored under health reform will be very important. Under the desig-nation of system structure come such things as the type and locationof existing physical plants (e.g., hospitals, clinics, nursing homes)and the mix of services available. It includes the type and location ofequipment as well as health care personnel and their skill levels.Decisions about the methods used to keep up-to-date inventoriesand system profiles of health service delivery structures will be sub-ject to ongoing review. The way in which health service shortagesare remedied under whichever health reform plan is implementedwill be related to the method used to assess delivery system struc-ture. This and other system adjustments will be associated with theway policymakers perceive the status of the health care deliverystructure.ProcessThe way in which the process of health delivery and consumptionis monitored will be a central function of any information systemunder health reform. The functional definition of process used to in-form the information system will greatly influence the types of datacollected. Similarly, the actual data elements chosen as part of theprocess will limit the scope of process measurement and evaluation. 151155 Utilization data lie at the center of information about the processof health care delivery. Utilization data elements could include pa-tient visits to physicians, the number of hospital admissions, diag-nosis and procedure information, among others. Each delivery set-ting inpatient, outpatient, etc.has a number of possible dataelements that could be used for measuring utilization. Beyond theproblem of limiting the myriad possibilities of data elements thatcould be included in process measures lies the problem of uniformcollection instruments. Uniform hospital billing forms, such as theUB-82 form used for Medicare prospective payment, have been ad-vocated as the basic instrument for gathering inpatient information.The efficacy of collecting information and developing uniform re-porting instruments for different types of care and other aspects ofthe health care delivery process, such as hospital financial details(e.g., gross revenues, debt structure, operating and capital ex-penses) will undoubtedly undergo lengthy policy discussion.Of course information about the process of care cannot overlookissues of cost and payment. The problem of measuring service costcan be broken into two parts. If the collection of health cost datatakes place at the point of service delivery, information will pertainto the price charged by the provider which, in turn, becomes a costto the consumer. Health cost data collection could also cover pro-vider inputs. That is, the price hospitals pay for equipment, nurses'salaries and the like might also be collected to measure the inputcosts of producing medical services. Different types of policy deci-sions will be required depending upon whether cost data is collectedon service inputs, outputs or on both.The problem of collecting information on payment for service be-comes more complicated as one moves from single-payer plans, tomanaged-competition plans, to other forms of insurance coveragereform. Decisions regarding the collection of information about pay-ment methods will be difficult as well. Different types of informationwill be needed for capitation payment, fee-for-service, or PreferredProvider Organization (PPO) strategies. Related to the way third-party payers make payment is the issue of collecting informationabout the premiums they charge for coverage and the costs they in-cur managing the payment mechanism.The identification of appropriate process measures and the associ-ated collection of data elements would likely represent the bulkhealth information system development. It is at this stage that issuesof cost containment, case management, as well as service type anddistribution, will receive the greatest attention. Most of the informa-tion used to address issues of health system management will comefrom process-type data collection.OutcomeOutcome measures and outcome data refer to the end result ofcare received. They include such things as the management of156152 chronic illness, appropriateness of care or the occurrence of adverseresults such as mortality.The interpretation of outcome data with respect to health systemperformance can be exceedingly complex. For instance, a hospitalthat takes more patients with advanced stages of a serious diseasemay have higher mortality statistics by that cause of death than ahospital that only treats patients in the early stages of the same dis-ease. It may be improper to use outcome data, measured by mor-tality statistics alone, to infer that the first hospital is not as \"good\" asthe second hospital with respect to the treatment of the disease.The difficulty of using many outcome measures to evaluate healthsystem performance in the treatment of acute care has limited theiruse in health system management. On the other hand, in the evalua-tion of the delivery of preventive services, outcome measures, suchas immunization rates, have received greater acceptance. However,it is safe to say that no general agreement has yet been reached con-cerning the best use of outcome data in health system evaluation.Despite the lack of a broad array of generally agreed-upon evalua-tion techniques based on outcome measures, managed competitionplaces greater emphasis on outcome as an indicator of comparativehealth plan efficiency and effectiveness. There will be significantpolicy issues raised regarding the development of outcome measuresfor a health care reform based on managed competition. The typesand uses of outcome data included in health information systems willbe of much greater importance.QualityAn overriding principle guiding the development of health-care-reform-inspired data systems will be that of health care quality.Health data systems will be called upon to provide information to beused in the assessment of health delivery system quality and in theimprovement of health system quality. In the context of universal ac-cess to care, policy definitions of quality care will receive increasingattention. Policymakers and health system managers will demandthat the data elements of their information systems reflect their defi-nitions of quality and enable their evaluation of the quality of healthsystems.ConclusionThe impact and consequences of health care reform on health in-formation system development will be significant. Important policydecisions affecting the implementation, control, content and use ofsuch systems will be required at all levels of government as well asin the private sector. The scope of data collection, especially with re-spect to the processes of care, will most likely be the subject of most1531 5 7 policy activity. It is likely that the wide array of consumer, provider,third-party payer and government agency interests regarding theprocess of health care delivery will not always be compatible. Thepossible detail of information about process needed by health systemusers could cause conflict with the providers of the information. As aresult there will most certainly be policy decisions made with the in-tent to limit and prevent conflict in the development, updating anduse of health information systems supporting health reform imple-mentation.

Yet, it is a consequential issue forrural people and communities. More than any other residentialgroup in society, rural Americans experience the greatest depriva-tion of access to quality, affordable health care. For this reason, thefulfillment of our traditional mandate to improve the quality of life ofrural peoples and communities demands a comprehensive responsefrom extension. This paper highlights some of the spatial inequalitiesin access to health care services and considers the consequences ofthese inequalities. It then explores some approaches to empoweringrural citizens to become involved in the public discourse and deci-sion making about health care reform.Spatial Inequalities in Health CareIn our urban society, geographic place has been all but dismissedas a significant factor in social life. Social science research has tend-ed to ignore the question of residence, while policymakers, respond-ing to the demography of politics, ignore the spatial consequences ofpolicies and programs. Because we have all failed to recognize howgeography or physical space remains a significant factor in sociallife, spatial inequalities have emerged and persisted. Spatial in-equalities refer to the differences in life chances that arise merelyfrom residential location in either rural (nonmetropolitan) or urban(metropolitan) places. In other words, where you live affects yourlife chances over and above the effects of any other defining charac-teristics of individuals, their families or their households. Spatial in-equalities exist because space is not simply a \"given social fact,\" anobjectively neutral canvas on which significant social processesoccur. Rather, space is a key factor shaping the structure and func-tioning of all institutions and organizations, especially the health caresystem.The significance of spatial inequalities for rural Americans is alltoo easily demonstrated. The preponderance of medically under-served areas are rural. One study found that underserved countieswere three times more likely to be rural than urban, and one halfthe states had more than 75 percent of all their rural counties classi- 155 fled as underserved. This means rural people have less access tohealth care providers and facilities than urban residents. Indeed, insome rural areas, there are no primary care providers, includingobstetricians, and this means pregnant women must travel great dis-tances for prenatal care and delivery. For example, in 1988, therewere sixty-one obstetric care providers per 100,000 women in urbanareas, but only twenty-five per 100,000 rural women. Studies alsoshow that when health services are available, rural residents havefewer choices among health care providers and facilities, and areless able to obtain all levels of care within their communities. Final-ly, even when services are available, rural residents are less able toutilize them because of a higher proportion of uninsured personsand families within the population.Quite simply, if you live in a rural area, health care reform maywell be a matter of life and death. As a rural resident, you are atgreater risk, than if you lived in an urban area, of dying within yourfirst year of life, 'developing a chronic disease, becoming functionallyimpaired, having no health care providers within your communityor, if they are present, having no choice among providersand hav-ing no financial access to services. All this just because you live in arural community. This is the meaning of spatial inequality and whyhealth care reform is so critical to rural America.Is There a Health Care Reform Role for Extension?Extension's national health initiative provides an institutional man-date for the development of new programming in this area, but doesnot necessarily insure the institutional resource base for developingsuch programming. Some may argue that health care reform in-volves questions beyond the human resources of extension. Fromone perspective, this is true. Most extension systems do not havepersons who are health care providers on staff. However, this inter-nretation of the question of health care reform is very narrow, defin-ing health care reform as only an economic or technical problem re-quiring expert knowledge for analysis and decision making. Indeed,nearly all the debate over reform focuses on the economics of thehealth care systemhow to control the spiraling upward rate ofhealth care costsas if finding a better way to finance the healthsystem will solve all the spatial and other inequalities inherent in theorganization and functioning of health care in America.An alternative perspective asserts that health care reform is notabout the technical issues of more efficient billing systems or morecost-effective ways of financing health care. Rather, these answerswill only \"tinker\" with the system of health care in America withoutaddressing the more fundamental issues of prevention, access, con-sumer health and the relationship between social inequality andhealth status inequality. These issues are at the heart of a redesignof our health care system into one that assures equal access to high1601\" quality, appropriate care for all Americans. Health care reformshould not be decided simply on the basis of economics, for such anapproach ignores more substantive concerns. If the current nationaldebate over health care reform does not address questions of spatialand socioeconomic equity in access to the health care system, thenwe will have simply perpetuated an essentially flawed institutionalsystem.Extension has a key role to play in this arena by helping toredefine the current debate over health care reform. To best servethe interests of rural Americans, we must move the debate from anarrow focus on economics into the broader, more substantively sig-nificant questions of prevention, access, health education and socialinequalities. And we must broaden the debate to include not just theexperts and those with vested special interests, but all Americans,for these value-based decisions will affect all our lives.Extension is uniquely situated to broaden the focus of the debateand engage more citizens in the decision making. Extension's reachinto every county of every state is its organizational structure facili-tating public discussion. Extension's educational programming andits emphasis on collaborative work are the organizational processeson which the public discussion can be built. Extension's traditions of neutrality and information transfer as well as its organizationalmission are the philosophical j .stifications for assuming a leadershiprole in the public discussion of health care reform. All that is neededis the organizational commitment to the development of focused pro-gramming in this area. What follows is a description of how one stateextension service has developed its commitment to this issue.Kentucky's Health Extension ProgrammingA year ago, Kentucky's state extension task force on health andsafety was formed. The task force membership includes not onlystate extension specialists and county agents, but also health profes-sionals in other sectors of the University, e.g., the Rural Health Cen-ter, the College of Medicine and the Markey Cancer Center's Pre-vention Program. Our approach has been to open participation inthe task force to anyone with an interest in health and safety issues.This broad membership has provided the task force with the tech-nical knowledge base to address a wide variety of health issues withnew programs and materials.The task force has two subcommittees: one focused on communityhealth services, the other oriented to individual health behaviors.Educational materials and programming are done by the subcommit-tees as well as by the committee as a whole. For example, the indi-vidual health practices subcommittee surveyed all county extensionagents to identify programming topics for specific audiences. Thecommunity health services subcommittee is in the process of devel- 1516 I. oping a survey to assess the availability, access, convenience anduse of county health services as well as attitudes toward the qualityof these services. The survey will first be administered to county ex-tension agents. Then training will be offered to agents so they canuse the survey as the basis for community programming.The task force has adopted the issues-gathering approach for itswork on health care reform and related community development ef-forts. Issues gatherings are based on the Kettering model of studycircles designed to encourage \"public talk\" about community andnational life. Issues gatherings provide a structured opportunity forcitizens to express their opinions on controversial topics. All partici-pants begin with a common understanding of the issue as presentedin an issues brief and discussions encourage participants to evaluatethe strengths and weaknesses of action choices. As the discussionsproceed, participants are asked to consider the values underlyingaction choices and to identify points of common ground. We believeissues gatherings are a method for conveying information on con-temporary issues that involve the allocation of scarce community re-sources or the transformation of community resources, organizationor goals. With the ground rules for discussion clearly defined, thisapproach can successfully guide reasoned discussions among oppo-nents of the most contentious issues.Three examples will illustrate how this approach to engaging cit-izens in public talk about critical issues has guided the educationalprogramming of the task force. The first issues brief was part of theAppalachian Civic Leadership Project, a Kellogg-funded program inwhich extension participates. When it became apparent the currentgovernor would move forward on state health care reform as prom-ised during the election, the Appalachian Civic Leadership Projectmobilized to provide a forum for public discussion of the issue. Anissues brief based on the governor's proposal was prepared for a se- ries of issues gatherings around the state. The discussions focusedon the strengths, weaknesses and values underlying the proposal,guided by questions such as: \"Who benefits?\" and \"Who loses withthe plan?\" and, ultimately, \"What is best for the common good?\"The Appalachian Civic Leadership Project has trained nearly one hundred issues-gathering facilitators, many of whom are county ex- tension agents. These trained facilitators joined others to conduct a series of issues gatherings statewide, producing an organized publicinput to the reform process.A second example occurred just prior to the appointment of thetask force when some members were involved in the development ofa guide evaluating advanced life support (ALS) versus basic life sup-port (BLS) emergency services. Research shows that a trained para-medic and an advanced life support emergency service, respondingwithin the \"golden hour\" following a life-threatening injury or heart attack, can increase an individual's chances of survival and recovery162158 by two and one half times. For Kentuckians, access to ALS is notequal. More than half of all counties (primarily the rural counties)have only BLS and virtually none of the eastern Kentucky countieshave ALS. Yet, upgrading to ALS represents a significant commit-ment of community funds for equipment, training and personnel at atime when most rural Kentucky counties face serious economicstresses. Thus, rural counties face some important choices with re-spect to a critical component of the local health care system. Theymust make value-based decisions on the balance between the invest-ment of a given amount of community resources against a given im-provement in the quality of local health services. The issues brief de-scribes the differences between basic and advanced life supportservices and then discusses some community options. Communityresidents thus have a basis for public discussions on their healthservice options.Our most recent publication is an issues brief on health care re-form that also includes simple definitions of key health reform,health care and health insurance terms. The issues brief introducesthe debate over health care reform, summarizing the reasons for thecurrent movement and some of the major proposals for change. Theaccompanying definitions of key terms offer a simple introduction tothe bewildering world of health care terminology, providing partici-pants with a common ground for discussion. Two training programson health care reform will be offered to county extension agents thisfall to introduce the new materials and enhance the agents' skills asfacilitators for public discussions of controversial topics.Although only in the early stages of its work, the educational ma-terials and professional expertise of the task force have already beenseized on by county extension agents. For example, one countyagent has provided the health care reform issues brief to the localchamber of commerce, which has now requested a special programfor chamber members. In another county, the extension agent, wholast year organized a social services agency council, is planning out-reach discussion groups on health care reform with clients of thevarious service agencies. In addition, the state Rural Health Centerwill be using the educational materials in their programming whilealso contributing to the development of new materials.SummaryReform of the health care system must move beyond the econom-ics of the system into broader questions of equality of access, qualityof services and the underlying socioeconomic inequalities that com-pound the limited life chances associated with the spatial inequalitiesin health care. But this will not happen unless citizens, especiallythose most vulnerable to the inefficiencies and inequalities in ourcurrent health system, force the public discussion into these areas.Currently, the public debate has been defined by those with a1'16 3 vested interest in the current system and concerned primarily withthe economics of change. What is needed is a foundation for a newpublic discourse. Extension can contribute to this effort. But, to doso, extension must build coalitions with health professionals andothers who share these broader concerns. The multidisciplinary taskforce provides the expertise necessary to develop educational mate-rials, while the study circle issues briefs provide a vehicle for open-ing the discussion of health care reform to all citizens. 164160 Public Issues Educationand the NPPEC 165 PUBLIC ISSUES EDUCATION AND THE NPPECWalter J. ArmbrusterFarm. FoundationPublic policy education evolved from the work of agriculturaleconomists involved in commodity policy extension work. Thesesubject matter specialists were looking for ways to improve their ef-fectiveness as educators while avoiding the pitfalls of taking a posi-tion on the policy issues. They focused on identifying important pol-icy issues; developing alternatives for dealing with those issues; andanalyzing the consequences of each of those alternatives, all in anobjective, educational mode. The \"issues-alternatives-conse-quences\" model that evolved combined \"content\" expertise and\"process\" methodology, though most emphasis was placed on con-tent, including much outside of commodity policy.Public policy education specialists have dealt with more than com-modity policy as reflected in the National Public Policy EducationConference agenda over the years. In 1990, Barr and Flinchbaughreviewed program topics for the policy conference and found thatcommodity, and closely-related, policy was of decreasing impor-tance, although it always had been only part of the forty-year-oldconference agenda.Nonetheless, the public policy education specialists and the Na-tional Public Policy Education Committee (NPPEC) continue to beviewed as focused almost entirely on agricultural commodity policy.That perception is reinforced by the fact that the most visible out-puts from the NPPEC over the past fifteen plus years, other than theconference proceedings, have been the periodic farm bill projects.The one exception is Module 6, \"Education for Public Decisions,\" ofthe Working With Our Publics project. Module 6 was high quality,but has been the most widely used of the modules because it was\"pre-sold\" to a network of specialists with subject matter credibility.These specialists were drawn upo- Is authors and reviewers. TheNPPEC promotion of the module v. s extremely helpful in creatingdemand for, and use of, the materials. However, Module 6 is identi-fied as a part of the overall project for which others are credited.In recent years the public policy education \"content\" arena hasembraced home economics (or human ecology) and family issues;environmental, water quality, and other socioeconomic issues impor-tant to agriculture, rural communities and society at large; and otherpolicy issues of broad interest to the general populace. 163166 Methodological or \"process\" developments have included increas-ing attention to a broader definition of the public policy educationmethodology, redefining or broadening the inclusiveness of some ofthe concepts. For example, Hahn has focused some attention on biasversus balance as opposed to the \"objectivity\" frequently cited as anelement of the public policy education process.The W.K. Kellogg Foundation funded eleven projects in its Inno-vative -Public Policy Education Project Cluster, administered jointlywith Farm Foundation. Only a few of the seventy project proposalswere submitted by \"established\" public policy education specialists.Of the eleven funded projects, only three were from these specialistsand none focused on commodity policy.The eleven Kellogg projects incorporated team building skills;coalition development and nurturing; bringing together a range ofinterests to discuss policy issues; leadership development for thosegroups needing to be empowered to work in the policy arena; com-munity or interest group problem solving workshops to develop un-derstanding of public policy education methodology; and involvingparticipants in agenda development. The project coalitions broughttogether a diverse group of land grant university and other organiza-tion personnel that had a knowledge base and an interest in the pol-icy issues involved. In some coalitions, land grant university person-nel were not even included. These projects utilized a variety of\"process\" techniques to reach their objectives.Recently, \"public issues education\" has been brought forward asan action plan to provide extension staff, from specialists downthrough county staff, an increased understanding of how to success-fully work on controversial public issues in an educational context.The proponents of public issues education clearly saw the increasinginvolvement of extension educators in controversial issues. But be-yond that, they recognized the need to provide an in-service educa-tional program and developed a specific proposal to obtain fundingto do such in-service programming., They developed the proposalunder the public issues education label and have received ExtensionCommittee on Organization and Policy (ECOP) endorsement. Thalabel was selected at least partially because of concerns among som& extension leaders that \"policy\" implies political involvement or per- haps even making or advocating recommendations for specific policyalternatives. \"Issues,\" on the other hand, has a more benign con- notation to many and is viewed as more amenable to education.Public policy education specialists and the National Public PolicyEducation Committee have for some time recognized the need for in-creasing understanding of the public policy education methodologyas a useful tool for an increasing number of extension employees.However, we have never proposed specific action. Given the ECOP 167164 adoption of the public issues education action plan, what role isthere for public policy education specialists?You may contribute individual knowledge of the public policy edu-cation process and provide training to increase the understanding ofit by extension specialists and county staff in your state. You maycontribute disciplinary excellence to the educational programs tobroaden understanding of the controversial public issues by helpingidentify alternative solutions and analyzing their consequences. Oryou may choose to do nothing, view public issues education as en-tirely focused on \"process\" and act as if you still have control of the\"content\" agenda.Clearly, public issues education training must emphasize the im-portance of having access to, and incorporating into educational pro-gramming, a sound content knowledge base. There exists ample op-portunity for public policy education specialists to get involved. Youmust decide what you wish to do, either individually or as a group. Isuggest that the NPPEC appoint a Public Issues Education TaskForce to work with the two ECOP subcommittees charged with im-plementing the action plan, the Personnel and Organization Devel-opment Committee (PODC) and the Program Leadership Committee(PLC). Specialists affiliated with the NPPEC have the practical ex-perience in the core issues-alternatives-consequences methodologyframework upon which public issues education must build. Theyhave increasingly drawn upon emerging process techniques to im-plement effective education on controversial public issues. They arein the best position to lead the effort to develop the in-service educa-tion programming to increase the understanding by extension staff,including specialists and those in the counties, of how to do publicissues education. The stage is set! Let's get on with the task! REFERENCESBarr. Wallace. and Barry Flinchbaugh. \"Fort2, Years of Increasing Understanding ofPublic Problems Policies-1990. pp. 15-22. Oak Brook.

SomersanUniversity of WisconsinExtensionToday, more than ever before, our nation's economic and socialwell-being rests on its ability to make informed choices regardingpublic issues. The complex issues facing our society defy single-sec-tor solutions. It is necessary to create forums that bring public andprivate entities and interested citizens together. However, in orderfor a truly democratic public decision-making process to take place,citizens need assistance to become active and productive partici-pants.Issues confronting us at every level encompass difficult choices.Once the public becomes aware of an issue, citizens need to work to-gether to make public choices. Such public problem solving requiresdiscussion and debate from different perspectives. The process isoften controversial because individuals' understandings, beliefs,values and specific situations lead them to prefer different solutions.Given the differences in individuals' beliefs, values and circum-stances, it is easy for viewpoints to become polarized and for publicissues to harden divisions among social and economic groups. Non-adversarial discussion and debate on issues, and exploration, gener-ation and assessment of alternative solutions are essential to makinginformed public choices.The public issue decision-making process should Na open and in-clusive. It should incorporate extensive and informed debate and de-liberation. Only when these conditions are present can the publicunderstand and support the ensuing public policy. This is how I in-terpret Harry Boyte's vision for \"recreating the Common Wealth.\"This is how I interpret the meaning of self-governance in a democ- racy.Who leads this process of public decision making and problemsolving? What kind of expertise does one need to \"reinvent the Com-monWealth?\" Michael Briand of the Kettering Foundation, in a paper delivered at this conference last year, provided the responseto my questions. He defines political expertise as \"the ability to getpeople to work together to solve public problems.\" In his view, thepurpose of political expertise is \"to improve a community's ability to 166166 ftunderstand the hard choices it must make and work together towardpublic judgment.\"Facts, analyses and expert opinion on consequences of various op-tions have their role in this process. But the critical trait distinguish-ing effective political leaders from other actors in the process is, inBriand's view, the know-how needed for public deliberation. Hechallenges public policy educators to supplement their currentteaching efforts with a practical educational experience that in-structs young Americans how to practice democratic politics(Briand, pp. 23-24).Improving the practice of democratic politics requires a commit-ment to \"societal learning\" that can help people operate effectivelyin the context of changing local, national and global realities. Ouruniversities have an important leadership role in the societal capaci-ty building required to improve the practice of democratic politics.There are important roles for research and teaching in this long-term process, and there also is a continuing important role for exten-sion educators.The Cooperative Extension System (CES) has defined PublicIssues Education as \"educational programs which have the objectiveof enhancing the society's capacity to understand and address issuesof widespread concern.\" The vision is to become the premier educa-tional resource to guide Americans in relearning the practice ofdemocratic politics. The CES Position Statement on Public IssuesEducation (October, 1992) articulates the vision for CES:\"With public issues education as a major component of its activi-ties, the Cooperative Extension System is envisioned as a vital andimportant resource for the nation in the twenty-first century. Exten-sion will be known for the contribution it has made through its abilityto:initiate public discourse before positions have hardened or acrisis point is reached;draw all interested parties into public discourse;increase understanding of others' points of view;address controversial issues fairly;introduce relevant academic knowledge into public discourse,and expand the knowledge base by communicating researchneeds to the academic community;facilitate a process of active learning and discovery;involve participants in analysis, forecasting, strategic planning,and problem solving;create an understanding of complex, controversial issues;broaden the mange of alternatives; discover new approaches andopportunities,increase the likelihood of collaborative solutions; 167170 help people and communities anticipate emerging issues andtheir implications.\"There are core values, beliefs and assumptions underlying visionstatements like this one that are important to articulate. We haveidentified four that underlie public issues education. Namely, educa-tion as a powerful tool for improving the quality of public choices; di-alogue among people of diverse backgrounds and points of view asimportant to enhancing the quality of public decisions; willingness tonegotiate, to share power, and to explore collaborative action as es-sential to innovative solutions; and capacity building through educa-tion as the opportunity for non-participants to become involved inpublic discourse.The Cooperative Extension System will fulfill its potential in publicissues education to the extent that extension staff at all levels under-stand the need for this effort and build their own capacities in theprocess and content of public issues education. This initiative will failif the majority of extension staff assume that it is the responsibility ofa handful of \"specialists.\" We must strive to make each and everyone of our staff an accomplished public issue educator if we are torealize our vision.This is hard work for all of usadministrators, faculty and staff.We need to discuss, debate and internalize a shared vision for ourrole in public issues education. We need to establish mechanisms toassure program quality. We need to build internal capacity throughmeaningful staff development activities. We need to recognize publicissue education work in reward and advancement systems. And weneed to establish mechanisms for coping successfully with controver-sy. There is a great deal of work to do in each of these areas.Recognizing the need for an action plan to make progress towardits vision, the Cooperative Extension System endorsed the report ofa task force, created jointly by the Extension Committee on Organi-zation and Policy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Exten-sion Service. The report is titled Public Issues Education: An Agendafor .Action (July, 1993). The agenda focuses on organizational under-standing and commitment, staff development, and knowledge devel-opment and utilization. It sets goals, identifies strategies, lists actionsand suggests primary responsibility for implementation of each focusarea. The document will be disseminated throughout the systemwithin the next few weeks.This may be the \"teachable moment\" and a great leadership op- portunity for the community of public policy educators. You have in-troduced and refined the \"alternatives and consequences\" approachas well as a variety of other approaches very useful within publicissues education. You are also experts at various process specialtiesthat are extremely important tools in conducting public issue educa-tion programs. In fact, the Farm Foundation and several experi- 168171 enced public policy education specialists have been involved in plan-ning the national video teleconference series on public issueseducation, as well as developing the Cooperative Extension System'sAgenda for Action. In addition to providing visible leadership tobuilding capacity throughout the organization, many of you will con-tinue your long-standing and important function as experts in specif-ic areas of public policy based on your disciplinary background andresearch interests.For all of you who devote part of your time to professional devel-opment for extension educators, the initiative in public issues educa-tion has the potential for increasing your \"class size\" to the total or-ganization and beyond. As we collectively strive to build expertise inthe young generation in our classrooms on and off campus, we canalso strive to instruct and empower each of our colleagues, to helpthem take leadership toward the goal of improving public decisions.The need is great. This is the call to action. As public institutionsand as educators we would ignore it at our own risk. REFERENCESBriand.

FlinchbaughKansas State UniversityI must admit, after a quarter of a century of involvement in exten-sion public policy education, both as a student and a practitioner, Iam perplexed .and confused. Perhaps the \"system,\" whatever thatmeans, is about to devour us. As the Kansas contact person for thePublic Issues Education project, I received a packet of materialsheadlined, \"if issues were alligators.\" Well, issues are not alligators,but I fear the \"system\" is crawling with alligators. Allow me to ex-plain.Public policy education in the Cooperative Extension System wasborn in the hatchery of agricultural economists who dealt with priceand income programs for family farmers. A well-known model thathas stood the test of time was usedthe non-advocacy alternative/consequences (A/C) model. It did not espouse a political agenda forthe Extension Service and it fully understood that value judgments,not scientific criteria established by the experts in the halls of aca-deme, were the basis for policy decisions. The evolution of the Na-tional Public Policy Education Committee (NPPEC) paralleled thedevelopment of public policy education.The record of the traditionalists in this business on farm bill educa-tion and the famous Who Will Control Agriculture project is exem-plary, but beyond that, what have we done? That is a good question.Some may take offense at this accusation and will come forwardwith some examples, state by state, but the record of the nationalcommittee and regional committees, in recent times, is slim. Severalof us even tried to revisit the structure-of-agriculture question andreceived little support. Since I chaired the national committee twicein recent years, I will shoulder a disproportionate share of theblame, but also take the license to be heard.In our defense, in the North Central Region we attempted tobroaden our base and include a home economist from each state onthe committee because we could document that they were doingpublic policy education effectively in family issues, but the directors,in their infinite wisdom, shot us down. They refused to allow an agri-cultural economist and a home economist from each state to serve onthe committee.173170 Ironically, I spent the first two-thirds of my career trying to con-vince traditional agriculturalists that we should broaden our baseand include natural resource and family issues. Now I find, in an ag-ricultural state such as Kansas, I will spprid the remaining years de-fending the importance of agriculture against those who think it is nolonger relevant at a land grant university. But then, every nonad-vocacy public policy educator must have at least one cause, internalto the system, to fight for.The public policy education fraternity within extension, I will ar-gue, created a vacuum by 1980 (for lack of a more appropriate docu-mented date) by our lack of an issue agenda much beyond price andincome policy. Along came those whose forte is process rather thancontent and we began to reinvent the wheel. The alligators got intothe swamp and the devouring began. The buzzwords became\"issue-based programming.\" Was \"issue-based programming\" de-signed to serve the needs of the people, our clientele, or was it self-serving and designed to save the system? Many traditionalists in thefraternity were miffed because we thought public policy educationwas issue-based programming. (Many may think the term \"frater-nity\" is sexist, but, remember, the directors would not let us mergewith the sorority). Now we have new buzzwordspublic issues edu-cation.Barrows, in the introduction to his classic bulletin on public policyeducation, which the University of Wisconsin is now wisely reprint-ing, stated, \"public policy education is an Extension program thatapplies the knowledge of the university to public issues and educatescitizens to enable them to make better informed policy choices.\" Inmaterial I received this summer from the University of Wisconsin, itwas stated, \"public issues education refers to educational programswhich have the objective of enhancing the society's capacity to un-derstand and address issues of widespread concern.\"Materials from the same project contain a question-and-answersection that attempts to explain the difference between regular ex-tension work, public policy education, issue-based programming andpublic issues education.What silly games we play. Frankly, the people who pay my salary,the taxpayers of Kansas, either could care less or would be of-fended.What our clientele are crying out for is content, subject matter,vigorous analysis, data, statistics, theories, options and tools that willhelp them understand, formulate positions, provide answers andsolve problems while we are debating abstract concepts, definitionsand reinventing new terms that confuse. We keep talking process,process, process and the people want content, content, content. 171.174 And, as Hahn has so clearly stated on numerous occasions, it takes abalance to effectively do the job.A personal case in point. I have, for years, conducted an ongoingpolicy education program in macroeconomic policy. I just finished aseries on the Clinton budget. That budget debate desperately need-ed factual information and content. In preparation, I searched and Isearched for the factsOffice of Management and Budget, Congres-sional Budget Office, Council of Economic Advisors, U.S. Depart-ment of Treasury, Democratic Study Group, Senate Budget Com-mittee Minority Staff. Every data set I received was different. Noneagreed. Process was abundant. Accurate content was impossible toestablish. We did, however, provide factual input into the budget de-bate by using our Farm Management. Association data base andproviding our Congressional delegation of both parties estimates ofthe impact of the BTU tax on Kansas farms. They were grateful andare supportive of our extension programs.Someone once said, people have problems and universities havedepartments. We traditionalists in this business address problemsthat fit our discipline and we analyze alternatives with the tools ofeconomists when society demands much more. Another personalcase in point. Last winter I testified, along with two other agri-cultural economists, before the legislature on the Kansas corporatehog farming law. The economics of that issue are rather straight-for-ward. But, the issue is more than economics. It is social, legal andpolitical. Have we put a team together to infuse education across thespectrum into the issue? No!The question is frequently asked is the A/C model sufficient or isthat the only process tool the educator needs in the \"bag of tricks\"?No! Networking, empowerment, conflict management, all of thesetools, are making valuable contributions and perhaps it is time for ustraditionalists to learn some of these. But, I would also argue thatthe new kids on the block need to learn how to use the A/C modeland practice it. I find less and less of that and more and more exten-sion educators who want to have a \"politically correct agenda.\"Well, what is my point? Four-fold:1. We traditionalists are leaving a vacuum!2, It is time the NPPEC truly broadens its base. Extension educa-tion on public policy issues must cut across many disciplines toprovide the input citizens need, in the Jeffersonian sense, tomake informed decisions.3. There is room for family issues, national resource issues and,yes, even price and income policy for farmers. There is roomfor all of us to apply our unique expertise! The record on farmbill issues needs to be replicated on other issues. It is time forsome oxygen. Let us get with it! 172 4. What shall we call it? Public policy education, issue-based pro-gramming, public issues education? That's immaterial. REFERENCESBarrows, Richard. Public Policy Education: Key Concepts and Methods. #203. Madison.

OlexaUniversity of FloridaLong ago and far away in the imaginary land of Wal, there lived anelephant and a butterfly. One day they met, fell hopelessly in love anddecided to get married and raise a family. Realizing an obvious prob-lem or two with the match, they agreed the elephant would speak to theking in an effort to find a solution to their dilemma. Upon speaking tothe king, the elephant was promptly referred to the owl for consulta-tion. On hearing the elephant's story, the owl quickly responded withconviction. \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"Become a butterfly!\"Happy he had found a solution to the problem, the elephant returnedto the jungle only to reappear before the owl a few weeks later.\"You've given me some excellent advice,\" said the elephant. \"Buthow do I become a butterfly?\" \"That's your problem,\" said the owl. \"Ijust make policy. I don't implement it.\"As in the story, legislative solutions to environmental dilemmasfrequently seem simple at first glance. Nearly twenty-five years afterthe first sweeping environmental policy legislation, we have finallyrealized, although the solution was easy enough, putting it into prac-tice is altogether different. Like the owl in Wal, Congress onlymakes policy through legislation. Once policy is legislate d it becomesthe responsibility of the executive agencies to implement it throughregulation. My presentation today will focus on environmental policyby addressing what I see as the key environmental issues shapingthe legislative and regulatory agendas. I have been asked to provideyou with my perspective, not as a Beltway insider, but as an agri-cultural lawyer, former plant nursery operator and environmen-talist.Historical PerspectiveTo better appreciate the upcoming challenges inherent in makingand implementing environmental policy within the agricultural sec-tor, we have to look to the evolution of environmental policy. Inshort, we have to look to the past to better understand the future.As an agricultural lawyer, I believe two historical events have pro-foundly served as a foundation for modern agricultural law and havehad a significant impact on the framing of agricultural policy. These 177 events are the Great Depression and the establishment of the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA). The first event led to Con-gress's vesting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)with broad regulatory authority. The second removed some of thatauthority from USDA and gave it to the EPA. This regulatory shift in1970, brought about largely as the result of increased awareness andinterest in environmental issues, was followed by enactment of anumber of environmental laws and corresponding regulations thatconflicted with traditional agricultural practices and philosophies.This in turn fostered a \"them agin' us\" mind-set, pitting agri-culturalists against environmentalists. The agricultural communitybecame concerned about erosion of property rights and suspicious ofthe objectives of EPA's long-term regulatory agenda.This mind-set is countered by the environmental community's sus-picions that production philosophies and agriculture's quest for prof-its in the production of food and fiber overwhelmed environmentalconcerns. These opposing perspectives have been and will be re-sponsible for much of the controversy surrounding a number of envi-ronmental issues facing today's 103rd Congress.The following environmental areas are earmarked for discussionby the 103rd Congress: 1) reauthorization of the Clean Water Act(CWA), including nonpoint source pollution, citizen suits, and wet-lands; 2) endangered species; and 3) pesticides. They are of interestto the agricultural sector, of interest to me; and have been ad-dressed in several bills. Most notable among these bills is Baucus-Chafee (Senate Bill 1114), which focuses on reauthorization of theCWA. The bill, known as the \"Water Pollution Prevention and Con-trol Act of 1993,\" was introduced by Senator Baucus (D-MT), chairof the Environment and Public Works Committee, for himself andSenator Chafee (R-RI), and has widespread bipartisan support andappears to have the best chance of passage (Camia).Nonpoint Source PollutionNonpoint source (NPS) pollution is extremely difficult and costly tocontrol. Complete abatement demands rethinking and retooling tra-ditional agricultural production practices. NPS pollution has beenthe target for increasing regulatory attention over the past two dec-ades.Federal interest in NPS pollution was first extensively addressedby passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) of1972 (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251-1387). The intent of this legislation was torestore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrityof the nation's waters (Hari, pp. 14- 11). To achieve this objective,the federal government developed a strategy to end pollutionthrough the control of both point and nonpoint sources of pollution.Point sources (PS) were defined as clearly identifiable point's of dis-1 79178 't 1 charge such as pipes and concentrated animal feedlots. Nonpointsources, while not defined in the original legislation, have been de-fined to include discharge from diffuse areas such as runoff fromfarm and ranch land, mining operations and construction sites. Ini-tially, the federal government's role in pollution control focused onPS pollution. The states, in cooperation with the federal govern-ment, were responsible for overseeing NPS pollution control (Harl).Over time, federal emphasis shifted from PS to NPS control (Car-riker, p. 13). This policy shift was largely manifested with passage ofthe Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1329). The change wasdue largely to federal success in controlling PS pollution. In addi-tion, it became apparent the states had been unsuccessful in control-ling NPS pollution and increased federal participation would be nec-essary to meet targeted water quality standards (Fentress, pp.808-809).The Baucus-Chafee bill goes even farther and would vest greaterfederal oversight in controlling NPS pollution. Nonpoint sourcepollution is one of the key elements of that proposed legislation(American Farm Bureau Federation). Key Baucus-Chafee provi-sions addressing NPS pollution amend CWA sections 302 and 319.Section 304 of the Baucus-Chafee bill, \"Nonpoint Pollution Control,\"amends CWA Section 319 by calling for revision of NPS manage-ment plans. Under this revision, EPA is given significantly more con-trol over the substance and format of these plans. This is accom-plished by requiring that the EPA Administrator issue \"guidance\" inthe preparation and implementation of CWA Section 319 plans(Krause and Porterfield, p. 9).Agricultural interests see the amendment of CWA Section 302,\"Comprehensive Watershed Management,\" and not 304, as the cen-tral NPS focus of Baucus- Chafee (Krause and Porterfield, p. 7).Their belief is based, in part, on the use of comprehensive water-shed management plans as a means of \"integrating water protectionquality efforts under the Act with other natural resource protectionefforts\" (Senate Bill 1114, Sec. 321 (a)(1)(B)) and allowing forgroundwater to be identified within a watershed management area.Both provisions would expand the scope of NPS oversight.Some interests express concern with the language of Section 302of the bill addressing \"Activities of Federal Agencies.\" This new sec-tion would provide that \"each activity of a Federal agency that af-fects land use, water quality, or the natural resources with a water-shed planning unit for which a plan has been approved, be carriedout in a manner that is consistent with the policies established in theplan.\" (Senate Bill 1114, Sec. 321 (h)(2)(A)). Since EPA must ap-prove any watershed designation plan, and since federal agenciesare required to act in accordance with that plan, critics argue thisprovision could place numerous federal activities under the control 179180 of EPA. Federal activities likely to be affected would include timber,mining and other operations, issuance of permits, federal fundingand other federal activities (Krause and Porterfield, p. 9).Nonpoint source pollution control is also the focus of the CoastalZone Management Act (CZMA) pursuant to the 1990 amendment (16U.S.C. Sec. 1451 et seq.) of that act (Thunberg, p. 13). As amended,Section 6217 of the act authorizes the National Oceanic and Atmo-spheric Administration (NOAA) and the EPA to assist coastal stateswith an approved coastal zone management program to developNPS control programs (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, pp.1-4). Erosion from cropland, confined animal facilities, application ofnutrients and pesticides to cropland, grazing management andcropland irrigation have all been recognized as sources of agri-cultural NPS pollution affecting coastal waters (U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, p. 2-2). NPS pollution control under the CoastalZone Management Act has raised questions regarding regulatoryduplication between Section 319 plans under the CWA and 6217plans under the CZMA. These questions could be addressed as partof the reauthorization process for the CWA.Other questions raised by the agricultural sector regarding NPSoversight center on the lack of adequate resources necessary for ef-fective implementation and the costs to the regulated community.Agricultural producers contend market realities have not been ade-quately considered by legislators and regulators in structuring NPSprograms. They argue that because of their inability to increaseproduct prices, they cannot meet added NPS program costs and re-main in business.Environmentalists counter this argument by noting that of the esti-mated 60 percent of existing water quality violations attributable toNPS pollution, agriculture is responsible for a significant proportionof those violations (Copeland, p. CRS-5). Since agriculture is a majorpart of the problem, they argue, agriculture should play a major, partin its solution.Citizen SuitsWith the exception of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Ro-denticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. Sec. 136, et seq.), all major environ-mental laws contain citizen suit provisions. Under these provisions,when the federal government fails to act, private citizens can sue theadministering agency to comply with its statutory, non-discretionarylegislative mandates. That is, enforcement of the \"shalls\" not the\"mays\" of enacted legislation. Citizens may also sue the violator ofthe law.Citizen suits are viewed by a number of environmentalists as nec-essary and effective tools for implementing environmental policywithin the agricultural sector. Critics view these provisions as plac-1 8 1 180 ing the citizen in the role of private attorney generals. Over theyears, the CWA has been the focus of a number of citizen suits (Mil-ler, p. 8).The Baucus-Chafee bill expands the scope of the CWA's citizensuit provision (Senate Bill 1114). It does so by permitting citizens tosue for past violations. Currently, the CWA only allows suits broughtfor violations ongoing at the time of suit. While this provision isviewed favorably by environmentalists, agricultural interests see itas moving the citizen suit provision from a corrective position to apunitive one (Krause and Porterfield, p. 13). Critics of the provisionare also concerned its incorporation within the CWA will serve as atemplate for inclusion within other environmental laws such as theEndangered Species Act (ESA) (Krause and Porterfield, p. 13).WetlandsEstimates by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) place wetlandloss since the nation's settlement ai, greater than 115 million acres,with some 290,000 acres lost annually (Zinn and Copeland, p.CRS-1). Currently, no single piece of law collectively addresses wet-lands protection (Zinn and Copeland, p. CRS-1). Recently, however,separate comprehensive wetland legislation has been introduced fortie-in within Baucus-Chafee. The bill (Senate Bill 1304), known alsoas the \"Wetlands Conservation and Regulatory Improvements Act,\"is the second attempt in as many years to address wetlands protec-tion. The major provisions of the bill include improving the efficien-cy, consistency and fairness of wetlands regulations; easing federalwetlands compliance requirements for farmers and ranchers; estab-lishing a better working relationship between state and federal gov-ernments; and increasing the emphasis on wetlands protection andrestoration nationwide.This bill provides incentives for both agricultural and environmen-tal interests. In addition to simplifying agricultural compliance withwetlands protection efforts, it also exempts some 53 million acres ofpreviously converted croplands from CWA compliance (Kirby). Theincentives favored by environmentalists include making wetlandsprotection and restoration a goal of the CWA and directing federalagencies and the states to establish a \"National Wetlands Restora-tion Strategy.\"Some provisions of the bill do not fare well with either agriculturalor environmental interests. On the agricultural side, property rightsare an issue. Some argue the added costs of implementation couldresult in a \"taking\" of farm and ranch lands, in violation of Fifth andFourteenth Amendment rights (Eckel, p. 101. On the environmentalside, wetlands delineation is one issue. A number of environmentalinterests are displeased with the bill's provision calling for the use ofthe 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual. The man- 181182 ual was revised in 1989, but the revision created such confusion andcontroversy in delineating wetlands, that Congress authorized theNational Academy of Sciences to conduct a wetlands study designedto develop new delineation guidelines (Zinn and Copeland, p.CRS-4). Until that review is completed, the 1987 manual is in effect.The 1989 revision expanded the definition of wetlands, thereby in-creasing the amount of land so designated (Eckel, p. 7). Shelving the1989 revision in favor of the 1987 manual significantly reduced theamount of land designated as wetlands.Another issue in the proposed bill which has generated concernamong environmentalists is the mitigation provision. They argue thatmitigation, the replacement of wetlands in kind, allows the con-tinued destruction of wetlands (Zinn and Copeland, p. CRS-7). Thiscontention is based on the fact that the mitigation process is notbased on good science and experience which demonstrates that miti-gation failures outnumber successes.Endangered SpeciesEnvironmentalists consider the Endangered Species Act (ESA) themost important piece of legislation preventing the extinction ofplants and animals (Corn, \"Summary\"). As defined by the ESA, anendangered species is \"any species which is in danger of extinctionthroughout all or a significant portion of its range\" (16 U.S.C. Sec.1532 (6)), while a threatened species is \"any species likely to becomeendangered within the foreseeable future throughout a significantportion of its range\" (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1532 (20)).Currently, several bills have been introduced to reauthorize andamend the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Key provisions of billsproposed by Representatives Tauzin of Louisiana and Fields ofTexas are designed to provide for a five- year reauthorization; en-sure the scientific integrity of the process to list threatened and en-dangered species; ensure balanced consideration of all impacts oflisting decisions; and provide that private landowners and other non.federal parties are not compelled to comply with more stringent pro-cedures and standards than are federal agencies. The major provi-sions of a bill introduced by Senator Baucus encourage earlier, morecomprehensive species conservation; improve efforts to recover spe-cies by speeding up the development of recovery plans; and createincentives for private landowners to protect endangered species.Even with the incentives provided by these bills, opposition is ex-pected from several sectors. On the agricultural side, the issue ofproperty rights is again raised by farm and ranch concerns. They ar-gue that, amended or not, the ESA creates serious economic conse-quel. :es for agriculture, with insufficient compensation provided toproperty owners by the government (Corn, \"Summary\"). Support-ers of reauthorization favor strengthening the ESA through in- 182183 creased funding and accelerating the recovery of listed species forwhich no action has been taken (Kip linger Agriculture Letter).ESA reauthorization will be a challenge for the 103rd Congress.Field issues related to such endangered species as the NorthernSpotted Owl have deeply polarized many factions subject to the actand have, in turn, generated considerable debate about the act's fu-ture. Reauthorized or not, Congress will probably appropriate thefunds necessary for continued implementation of the current law(Corn, p. CRS-2).PesticidesNo one environmental policy issue surfaces with such consistentregularity as that of pesticides. Issues related to pesticide use andimpact weave through nearly every major piece of environmentallegislation. Some of these issues include ground and surface watercontamination, endangered species, food safety, hazardous wastedisposal and cleanup.Once again, pesticides have dominated the popular press with therecent National Academy of Sciences Study, \"Pesticides in the DietOf Infants and Children.\" The study was designed to determine\"whether there are adequate protections for infants and children inthe pesticide risk assessment process\" (Chemically Speaking, July,1993, p. 1). The conclusion was that the risk assessment processneeds improvement, specifically in the form of better data (Chem-ically Speaking, July, 1993, p. 2). EPA Administrator Browner re-sponded by calling for more pesticide regulatory oversight. What fol-lows are two pesticide issues currently under consideration byCongress. They are food safety and minor use registration.Food SafetyA number of scientists and public health officialsagree that microbial contamination of foods, not pesticides, pose thegreatest food safety threat to the public (Vogt, p. CRS-6). The publicsees it differently. In one study, 79 percent of consumers surveyedsee pesticides as the most serious food health threat (Vogt, p.CRS-3). The pesticide-food safety issue has recently surfaced in thecourts, prompting EPA and Congressional action (Chemically Speak-ing, Feb. 1993).The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ruled theEPA must adhere to Delaney Clause provisions of the Federal FoodDrug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (7 U.S.C. Sec. 138 et seq.). TheDelaney Clause, also referred to as the Food Additive Amendmentof 1958, is found in Section 409 of the FFDCA. Delaney sets a zerorisk standard for carcinogenic residues. Under the ruling, the EPAcan no longer allow carcinogenic pesticic 's to accumulate in proc-essed foods (Pesticide & Toxic Chemical News, June, 1993). Foryears, the EPA interpreted Delaney as containing an exception for 183 pesticides posing a trivial or de minimis risk (Chemically Speaking,July, 1992, p. 1).The Ninth Circuit Court's action is of significant interest to agri-cultural producers. Of the 300 pesticides registered for application tofoods, some 67 have been found to induce cancer in laboratory stud-ies (Chemical RegUlation Reporter, July 10, 1992). The EPA acknowl-edges that some 35 chemicals and a number of uses will be impactedby the Ninth Circuit's ruling (Chemical Regulation Reporter, July 10,1992).Supporters of Congressional moves to change Delaney argue theEPA is being forced to adhere to a law based on 1950s technology.When implemented in 1958, residues could not be detected withthen-existing technology. Now, however, science has advanced tothe point at which residues can be detected at concentrations of onepart per billion. This is equivalent to a pinch of salt in 10,000 tons ofpotato chips (Nesheim). There is no way, producers argue, that acrop could be produced without any residues being detected in theprocessed product. Strict adherence to the Delaney standard wouldbe devastating. Opponents counter that Delaney should be strictlyenforced. To not do so would jeopardize public health.Members of Congress have introduced several bills proposingchanges in the application of Delaney. These bills generally providefor a \"negligible risk\" standard in establishing tolerances for bothraw and processed commodities (Vogt, p. CRS-3). Under Section 408of the FFDCA, the EPA is allowed to weigh the benefits of pesticideuse and set less stringent tolerances for carcinogenic residues onraw agricultural commodities. Subsequently, EPA has pursued apolicy of setting different standards for carcinogenic pesticide resi-dues in processed and raw foods (Chemical Regulation Reporter,July 10, 1992). The emphasis of the currently proposed bills appearsto be that of setting identical standards for both raw and processedcommodities. Because of the health and production arguments forand against Congressional action on Delaney, this is one environ-mental issue with little if any ground for compromise.Minor-Use Pesticide Registration In general, all pesticides mustbe registered by EPA. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Ro-denticide Act (FIFRA), together with rules promulgated by EPA setforth the requirements for pesticide registration (USDA EconomicResearch Service, p. 37). These requirements are quite complex andneed not be elaborated on here other than to point out that EPA willnot register a pesticide unless it is satisfied its use, as specified bythe label, will not cause undue harm to humans or the environment.Pesticides must be reregistered periodically and EPA must make thesame kind of judgment on a reregistration that it does on an originalregistration. Registration is the cornerstone of FIFRA and is costly. 48 5184 Minor-use pesticides are de...ned as low-volume, low-profitpesticides applied to a variety of crops such as vegetahies, fruits, or-namentals, nuts and other specialty crops (Chemical Regulation Re-porter, March 6, 1992). These pesticides do not provide sufficienteconomic incentive to support reregistration and many manufactur-ers are refusing to reregister them (Chemical Regulation Reporter,March 6, 1992). Agricultural interests are concerned that losing theuse of these products will prohibit the production of numerous minorcrops and devastate producers in the process. The revenues gener-ated from the sale of minor-use crops are substantial. EPA estimatesthat of the $70 billion in agricultural sales in 1990, minor crop salesaccounted for some $30 billion (Chemical Regulation Reporter, June11, 1993). Some states, such as Florida, would be devastated by suchlosses since all crops grown in Florida, including citrus, are minorcrops.To address agricultural concerns, the federal government has en-couraged the retention of minor-use pesticides by establishing theongoing USDA administered \"IR-4\" program. This program enablesthe USDA to assist in collecting data for the support of minor-useproducts (Womach, p. CRS-4). The end result aids in defraying re-registration costs for minor-use registrants.A coalition of farmers and farm organizations known as the\"Minor Crop Farm Alliance\" (MCFA), has successfully initiated leg-islation known as the \"Minor Crop Pesticide Crop Protection Act of1993\" (Womach p. CRS-4). Sponsored by Representative de la Garza(D-TX) in the House and Senator Inouye (D-HI) in the Senate, thebill provides a series of incentives for registrants. One such incentivespeeds up the registration process (Womach, p. CRS-4). Chance ofpassage looks good for several reasons. First, crop protection alter-natives are not being developed quickly enough to mitigate the lossof minor-use products. Second, the loss of minor-use products mayresult in the use of less environmentally friendly pesticides and in-creasing off-label uses. Finally, minor-use pesticides can play a ben-eficial role in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs.Pesticide Reduction: A Policy Alternative?The Clinton administration appears committed to FIFRA reformand, according to Administrator Browner, will demonstrate thatcommitment in the fall of 1993 (Pesticide & Toxic Chemical News,July 14, 1993, p. 18). Currently, pesticide use is a necessary activityfor crop production. Nevertheless, this activity has, and will con-tinue to have, detrimental impacts on the environment. This is clear-ly reflected in the number of environmental laws and correspondingregulations addressing pesticide use and impact. To reduce thenegative impacts, there must ultimately be a reduction in pesticideuse. 18518 6 =1.Lowering the grade standards for fruits and vegetables has beensuggested as one approach to reducing the amount of pesticide usein agriculture. This approach is based on the premise that ,.ianypesticides are used to meet the cosmetic requirements of the gradestandards. This premise has recently been the subject of an EPAstudy conducted by Leonard Gianessi,- a fellow with Resources forthe Future (Pesticide & Toxic Chemical News, Nov. 4, 1992). In hisstudy, Gianessi concluded most producers use pesticides to controlpest problems, not for the cosmetic benefit fostered by the federalgrade standards. He concludes changing-the standards to permitmore surface damage would not significantly decrease the amount ofpesticide use on fruits and vegetables.Nevertheless, critics of the standards still contend that because ofthe standards, growers are required to apply more pesticides.Gianessi notes federal standards \"already have significant allow-ances for surface damage.\" While the EPA study proves a credibleargument, questions still remain regarding the efficacy of loweringthe standards. Gianessi also notes that policymakers need to decide\"to what extent they want to continue funding research, or doingconsumer surveys . ..\" He adds that policymakers \"must decidewhether the administrative costs of changing the standards areworth it.\"Extension Opportunitiesin closing, I have some additional comments about the educationalopportunities the environmental regulatory agenda holds for exten-sion. Because of environmental law and regulation, the level ofknowledge of law that served our parents only a few decades ago isinadequate today. People in agriculture have reached a point atwhich knowing environmental law is just as important in the suc-cessful management of an agricultural operation as knowing busi-ness law and economics. Here lies the challenge and the opportunityfor extension.The extension network can provide the balanced education neces-sary for its clientele to effectively and responsibly operate within thisimposing body of environmental law and regulation and the pol-icymaking process. I am not advocating the training of lay lawyers. Iam advocating education designed to meet the challenges inherentin implementing a policy that is acceptable to both agricultural andenvironmental interests.

Of all agricultural seg-ments, fruits and vegetables are being the most profoundly affectedby policy changes mandated by the courts requiring interpretation ofthe zero tolerance provisions of the Delaney clause. Ironically, eco-nomic research on the tradeoffs involved in reduced pesticide use isseriously lacking.Most studies of the implications of reduced pesticide use deal withthe implications of taking an individual chemical off the market. Thisorientation results from the requirement under the Federal Insec-ticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) that the costs of li-censing a pesticide be weighed against the benefits. The major ben-efit from pesticide use is the increased yield experienced by farmers,the improved ability to store produce, and the increased availabilityof domestic products to consumers throughout the year. The costsrelate to environmental concerns such as the impact on health. Forexample, a recent National Academy of Science study explores theimpacts that pesticide residues have on infants and children (Na-tional Academy of Sciences, 1993).To date, for most individual pesticides there are substitutepesticides that can be used when and if they are withdrawn from themarket. Therefore, the withdrawal of a pesticide has not, as a gen-eral rule, meant the product could not be produced or could only beproduced in the absence of a means of controlling particular pests.However, after years of winnowing down the number of pesticidesregistered, questions of the availability of any chemicals to controlparticular pests have become more real. Significant forces impactingthe registration and availability of pesticides could converge duringthis decade to bring seeds of change that will likely affect Americanagriculture and the nation's food supply for years to come. Theseforces include the following:All pesticides registered before 1984 should be reregistered by1997, holding the potential for eliminating use of many pesticidesthat control pests and disease on fruits and vegetables. 1 8 9188 FIFRA, under which cost/benefit standards and requirements forthe registration of pesticides are established, must be reauthorized.The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision enforcing a zero-toler-ance Delaney standard of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct for processed foods must be rationalized against the reducedsupply and availability of fruits and vegetables resulting from strictapplication of Delaney. The Clinton administration has proposed anegligible risk alternative.The Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, both of whichcan affect the use of pesticides generally or on specific lands, mustbe reauthorized.The results of studies such as that of the National Academy of Sci-ences, which express caution about diet as an important source ofpesticides (particularly in infants and children), must be reconciledby finding a satisfactory balance between the level of risk and thepublic's need for a varied diet and a plentiful supply of fresh fruitsand vegetables.Objective'and MethodologyThe objective of this study is to quantify the supply, availabilityand cost conc-_-,quences of reduced pesticide use on fruit and vegeta-ble crop.. the nine crops analyzed include potatoes, oranges, toma-toes, grapes, apples, lettuce, onions, sweet corn and peaches. Thesecrops represent approximately 82 percent of the 1992 value of U. S.production for major fruit and vegetable crops.The yield estimates used in this analysis were provided by leadinguniversity horticultural scientists in the major production areas (atotal of 19 regions) associated with each crop. Each horticultural sci-entist specified current cultural practices as a baseline and indicatedchanges in cultural practices associated with each individualpesticide-use-reduction option. These cultural practices could, forexample, include increased use of labor to control weeds or sortingout inferior quality products unacceptable to the market, but weredesigned to minimize the yield losses.The cost impacts generally were estimated by a separate hor-ticultural economist using the yield and cultural practice informationprovided by the horticultural scientist. The economist was responsi-ble for developing the baseline budget reflecting cultural practicescurrently used in commercial production of the crop.This baseline budget only included the cash costs involved in pro-ducing and harvesting a crop. The baseline budget was then ad-justed for each pesticide-reduction scenario to account for thechanges in cultural practices specified by the horticulturist makingthe yield estimates. Impacts, on a cash cost per pound basis, could 181. then be calculated from the yield- and cost-per-acre information foreach reduced-chemical-use scenario. This cash cost per pound ofcommercially acceptable production is a conservative estimate of thechanges in total cost since it does not recognize any increases inoverhead, management or capital replacement costs that would beassociated with reduced pesticide use.The specific scenarios analyzed for each crop included eightpesticide-use-reduction alternatives in addition to the baseline. Fourof these scenarios involved complete elimination of the following:Pesticides, including the combination of herbicides, insecticidesand fungicides.Herbicides, including growth regulators.Fungicides, including fumigants.Insecticides, including natural, synthetic, biological and chemicalmethods of control.Each of these four scenarios was then modified to involve an ap-proximate 50 percent reduction in the number of pesticide applica-tions. Because of the choices that had to be made by the lead scien-tist in accomplishing the 50 percent reduction, the 50 percent targetis only an approximation. If only one application of a particularpesticide was used in the baseline, for example, this option wouldnot be applicable (NA) unless the lead scientist specified an alter-native means that would reasonably accomplish a 50 percent reduc-tion.Overall ResultsThe yield and cost impacts generally were substantial but highlyvariable among regions and crops. The fresh market tended to expe-rience larger yield reductions than the processed market. If the goalof public policy were to reduce pesticide applications by 50 percent,for example, average yields would be expected to fall by about 20percent for processing vegetables and 42 percent for fresh vegeta-bles. If pesticide applications were eliminated, fresh vegetable yieldswould experience a 76 percent decline, while processed vegetableyields would decrease 45 percent. Fresh vegetables, therefore,would suffer the greatest yield reduction in the first 50 percentreduction in pesticide use. For processed vegetables, the greateryield reductions would lean marginally toward the second 50 percentreduction in pesticide applications.The vegetable generalizations appear to apply only partially in thecase of fruits. Fruits produced for the fresh market would experi-ence greater yield reductions (79 percent) in the absence ofpesticides than those produced for the processed market (68 per-cent). When pesticide applications are reduced by 50 percent, yields 91190 of fresh fruit decline by 40 percent while those for processed fruitdecline by 35 percent. Thus, severity of yield losses for fruits wouldtend to be split between the first and second 50 percent cut inpesticide use rather than favor one or the other. In other words, theyield reduction \"curve\" could be concave, convex or linear depend-ing on the pesticide option.Sweeping pesticide-use reduction involving more than onepesticide category would have more adverse (synergistic) impacts onyield than strategies targeted toward particular pesticides. Stateddifferently, pesticide-reduction strategies that simultaneously de-crease the use of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides would havemore adverse impacts onyields because fungi and insects wouldtend to be more prolific in the presence of weeds.Issues Impacting ProfitabilityThis study clearly reveals several complex issues impacting prof-itability of fruit and vegetable production that would be associatedwith the decision to reduce pesticide use. In some cases, such asyields and costs, it is possible to estimate the magnitude of thosetrade-offs. In other cases, the trade-offs can only be identified asbeing an important and substantial consideration in the decision toreduce pesticide use. Some of these trade-offs apply to all cropswhile others appear to be crop specific.Marketable YieldsAs indicated previously, reduced pesticide use would mean lowercommercially marketable yields and this would affect fresh marketproducts to a greater degree than processed products. For all thecrops and regions analyzed in this study combined, the weightedaverage yield reduction would be an estimated 70 percent with nopesticides and 37 percent with a 50 percent reduction in applications.Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the reductions in yield associated with eachindividual fruit and vegetable crop when weighted by the value andsales that the study regions represented.The amount of yield reduction would vary, however, by crop,pesticide and combinations of pesticides (Table 1). For example, six-teen (11 percent) of the one hundred and fifty-two total pesticide-reduction scenarios (nineteen regions with eight scenarios each)would result in total crop wipeout (100 percent crop loss). That is, nocrop (NC) would beproduced without the use of a particularpesticide. Additionally, there were six other scenarios in which thereductions in yield were estimated to be 70 percent or greater.Among those crops and regions most adversely affected were Mainepotatoes, California grapes, Florida tomatoes, Washington and Mich-igan apples, Florida sweet corn and Georgia/South Carolinapeaches. For these crops, the impacts are greater in cases in which 191192 III111/ ANVV'ery,4...0: P+./M.4... I. Figure 2. Reduction in Yield Resulting From No Pesticides and a 50 PercentReduction in Pesticide Applications for Fruits.**0% represent weighted average by the value of producer sales forthe states included in the study. In the cases where only one application pre-vented a 50% use scenario, the yield reduction was approximated at 50% of thezero use impact. 193194 Table 1.

For example. in twenty-four scenarios,the impact on marketable yield was estimated to be 10 percent orless. However, all but eight of these scenarios dealt with 50 percentreductions in applications. In other words, there were only a handfulof crops in which the total elimination of a particular pesticide re-sulted in less than 10 percent yield reduction. TII.se cases included:a) the application of herbicides on Florida oranges, Florida sweetcorn and California peaches; b) the application of fungicides on Cal- ifornia tomatoes and Washington apples; and c) the use of insec-ticides on California oranges, New York grapes and Californiaonions.CostsPer unit costs of production would increase if pesticide use werereduced (Table 1). This would happen even if the cost of productionper acre were to fall because the yield invariably would fall by agreater percentage than the cost per acre. In many cases, however,the cost per acre also would rise because of increases in , titivationand/or labor costs. There were seventeen scenarios in which the es-timated cash costs per pound more than doubled from the reductionin pesticide use. Another seven cases were estimated to result in perpound cost increase of 80 percent or higher. The existence of higherunit costs with less use of pesticides seems reasonable since farmerswould never have adopted pesticides in the first place without a costbenefit.Prices/ImportsBecause a large number of growers compete in markets for fruitsand vegetables, they do not have the power to \"pass on\" increasesin cost. Over time, however, less production and higher costs wouldmean higher prices. In the long run, the price increase would be atleast as much as the cost increase. In the short run, the price in-crease might be much more than the cost increase because the de-mand for fruits and vegetables is believed to be quite inelastic,which means that a small percentage reduction in supply would re-sult in a larger percentage increase in price.However, the price effect depends on U.S. policy regarding im-ports. Higher prices in the United States combined with the periodiclack of supplies due to reduced pesticide use would also mean ahigher proportion of the U.S. fruit and vegetable supply would haveto be imported in order to meet current consumer demand, particu-larly for those crops in which a total crop wipeout (100 percent loss)was estimated to occur. All of the crops studied have viable alter- 195196 native sources of supply. In addition, the United States has little con-trol over pesticide use in the supplying countries.Product Appearance, Quality, and PerishabilityMost consumers will not buy corn or apples if worms or maggotsare present in them. Even if some purchases were to be made,waste and spoilage would increase as perishability increased andproduct turnover in the grocery store declined. Spoilage means evenhigher costs.Likewise, processed products have less appeal with increased in-sect parts and greater potential spoilage. Processed product toler-ances for insect parts would almost certainly have to be increasedwith substantially reduced pesticide use. Costs of processing wouldlikewise rise as processing plants attempted to maintain qualitythrough increased product sorting.ExportsHigher prices in the United States due to reduced pesticide usewould suggest a marked reduction in U.S. ability to compete in theinternational fruit and vegetable market. Several of the lead hor-ticultural scientists and economists mentioned the inevitable loss ofexport markets as a result of lower pesticide use. This loss of mar-kets would not only be a result of the lack of competitiveness on thebasis of price and cost but also a result of rejection by customercountries because of increased insect parts in either fresh or proc-essed products. The countries that buy our fruits and vegetableshave phytosanitary regulations-that prevent lower-quality productsfrom entering.LaborAlthough the reduced use of pesticides would contribute to a na-tional goal of employing more labor, the labor supply required togrow crops without pesticides may not be readily available underany circumstances. History has shown that it is difficult to attract la-bor to agriculture.Production without pesticides would reduce the use of mechanicalha. ,esting equipment due to reduced product quality. If productssuu., AS tomatoes or sweet corn were damaged and softened by in-sect infestation, further damage by mechanical harvesting wouldrender the product unusable. In the absence of an adequate laborsupply, the result could be even lower yields of marketable cropsthan those indicated in this study. 197196 Land and Water UtilizationIt is well-known, but not generally recognized, that pesticides areresource-conserving. About 5.83 million acres of land is being usedfor fruit and vegetable production in the United States. Becausepesticide use results in higher yields,- less land is required for farm-ing.Based on the results of this study, however, land requirementscould easily increase by 40 to 50 percent if pesticide use were elimi-nated. These additional acres would be required to meet market de-mands, but the acreage would have to come from land devoted toother crops or from more fragile lands not in production.If more land were placed in production, more water would be re-quired for irrigation, particularly if the loss of herbicides allowedweeds to compete with crops for water. More .weeds also wouldmean more rodents, a pest notorious for spreading disease. Withmore weeds in the fields, growers would be forced to use morecultivation to control weed growth, and more cultivation wouldmean more soil erosion.Management and Size of FarmsThis study assumes management is a fixed expense. Although con-siderable management skills are employed when pesticides are usedon a regular basis, greater management skills and time would be re-quired if the level of pesticide use were to decline. In other words,pesticide use reduces the requirements for one of agriculture's mostscarce resourcesmanagement skill.If pesticide use were to decline and growers were faced with lowyields, farm size probably would increase as growers tried to meetmarket demands by farming more acreage. Few farm managerswould have the required management skills to farm under reducedchemical systems. This scenario is contrary to conventional wisdom,which maintains that reduced pesticide use would mean a return tosmall farms.Implications for Policy DecisionsBecause of the, large yield reductions generally experienced andrelated cost increases, and the potential for imports, it becomes clearthat farm profitability is directly impacted. The magnitude of that im-pact depends on, more than anything else, on the policy toward im-ports.This study follows an earlier study (Knutson, et al., and Smithet.al.) that used similar methodology to evaluate the impact of198197 pesticide use reduction on the major program crops. Although theresults for fruits and vegetables are similar to the program cropstudy, they are more dramatic in that some fruit or vegetable cropswould be completely wiped out in certain regions as a result of theabsence of pesticides. Of course, this would not only have severeshort-run effects on individual farm profitability and survival, butwould also impact the long-run competitiveness of the produce in-dustry.The major difference between this study and the earlier study isthe inclusion of a 50 percent pesticide-reduction option for fruits andvegetables. The results suggest that a substantial variation existsfrom crop-to-crop regarding whether the largest incidence of yieldreduction would occur in the first 50 percent decrease or in the final50 percent. There are situations in which the 50 percent reduction:would be possible for some crops in some regions, but broad sweep-ing legislation would not achieve this goal with being detrimental toother major production regions.The need to proceed with caution on policies involving the elim-ination or substantial reduction of pesticides was a primary emphasisin the earlier study of major program crops. This emphasis is evenmore important in a study of fruits and vegetables because thenumber of pesticide options is often very limited and the potentialyield reductions are large and sometimes even dramatic.Further research and technological innovations will be requiredbefore significant reductions in pesticide use will be possible withoutsubstantial yield reductions and large cash cost increases. The na-tion's policymakers will likely want to consider all economic, envi-ronmental, nutritional and social tradeoffs as they consider pesticidepolicy changes that will impact every link of America's food chain foryears to come.

MillerTexas A&M UniversityWith the initiation of dairy waste regulatory activity in Texas andFlorida during the early 1990s, questions have arisen regarding theimpacts of these regulations if extended throughout the UnitedStates. The Agricultural and Food Policy Center (AFPC) system ofrepresentative dairy farms provided a unique opportunity to evalu-ate the impacts of these regulations on dairy farm profitability if ex-tended to all other states.EPA Dairy Waste PolicyWith the exception of concentrated animal feeding operations(CAFOs), agriculture has been treated as a nonpoint source of pollu-tion. Nonpoint pollution means there is no legally recognized identi-fiable source of that pollution. Point pollution, on the other hand,can best be illustrated by an industrial plant or a sewer system thatdrains directly into a river or stream, leaving no question regardingthe source of that pollution. The requirement has been that suchpoint sources of pollution internalize the cost of cleaning up the dis-charge except under extremely unusual and basically uncontrollablecircumstances. Such point sources of pollution must receive a permitexplaining measures taken to prevent illegal discharges.Concentrated animal feeding operations have been identified as apoint pollution source because, in the eyes of the regulatory au-thorities, they are much like a factory. The issue becomes one of de-fining a CAFO. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cur-rently requires a discharge permit for any dairy having more than700 cows. The permit will be issued if the dairy farmer demonstrateshe or she has taken steps to contain pollutants and prevent dis-charges up to a twenty-five-year/twenty-four-hour storm event. Ifthere is already an identifiable direct discharge, the threshold for re-ceiving a permit may extend to 200 cows or even less, if a complaintis received by the EPA. The requirements for receiving a permit aremore stringent for new operations than they arc for existing opera-tions.In most states, EPA regulations are enforced by state environmen-tal regulatory agencies under what is called delegated authority(Table 1). The requirement for a state to receive delegated authority i44400 4 Table 1. Delegated and Nondelegated EPA Regulated States, by EPA Region.EPA Region Delegated NondelegatedICT, RI, VT MA.

The twelve states and the District of Columbia that do not have delegated authority experience a considerably higher level of EPA supervision and involvement even though they may have a state level counterpart to the federal EPA. Texas and Florida are both non-delegated states which, to a degree, contributed to these states becoming \"test cases\" in the establishment of EPA dairywaste regulatory policy.The authors completed a survey of state environmental protection agencies to determine their regulatory strategy regarding the dairy waste issue. This survey found substantial variation among states in enforcement strategy regarding dairy waste. Some states inter- preted the spirit of the EPA policy as being one of no discharge ex- cept under extreme circumstances. Thus, Minnesota, in an effort to protect its 10,000 lakes from pollution, has adopted a seven-cow threshold for the receipt of permits by dairy farmers. On the other hand, Wisconsin, Iowa and Vermont interpret the. EPA 700-cow pol- icy literally. That is, with no dairies having more than 700 cows at the time of the survey, they had issued no permits.The EPA regional offices indicated to the authors an intent to move in the direction of using the evolving Region VI policy as the standard for controlling dairy waste. This would require all dairies to develop a waste management plan that meets the twenty-five-year-storm-event criterion. In addition, dairies would be required to keep records on handling and discharging dairy wastes.Costs of Meeting EPA Regulations in Texas and FloridaCoincidentally, the AFPC representative dairy farms in Texas andFlorida were developed before the EPA policies on dairy waste management were implemented. Recently, these farms have beenupdated after the farms had been renovated and retrofitted to meet the new EPA standards. This provided a perfect environment for 201200 --a.'gr determining a before/after context in the costs of meeting the EPAregulations. The findings are presented in Table 2. Part of the farm-to-farm variation in costs is reflected in the extent to which the farmshad already dealt with the waste management issue. The $528,000investment required of the large Florida dairy (FLLD) was the resultof the unique conditions and requirements to curb the contaminationof fragile waters related to the Everglades.Using the FLIPSIM policy simulation model developed by JamesRichardson at Texas A&M, the authors simulated the impacts of thenew, more stringent EPA policies on the profitability of Texas andFlorida representative farms (Table 3). In this table, Base representsthe baseline net costs income prior to retrofitting for the EPA pol-icies while Enviro indicates the results afterretrofitting. These results indicate that dairy farms having cash flowproblems are simply put out of business sooner as a result of the newEPA requirements. On the other hand, the larger profitable EastTexas dairy (TXEL) and the Central Texas dairy (TXCL) were suffi-ciently profitable to pay off the amortized debt resulting from thenew investments.While the moderate-size Florida dairy (FLMD) reflects the samepattern of results as the Texas dairies of comparable size, the largeFlorida dairy (FLLD) represents a case in which the EPA invest-ment requirements were so large that its ability to cash flow isplaced in jeopardy. This was the only case in which a large andotherwise profitable dairy is projected to encounter cash flow prob-lems due solely to the EPA regulations. This result, in part, is a con-sequence of the large investments required ($528,000) to build the\"unique waste containment structures. Table 2.

BEST COPY AVAILABLEr)4034 Extension to Dairies in Other StatesIn an effort to help Texas dairies assess their investment require-ments for meeting EPA Region VI standards, Lacewell and Schwartdeveloped a model designed to estimate the costs of meeting theEPA standards under alternative animal concentration, soil andrainfall conditions. This model was used to estimate the costs ofmeeting the more stringent EPA standards for AFPC representativedairy farms in other regions (Table 4). These cost estimates shouldbe treated as rough approximations since labor and machinery costsin other states may be outside the range used to develop the Texasmodel. The investment requirements ranged from slightly more than$21,000 for the 50-cow Wisconsin dairy ($10,581 + $10,518for WIMD)to nearly $42,000 for the 186-cow Vermont dairy.Of substantial significance is the requirement that approximatelyevery five years, solids had to be cleaned out of the lagoon at a lumpsumscost ranging from nearly $600for the moderate-size Missouridairy (MOMD) to more than $17,000 for the large Vermont dairy.This periodic cost could become a significant factor in farm pros-perity and survival.Table5presents the net cash income simulation results for thedairies on which investment and cost requirements were made as in-dicated in Table 4. These results generally indicate that dairies hav-ing no problems cash flowing before retrofitting to meet the EPA.,tandards will be able to pay off the resulting costs without encoun-tering financial problems. However, dairies that are already havingproblems cash flowing, such as the Vermont dairies, will experienceeven greater problems. For dairies experiencing cash flow prob-lems, the EPA regulations could be the decisive factor resulting inan exit decision.ImplicationsEPA regulations are often criticized by farmers and their organi-zations as being unrealistic and as creating havoc on the farm. Thisanalysis suggests that this criticism may not be true for the vast ma-jority of dairies that are currently relatively profitable. However, if adairy is already experiencing cash flow problems, compliance withEPA reguh ions could push this farm over the brink into financialfailure. Suci t farmers would probably find it desirable to minimizetheir losses and exit the dairy industry.Dairy farmers that are bringing their farms into compliance withthe new EPA standards could find it desirable to expand their dairyoperations simultaneously. Such expansion may involve conversionto different farm structures such as free stall confinement housing ona concrete slab. The related investments are substantially largerthan those estimated in this study for simply meeting the EPA stand-ards on an existing operation. Such large investments may lead to 203204 Table 4.

In particular. EPA waste handling requirementscould be one of the factors that lead to structural change in both thehog industry and the demise of the few farmer-feeders of beef cattlethat remain.

As a result, U.S. agriculture could experi-ence even more rapid structural change. 2 0 7206 ENVIRONMENTAL POLICYAND NATURAL-RESOURCE-BASEDECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTTim PhippsWest Virginia UniversityEnvironmental policy is designed to restrict and channel our usesof the environment in ways that protect environmental quality. Assuch, environmental policies often conflict with resource develop-ment when that development requires the use of environmentalassets. It is artificial, though, to look solely at the effects of environ-mental policies on resource development. There are also importantnatural resource and other (such as tax) policies that, in some cases.encourage resource development and, in 'other cases, help conserveor preserve those resources The net policy impact on resource de-velopment depends on the net effects of incentives and disincentivesprovided by environmental and natural resource policies.Natural-Resource-Based Economic DevelopmentFirst, it is important to define natural resource development. Isdevelopment defined as extraction and use as in the case of fossilfuels? Is development harvest and sale of a resource such as fish ortimber? Or is development the preservation of a unique natural arealike Yosemite National Park that annually attracts millions of visitorsand makes a large contribution to the regional and national econo-mies? The latter case would normally be called preservation, not de-velopment. However, if our criterion is economic development thatis based on natural resources, the preservation of Yosemite is clearlyone form of economic development of the resource that can be com-pared to other forms of economic development, such as harvest ofthe timber in the valley or use of the valley floor for cattle grazing.The traditional classification of natural resources into exhaustibleand renewable may help in understanding the meaning of develop-ment. Exhaustible resources include fossil fuels and minerals. The fundamental characteristic of an exhaustible resource is that itssupply is fixed in the physical sense at any point in time, and newsupplies cannot be created. Exhaustible resources can be furthercharacterized by whether they arc recyclable. Fossil fuels are usedup when they are burned, but many of the products of fossil fuels,such as lubricating oils, can be partially recycled. Many mineralsmay also be partially recycled. While exhaustible resources are fixed 207208 in physical supply, economic supply depends on market price andtechnology.Renewable resources are perhaps more important to the futureeconomic development of most regions. Like exhaustible resources,renewable resources have a fixed supply at any point in time. Thedifference is that if renewable resources are used in a sustainablefashion, they will replenish their supply. Current use, then, does notnecessarily reduce future supply.Some resources may be renewable for certain uses and exhausti-ble for others. This is particularly the case if some uses of the re-source cause irreversible damages. Hiking in a forest is a renewableuse of the forest as long as hiking pressure does not lead to gullyingof the trail and consequent irreversible damage. However, off-roadvehicle use on wetlands can and does cause irreparable damage t.)the wetland ecology and is incompatible with other uses such as hik-ing or provision of wildlife habiiat.Finally, a given use of natural resources may be considered asrenewable by some people and as destructive by others. Limitedlogging of old-growth forests may be seen as a way to increase thetimber growth and production while still preserving the forest (Sed-jo). Others regard such logging as utterly incompatible with the eco-logical, scenic and, indeed, ethical values provided by old-growthforests.Natural Resource and Environmental PoliciesThe policy debate over environmental and resource issues hasbroadened over time. Environmental policies are no longer solitaryissues to be dealt with separately from development policies. Envi-ronmental policy 'is at the center of many of our most important so-cial debates. Second, everything is related to everything else. In-creased water quality restrictions may hurt one industry butincrease recreation and tourism. All environmental policy decisionsinvolve difficult tradeoffs.Environmental Policy and Economic DevelopmentA number of studies have attempted to gauge the overall impact ofenvironmental regulations on the U.S. economy. Portney summa-rizes those studies as finding \" ... pollution control spending had a relatively minor impact on macroeconomic performance. It has exac-erbated inflation somewhat and slowed the growth rate of productiv-ity and the GNP. On the other hand, studies have found that pollu-tion control spending appears to have provided some very modeststimulus to employment ...\" (p. 11). This is somewhat surprising,given that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimatedtotal private spending to comply with environmental regulationsfrom 1981 to 1990 to be $640 billion (Portney).209208 .While studies have found that environmental policies have not hada major impact on economicgrowth in the aggregate economy, thatis not necessarily the case when you look at specific sectors, particu-larly the natural resource sectors, such as mining, forestry, fisheriesand recreation.MiningThe story for mining is perhaps the simplest of the four natural re-source industries. While mining is a complex industry geograph-ically, the products produced by mining tend to be purely marketgoods that have value only in their use. Few people would plan theirvacations around visits to pristine iron ore deposits as they might tovisit a redwood forest. The policy complications for ,pining involveexternalities that are created during the mining process, such as de-struction of the landscape, air and water pollution, and environmen-tal problems associated with processing and use. The social and pol-icy choice for mining is to balance the economic value of theproduct, including the regional economic contributions made by ex-traction and use, with the environmental costs of extraction and use.As an example of the policy trade-offs involved in mining, theClean Air Act of 1990 has significantly strengthened regulation ofemissions of sulfur dioxide to reduce acid precipitation. Because coalsupplies approximately 40 to 70 percent of man-made sources of sul-fur dioxide (James) the coal industry will be affected by the legisla-tion.The Clean Air Act of 1990 promises to reduce acid precipitation byone half, with much of the reduction coming from tightened re-strictions on emissions of sulfur dioxide (Htinter). Electric utilitieshave a number of compliance options under the new regulations:switch to low sulfur coal; install scrubbers that remove sulfur fromthe flue gasses; switch to fluidized bed or other advanced and lowpolluting technologies; buy pollution rights; or switch to other fuels.All share one common attribute in addition to reducing pollution:they increase the costs of electricity production and raise its price toconsumers while reducing the country's economic growth some-what. The options are quite different, however, in their regional de-velopment effects. A switch to low sulfur coal will favor western coalproducers who produce a lower BTU but much cleaner Coal thantheir Eastern counterparts. The impact will be felt differentially inthe East as well. For example, the southern part of West Virginiaproduces a high BTU coal that is relatively low in sulfur. That sec-tion of the state could benefit from the Clean Air Act. Producers inareas that only have high sulfur coal, such as northern West Vir-ginia, Western Pennsylvania and parts of Kentucky and Ohio willclearly be hurt by the switch to low sulfur coal. One study estimatesthe Clean Air Act of 1990 will result in the loss of 2,000 jobs in north- 209210 ern West Virginia while the southern part of the state will gain about4,500 jobs (Hunter).ForestryForestry is a more complex natural resource industry than mining.Forests supply a number of marketed products and services such astimber that make a direct contribution to the economy. But thestanding forest itself produces economic and other values, such asprovision of wildlife habitat, watershed protection, erosion controland recreation generally not sold in markets, though they contributeindirectly either to the economy or to the quality of life in a region.The major issues that involve forest development policy in theUnited States, currently and in the future, are environmental ones.The three most important are acid precipitation and ozone damage;endangered species and the preservation of biodiversity; and globalwarming.The Endangered Species Act is probably the most controversialenvironmental program that affects forestry, particularly in the Pa-cific Northwest where timber companies are pitted against environ-mentalists over the fate of the remaining old growth forests. Whilethe spotted owl has been the focus of the debate, it is really a minoraaor in the overall policy issue. The primary issue is one of preserv-ing habitat, species diversity and the old growth forests themselvesversus the economic value of the timber for regional developmentand employment. So far, the Clinton administration has shown awillingness to compromise on the old growth issue. It seems to favora policy that allows logging of old growth forests, but at rates lowerthan allowed in the 1980s, while preserving some large tracts forpreservation of habitat. The keys in determining the balance be-tween cutting and preservation are knowing exactly how much ofthe forest is required to provide habitat for endangered and threat-ened species and trading off the Social values of species diversityand the value of the resource in situ against the value of the Umbel'.Given the scientific uncertainty surrounding the critical size of anecosystem to support a species, and the extreme difficulty of valuingsuch intangibles as species diversity, these are not simple issues toresolve.FisheriesThe story of fisheries in the United States is complex and involvesa number of related and unrelated issues. The issues include over-fishing, conflicts between commercial and recreational interests,regulations that offered too little too late, pollution, internationalboundary disputes and the introduction of exotic species.Commercial fishing and industries related to commercial fishingmake a substantial contribution to the U.S. economy. Commercial 210211 7 landings alone were valued at $3.1 billion in 1987 while imports offish and fish products were valued at $8.8 billion that year (Gordon).Recreational fish:r g also makes a large contribution to the U.S.economy, estimated in 1987 to be $13.5 billion (Gordon). The futureof recreational and commercial fisheries in the United States de-pends on the quality of the resource. Unfortunately, in many impor-tant regions that quality is declining. There have been significantreductions in fishery stocks in the Georges Bank fishery in NewEngland, the Chesapeake Bay, the Columbia River fishery in thePacific Northwest, Lake Okeechobie in Florida, and the Gulf ofAlaska.Once the Chesapeake Bay was a valuable fishery, producingoysters, blue crabs, striped bass and numerous other species. Whilethe blue crab fishery continues to be important, oyster catch is muchreduced and the striper fishery has been closed since 1985. Thestory of the decline of the Chesapeake Bay involves themes of over-fishing; reluctance of managers to place timely limits on catch; anddamages and diseases linked to nonpoint pollution from agriculturaland municipal sources.While attempts to control point sources of pollution have greatlyreduced pollution from toxic elements, pollution from nonpointsources has not been nearly as successful. One reason for the limitedsuccess at controlling nonpoint pollution has been the reliance onvoluntary programs rather than regulatory programs. This is begin-ning to change, with greater regulation of agricultural practices inproximity to the Chesapeake.Outdoor RecreationThere is no doubt that outdoor recreation has been, and still is,growing in importance in the U.S. economy. Every tourist dollarspent generates approximately two and one third dollars of addi-tional economic activity. Tourists in the United States spent approx-imately $272 billion in 1989, which, when accounting for multiplier ef-fects, makes tourism responsible for 12 percent of the gross nationalproduct (GNP). By this account, tourism is the single largest industryin the United States, though it is such a heterogenous part of theeconomy that it is difficult to classify it as an industry (U.S. TravelData Center). Attendance at state parks, national forests and na-tional parks has continued to grow since World War II. Visitation atnational forests and parks has grown from less than 40 million visitsafter the war to more than 300 million visits in 1987 (Harrington).State park attendance grew from 92 million visits in 1946 to 618 mil-lion in 1981. There are no consistent data on private recreational fa-cilities, though it is thought that growth of this industry sector is atleast as high. 211 1 Clearly, recreation is the industry that benefits the most from envi-ronmental regulations. The Clean Water Act helps improve streamand lake water quality for fishing, boating and swimming. Regula-tion of pesticides and restrictions on wetland conversion help pre-serve game habitat. The only negative effect environmental regula-tions have on tourism is increasing the costs of travel by increasingthe costs of automobiles and fuels.While outdoor recreation continues to grow, that growth rate isfPlling. The leisure time available to most Americans has declinedrapidly, falling around 37 percent from 1973 to 1988 (Cordell). Lei-sure time has fallen because of the growth in two-wage-earner fami-lies, increased commuting time and increased time on the job. Thisdrop in leisure time has affected the type and location of recreationalactivities. People are recreating closer to home and spending lesstime at the places they visit. People also spend a higher percentageof their available leisure time at or near their homes doing thingslike jogging and bicycling.The implications of these trends for outdoor recreation in differentregions of the country are not yet clear. The policy issues involvetrading off the economic and other values associated with outdoorrecreation with the alternative uses of the resources required by rec-reation. While recreation is a large and growing sector of the econo-my, it does have its negative side. Most recreation-based jobs arelow-paying service sector jobs. Communities also face such problemsas loss of identity, the transfer of power to nonresident landowners,and growth pains.ConclusionsAll natural resource and environmental policy issues involve diffi-cult trade-offs among alternative resource uses, economic develop-ment and environmental quality. The complexity of the issue de-pends, in part, on the resource involved. For mining, the issues aretrade-offs between the economic value of the extracted resource andthe environmental costs of extraction, processing and use. Forestryadds the complication of a resource that has one type of value whenit is harvested and a mutually eAclusive value as a standing forest.Moreover, many of the values of the standing forest, such as water-shed protection, wildlife habitat and scenic beauty, are very difficultto measure in dollar terms. The fishery has all of the complicationsof forestry issues, such as pitting commercial against recreational in-terests, but adds the complication of a resource that has, in manyareas, been severely damaged by nonpoint sources of pollution. Fi-nally, outdoor recreation is a cross-cutting issue, one that is stronglyaffected by environmental quality and the decisions that are madeon forestry and fishery management and land. ase decisions that af-fect wildlife habitat antfillaies. 212 The role of public policy educators in this area is the same as withagriculture and other rural issues, i.e., to clarify extremely complexand controversial issues, increase understanding of alternatives andthe trade-offs among alternatives, and provide an open, unbiasedpublic forum for the exchange of ideas. If public policy educators donot help, who will?' NOTES1 A longer version of this paper is available on request from the author.

The clean water policy alonewould provide the opportunity for declining fish populations to re-build. In the southeastern United States, according to the NationalMarine Fisheries Service, 85 percent of the fish species sought bycommercial fishermen are estuarine dependent. Estuaries' healthdetermines fisheries' fate. At this point in time, construction nearwetlands, storm water runoff, nonfunctioning septic tanks and pollu-tion associated with heavy industry as well as municipal wastes de-cide the fate of most marine critters.Some so called \"environmental policies\" really are not environ-ment related at all. For instance, some conservation associations saybanning the commercial harvest of redfish was a good \"environmen-tal policy.\" We view the decision to reserve the redfish resourcesolely for sportfishermen as a political \"taking\" decision having noth-ing whatsoever to do with the environment or conservation. Sport-fishermen took the resource away from non-boating consumers. It isas simple as that.An extreme example of what some people call \"environmentalpolicy\" is a Florida conservation association's constitutional amend-ment petition drive to ban all gill nets in Florida waters and ban allother net types with more than 500 square feet of webbing. They callthis an \"environmental effort.\" The Audubon Society and severalother \"eco-groups\" have endorsed this petition in the name of \"con-servation.\" This is not an environmental question. The sportfishingorganization merely wants all the fish in the water reserved for thesportfishing angler. These are two examples of what some groupsrefer to as \"environmental policy\" but which we strongly argue havenothing to do with the environment or conservation. These types ofpolitical situations only de( idc \"who gets the fish.\" An honest publicpolicy should be develope, making sure all citizens have a reason-able and affordable opportunity to share in the commonly-ownedmarine resources and not just those who have boats, motors andwho live near, or can drive to, the shore.215214 On the other hand, a very true environmental policy is that whichhas been expressed in the Endangered Species Act. This act re-quires that species listed as threatened or endangered be protectedfrom harm. Several species of marine turtle, i.e., green, ridley,leather and hawksbill, have been listed as endangered and the log-gerhead turtle has been listed as threatened. Our organization wason the cutting edge of the development of turtle excluder devices(TEDs) and by voting to comply with the law in a vigorous fashionand convince the rest of the shrimp industry to do likewise. Thiscaused controversy within the industry and a radical group in Loui-siana formed with the sole purpose of not using turtle excluder de-vices. Many of our boat members aligned with Louisiana on thisissue and our membership dropped.As an indication of our success in complying with the law, theFlorida shrimp industry has achieved a 99 percent compliance ratein the use of TEDs and National Marine Fisheries Service has re-ported the turtle stranding in Florida from offshore shrimp trawlinghas been reduced by 90 percent. We modified our shrimping opera-tions at our own expense by purchasing TEDs by cutting big holes inour nets to let the turtles pass through. At the same time, we havenot seen our shrimp landings reduced to the point that shrimping isno longer profitable. TEDs have cost us money. We have lost shrimpproduction. But the law is the law and until it is changed we willcomply with it.Water quality is very important to the seafood industry. A largeoyster industry in Apalachicola, Florida, keeps water quality on thefront burner in several agencies. We believe if we could bring allFlorida water quality up to the standards required for oyster har-vesting, we could assure a highly productive and extremely valuablelegacy for future generations. We believe our goal to keep Ap-alachicola Bay, Cedar Key and other areas open to oyster har-vesting is the main defense available to prevent our natural resourc-es from being depleted in the name of coastal development projects.While high rise resorts and golf courses tend to make everythinglook green and plush on site, they invariably lead to water degrada-tion and to the loss of lifestyles and cultures common to many ruralFlorida coastal areas.A strong environmental policy assuring excellent water quality is amust. Without one the seafood producing industry will not survivemany more decades.True environmental policies have a very positive impact on com-mercial fishing. If a certain species of fish has declined in individualsize and cumulative pounds for several fishing seasons, it is reason-able to conclude this particular species is over-fished and in need ofa sound environmental policy that will bring the population back toequilibrium.215 216 Howevei, with government regulation today it seems anytime aspecies shows decline, the \"environmental policy\" is to close downcommercial seafood production and blame that sector for over-har-vesting.For instance, when the regulators wanted to develop a manage-ment plan for king mackerel, they decided nets were the culpritsand should be curtailed. When the landing statistics came to the fish-ery management council, however, they showed the recreationalfishermen had historically taken 68 percent of the total and the com-mercial fishery (both net and hook and line) harvested the other 38percent. Going deeper into the 38% commercial catch, only 47 per-cent of the 38 percent came from nets. In other words, less than 20percent of the total king mackerel harvest was being caught by netsbut nets were blamed and are still blamed for the decline in the kingmackerel fishery. Federal and state statistics show 81 percent of allthe king mackerel killed were killed by hook and line fishing. Justanother example of who gets the fish. Who gets the fish will never bean \"environmental policy.\"In the fish wars, \"perception is reality.\" Some sportfishing groupshave convinced some legitimate environmental groups \"that in orderto save the fish in the sea, commercial fishing must be banned.\" Oneof the most cruel tactics being used in Florida is to show pictures topeople of large foreign factory ships with dolphins in their nets andsay, \"We have to ban the nets in Florida to save these poor dol-phins.\" There has never been a factory ship in Florida waters or offthe coast of Florida and there never will be. We do not have the fish-ery biomass required for such harvesting techniques. However,many Florida residents believe this propaganda when they read it insporting magazines and outdoor writers' columns.Another vicious tactic is to show a picture of a porpoise in a netsomewhere in the world and ask unsuspecting petition signers,\"Don't you want to stop this slaughter?\"Please believe me, Flipper is not in danger from Florida's fishingnets. If Flipper has an enemy, it is turbo-charged speed boats, jetskis, pollution and theme parks. The Florida Department of Envi-ronmental Protection reports that thirty-five porpoises died in cap-tivity from 1986 to 1992 while only seven porpoise deaths were re-motely tied to commercial fishing operations during the same timeperiod.I make these remarks because few people are in a position toknow all the nuances of any controversy and thirty years of involve-ment with marine harvesters of fish and shellfish has filled mydatabase.Another example of what I call \"mythinformation\" are news re-leases written by one particularly mean-spirited group and sent to all21 7216 Florida newspapers telling them shrimp trawlers are killing thou-sands of juvenile red snappers in their shrimp nets.This is somewhat true for the brown shrimp fishery off the Texascoast during a certain part of the year, but absolutely false as it per-tains to Florida shrimpers. For a shrimp vessel to catch a red snap-per off Florida it would have to drag on rocks that would tear up thenylon nets. But the perception in the mind of the general public isthat Florida shrimp trawlers are killing red snapper. This is a falsestatement and the people making it know it is propaganda.So, what does all this have to do with the topic of how environ-mental policy impacts resource-based economic development? Orwhose dollar bill is the biggest? Everything.If the militant angler clubs can get the media to mold public opin-ion, which in turn is then used as the basis for an environmental pol-icy that reserves the marine natural resources for sports anglers,then the anglers will have succeeded in totally destroying a food pro-ducing industry, savaging an entire culture and, at the same time,eliminating all commercial fishing. If the industry is eliminated, thenthe economic impacts to commercial fishing that might have beenused to prevent unbridled coastal wetland development in order toproduce a better environment will have been destroyed. That is cer-tainly a big dollar bill.The sad part about this entire scenario is that there really areavailable resources for both commercial and sport fishing. Our credois to share the fishery resources while the anti-seafood gi oups seemto want all the fish.Environmental impacts on the commercial fishing industry can be1) excellent, 2) tolerable, or 3) absolute destruction:1. Clean water, clean air and clean land are excellent for the sea-food industry.2. Turtle excluders, by-catch excluders, closed seasons, quotasand trip limits are tolerable and sometimes necessary.3. Net ban petitions and federal and state regulations based onfaulty science are absolute destruction.The greatest scam that has taken place in the debate between thecommercial fishing industry and the sport fishing industry is that arelatively few businessmen from some of America's largest energyand real estate development companies have put up enough dollarsto convince some honest conservationists and environmentalists thatdestroying the commercial fishing industry is environmentallysound, aesthetically pleasing and politically correct. How aboutthose \"buzz words\"? In reality it will only pave the way for some ofthese men to build more marinas, golf courses and very expensivehouses in the coastal areas of Florida.217 21 Conversely, this proposed corporate takeover of the marine re-sources under the banner of environmertRlism offers a good oppor-tunity to expose the real destroyers of th,.: wetlands and fisheries forwhat they really are. We have accepted that challenge and oppor-tunity.ConclusionSound Environmental Policy: Positive ImpactsProvides clean water for maximum fisheries habitat.Provides ecosystem management which is more effective than spe-cies management.Provides for fewer dredged and filled wetlands which equals moremarine life.Provides opportunity to rebuild any declining fish stocks.Provides opportunity to save endangered species.Provides opportunity to protect marine mammals that are in need.Provides opportunity to leave our planet better than we found it.Sound Environmental Policy: Negative AspectsShort-term economic losses in implementing new requirements.Some short-term social disruption among some citizens.Public policy issues of intensity to be re-examined include: flawedscience, netting ban, allocation of resources among user groups,water quality, endangered species, marine mammal protection,coastal zone use, turtle excluder devices, by-catch reduction de-vices, and transfer of marine resource management to game and fishcommission.The elimination of commercial fishing will have monumental socialand economic costs. Some communities will face bankruptcy. Coun-ty, state and federal assistance programs will be strained beyondtheir ability. The very real possibilities of disrupted families, di-vorces, spouse abuse and loss of life do exist. It will be difficult whenan entire socioeconomic group is told they can no longer have a jobin their chosen profession harve -ting fish for others because anothergroup wants to use the fish for recreation and that group hadenough wealth and political clout to shut down commercial seafoodproduction in state and federal waters.There needs to be a well-thought-out public policy toward the pro-duction of food from the sea. The policymakers at all levels of gov-ernment must take a proactive stance in favor of America's first in-dustry if it is to survive the 1990s here in Florida as well as in theother southeastern states. 2 1 9 218 TOURISM, NATURAL ENVIRONMENTSAND PUBLIC POLICYClyde F. Kiker and Andrew SeidlUniversity of FloridaWorld-wide, tourism has become a major economic sector. InFlorida, for example, it is the largest economic sector, dealing withmore than 40 million visitors annually. Caribbean countries, withwhich countries the authors are acquainted, have seen the majorityof their economic growth stemming from this sector (Deere, et al., p.19). Jamaica, for example, saw a 17 percent growth in visits in 1990(Planning Institute of Jamaica, p. 13-1). The World Bank, in fact,claims tourism is the world's largest economic sector. Yet, little spe-cific information is available on tourism, either in aggregate terms orfor specific locations. For example, even in Florida and Jamaica thereporting of macroeconomic data (Bureau of Economic and BusinessResearch; Planning Institute of Jamaica) there are not clear listingsfor tourism as an economic sector. Little is known about the rela-tionship between tourism and the local setting, a component that ap-pears important in attracting tourists. Further, little public policy hasbeen focused directly on the tourism sector and its relationship tonatural resources. Essentially, economists and policy analysts havevisited little attention on this broad and diverse economic sector.In our brief comments we will consider tourism as it relates to eco-nomic growth, public infrastructure and natural environment. Flor-ida and the Caribbean will be used as examples. The presentationwill be broad with a number of generalizations. Please bear with usin this general approach. We find that when people begin to identifyissues of concern, often issues with little concrete information, it ishelpful to deal with them at an \"appropriate level of vagueness.\"The approach allows all interested parties to have an opinion and tocontribute to the clarification of critical issues. We will be working ata \"vague level\" and hope that it will be \"appropriate.\"The major tool to be used is a schematic (Figure 1). The idea forthis representation derives from work being done with digraphs maps\" (Kosko, 1992, pp. 152-158; Kosko, While we recognize many components and influences arenot illustrated, use of the digraph allows us to focus on specific con-cepts (the rectangles) and their interactions (arrows with associatedsigns).When considering tourism as illustrated in the schematic, it ishelpful to think in terms of interacting processes: demand processes, 2192 Figure 1. Diagraph of Tourism Sector. 6- :.es-a- :^sye:: a PL-..e \"t0,P-C.,7.---, s supply processes, public policy processes and natural processes. Inessence, outside forces increase demand, expanding demand trig-gers supply responses, the number of visitors increases rapidly, theregion's aggregate income grows, government revenues increase,etc. Of course, in reality, these processes are highly nonlinear andintertwined.Demand and SupplyDemand for travel is growing. Media acquaint people with a widerange of locations and cultures. People have active interest in traveland develop perceptions of locations long before they visit specificsites. Their interests are varied. For some, the idea that Florida andthe Caribbean are sunny and warm in February and March isenough, while increasingly others are taking interest in cultures andunique environments. Advertising by private and government or-ganizations--we have all seen Jamaica's and Florida's adsaid peo-ple in envisioning themselves having a wonderful time in a location.As a result, people travel to these locations in increasing numbers.We economists say demand is growing rapidly. 220221BEST COPY AVAILABLE The supply response derives from actions by both private andpublic entities. The private sector provides hotels, restaurants,shops, attractions, etc. as part of normal commerce, while govern-ment provides airports, roads, pa,. ks, etc. as part of a broad set ofpublic services. In cases in which the number of visitors that come toa location is as large as it is in Florida and the Caribbean, the levelsof business and government activities necessary are of huge magni-tude. These activities tend to dominate commerce and governmentand create large numbers of jobs. Populations grow as people moveto take advantage of job opportunities.Components not always recognized as important in generatingtourist services are the natural and cultural settings. Often it is theenvironmental and cultural contexts that are the basis of the tourismpotential. Unique natural settings provide service flows essential tothe actual tourist services the consumers value. Florida's sunnybeaches and the Caribbean's colorful Creole culture and lush trop-ical ecosystems are examples. These components, in many ways,have characteristics of public goods and, to a considerable degree,are seen as open access resources. The substantial economic rentsgenerated by the settings and the relative open access to these re-sources lie behind their apparent over-development.Public PolicyPublic policy related to tourism has been, and remains, an integralpart of overall economic growth policy. The focus has been largelyon expanding the potential for capturing economic rents resultingfrom development of local natural resources. In Florida, the stategovernment sold wetlands and allowed these to be dredged andfilled; it built highways through other fragile ecosystems and bridgesto barrier islands; it allowed hotels and time-share condominiums tobe built just feet from the shoreline. In the Caribbean, governmentsbuilt airports (often on filled coastal wetlands) to handle the largestairliners, port facilities for cruise ships, and hotels. In both Floridaand the Caribbean, public funds are used for advertising and promo-tion. Often nongovernment entities and government agencies workin accord to foster additional tourism enterprises. Such activities aresupported politically, since increased employment is seen as a pri-mary outcome. Overall, growth in tourism is seen as good, and amajor goal of public policy is to aid the growth.Additional considerations are being added to public policy discus-sions relating to tourism. First, those gaining fi from tourism are seeingthreats originating in other sectors of the economy. Differing publicpolicy positions are being heard and conflict is increasing. In Flor-ida, offshore oil drilling is being fought, sports fishers are attemptingto have commercial net fishing banned, and agriculture's release of 221.222 drainage water into the Everglades National Park is being chal-lenged. Similarly, in the Caribbean, oil facilities, mining and agri-culture are seen as threats to reefs and coastal resources. Economicinterests are seeing billions of dollars of potential loss and gainandpublic policy debates are heating up.Expanding tourism also is being seen as a threat to itself. It isbeing recognized that any given location has an upper limit to .,;ieamount of activity it can absorb without deterioration of naturalprocesses. While the upper limit is not known, people are beginningto think that limit is being approached. Growth in the Florida Keysthreatens the ecosystem of Florida Bay and offshore reefs and hasled to a controversial designation of the Keys as an \"Area of CriticalState Concern.\" Proposals by the Florida Turnpike Authority wouldextend the turnpike through critically important wetlands. Demandfor beachfront land for hotels and tourist facilities threatens theplanned Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge which would providehabitat for several endangered species. Likewise, the Caribbean hasmany cases. In Jamaica the government has allowed hotels to con-tinue to be built in Negril even though present tourist loads are caus-ing identifiable damage to fresh water wetlands and marine systems(Tolisano and Kiker). Again, the outcomes mean gains for some andlosses for others. For many tourist destinations, whether in warm lo-cations like Florida and the Caribbean, Third World wildlife parksor winter sports areas, similar problems are arising accompanied byincreasing hostilities among rent-seeking interest groups.The underlying causes are far too numerous for us to deal withhere. We can, however, say that, in most cases, explicit forums aremissing in which to consider a broad range of goals for the tourismsector. This may be because the tourism sector in many locations isso young it has yet to be recognized as an important segment of thelocal economy. Whereas agriculture, mining and manufacturinghave been recognized and supported as major components of thelocal economy for some time, tourism is just now being viewed thisway. In many locations it has been viewed like a frontier with eco-nomic rents to be captured by both private and public entities.There has been little or no recognition that deterioration of the natu-ral setting of tourism could ultimately lead to reduction in demand inthe region. Where attention is given, it is generally only after a majorproblem has become apparent to all, for example, traffic congestion,ir.adequate sewage and waste disposal, shortage of shorelines in anatural state, collapse of an ecosystem, and by then remediating ac-tion is complex and expensive (Dixon and Sherman, pp. 197-199).Public Policy EducationIt seems to us there are two roles public policy education can play.First, in areas in which tourism is related to natural resources andenvironments, but is not viewed as the major economic sector, the 223222 best approach would be to focus on the ongoing economic and natu-ral resource issues being identified by community residents. Thesemay or may not be identified with area tourism. Educational ap-proaches dealing with the broad set of public policy issues will helpdevelop knowledge and capability within the community. When spe-cific issues concerning tourism and natural resources arise, commu-nity knowledge and capabilities can be brought to bear. In makingthis suggestion, we realize that most of you are already using this ap-proach and understand it far better than we do.The second suggested approach applies to areas such as Floridaand the Caribbean in which tourism is recognized as a dominanteconomic sector. In such areas there is a need to develop public pol-icy forums for dealing with community and natural resource issuesdirectly related to tourism. In these areas, economic conditions willinduce even greater tourism activities, and it will be important thatthe entire community recognize that, ultimately, overuse and deteri-oration of facilities and natural environments will result if balanCingactions are not taken. Natural processes in specific locations havemaximum capabilities for absorbing human activities without dra-matic change. Unfortunat-ely, for most locations the natural proc-esses are so poorly understood it is not possible to say exactly whatthe limit is. By working in a public forum in which the many inter-ests concerned about the economic potential of tourism are repre-sented, there is an opportunity for balancing the rent-seeking behav-ior before the rents begin to decline. While the approach will bemessy, as all public policy processes are, it will provide a forum inwhich to learn about the relationship between tourism and its settingas specific actions are taken. As the tourism sector matures, knowl-edge about it will be available for resolving problems.Additionally, we believe there is an opportunity for creative re-search here. The basic premise is that progreis toward solution ofcomplex problems can be made, even when associated issues arepoorly defined, if the many actors can at least agree upon a broadset of goals. What we have in mind stems from a developing body ofliterature that focuses on the evolution of complex systems, systemswith so many components and interactions they cannot be repre-sented by usual apps caches. We find the work on \"fuzzy\" adaptivesystems by Bart Kosko (1992, 1993) most interesting. The approach isessentially model free and builds linguistically. Actions to be takenare inferred from qualitativeappraisal by actors as to whether pre-vious actions moved the system toward or away from agreed upongoals. Subsequent actions are implemented to the degree that sim-ilar previous actions moved the system toward or away from thegoals.To us this approach is the essence of what public policy and in-stitutional development is really about. Following the concepts offuzzy adaptive systems allows a more explicit linkage of actors' qual- 223224 itative judgments of previous outcomes and future potential actions.We think it would be interesting to take on a public policy educationeffort dealing with tourism and environment using this structuredapproach. Of course, a location in Florida or the Caribbean wouldbe ideal. Both provide interesting economic, social and environmen-tal conditions for such an analysis. The analysis could provide clarifi-cation of the interactive roles of tourism, other sectors and environ-mental conditions with the local economy, and allow academics tostudy the details of public policy evolution. Given the growth of tour-ism, the effort could lay the groundwork for applied research inother locations. Plus it would be a lot of fun to do.
