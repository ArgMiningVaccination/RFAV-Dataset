The authors wish to thank all those who assistedin identifying the communities to be included in this study. Their suggestions and perspectives were extremely valuable.The authors also wish to express their sincere gratitude to the communities included in theseprofiles. Appreciation is due first for their vision, dedication, and commitment to improvingservices to troubled youth and their families and, secondly, for their contribution to thedevelopment of these case studies describing their systems of care. Community leaders,agency administrators, program staff, parents, youngsters, and advocates all wereextraordinarily generous with their time both by telephone and on site. They arranged sitevisits affording the project team the maximum opportunity to learn about and observe theirsystems of care.They provided rich information and insight about their experience indeveloping systems of care and were candid about the struggles and problems they haveencountered. Across the sites, there was genuine interest in \"telling their stories\" to assistother communities in designing and implementing systems of care. When drafts of the case studies were completed, key individuals fr.( in each site provided extensive review andfeedback. Their cooperation in meeting extremely tight deadlines was most appreciated.The opportunity to visit and to become acquainted with individuals from each of thesecommunities proved inspirational for the project team. The authors hope that the profileswill serve as an inspiration and guide to other communities to develop local systems of care for youngsters and families. Beth A. Stroul, M.Ed.Sybil K.

Lourie, M.D. CASSP Technical Assistance CenterCenter for Child Health & Mental Health PolicyGeorgetown University Child Development CenterFunded by the National Institute of Mental HealthChild and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP)July 1992 INTRODUCTION This case study was developed through a project conducted by the Child and AdolescentService System Program (CASSP) Technical Assistance Center at Georgetown University.It is part of a descriptive study of local systems of care which was initiated in 1990 andfunded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Child and Adolescent ServiceSystem Program. The project has involved identifying and studying communities which havemade substantial progress toward developing comprehensive, coordinated, community-basedsystems of care for children and adolescents who are severely emotionally disturbed and theirfamilies. Individual case studies of each local system of care are the products of this effortand are intended as technical assistance resources.Systems of care for troubled children and adolescents have been of great interest over the lastseveral years. In 1982, Knitzer estimated in her seminal study, Unclaimed Children, thatof the three million children with serious emotional disturbances, two-thirds were receivingno treatment whatsoever and countless others were receiving inappropriately restrictive carebecause of the lack of community-based service alternatives. In 1986, Saxe conducted a studyfor the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress which confirmedKnitzer's findings and stated that \"Mental health problems are a source of suffering forchildren, difficulties for their families, and great loss for society. Though such problems aresometimes tragic, an even greater tragedy may be that we currently know more about howto prevent and treat children's mental health problems than is reflected in the careavailable.\"In response to these problems and to the growing number of calls for change, the NationalInstitute of Mental Health launched the Child and Adolescent Service System Program(CASSP) in 1984 to assist states and communities in developing community-based systemsof care for this underserved population. Through grants and technical assistance activities,CASSP has supported the development of interagency efforts to improve the services providedto the most troubled children and youth and their families. To provide a conceptualframework for system of care development, CASSP supported the publishing of A System ofCare for Severel Emotionall Disturbed Children & Youth by Stroul and Friedman in 1986.This monograph has been called a blueprint for action in the child mental health field, andit describes the various service options required by these youngsters and the need for servicesacross all of the relevant child-serving agencies. From these components, Stroul andFriedman proposed a design for a \"system of care\" encompassing both the full range ofservices and the mechanisms required for the assurance of their appropriate delivery.Currently, there is widespread agreement that community-based systems of care foryoungsters who are severely emotionally disturbed and their families are needed, and thedevelopment of these systems has become a national goal.Despite the calls for such systems of care, until recently there were few, if any, examples oflocal systems of care which combined an array of community-based services with otheressential elements including interagency collaboration and case management. Today, thereis what might be described as an explosion of activity related to system of care development.The activities of CASSP, which have now involved every state, have played a crucial role instimulating system development at state and local levels. Increased attention to children's mental health by advocacy groups also has had a major impact. Further, system building hasbeen advanced significantly by initiatives such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation'sMental Health Services Program for Youth, which has provided funds for the developmentof systems of care in selected local areas, and extensive system development initiatives in anumber of states. As a result, many communities now have evolving systems of care whichcan be studied and described. Descriptions of the system building approach and experienceof these communities are designed to assist other communities which are attempting todevelop such systems.Potential sites for inclusion in this study were identified through a process of consultationwith key informants including individuals at national and state levels who have extensiveknowledge of developments in the children's mental health field and in the development oflocal systems of care in particular. Through these initial discussions, approximately 20communities were identified. These localities were characterized as having made significantprogress toward the development of community-based systems of care consistent with thephilosophy and principles which have been promoted by CASSP and which are displayed onthe following page. Accordingly, an attempt was made to locate local systems which arefamily focused, emphasize treatment in the least restrictive environment, involve multipleagencies, individualize services, and so forth. Similarly, an attempt was made to locatesystems which have moved beyond the more traditional outpatient, inpatient, and residentialtreatment services and have begun to develop a more complete and balanced array ofnonresidential and residential services including home-based services, day treatment, crisisservices, therapeutic foster care, respite care, case management and others.The second phase of the selection process involved extensive telephone interviews with a representative from each site to obtain detailed information about the array of servicesavailable in the community, the nature and functioning of the system level coordinationmechanisms, and the nature and functioning of the client level coordination or casemanagement mechanisms. In addition, information was collected about any special systemactivities related to such issues as financing the system, evaluating the system, involvingfamilies in planning and delivering services, and enhancing the cultural competence of thesystem of care. A chart was prepared for each potential site summarizing the service array,system level coordination mechanisms, and client level coordination mechanisms.Selection of sites for further study was accomplished with the assistance of an advisorycommittee and was based on the following set of criteria: 1.Must have a range of services in place (home-based services, crisis services,therapeutic foster care, and others).2.Must have interagency coordination mechanisms in place.3.Must have client level coordination mechanisms in place, e.g., case management.4.Must be a sufficiently well-developed local system to be able to serve as a usefulexample to the field and to receive national attention. ii CORE VALUES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.The system of care should be child-centered and family-focused, with the needs of thechild and family dictating the types and mix of services provided.2.The system of care should be community-based, with the locus of services as well asmanagement and decision-making responsibility resting at the community level. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.Emotionally disturbed children should have access to a comprehensive array ofservices that address the child's physical, emotional, social, and educational needs.2.Emotionally disturbed children should receive individualized services in accordancewith the unique needs and potentials of each child and guided by an individualizedservice plan.3.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services within the least restrictive,most normative environment that is clinically appropriate.4.The families and surrogate families of emotionally disturbed children should be fullparticipants in all aspects of the planning and delivery of services.5.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services that are integrated, withlinkages between child-caring agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning,developing and coordinating services.6.Emotionally disturbed children should be provided with case management or similarmechanisms to ensure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated andtherapeutic manner and that they can move through the system of services inaccordance with their changing needs.7.Early identification and intervention for children with emotional problems should bepromoted by the system of care in order to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes.8.Emotionally disturbed children should be ensured smooth transitions to the adultservice system as they reach maturity.9.The rights of emotionally disturbed children should be protected, and effectiveadvocacy efforts for emotionally disturbed children and youth should be promoted.10.Emotionally disturbed children should receive crlturally competent services which aresensitive and responsive to cultural differences and special needs and are providedwithout regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, physical disability, or othercharacteristics. Hi k.) 5.Should have some noteworthy activities in one or more areas including familyinvolvement, cultural competence, transition, high-risk children and adolescents,financing, and evaluation.An initial group of five communities was selected for site visits by the project team. The sitevisits generally involved spending three to four days in each community engaged in a varietyof activities designed to provide insight into the functioning of the system of care. Theseactivities included interviews with a number of individuals and groups including key systemmanagers, senior management representatives of the major child-serving agencies (mentalhealth, child welfare, education, and juvenile justice), case managers, youngsters, parents,and advocates.Additionally, the schedules included visits to three or more servicecomponents in the system of care where activities were observed and discussions held withprogram managers, staff, and, in some cases, clients. An important aspect of the site visitswas observing the functioning of interagency entities. Site visitors attended meetings ofinteragency entities focusing on system-level coordination as well as meetings of interagencyteams organized for the purpose of creating individualized service plans for specificyoungsters and their families. The site visits provided a wealth of information about eachsystem of care -- its developmental milestones, strengths, and obstacles yet to be overcome.The sample of communities studied yield valuable insights into the process of buildingsystems of care.Due to an enormous increase in system development activities incommunities across the nation, there currently are many more noteworthy examples of localsystems of care.It should be emphasized that none of the communities selected for studyhave fully developed systems of care, and all are struggling to overcome financial and otherobstacles to system development. Rather, they are communities which have succeeded inputting some basic building blocks into place and have demonstrated progress towardachieving system development goals. The resulting case studies are intended to serve astechnical assistance resources for other states and communities as they approach thechallenge of developing local systems of care for youngsters with severe emotionaldisturbances and their families.

COMMUNITY CONTEXT Northumberland County is located among hills and valleys in central Pennsylvania, borderedon its western side by the Susquehanna River and on the east by the Pennsylvania coalfields.It is about 60 miles due north of Harrisburg, the state capital. The area has fourdistinct seasons with cold snowy winters and pleasant summers. As of 1991, its makeup is51 percent rural and 49 percent urban (primarily small towns) with three major populationcenters spread across the county's 453.4 square miles.Northumberland County has a population of 96,771 with 22,450 children under the age of 18.Of the three small cities in the county, Sunbury, with a population of about 12,000, is thelargest and is the county seat, and the major industry is government. Because it has thelargest part of the population and is central to most of the rest of the county, it serves as thefocal point for most services. Shamokin has a population of almost 11,000 and, lying in theeastern part of the county, is the county's center for anthracite coal industry activities.Milton has a population of about 7,000 and, lying in the northern part of the county alongInterstate 80, acts as a center for a major trucking firm. The small towns near Shamokinare also \"coal towns,\" while the rest of the small towns in the county are farmingcommunities.Northumberland County has its employment concentrated in industry, small farmagriculture, and coal mining. Both the farming and mining segments of the county's economyhave been depressed for over 15 years. This is especially true in the coal regions which havesuffered from the decline in the use of coal and from the coal fires that burn under part ofthe county. As a result, poverty has been a major problem in the county. The median incomeis near $11,000, placing it among the poorest 10 percent of the counties in the state, with 11to 12 percent of the population living below the poverty line. There is great disparity ofincome levels within the county with the average income in one region being twice that inanother.\"Unearned\" income (welfare benefits and Social Security) has grown at a ratenearly five times that of business and industry.A recent development has been the consolidation of pockets of poverty within the county.Many of the upper middle class families from the three small cities are moving to suburbanand rural areas of this county and surrounding counties. This type of population migratorypattern is reflective of larger urban areas and is leaving behind a concentration of povertyin the more urban communities. Both in the anthracite coal and farming regions of thecounty, several communities have become pockets of poverty as a result of economicdepression in these industries. This consolidation of poor families has been accentuated bythe availability of rapidly deteriorating inexpensive housing which is available is somecommunities and draws impoverished families from other areas.Another significant demographic trend in the county has been the out-migration ofindividuals in the 20-50 age bracket due to economic and employment conditions and an in-migration of the elderly. This has created a population shift toward the elderly, lower-class 1 families, and children with a resultant reduction in the county's tax base and an increase inthe demand for social services.The minority population of the county has historically been less than one percent. There hasbeen a significant shift during the last five years, however, with the minority populationhaving doubled and continuing to show an annual increase. The majority of this increase isthe result of in-migration of Hispanic families from the metropolitan New York area. Therehas been an 81 percent increase in minority population in the last decade. As of 1990,minorities had increased to 1.3 percent of the total population. With its history ofpredominance of individuals from ethnocentric European cultures, the county has not beenprepared for working with minority populations, and services have been slow to adjust.As of 1990, approximately 2,295 children were being served at any given time by the humanservice system, including children who were receiving special education services for emotionaldisorders. Over the last several years, Northumberland County has had one of the highestrates of reported child abuse referrals and of substantiated child abuse cases in the State ofPennsylvania. In addition, Northumberland County has experienced a significant increasein the number of sexual abuse referrals.While there is a great need for human services throughout the county, services tend to belocated in one of the major population areas creating a particular challenge to accessibilitysince there is no county-wide transportation system. This presents a significant hardship andbarrier to children and families who live in outlying areas of the county. Small satelliteservice centers in outlying locations have not proven to be useful for those families with thegreatest problems, particularly for children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbances.The human service system in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania consists of several largeagencies including: the Department of Public Welfare, which houses mental health programs,the Department of Education, the Department of Health, which houses drug and alcoholprograms, and the Juvenile Court Judges Commission. These agencies have major mandatedstate funding streams from which they create specific programs under state regulations.However, much of the state funding of localities in Pennsylvania is through block grantswhich go to counties; local service systems are controlled by County Commissioners and localboards of education except for special education which is a state-level function administeredregionally through Intermediate Units.The following child-serving agencies and systems provide services in Northumberland Countyand are key players in the system of care: oNorthumberland County Department of Human Services: a unified agency that servesthe following functions: mental health, child welfare, juvenile probation, drug andalcohol, and mental retardation. oEducation: Boards of Education in nine school districts; and special education servicesadministered regionally through the Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit. 2ii 10II. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF SYSTEM OF CARE DEVELOPMENT History of the System of CareSystems change is a relatively new concept to Northumberland County. Prior to 1980 therehad been few, if any, attempts to modify the way the system operated to deliver services.The 1960s saw the advent of the community mental health movement out of which a localmental health capacity was created, using a federal community mental health center grant.However, there was little capacity for meeting the mental health needs of children nor thoseindividuals served by other community agencies.In the early 1980s, a systematic approach to human services in Northumberland County didnot exist. Each of the agencies provided services within its own context and felt that it wasa struggle to obtain services from other agencies to meet the full range of client needs. Thejuvenile probation agency dealt with this situation by creating its own continuum of careincluding outpatient counseling services and a specialized education program calledCoordinated Learning Alternatives for Northumberland County Youth (CLANCY). Similarly,the child welfare agency contemplated the development of its own outpatient service capacityand was using mostly private sector services and placements.The mental health agency offered few mental health services for children and was seen bythe other agencies as unresponsive and unavailable. Until the mid-1970s, community mentalhealth services were provided by a community mental health center (CMHC) at the GeisingerHospital which is in an adjacent county. This CMHC served two catchment areas, one beingNorthumberland County and the other being an area comprised of the surrounding fourcounties. The reasoning behind this ungainly catchment area structure was related to therelative poverty of Northumberland County when compared to its neighbors; it also reflectedtraditional struggles among the counties involved.Around 1975, Geisinger Hospital, deciding that the CMliC program was becoming lessprofitable, closed that program's doors. This left each catchment area in the position of having to create its own new public mental health capacity. Northumberland Countyresponded by developing mental health services to be delivered by the county's Departmentof Mental Health.What the Department of Mental Health developed was a traditional mental health clinic withan office-based service model that tended see \"patients\" who came on a voluntary basis.Emotional problems typically were treated with therapy, out of the context of the rest of theindividual's problems. This philosophy was seen as \"elitist\" by the workers in other agencieswho complained that the mental health workers \"didn't want to listen\" to what they had tosay about families, offered no follow-up to referring agencies, and closed cases when reluctantreferrals failed to appear for therapy. In addition, there was a very low level of child mentalhealth expertise available within this mental health unit. In fact, in 1980 the County MentalHealth Department had been ranked last in the state in quality of service delivery and incompliance with state regulations. As a result, the other public agencies were at a loss forresponsive, qualified public child mental health resources and felt obliged to buy such carefrom private sector providers available in the community. 3 1I4 In Pennsylvania, each county creates a Board of Commissioners which is elected by its lc :alcitizens; these county commissioners are vested with the power to determine the structureof their human service delivery system. Northumberland County's Board of Commissionershad heard agency complaints and was not pleased with the way services were beingdelivered.Commissioners had knowledge about children who were \"falling through thecracks\" and felt that the categorical structure of their human services would not allow theclosing of gaps in the system. This understanding was aided by the experience of severalcommissioners in the mental health field. One commissioner had been a member of theoriginal Governor's Advisory Panel for implementing the Mental Health Act in the 1960s;two other commissioners had served on the original county mental health/mental retardationadvisory board in the early 1970s. From this background, there was a strong representationon the Board of Commissioners for mental health issues and support for systems change.This situation was very different from similar small counties where county commissionerswere known to have \"gotten in the way\" of systems change.Although it appears as if the commissioners would not have changed the system on theirown, their growing frustration with the failure of categorical programs to solve the humanservice problems of the county, led them to create a climate which was conducive to change.Change began in 1984 when the state threatened the county with loss of licensure and statefunding unless changes were made in its mental health and mental retardation programs(MH/MR). The commissioners responded to this failure of MH/MR management by changingthe agency director. They made a politically brave move by asking the director of the countyJuvenile Court Services Agency to take over MH/MR. Even though this individual hadformal mental health training, he had worked in juvenile justice for the last 13 years. Hewas well known for his innovative management of the Juvenile Court Services Agency andhis development of in-house mental health services. Significantly this director insisted thathe would take over the MH/MR agency only if he were allowed to also remain as Director ofJuvenile Court Services.The selection of the new director was based on the commissioners' recognition that systemleadership had grown out of the juvenile services agency over the years since 1979. TheCLANCY program had been started in that system well before the need for system of carewas conceptualized. However, the CLANCY program embodied the belief that systems mustrespond to the changing needs of youth. This \"alternative service\" concept became thedriving philosophy of the Juvenile Court Services Agency in the county. It was the JuvenileCourt Services Agency that provided leadership in developing the new system of care andunified agency approach, and it is this same spirit that has driven the entire system of careto be responsive to the needs of individual children and families.Combining the two agencies under one director served to assure that the mental healthcapacity within MH/MR would be structured so that it could meet the needs of the JuvenileCourt Services agency. Having seen the creative approaches to using mental health resourcesin juvenile probation, the director of child welfare was desirous of setting up outpatientmental health capacity within the child welfare agency, just as Juvenile Court Services haddone. However, it was felt that in order to offer outpatient services, Medicaid reimbursementwas needed. When a request for Medicaid reimbursement was rejected by the state, the childwelfare agency sought help from the new Director of MH/MR. In response, the directorencouraged the child welfare agency to join in a partnership to create a mental health service4 13 capacity that could meet the full needs of child welfare clients. This partnership involvedusing the newly created capacity within the mental heal th agency to serve child welfareclients and included a proviso that no outside mental health service would be purchasedunless it was clear that the faental health agency could not meet that need. This agreementinitiated a process of looking within the agency to receive necessary services and put the onuson the agency to develop services geared to meet identified needs in the community.At the time of the merger of MH/MR snd Juvenile Court Services in 1984, all of the agencieswere ready to begin working more cicsely together. The vehicle for if creased collaborationwas the creation that year of an entity called the Children's Clinic. he Children's Clinic,described in greater detail in a subsequent section, was developed as a coordinatinginecham ism for children with mental health needs. It has subsequently evolved into a casemanagement system and fvrther serves as a gateway for all mental health services (not justfor those 'hildren and adolescents with severe emotional disturbances). Rather than beinga programs for serving children and families, the Children's Clinic acts as a process forassuring a dequoye and appivr tate cross-agency interventions. The Children's Clinic initiallywas goo., it. developing at first, with individuals and agencies feeling their way along. As thisprocess proceeded, it allowed agencies with less overt investment to feel comfortable joiningin without beir,(2,. threatened.In 1985, Pennsylvania received a Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP)grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. Through this federal grant, the stateaimed to improve the provision of services to children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbances through the development of county-wide inter-agency mechanisms for servicecoordin ation. Northumberland County was in the first group of five counties to receive a localCASSP grant through this state program. The timing of the CASSP grant was perfect for theenhancement of the county process of system integration. When presented with the staterequest for proposals for CASSP, the county officials who had been involved in thedevelopment of the Children's Clinic saw it as an unexpected outside reaffirmation of theirprogram integration principles. With this outside support from the state, the Children'sClinic process was empowered by CASSP to grow and solidify as the accepted local practice.The CASSP Coordinator, hired under the grant, became the convener of the Children's Clinic.In this role, the coordinator encouraged the development of the process by centralizing staffdevelopment and bringing people together.Following from he interagency concepts of the Children's Clinic and CASSP, in 1987 aunified human service agency was created which combined the child welfare, mental health,substance abuse, and juvenile probation agencies under the leadership of the individual whohad been th.z., Director of Mental Health and Juvenile Court Services. All of the agencycomponents were moved into the same building. The creation of this unified human serviceagency was not the result of a state- drivcr initiative, but rather it was the result of anevolution in service delivery within Northumberland County. The reorganization waspossible since county governments in Pennsylvania have the power to structure local agencycomponents in any way they want, as long as needed services are pnvided and statemandates fulfilled. This flexibility allowed the county to create a unique structure that metits current needs. 5 This unified agency has directed the development of a continuum of services to meet thevarious needs of children, adolescents, and their families. Each service componentparticipates as part of an integrated system. System components range from a reconstructedprogram of outpatient individual and family psychotherapy, through therapeutic foster careto respite care, shelter care, home-based family preservation and crisis intervention services,day treatment services, social skills programs, juvenile probation services and parentingprograms. There are no formal residential or he spitalization programs directly related to thesystem, and the use of such resources is rare and seen as extraordinary.In addition, the system of care does not have a cut-off which separates the delivery of servicesfor children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbances from children with lesserneeds. As a result, all children with a perceived mental health service need are seen throughthe Children's Clinic process, each getting the degree of attention and intensity of treatmentnecessary. Further, there are no formal case management systems in mental health; theChildren's Clinic provides a case management function which is supplemented by selectedagency personnel on an as-needed basis.State Influences on System of Care DevelopmentPrior to 1984, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had made significant progress toward thecreation of an improved service system for children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbances. Since 1980, the Pennsylvania Office of Mental Health has placed high priorityon the need to improve the child and adolescent mental health service system in its annualstate mental health plan.This plan was based on the concepts of a comprehensivecommunity mental health system following from deinstitutionalization. Each county isrequired to prepare a county mental health plan that is consistent with the priorities thatare elucidated in the state plan.In addition, the state had another methodology for insuring the growth of child andadolescent mental health services at the county level. This process was centered around theallocation of funds to counties to be used exclusively for the expansion of outpatient andpartial hospitalization programs for children and adolescents. Further, in 1982 the statecreated a children's Community Residential Rehabilitation Services program which providedhighly structured living arrangements in either group or host home settings with maximumsupervision, personal assistance, and a full range of psychosocial rehabilitative services.The State Office of Mental Health also encouraged interagency coordination of services. Thisoccurred within the juvenile justice agency by the creation of the capacity to provide mentalhealth services for youth incarcerated in juvenile justice institutions and forestry campsthroughout the state. Also funded were a number of demonstrations of local interagencyprograms that involved the provision of mental health services to the population of otheragencies including child welfare, health, mental retardation, and special education. Alongwith these demonstrations, the Office of Mental Health developed a cooperative interagencyagreement with the Office of Children, Youth and Families, the state child welfare agency.This agreement promoted the development of similar interagency agreements between localMH/MR and child welfare units. 6 Following from this strong start, in 1984 the State Office of Mental Health in the Departmentof Welfare applied for a federal CASSP grant in the first year of that national program. Itwas awarded a grant from the first CASSP review; funding began in early 1985. This CASSPgrant built on the county structure of the state service delivery system, and from it wasdeveloped a two-tier system development strategy. At the state level, a CASSP Committeecomprised of system participants, advocates, and parents was created. This committeeassumed the role of defining a state-level philosophy for the delivery of services for childrenand adolescents with severe emotional problems and their families. Further, the committeecreated a process for the development of systems of care at the local level throughout thestate.Most innovative in Pennsylvania's CASSP effort was the focus on local system-building fromthe earliest time in the grant. This local focus acknowledged the power vested in countiesand the importance of making an initial major impact at the local level. Pennsylvania's planinvolved creating a CASSP committee, similar to the state-level CASSP Committee, in eachcounty. This was to be done in stages, using the federal CASSP dollars to give counties smallstate CASSP grants. In the first year of Pennsylvania's CASSP grant, five counties weregiven local CASSP grants -- one of these counties being Northumberland. Since that time,local system development has been mandated by the State Office of Mental Health, and statedollars have replaced the federal in the funding of county projects throughout the state.Northumberland County was struggling with creating a unified service system that providedbetter access to mental health services. It was almost simultaneous with the creation of theChildren's Clinic that the state began offering local-level CASSP grants. NorthumberlandCounty was appreciative of the state and local CASSP initiatives in that they reaffirmed thecount's emphasis on interagency coordination and provided a mandate from above to continuein the direction that had already been established. Additionally, the local CASSP grantoffered the county the resources with which to hire a CASSP Coordinator, the individual whobecame the \"glue\" that held the county's new system together.Another way that the state influenced and supported the development of local systems of carewas by providing technical assistance. Through the federal CASSP grant, the state hiredseveral individuals whose roles were, in part, to work with the local grantees. Theseindividuals helped local communities to understand the state-level CASSP philosophy andhow to translate these ideas to meet local needs and political realities. Each year, the statehas held conferences for local service deliverers, advocates, and family members to furtherdevelop the concepts of the system of care as applied to Pennsylvania counties. Participationin these conferences has been very helpful to the counties, including Northumberland, increating a spirit and a camaraderie that drives systems change across the state.The state has also influenced local service development through state funding of local servicecomponents. In 1987, the state received funds from the legislature to develop and providelocal Family-Based Mental Health Services. Northumberland County used this initiative todevelop the Homekeepers Program which provides intensive home-based services for childrenand adolescents with severe emotional disturbances and their families.Another state initiative that has had a major impact both within the state and inNorthumberland County has been the Student Assistance Program (SAP) which is a joint 7 initiative among the state mental health, drug abuse, and education agencies for theprevention of adolescent suicide. SAP programs, modeled after Employee AssistancePrograms, are school-based efforts to work through a consortium of community agencies toreach children and adolescents who are at risk for a number of problems including emotionaland drug abuse problems. The joint education/mental health/drug abuse funding of theseprojects across the state has had the effect of further emphasizing the interagency nature ofthe state's commitment to systems change and offers a model by which localities can movetoward more responsive integrated, systems of services for children and youth.Northumberland County has SAP programs in each of the county's high schools and severaljunior high schools. Participation in the SAP program by these school districts has had amajor impact on enhancing the participation of the schools in other system improvementefforts such as the Children's ClinicOne of Pennsylvania's priorities has been to encourage parent participation in thedevelopment of the state and local service systems and to emphasize parents as providers ofservice for their children and adolescents. Through the Parents In Need (PIN) program, thestate used its CASSP grant to fund the training of parents and the development of localparent groups across the state. While the development of parent programs has been slow inNorthumberland County, the state influence has been supportive of the county's ownemphasis on the role of parents in the development of the system of care and of individualtreatment plans and its focus on family-based services.Individuals who have been involved in the development of the Northumberland Countysystem of care are convinced that without the positive state influence, critical changes wouldnot have taken place, or at the very least, would have taken much more time and effort. Therelationship between the state and the county in changing systems is an important two-directional process. The county is presently waiting for the state to change some of the rulesrelated to service delivery and financing which would further encourage and facilitateinteragency unified service concepts at the local level. Most importantly, the county systemwould prefer fewer restrictions on the length of time youngsters can be placed in foster carewithout having to be committed to county care. This would allow placement with greaterfamily involvement and would avoid forcing families to give up custody of their children inorder to get appropriate services. Further, the county would like the state to change somerules related to financing of services to enable the county to use funds more flexibly toenhance its ability to blend funds in order to create a pool of undesignated funds to be usedas appropriate for individual service plans. III. PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS The mission statement of the Northumberland County Department of Human Services isstated as follows:\"Our mission is to improve the quality of life within the community by: oEmpowering the residents of Northumberland County to achieve their highestlevel of functioning and independence; 8 1 oPromoting mutual respect, rapport, and partnership with the community ...families, residents, and staff; oProtecting and serving Northumberland County's most vulnerable citizens; and oAdvocating the values of family life and the dignity of each family member;whileoEnhancing, developing, and effectively managing our resources\".This mission statement reflects several major tenets of the Northumberland County system'sphilosophy: oQuality Circle - A major aspect of Northumberland County's philosophy is theconcept of the \"Quality Circle,\" a Japanese form of management which includes aprocess whereby all participants have a role in the ongoing development of theagency's philosophy and practices. The concept of the Quality Circle reflects thedesire by the department administration to make decisions only with a broad base ofinput from service delivery participants ranging from clients to front line workers toadministrators. The process of the Quality Circle allows all participants to feel thatthey are part of the decision making process; it insures that each has ownership of thedecisions and the resultant system development.oConsumer Focus - Inherent in the mission as stated is the understanding that theagency is there to serve. \"The people we serve are the primary focus of our programs.\"Listening to the \"customer\" is important. In fact, the philosophy states that the\"customers\" include families, other agencies, and the community. Additionally, whilethe Quality Circle includes agency administrators and customers, it also includesfront-line workers who, along with families, are felt to have the best perspective onservice needs. When a system is built upon a consumer-driven policy, the child andfamily become the center of service delivery rather than the agency itself. Thus, theagency is there to do whatever is necessary to provide appropriate services.oFamily Focus - Families are seen as the most important resource for children andadolescents. The intervention modalities used in the county are oriented toward thefamily rather than toward the individual child. Services are delivered to the familyas a whole to the extent possible, and, when that is not possible, inclusion of thefamily remains a primary intervention goal. Similarly, keeping children in theirhomes is seen as most appropriate, and, when that is not possible, reunification of thefamily remains a primary goal. Intensive services are delivered in a home-based manner whenever possible, because it is felt that home-based services are moreeffective and that this approach solidifies the commitment to the family. To insurethat families feel that they are considered as full participants, they are alwaysincluded in case planning as a part of the treatment team. The staff philosophy isthat services should be aimed at maximizing the potential of families to care for andraise their children. For families that have difficulty participating in the interventionprocess, the department has created the Parent Center, which works with parents who 9 I. 0 wish to enhance their parenting skills and their ability to support their children. Inaddition, a new foster care pilot effort allows foster parents of children removed fromtheir homes to work with the natural parents. Further, families are included in theplanning for future program development. IV. TARGET POPULATION The target population as identi5ed by the Northumberland County Department of HumanServices includes children who are processed through their multidisciplinary service planningprocess called the Children's Clinic. This group represents, for the most part, those childrenwho are involved with multiple systems and are in need of mental health services.From a practical point of view, the target population of the Northumberland CountyDepartment of Human Services includes all children who have needs that are to be addressedby the public sector.From the standpoint of mental health, the target population iscomprised of all children and adolescents who require services from the mental healthcomponent of the agency including, but not limited to, children and adolescents with severeemotional disturbances and their families.The broadness of this definition of the target population reflects the philosophy of the systemwhich involves approaching each child and family from the context of their unique needs.The system is created so that each child and family can receive the amount or intensity ofservice that they need from each of the agencies. Children and adolescents with severeemotional disturbances, those at risk for that serious disturbances, and those who have lessserious mental health needs all can be served by the system and its coordinationmechanisms. Because a child does not need to have a particular level of mental health ormultisystem need in order to be eligible for the full range of services and coordination, thereis little concern about excluding children and families or of their \"falling through the cracks.\"Further, the system recognizes that the service needs of children and families are not ascategorical as the programs designed to provide for them. The definition used in the countyfor the system of care target population tends to foster the concept of decategorization ofservices by not requiring that the child be categorized before he or she receives services atany level.While the mandates of various components of the agency, such as protectiveservices and juvenile services, force some categorization, the system definitions help minimizethe effects of the categorization and aid the system in looking at the full range of needs.The target population includes children who come through each of the system components:',cliental health, child welfare, mental retardation, juvenile justice, drug and alcohol, andeducation. In the 1990-91 fiscal year, the Children's Clinic saw 375 children and adolescents,which represented 1.5 percent of all children in the county and 20 percent of those served inthe agency as a whole.The ages ranged from birth to 18 with 62 percent being 12-18, 25percent being 6-11, and 13 percent being 5 and under. The minority population served wasonly about two percent of the minority population of the county, which is small to begin with-- about 1.3 percent of the total county population. 10 Children and adolescents seen in the Children's Clinic during this period had a wide rimy.of primary diagnoses:PercentAutism/Developmental Disorders 7Major Depression/Bipolar Disorder Disorders 2Adjustment Disorders 32Miscellaneous 9Total 100Of note is the high percentage of serious psychiatric disorders represented in this population-- over 20 percent.Only 32 percent were diagnosed as being in the often over-usedadjustment disorder category, and only two percent were seen as having a conduct oroppositional disorder, in spite of the fact that many of these children came from juvenilejustice services.Given the serious level of most of the diagnoses, the Children's Clinicappears to be serving a population of children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbances. V. ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM System ManagementThe Northumberland County system of care has been created and is run as a function of theNorthumberland County Department of Human Services. The department resulted from theunification the major human service components under one agency. It is this unified agencythat drives the system of care in the county; the department serves as the administrative andfiscal agent for all of the various programs under its auspices.The unified nature of the system makes it impossible to separate out the services for childrenand adolescents with severe emotional problems from the care of other children andadolescents. Even the Children's Clinic, which coordinates the clinical function of the system,is not focused solely on those with the greatest need. Rather, the focus is on all children andadolescents with any need. The Children's Clinic coordinates support for any family with achild who has any level of mental health or multiservice need.Power is vested in the director of the department, but is redistributed to the agency as awhole through a Human Services Management Team. This team consists of the directors ofmajor component agencies and programs in the department who meet regularly and are 11 vested as a group with the responsibility for making policy decisions for the department. Thedepartment also espouses the philosophy of the Quality Circle, a form of participatorymanagement in which all employees of the department have a say in the management of thedepartment and in the development of policy and programs. Because of this managementpolicy and the fact that the agency is small, there is a unanimity of thought that drives thesystem. The director reports to the County Commissioners on all of the programs in thedepartment and also reports to the President Judge for the juvenile justice programs. Agencycomponents within the department have program directors who report to the director of thedepartment.This unified human service agency has the power and capacity to directly provide or topurchase most of the services that children and their families need, with the exception ofthose provided by schools. There is also a great deal of flexibility in the handling of most ofthe funds that come to the county from the state or which are generated at the county level.Although some funding streams are dedicated to very specific populations, the departmenthas the capacity to direct many funding streams into jointly supported programs, thusapproximating joint or blended funding.Role of Participating Agencies oMental Health: Mental Health/Mental Retardation (MH/MR) Services and theNorthumberland County Counseling Service (NCCS) of the Department of HumanServicesThe MH/MR Program of the department serves as the primary intake and assessmentvehicle for all mental health services for adults and children. Within the system ofcare, the MH/MR Program is the entry point for all youngsters felt to be in need ofmental health services. This intake and assessment as well as emergency services,are provided in what is called the Base Service Unit (BSU). There are two locationsfor the BSU, one at the main office in Sunbury on the western side of the county andanother in a satellite center in Shamokin, on the eastern side. The BSU also isresponsible for case management functions. While the BSU has relatively fewresources allocated specifically for children and adolescents (two case managers), therole of the BSU is amplified by its close relationship the Children's Clinic, which isthe departmental-level case coordination and planning mechanism for young peoplewith multiagency need. The close integrative nature across the department offers theBSU the support it needs to perform its function in spite of its sparse resources.The Northumberland County Counseling Service (NCCS) is a separate mental healthprogram within the department. It provides two basic system service components:outpatient counseling and intensive home-based services for children and adolescentswith mental health problems (known as Homekeepers). Services offered by these twocomponents act as the major mental health resources iu the county system and areavailable only through referral from the Children's Clinic. Mental health services areprovided with the family being the focus of treatment. Most of the services are family-oriented, clinic-based outpatient or intensive in-home interventions. When this is notpossible, individual treatments are offered which have family unification as atreatment goal to the extent possible. These are well-staffed services and are well- 12 110integrated into the other services of the department. The Homekeepers program hasstaff funded by both child welfare and juvenile justice budgets. oChild Welfare: Children and Youth Services of the Department of Human ServicesChildren and Youth Services (C&Y) is the child welfare agency within the department.As such, it serves the traditional functions of child protection, foster care, andadoption as well as the newer functions of family preservation and therapeutic fostercare. Each of these services is accompanied by case management provided by theappropriate program. As a member of the Children's Clinic, C&Y activities becomepart of the unified system of care. Because there are important state mandates formost of the services offered, C&Y can never feel completely free to give up its programboundaries within the system of care. This becomes most evident with: 1) the commitment requirements of foster care, and, 2) the requirement that familypreservation programs serve only newly referred child protection clients. Many of theyoungsters and their families served by C&Y also have mental health needs and canaccess services from NCCS through the Children's Clinic.The foster care programs, both regular and therapeutic, are essential services in thesystem.They are used to serve multiple purposes including shelter, crisisstabilization, respite, and therapeutic placement as well as traditional longer-termalternative family placement. Regardless of state regulations, flexibility createdwithin the Northumberland County system has allowed these resources to be used tofreely meet the specific needs of children and families. The basic problem in the useof foster care by the system is that after 30 days of voluntary placement, the child'scustody must be given to the department. While this rule is more flexible than childwelfare policies in many states, it still puts a strain on the system. Participants inthe service system, including those from C&Y, feel that this custody issue is a majorobstacle in the full unification of the system. oJuvenile Justice: Juvenile Court Services Program and CLANCY/Special ServicesProgram, of the Department of Human ServicesThe Juvenile Court Services Program is the juvenile justice component of the system.This program offers juvenile intake, probation, and guidance services. For youth withmore severe problems, this program also offers intensive probation and intensive drugand alcohol probation. While each child served by these programs must come throughthe police or the district magistrate, the programs are integrated with otherdepartmental efforts.Many of the adolescents involved are in need of, and areprovided, mental health services available through NCCS or support/residentialservices available through C&Y. The Children's Clinic is the gateway through whichthese other services are accessed by youth involved with the juvenile court.CLANCY (CoordinatedLearningAlternativesforNorthumberland CountyYouth)/Special Services Program is a collection of services that offer alternatives tomore traditional interventions for youth. These include social rehabilitation, daytreatment, outward bound, and camp programs. Within the system of care, CLANCYserves a very special purpose. By institutionalizing these alternative approaches, the 13 department has demonstrated its commitment to programming that meets individualneeds. Further, since CLANCY developed as a juvenile justice program, its presencein the service system demonstrates the links between juvenile justice and the otherprogram areas. CLANCY youth can access mental health services from NCCS andHomekeepers through the Children's Clinic, and, conversely, youth in other programareas can be referred to CLANCY through the Children's Clinic. oEducation: Seven Local School Districts Serving Only the County and Two DistrictsShared with Other Counties, Plus the Central Susquehanna Intermediate UnitRegular class schools are operated by seven school districts exclusively serving thecounty and two districts shared with other counties. However, special education services are offered directly, as well as supported in local schools, by a regionalIntermediate Unit operated by the state. The Central Susquehanna IntermediateUnitisthe special educationcollectivethat serves the region in whichNorthumberland County lies. It offers a wide range of special education services forchildren and adolescents with severe emotional disturbances, and it works with thevarious school districts in mainstreaming efforts.While these school-based special education programs have not directly integrated withthe human service agency in the past, they are becoming more cooperative and arebeing seen as part of the total system. There also is more direct service integrationwith the local schools. This is especially true with the Student Assistance Program(SAP), a school-based prevention and early intervention program for children andyouth with drug and alcohol problems or at-risk for suicide which is jointly funded bythe state-level education, drug and alcohol, and mental health programs. TheDepartment of Human Services provides a liaison to each SAP team who attends atleast 50 percent of its staff-rags. The Human Services Department also provides training and technical assistance for all SAP and related school staff who areinterested and funds a full-time school liaison position to coordinate these activities.Each school district in the county has a relationship with the Children's Clinic. Whilevarious districts have developed better relationships than others with the system ofcare, each sends representatives to meet with the Clinic concerning individualchildren. oSubstance Abuse: Drug and Alcohol Program (D&A) of the Department of HumanServicesThere is a strong understanding that children and youth with emotional problems andtheir families often have concurrent drug and alcohol-related problems that requirespecial intervention. These programs are represented in the Children's Clinic. D&Astaff perform substance abuse assessments, offer some educational groups andoutpatient therapy, and make referrals to private providers. These programs areclosely related to the CLANCY programs as well as to the Student AssistancePrograms run by the schools. The substance abuse programs offered by privateproviders include a group for children of alcoholics and 47 prevention groups inelementary schools. 14 oHealth: Pennsylvania Department of HealthPublic health services, while available to a small degree through a State HealthDepartment clinic in an adjacent county, are not an integral part of the system of carefor children and adolescents with emotional problems. This gap in the system of careis partially addressed through the county's new priority on early intervention inresponse to P.L. 99-457.Additionally, a Local Interagency Coordinating Council(LICC) has been created and to improve early intervention services. oMental Retardation: Mental Health/Mental Retardation Program (MH/MR) a theNorthumberland County Department of Human ServicesServices for persons with mental retardation are included in the same administrativeunit, the Base Service Unit, as mental health services. Representatives of retardationservices are not regular members of the Children's Clinic. However, whenappropriate, those families with dual mental health/mental retardation needs cometo the Children's Clinic for the development of full service plans. VI. SYSTEM OF CARE COMPONENTS As noted, the Northumberland County Department of Human Services has four major sub-agencies: Mental Health/Mental Retardation, Children and Youth Services, Drug and AlcoholService, and Juvenile Court Services. Each of these service components has its own servicemandates and its own intake and assessment process. Each service component offers a rangeof services, some of which are offered only to mandated populations and some of which aremore generally available to all clients of the overall agency. It is a difficult task to describethe structure of the Department of Human Services for actual service delivery in no wayapproximates the flat structure as drawn on an organizational chart. Rather, services areoffered in a hub-type structure in which services respond to the needs of individual families;each coordinating with others and reporting to the Children's Clinic as an integrating bodyand to the department director.The continuum of services offered by the department includes the following: oIntake/Case Management/Case Work - Provided through the Mental Health andMental Retardation agency's Base Service Unit (BSU), through the Children andYouth Services' Child Protective Services and General Protective Services programs,and through the Juvenile Court Services' Juvenile Probation program oIntensive Case Management - Provided through the Children and Youth Servicesagency oSubstance Abuse Services - Provided through the Drug and Alcohol Services agencyand the Student Assistance Program (SAP) within the school districts 15 '-z oYouth Services - Provided through the Juvenile Court Services' CoordinatedLearning Alternatives for Northumberland County Youth (CLANCY) program withinthe Special Services division. oParent Support - Provided through the Parent Center oOutpatient Family Therapy - Provided through the Northumberland CountyCounseling Services' Outpatient Services and Homekeepers programs oDay through CLANCY's, the Geisinger Hospital's, and theCentral Susquehanna Special Education Intermediate Unit's day treatment programs oHome-Based Services - Provided through Children and Youth Services' FamilyPreservation program and through the Mental Health Services' Homekeepers program oFoster Care and Therapeutic Foster Care - Provided through the Children andYouth Services' Regular Foster Care and Therapeutic Foster Care programs oIndependent Living Services - Provided through Children and Youth Services oHospitalization and Residential Treatment - Provided through outside resourcesIntake/Case Management/Case WorkIn Northumberland County's system of care the traditional outpatient function is not theleast intensive mental health intervention offered. Intervention is felt to begin at intake, andthe intake worker has the capacity to offer a basic level of case management with atherapeutic function that is recognized by the system as being a mental health intervention.Some of these intake/case management services take place under the mental healthcomponent of the agency, while others are offered by workers in the child welfare andjuvenile services components.Entry into the mental health component of the Department of Human Services occurs in twoways. All clients new to the Department enter the system through the intake function of anentity called the Base Service Unit (BSU). Most emergencies also are handled by this unit.Clients who are involved with Children and Youth Services or Juvenile Court Services gainaccess to mental health services through the Children's Clinic function without going throughthe Base Service Unit.The BSU serves both children and adults and has several major functions, all of which areprovided by caseworkers called case managers. While there is no formal breakdown betweenadult and children's services in the BSU, there are two case managers who do almost all ofthe child and adolescent work (one in the main office and one in the satellite office). The casemanagers assigned to children are responsible for all individuals from birth to age 18, or upto 21 if the child is still in school. The case management function of the ESU includes a basiclevel of case management services (including intake, assessment, counseling and referral) anda second level involving intensive case management. The basic case management functionis seen as one that assures flat people get the services that they need. While this includes16 primarily referral and coordination, some clients receive counseling delivered directly by thecase manager. Intensive case management is for those individuals and families who havemore significant problems.The first function of the BSU is intake and assessment. Self-referred individuals andfamilies are seen first by a BSU worker. This worker handles an initial assessment andcarries out required administrative activities. The assessment focuses on the seriousness ofthe problem and the immediate degree of need. Identified needs can range from the need forpsychiatric evaluation, to immediate counseling intervention, to being seen at a later timewhen an appointment is available.At times, intake and assessment are triggered by a mental health emergency. Foremergencies, the BSU has individuals who act as crisis workers. In most instances, achildren's case manager handles day time emergencies for children and adolescents. Afterhours, this function is served by whomever is on call. Consultation is available to both thechildren's case managers and the adult crisis workers from the staff of the HomekeepersProgram (intensive home-based mental health services) or through psychiatric consultantsof the department. An intervention option available during emergencies is the commitmentof individuals, under State Statute 302, to a hospital for assessment and psychiatric care.Case managers and crisis workers are encouraged to use both Homekeepers and psychiatricconsultation in these decisions, with every possible resource being used before a child oradolescent is actually hospitalized.The BSU case manager has several options for working with any given case. The first ofthese is to keep the case as a counseling client for as long as necessary. This case dispositionis based on the ability of the case worker to deliver the degree of therapy needed and the lackof need for more intensive or multiservice interventions. The length of this intervention canrange from several weeks to several years, although cases kept at this level usually haveshorter-term needs. Individuals and families who need only counseling or psychotherapeuticservices may be referred out of the department to private or not-for-profit counseling services.The ultimate disposition will be determined by the ability of the family to pay for servicesand the availability of appropriate community resources.Some children and families are found to have complicated psychiatric needs. These familiesare immediately brought by the case manager to the Homekeepers staff or to the agency'spsychiatric consultants for evaluation. Most of these cases are ultimately referred to theNorthumberland County Counseling Services (NCCS) and to Homekeepers through theChildren's Clinic, although few are kept in the BSU for service, with psychiatric support fromdepartment consultants.Families who are not kept at the basic case management level or referred out to communityresources are referred to the Children's Clinic for multiservice coordination or more intensivemental health therapeutic services within the department. From the Children's Clinic,children and their families are guided to the type of intensive mental health or multiservicepackage that their needs dictate. One option is referral back to the Intensive CaseManagement Program in Children and Youth Services as part of the service plan. . 17 Case managers have case loads that number over 100 clients. While this may seem like anextremely large case load, most of these cases require only maintenance. The current policystates that every individual or family receiving mental health services will be assigned to acase manager. However, most of these cases are receiving primary services elsewhere in theagency, and the case management role is to follow up and assure that services are beingdelivered as planned. The case load for which the case manager has primarily responsibilityis relatively small, typically under 20. The children's case managers also are responsible forsitting on the Children's Clinic and for working with the school Student Assistance Programs.Case managers are required to have the minimum of a bachelor's degree with a humanservice emphasis; a small percentage have master's degrees in social work or counseling.Intake into the child welfare programs of the agency is primarily done through childprotection programs As with mental health, there is a counseling function that is providedby case workers in the protection programs. If youngsters seen in these programs need moreintensive mental health interventions, they have access to these through the Children'sClinic.The Children and Youth Services agency has two levels of protection programs: ChildProtective Services and General Protective Services. In general, the Child Protective Servicesprogram is for those cases in which the county is mandated to investigate and intervene.Child Protective Services is responsible for conducting an initial intake in all protectivereferrals.Cases which are felt to be within the agency's mandate are served by ChildProtective Services; others are referred to General Protective Services. Each of thesecomponents is based on traditional social service models. When case workers feel thatchildren and/or families have mental health needs beyond their ability to provide for, theyaccess mental health services through the Children's Clinic. There are two child protectionworkers who focus on sexual abuse and three who focus on physical abuse; each has acaseload of 8 to 12 families. There are 12 general protection workers, with caseloads of 27families.The intake/case management function for the juvenile justice component is called JuvenileProbation. Before the agency was unified in 1984, the Juvenile Court Services agency wasthe trendsetter in offering a full range of services. It had developed a continuum of care tomeet the needs of children and families referred by the police and the juvenile court. As aresult, its program of case management is the model used as the basis for designing servicesprovided by the other units, in particular mental health. This model consists of a basic levelof juvenile probation services, a more concentrated level of intensive probation, and, finally,a full range of mental health and support services provided through the Children's Clinic.An important function of Juvenile Probation Services is that it is the first line of drug andalcohol assessments for children and adolescents, some of whom are referred for moreintensive drug and alcohol services or for intensive drug and alcohol probation.Juvenile Probation offers counseling and case management services for youth who havecommitted offenses and are referred by the police. This program acts as an arm of thejuvenile court as well as being part of the Human Service Department's system of care. Theprimary service is case management and basic-level counseling by the juvenile probationworker.If this is not sufficient, there are more intensive options available includingdiversion programs, foster care, and intensive probation. Two intensive probation programs 1827 are offered. One, called Intensive Juvenile Probation, is for youth who are violent and havea high risk of placement. The other, called Intensive Drug and Alcohol Probation, is foryouth involved with drugs and alcohol (funded under a special state grant, Pennfree). Thereare six juvenile probation workers, one for Intensive Juvenile Probation, and one forIntensive Drug and Alcohol Probation. Most of these workers have degrees in criminal justiceat the bachelor's or master's level. Regular probation workers have caseloads of between 30to 60, while intensive probation workers have caseloads no greater than 15.For more intensive mental health services, youth and their families are referred to theChildren's Clinic, where they can access the entire continuum of care of the departmentincluding speci alized programs for sex offenders and substance abusers. Juvenile Probationappears to use the Children's Clinic less than other agency components. perhaps because ithas a wide range of options available within its own program including foster care homes,forestry camps, and secure residential treatment programs. The program also has directaccess to the Special Services/CLANCY programs and does take advantage of theHomekeepers Program and the Community Residential Rehabilitation programs, all describedbelow.Intensive Case ManagementIntensive case management is a function that C&Y provides for those clients and theirfamilies who are found to be in need of a service that provides them ongoing servicecoordination at all times. While this function can generally be provided by the Children'sClinic itself, sometimes the service needs of a particular child and family are so complex thatan intensive case manager must be assigned to assume responsibility for assuring that allservice components are working together. In other cases, the family may require thespecialized support of an intensive case manager to assure that it is able to make adequateuse of the services provided.The Intensive Case Management Program has three staff who work with families three tofive times a week.These families typically are served for approximately six months.Intensive Case Managers have specialized training and are usually chosen from casemanagers with extensive experience. As noted, Juvenile Court Services also offers intensivecase management services.Substance Abuse ServicesAlcohol and drug programs are provided to children and adolescents who are found duringassessments to be in need of higher-level drug and alcohol treatment. These services aremostly performed by private contract providers in the community. There is some outpatientintervention, primarily through groups. Rarely, an adolescent is referred for inpatient drugor alcohol treatment which is available in Philadelphia, 140 miles away.The Student Assistance Program (SAP) is a prevention program that is based in the publicschools and provides early intervention with children and youth who have drug and alcoholproblems and who are at risk for suicide. Developed through a state initiative modeled afteremployee assistance programs, and jointly funded by the state Department of Education andthe Drug and Alcohol and Mental Health Programs of the state Department of Human 19 Resources, each high school and junior high school in the county offers this program. Forelementary school age children there is a new, similar state program which currently is inplace in three county schools with plans to cover the entire county by 1995. SAP providescounselors who are available in schools for children and adolescents to access on their ownand by referral from school staff. Through a process of assessment (including specific drugand alcohol assessment), individual intervention, and groups in some sites, youth are urgedto explore the degree and depth of their problems in a confidential, nonjudgmental settingthat is readily available to them. Particularly, but not exclusively, aimed at substance abuseand suicide prevention, this program is able to identify at-risk youth and refer them for moreintensive help when necessary. The Children's Clinic is most often used to access theseservices.During 1990, 99 youth were served by SAP, 45 of whom were referred to theChildren's Clinic. SAP staff also are used for liaison with other child-serving agencies in thecounty and for training.Youth ServicesThe Department of Human Services has a division called Special Services which falls underthe Juvenile Court Services component. The basic program offered by the Special Servicesdivision is Coordinated Learning Alternatives for Northumberland County Youth, orCLANCY. Several important services are added to the system of care through the youthservices provided by CLANCY: life skills/GED, social rehabilitation, job training, daytreatment, and summer day camp.The Life Skills/GED program works with a broad range of youth who are both self-referredand referred through other parts of the agency. Focusing on educational equivalency, thisprogram helps young people who are not doing well in school or in the community to performbetter in a range of life skills. A youth can walk in off the street and start to receive servicesfrom this program without a referral from other agency components; this is the only CLANCYprogram where self-referral is allowable.The Social Rehabilitation program is for youth ages 10 to 18 and focuses on their ability toadequately live in their families and in the community. The program aims to increase thesocial and practical skills needed takes to progress through adolescence. The program offersstructure and respite during nontraditional hours for children and youth who are \"not makingit.\" The rationale for the program is that traditional therapeutic mechanisms have not hadan impact on this particular youth population and that another approach is required. Theprogram operates after school four days a week and on Saturdays. Included in the servicesoffered are homework assistance/tutoring, community service/helping activities (such as arecycling program), recreational activities, and group therapy. For youth who have greaterneeds, other services can be accessed through the Children's Clinic, including outpatienttherapy and family preservation activities. Seventy youth currently are served in tLprogram which is funded through mental health dollars. The cost runs a little over $700 peryouth annually.The Job Training program is for older youth and is funded from a state Job TrainingPartnership Act (JTPA) grant. It includes preemployment and life skills training as well aseducation, social case work, counseling, and job coaching. Some of the youth have ultimatelytransferred into technical school programs. Most of the youth involved in the program have202S problems with delinquency or are found to be at-risk. This programs costs a little over $600a year per youth.The Day Treatment program in CLANCY is the newest youth program and aims to be acommunity alternative to juvenile justice institutionalization. Almost all of the youth areordered by the court to attend, but some are placed by school districts as alternativeeducation. The program has similar components to the social rehabilitation program, witha greater emphasis on drug and alcohol treatment. The program meets five days a week andhas an educational component supplied by the Special Education Intermediate Unit. Animportant part of this program is a \"mini\" Outward Bound-type component, in which thereare four one-week outings each year with five weekend follow-ups. In this way, the conceptsof self-reliance and competence that are the basis of Outward Bound and Forestry Campprograms are integrated into a community-based, noninstitutional program. The programis funded by a state juvenile justice grant and serves about 30 youth at an annual cost ofapproximately $50, 000, of which $18,000 supports the Outward Bound component.CLANCY also runs a therapeutic summer camp for at-risk children and youth from ageseight to 14.The camp serves appropriate children and youth from the other CLANCYprograms as well as all of the children in the camp's age group who are in the CommunityResidential Rehabilitation (CRR) therapeutic foster care program. The camp program alsohas many of the components of the social rehabilitation program. In addition, there arecamps for younger children run by Children and Youth Services. The cost for the 170children and youth served is $38,000 which is provided by a state child welfare grant.Parent SupportParent support is offered through the Parent Center, one of the newest of NorthumberlandCounty's services. Started in 1989, it aims to support the needs of parents, particularly thoseparents who have lost custody of their children to child welfare or are at-risk for such loss.The types of problems addressed by the Parent Center include functional illiteracy, poverty,trouble with day-to-day parenting skills, and drug and alcohol abuse. Families are referredfrom any component of the agency, but most referrals come from child welfare. The programwas originally funded by a grant from the Governor's Drug Council; it currently is supportedby joint funding from the Children and Youth, Mental Health, and Drug and Alcoholagencies. The program currently operates in two sites at opposite ends of the county andserves 55 families a week at a total cost of $100,000 a year.The Parent Center program is run by parents who have received assistance from thedepartment in the past. They describe themselves as \"parents helping parents.\" Familymembers referred to and participating in the program are encouraged to see the staff as otherparents who are \"friends.\" Staff see their role as being parent advocates or \"parents whohave had problems and have gotten help.\"The main program meets daily from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. These hours meet the needs ofmost clients, many of whom are single parents and/or unemployed. Van service is providedas a form of outreach for parents who are unable to find other transportation. Day care isan essential aspect of this program. The basic program includes therapy and substanceabuse groups, parenting skills training, substance abuse education, and social skills training.21 . These activities take place through informal gatherings and craft sessions. The scheduleremains the same each day, with a mixer to start, then an education session, followed by atherapy or substance abuse group, and finishing with crafts. Lunch is part of the program.Each family is assessed by the program staff and is given the special service components ofthe program that it requires including a literacy program and an employment trainingprogram. The Parent Center also operates evening groups which target housing projects andother sites throughout the county.Outpatient ServicesIn 1989, the outpatient psychotherapy function was brought together into a new entity calledthe Northumberland County Counseling Services (NCCS) which is located within the MentalHealth/Mental Retardation agency. NCCS has two major components: Outpatient Servicesand Homekeepers (which is an intensive home-based intervention).NCCS operates outpatient services based on the principle that psychotherapy serves afocused, time-limited function. NCCS believes that the supportive functions often associatedwith psychotherapy can be provided elsewhere, usually through a case manager. Within thisframework, psychotherapy is always seen as one part of a more complete service plan. Thisperspective prevents therapy from becoming an isolated service, and, in turn, preventstherapy from being seen as the primary intervention modality in complex situations in whichmultiple services are required.Another way of looking at the role of psychotherapy in the Northumberland County systemis to say that a basic level of therapy, or counseling, is provided by workers throughout theservice components.It is only when more specialized services are needed that formalpsychotherapy is offered through NCCS. This philosophy forces the psychotherapists to seethemselves as part of team in which they have a particular role; the job which the team mustperform requires more than the psychotherapist can offer alone. This frees up thepsychotherapist to do internal consultation needed by the system as well as the necessarytherapy. With the recognition that they are part of a team, the psychotherapists must cometo understand the team function and, in turn, the other team members become morecomfortable in accepting them. Ultimately, the family benefits since psychotherapy isdelivered in a manner that is relevant to a treatment plan and is coordinated with otherservices that the family receives.NCCS offers primarily structural family therapy in its outpatient services. This choice oftheoretical base is derived from an understanding of the family needs of the populationserved by the human service agency as well as an institutional affinity for family therapy asa primary modality Some group therapy is available as well as individual therapy individualtherapy opportunities, including play therapy, for those youngsters in need of psychotherapywhose families will not become involved. However, in these instances one of the therapeuticgoals of the Family Service Plan is the further participation by the family in therapy.The treatment philosophy calls for brief, problem-focused interventions, and the length oftreatment is dictated by the complexity and seriousness of the problem. Since psychotherapyusually is not offered as a solitary service, psychotherapeutic interventions focused on specific 2231 problems can be terminated when those problems are ameliorated; ongoing support functionscan then be fulfilled by more appropriate service system components.Most families that are referred for treatment in NCCS fall into several categories: one groupwhich requires three to four sessions; a group with more entrenched problems which receives10 to 12 sessions; and a group with more complex and multiple problems which receivestreatment for six months to one year. Families that have shorter treatment courses areinvited for further therapy if the need arises; the supportive nature of the entire systemallows for this in-and-out therapy without fear of \"losing\" the family in between. Mostfamilies are seen weekly for the first four sessions. Many of these families show somepositive movement during this period and are then seen every other week until the treatmentis terminated.Other families demonstrate a greater therapeutic need and treatmentschedules are adjusted to meet these needs.NCCS Outpatient Services are operated in a way that makes them as accessible as possible.This service is open to families of children from birth to age 21. As often as possible, childrenand families are seen together. There are no waiting lists, as the service operates on thepremise that emergencies cannot wait and that these are usually among the most productivetimes for intervention. Since referrals only come through the Children's Clinic, NCCS is partof the referral process and can work with the Clinic team to assess therapy needs and thedegree of immediacy of those needs. As part of the team, NCCS then has a stake in makingsure that appropriate services are available. In addition, NCCS offers consultations to caseworkers/case managers and provides family therapy training to the entire agency staff.Therapy is offered when the families are available, and evening hours are part of the ongoingschedule of services. Most families seen in NCCS are Medicaid-eligible. Those that are not,either pay the Medicaid rate or are subsidized by generic mental health funds that supportthe agency. The agency purchases some outpatient services from the community, either fromgroup practices or from nonprofit agencies. These providers must be willing to invest in theservice system in order to get the business. This investment includes participating incoordination activities and training However, given the problems of public-private agencyinteraction, cases seen by outside providers tend to be those that require less coordination.A clinical director for the mental health structure has a master's in counseling with specialtraining and certification in family therapy. There are six therapists, half of whom havemaster's degrees in social work or in psychology; all have had training or experience in familytherapy.Day TreatmentThe CLANCY day treatment program described above under Youth Services, is one of threeday treatment alternatives available in the county. A new Day Treatment Program hasrecently been opened at the Geisinger Hospital. The program, which had not yet opened atthe time of the site visit, is aimed at providing post-hospitalization or preventive treatmentto youth with psychiatric diagnoses. This program meets five days a week after school andincludes psychotherapy (individual and group) as well as a program of social skills andrehabilitation. While it appears to be very similar to the CLANCY program, it is gearedmore specifically toward working with youth who have psychiatric needs.23 The Central Susquehanna Special Education Intermediate Unit offers day treatment in theform of day school programs for children and youth who are seriously emotionally disturbedas defined by PL 94-142. There are three such programs located in various schools in thecounty and shared by all of the local school districts. Children and youth who are enrolledin these programs can access other services through the Children's Clinic. In addition,several of the local school districts have alternative school programs for youth who requirean alternative educational approach.Home-Based ServicesThe next more intensive level of care in child welfare beyond protective case work is theFamily Preservation Program. This program is aimed at newly discovered cases in whichthere is a high risk of removing the child from the home. The goal of this program is toprovide the home-based services that will allow the child to remain in the home. It is basedon the Homebuilders model, but is extended to provide services for a three-month duration.The Family Preservation Program has been designed to provide crisis intervention forfamilies that are new to the social service system and offers support and a basic level of casemanagement, but no formal therapy. The needs of these clients are assumed to be less thanthose served by the Homekeepers program, which is reserved for families who have notresponded to less intensive services or are returning to the system repeatedly. The FamilyPreservation program has four workers who have caseloads of five families each.A separate program under NCCS is the Homekeepers Program, which provides intensivehome-based services for families with emotionally disturbed children and adolescents.Started in 1988, Homekeepers is aimed at the most troubled individuals for whom lessintensive interventions have not been successful and institutionalization is imminent. Theprogram offers long-term services, ranging from six months to one year. Although theHomekeepers program is under Mental Health, several of its staff are supported by Childrenand Youth Services.Criteria for admission to the Homekeepers Program are informal and include multiproblemfamilies being seen on an outpatient basis and/or families with children who are at risk forout-of-home placement. The program also works toward the reintegration of families wherechildren have been placed outside of their homes, some for several years. Many of thechildren seen with their families in the Homekeepers Program are considered to be seriouslyemotionally disturbed or mentally ill. For cases referred by the Children's Clinic, there is ano-reject policy. Most families are referred from the Children's Clinic, though some may bereferred directly from institutions, including hospitals. On an emergency basis, directreferrals will be accepted from other agencies. In addition, Homekeepers staff is called uponto provide consultation, directly or through the Children's Clinic, regarding the need forhome-based services. Each staff member serves as a liaison with specific programs andagencies.The Homekeepers Program has five professionals who work as a team serving about 30families at any one time. Other team members are available for support and to cover whenthe primary worker is unavailable. The family receives the amount of worker contact in thehome that the situation requires, averaging between one-half to six hours per week,depending upon the needs of the family. When referrals are first accepted, the family is24 most often in what is called the \"crisis phase\" which calls for an extremely intensiveintervention, often several hours a day. During this time the family works closely with theteam to bring the family crisis under control. Beyond the usual supportive and therapeuticinterventions that are available in home-based intervention, the team also utilizesconsultation and supports from other services in the system of care which can be accessedthrough the Children's Clinic when necessary. As the crisis is resolved, the care then entersa \"stabilization phase\" in which the intervention decreases in intensity. During this phase,the family is supported in making changes that may prevent further crises. In about two-thirds of the cases, the family receives a referral to other system components for ongoing careand support. In the other one-third, the Homekeepers intervention is sufficient, and furtherreferrals are not necessary.When respite becomes necessary for the youth and the family during the crisis orstabilization phase, temporary placement is made by purchasing foster care from the childwelfare programs in the department. While these placements are not made into the hosthomes used for therapeutic foster care, the foster parents used are experienced in workingwith troubled children and adolescents. These placements are reviewed after five days andcan be made for up to 30 days without formal commitment to the Children and YouthServices agency.The cost of an average episode of care in Homekeepers is about $8,500, based on a cost of $72per hour at an average of three hours a week for nine months. This cost is currently coveredby a grant from the State Office of Mental Health under an Intensive Family Based ServiceGrant program. The state is in the process of revising its Medicaid plan to allow Home-keepers to be a Medicaid-billable program.Foster Care and Therapeutic Foster CareFoster care is seen as the primary out-of-home placement in Northumberland County. Thisis due in pert to the lack of formal group homes or shelters. There are two levels of fostercare offered by the Children and Youth Services agency: Regular Foster Care and CommunityResidential Rehabilitation which is therapeutic foster care.In many respects, the regular foster care offered in Northumberland County is structuredmuch like other traditional foster care programs However, the prevailing philosophy of theagency is that children and adolescents belong at home and that foster care represents afailure of the system to resolve the problem in the home. Regular foster care serves anumber of different purposes. The first of these relates to child welfare issues concerning theinability of the family to ensure a child's safety in the home and the judgement by the agencythat the child must be removed, at least temporarily. Initially, this is seen as a crisisintervention, with the hope that the child can be returned home as soon as possible.Secondly, regular foster care serves as the first level of residential services in most cases thathave a mental health need. Even when a child meets the criteria for the therapeutic fosterhome program, placement most often is in a regular foster home either on a crisis or on alonger-term basis. As long as the child can be kept in a regular foster home, that is theplacement of choice, regardless of the mental health problem. It is only if the needs of childare not being met in the regular foster home that a therapeutic home is considered. This25 blending of regular and therapeutic foster care functions is seen as an important part of theservice continuum, allowing as much flexibility as possible. Many of the therapeutic fosterhomes also have regular foster care children at the same time.Thirdly, when a child has a placement need related to a delinquency problem, the foster careprogram is the first choice. While the juvenile probation workers may feel that specializedfoster care would be useful for their population, it is felt that the needs of the children in theJuvenile Court Services agency are similar to other populations of troubled children and thatthe same foster care resources are sufficient. Currently, Juvenile Court Services pays for fiveof the county's foster care homes. Fourthly, regular foster care is seen as having a crisisintervention function. This resource is used to offer children and/or their families respite ona short-term basis until a crisis can be resolved. Children can be placed voluntarily for upto 30 days in foster care under Pennsylvania rules.Family participation is a new facet of the foster care program. On a pilot basis, several fosterparents have been asked to work with and act as ongoing resources for some of the familiesof the youngsters in their homes. The idea for this service extension came from the positiveexperience with the Parent Center which was designed to work with parents who neededtherapeutic, social skills, and educational support in order to keep their children at home.Recognizing the gains made by families with this type of support, it followed that similarsupport could be offered to the parents of children in foster care by some of the moresophisticated foster parents.Started in 1986, Community Residential Rehabilitation (CRR) is the therapeutic foster careprogram used by all components of the system. Known also as the \"Host Home\" program,it was created to increase the system's capacity to keep children and adolescents with severeemotional disturbances both within the county and integrated as much as possible with theirfamilies. CRR originally was supported by a state child welfare grant; the funding for mostof the cost of this program currently comes from Title IVE funds. ORR is a program jointlyadministered in the county by mental health and child welfare. The homes and foster careworkers are provided by child welfare and the program coordinator is provided by mentalhealth. Of the $24.50 a day paid to therapeutic foster parents, $20.50 is provided by Childrenand Youth and $4.00 by Mental Health.The formal criteria for referral to the CRR are that the child must be under 18 years of ageand unemancipated, must have a mental health diagnosis, and must \"have exhibitedmaladaptive interpersonal behavior over a period of time, which significantly impairs thechild's functioning within the family and peer groups.\" What this means practically is thatthe child is a threat to self or others, has been or is at imminent risk of hospitalization orother residential placement, or has been moved several times between foster care homes formental health reasons. In practice, most children, even those who meet the official criteriafor CRR, are initially placed in a regular foster care home. Since the CRR staff are availableto support regular foster care parents with almost the same intensity of support provided totherapeutic home parents, youngsters who meet the criteria for referral to CRR often can bemaintained in regular foster homes. Only if the placement in the regular foster home doesnot work is the youth then placed in the Host Home. Throughout the entire process, thesame CRR staff works with the child. Being in CRR assures that there will be a \"meaningfulresponse\" by the staff whenever necessary; \"[the case coordinator] is always there!\" Most of2635 the foster families prefer to take both regular and CRR children, so the transition betweenregular and therapeutic foster care often is an administrative matter which results in thehome getting more support services.Parents for CRR are recruited from the pool of regular foster parents. They are selected onthe basis of their history of dedication and a willingness to accept the principle of \"no reject,no eject\" for the CRR children. They receive specialized training of about one month'sduration. Training is adjusted based upon the level of sophistication and experience of theparents. It is expected that someone always be at home in Host Homes. The daily rate forCRR is $24.50 a day, in contrast to the $16.50 a day paid for regular foster care. The averagelength of stay is one year, with a range of six months to four years.All referrals for CRR must come through the Children's Clinic. As a result, all CRRplacements are reflections of Family Service Plans. All children placed out-of-home also havea Residential Service Plan which expands the Family Service Plan to cite the reasons forplacement, the expectations of the child and family in placement, and the plan forreunification. Each child has a CRR case manager who has a maximum case load of eight.CRR case managers have a minimum of a bachelor's degree.Independent Living ServicesThe Children and Youth Service agency has a small independent living program for lateadolescents who cannot live in a home, but are not ready for emancipation. This programoffers housing supported by Title IV-E and a state grant. The youth in this program aresupported by a case manager who, through the Children's Clinic, has the ability to obtainother services that the adolescents may need. These most often are mental health, specialeducation, or job training services which can be accessed through NCCS, the IntermediateUnit, and the CLANCY program.Hospitalization and Residential TreatmentNorthumberland County has no residential facilities for children and youth; it has neithergroup homes nor residential treatment centers. Because the continuum of care requires out-of-county placement if these type of services are needed, the department has developedalternatives in the county. Because these alternatives have been so successful, there hasbeen little need for the development of other residential services. The residential functionis primarily served by foster care and therapeutic foster care services; these services are alsoused for shelter, respite, and longer-term out-of-home care. While Juvenile Servicessometimes uses state-run forestry camps and, occasionally, a state-run secure residentialfacility, most placements are in county foster care and therapeutic foster care homes.The Geisinger Hospital, which had served as the local community mental health center in thepast, now offers inpatient hospitalization as well as day treatment services to the county.Geisinger Hospital is available to provide acute care to adolescents, who are admitted toadult units. The hospital is also involved in the system of care by providing psychiatricconsultants through a contractual arrangement. 27r-t1.1 The nearest state hospital, which is also the nearest facility for children under the age of 12,is 60 miles away. In response to this problem, the system of care has created sufficientsupports so that hospitalization is almost never required. No child under 12 has beenhospitalized with county dollars for over three years, and the number of adolescentadmissions has been reduced by more than half. Still, the lack of community-basedhospitalization options for the under-12 population is seen as a gap in the system, and thedepartment is working to remedy this situation. VII. SYSTEM LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS When the Children's Clinic was started in 1984 and the unified Department of HumanServices was formed several years later, there was virtually no interagency collaboration inNorthumberland County. The county has used these two events to create a context foragencies to work together.Several mechanisms have been used to enhance interagencycollaboration at the system level: the Human Services Management Team, the Quality Circle,and the CASSP Team.Human Services Management TeamThe Human Services Management Team consists of the directors of the various componentagencies of the Department of Human Services as well as the heads of several key programs.This team includes thedirectorsof Mental Health/Mental Retardation Services,Northumberland County Counseling Services, Children and Youth Services, Juvenile CourtServices, and Special Services. The director of the department has vested in this group thepower to make policy and program decisions across the agency. The philosophy that drivesthe team is that decisions are made jointly, reflecting the needs of all the component agenciesand ensuring coordination and cooperation among all participants. Through this team thereis a blurring of component agency boundaries. As a result, problems are seen as \"our\"problems. The team has learned that in order to meet the cross-agency needs of the childrenand families they serve, categorical boundaries must be eliminated and children and familiesmust be viewed individually. Despite the fact that many categorical boundaries still exist,the team has found creative ways to design joint programs with shared funding and/orstaffing to fulfill their shared mission.Quality CircleThe power of the Human Services Management Team is enhanced by the concept of theQuality Circle that has become an integral part of the management of the department. Asnoted, this is a Japanese business management technique in which workers at all levels areincluded in the assessment of a business and its management, leading to inclusion inultimate changes in program and policy. At the Northumberland County Department ofHuman Services, the Quality Circle is an annual exercise. Input from line workei mid-levelmanagers, and executives decreases the possibility of top-down decision making that does notreflect the realities of practice and of the community. The Quality Circle offers valuablefeedback to the Human Services Management Team on how its decisions have impacted the 283 workers and the families served by the agency. Further, it offers the team insight from theservice delivery level on program gaps, coordination difficulties, and management problems.Through the Quality Circle process, staff at all levels in the department gain ownership ofthe agency. This makes them partners and helps them to feel as if they count. They are ableto see that their clinical and personal experiences can, and are, translated into programchanges and into new programs. The agency as a whole has used this annual renewal toreaffirm its commitment to the children, families, and community it serves.Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) TeamThe major cross-agency coordinating mechanism in the county, extending beyond thedepartment, is the CASSP Team. Northumberland County was one of the first fivePennsylvania counties to receive a CASSP grant as part of a state initiative to better servethis target population. While both the federal and state mandates for CASSP focus on thepopulation of the most disturbed and disabled children and youth, Northumberland Countyhas used its CASSP process to develop its entire system to serve not only the CASSP targetpopulation but also other children and families in the service system.The CASSP Team provides Northumberland County with a forum for discussing systemdevelopment, its progress, and its functioning. This then leads t' planning for furthersystems development. This process is facilitated by quarterly meetings of the CASSP Teamwhich includes: the CASSP Coordinator: the director of the Northumberland CountyDepartment of Human Services: the directors of Children and Youth, Mental Health/MentalRetardation Programs, Northumberland County Counseling Services, Drug and AlcoholServices, Juvenile Court Services, Special Services, the Parent Center, and the CentralSusquehanna Intermediate Unit; representatives from the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of theCentral Susquehanna Valley; and foster parents. At these meetings, the current functioningof county-wide programs is reviewed, and system needs are discussed. One of the uses of thethis county-wide, interagency process is to measure the progress of the county in reachingboth state and local goals and priorities for system development.A major effect of the CASSP Team and process has been the formalization of the system ofcare philosophy throughout the county. Each of the entities participating on the CASSPTeam feels ownerchip of the system changes being implemented, thus avoiding the concernof agencies that system change is being imposed on them by others. When there arestruggles across agencies about new system structures or policies, the CASSP Team becomesa forum for the resolution of these problems. In this regard, the CASSP Team and processis described as the \"flag waver for systems change,\" and the \"keeper of the philosophy orvalues.\" The CASSP Team and the CASSP Coordinator are intimately intertwined with allof the county's system change initiatives and play a major role in the convening andcoordination of the Children's Clinic.Joint ServicesOne of the mechanisms through which services have been coordinated has been joint workbetween programs within the department and across other community agencies. This hastaken place using several models including joint funding, joint administration, and joint29 staffing.Each strategy ensures that: 1) services are delivered in the least categoricalmanner; 2) services needed by individuals are available to them regardless of their point ofintake into the system; and 3) there is a minimum of program duplication.The Student Assistance Program is one example of a joint service. This program, fundedthrough a special state grant program, takes mental health, substance abuse, and educationmonies to run a program of substance abuse and suicide prevention in the schools. Abouthalf of the youth seen in this program ultimately are referred to the Children's Clinic forcross-agency services.The therapeutic foster care program, CRR, blends several joint funding sources. While it isprimarily funded by child welfare dollars available through Title NE, it also receives somefunding from the general county mental health allocation. In addition, staffing is providedthrough both child welfare and mental health, with case managers being paid for by welfareand the program's supervisor by mental health. Similarly, the Homekeepers intensive in-home service program has mental health, child welfare, and juvenile services-paid staffworking in a mental health-based program. Not only does this encourage joint ownership ofthe program across agency components, but it also creates built-in liaisons between thecomponents. Several of the youth service programs have funding from various sources, andthe Parent Center is jointly funded by all of the component agencies of the department. VIII. CLIENT LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS The Children's ClinicThe Children's Clinic is the cornerstone of the child mental health programs inNorthumberland County. Created in 1984, the Clinic represents a pooling of all countyresources that provide services to children. Staff from each of these agencies meet, alongwith families, on a structured, systematic basis to plan, coordinate, and monitor the servicesprovided to children and adolescents who have multiservice and intensive mental healthservice intervention needs. This process empowers staff to do treatment planning, utilizingall available resources from every agency and school district. Rather than seeing childrenand their families as \"belonging to\" one agency or service component, the Children's Clinicencourages the agencies, services, and families !o see themselves as part of a unified teamthat reconceptualizes the shared ownership of programs for \"our children.\" Since both thefamily and the primary worker responsible for the care of the family are considered to be partof the Children's Clinic team, the concept of \"our children\" truly makes sense from both thefamily's and the line worker's perspectives.Family participation is a vital aspect of the functioning of the Children's Clinic. Since 1986,family members have been expected to be full participants in the Clinic's process. Familymembers are seen as vital team members, and are treated as such at meetings. The Children's Clinic philosophy holds that the more one includes the family, the greater thefamily's investment in the service planning and intervention process. Similarly, parentinvolvement forces the agencies to be more honest with parents and among themselves. Thisbecomes evident in watching parents who come to an initial Children's Clinic meeting.303 Parents tend to arrive feeling wary and apprehensive about the process, but often they leavefeeling that, for the first time, their needs were addressed, their input was valued, and theywere seen by the rest of the team as an important partner and resource. Central in theChildren's Clinic approach toward families is the understanding that blaming other agenciesand/or parents for the problems of children is not constructive. Further, if one expectsfamilies to take part in solving problems, then solutions cannot be imposed upon them byprofessional agencies. Rather, families and professionals must work together cooperatively.The Children's Clinic is chaired by the CASSP Coordinator. As a result, the entire county-wide planning for delivery of services to children with mental health problems and theirfamilies is related to the experience of the Clinic. These experiences are directly reflected inneeds assessments, planning, and policy formation. At the same time, the philosophies anddirections developed through the CASSP Team are added to the practice of the Clinic. Thisclose interaction between planning and service delivery functions has led to an expansion ofthe continuum of services available, as well as to increased access to services.The Children's Clinic also acts as a gateway to intensive mental health services as offeredby the department's mental health component. There are two important aspects of thisgateway function. First, the gate keeping is a voluntary action in that there are no formalrules that require Children's Clinic approval in order to get more than basic-level mentalhealth services. However, the department staff understand that children and families thatneed more intensive mental health services will benefit from a Children's Clinic review andthat this review will ultimately lead to better service planning and availability. Secondly,the severity of a mental health problem is not a criterion for Children's Clinic review. Unlikemany other gate keeping mechanisms, children do not have to have severe emotionaldisturbances in order to receive services through the Clinic. Anyone who has the need formore than basic mental health counseling or needs multiple services has access to theChildren's Clinic to and the services that can flow from it.In addition to using the Children's Clinic for the development of intervention plans, theprocess is used for consultation about difficult assessment problems and/or service issues.In addition, the members of the Clinic's team use the team fcr mutual support. Further,other agencies and program components often use the consultation of the Children's Clinicto help them make a determination of need. For example, school personnel sometimes usethe Clinic to assist in making determinations of special education status on the basis ofserious emotional disturbance. Similarly, Children and Youth Services staff use the team toassist in making placement decisions, and the Children's Clinic is used as the formal bodyfor the determination of emotional abuse.The Children's Clinic is made up of regular representatives from the various agencycomponents as well as of representatives from outside agencies. Each individual case callsfor the participation o f that family and of any workers involved with the child and family,and may also call for participation of additional community agencies. Each agency representative is expected and authorized to speak for his or her agency and to commitnecessary services and resources as required in the agreed-upon treatment plan. 31 Regular participants in the Children's Clinic include: oMental Health/Mental Retardation ServicesHomekeepers (Family-Based Service Unit (Case Management)oChildren and Youth servicesoJuvenile Court ServicesoDrug and Alcohol ServicesoDepartment of Human Service AdministrationoPublic SchoolsoGuardian Ad LitemoFamilyoWorker(s)Clinic meetings are convened by the CASSP Coordinator and are held weekly at a regularlyscheduled time or on an emergency basis when necessary. There are no formal rules forthese meetings, and participation is considered voluntary -- all of which has the value ofmaking the process truly participatory with a strong feeling of joint ownership. This has ledto a spirit of sharing, which is in stark contrast to the feeling of \"dumping\" and being\"dumped on\" that existed in the pre-Children's Clinic era.The Children's Clinic receives referrals from any one of a number of sources including anyone of the agency components of the department as well as the publics schools or from theIntermediate Unit. Of particular importance is the understanding that the \"child\" (him orherself) is not referred. Rather, it is the worker and the family together who are referred forthe development of an intervention plan. The referring worker is expected to notify theClinic's convener of the desire for a Clinic review of a family's service need; the review thenis scheduled related to the urgency of need. The only required paper work that accompaniesa referral is a referral form which includes a problem statement, a family genogram, and ahistory of prior services. The referral procedure also requires a formalized risk assessmentto be performed using the Risk Factor Matrix. Also required is a release of informationacross agencies and components of agencies to allow for full participation and discussion.After initial introductions at the Clinic meeting, both the worker and the family members aregiven the opportunity to present the problems as they see them. This may include problemsin the access and delivery of prior services as seen by the family. Conversely, the workermay note problems of compliance with a treatment plan by individual family members.Honesty and a true lack of blaming can allow this to be a productive interchange thatultimately leads to the discussion of what services now need to be provided.Group consensus about the treatment plan is reached through sharing and discussion.Program representatives are present to offer the pros and cons of any particular treatmentmodality. Since the county has developed a wide range of service alternatives, the discussionusually leads to the identification of an array of appropriate and available services. Fromthis, a Family Service Plan is developed. 32 The Family Service Plan is the document that results from the Children's Clinic teammeeting. This document presents the goals of intervention, the services to be provided (withthe name of the specific workers), a set objectives (with plans for action), the key responsibleperson (which could be the parent), and a prospective completion date. The document alsoincludes a section labeled \"Methods Used to Involve Parents\" which not only reports onfamily involvement in the planning process, but also reminds the team of the need formeaningful family participation in service delivery If the child is placed out-of-home, aseparate section of the Family Service Plan is completed called the \"Placement Amendment.\"This section includes the reason for placement, efforts to prevent placement, theappropriateness of placement, placement goals, needs for reunification (if appropriate),services to be provided, objectives, and methods used to involve parents in the Family ServicePlan. The plan and the amendment both describe the rights of parents to appeal if they donot agree with the plan and will not sign the forms.Funding of the services specified in a Family Service Plan often becomes an issue. The jointproblem-solving capacity of the Children's Clinic team can lead to collective solution of fiscalproblems. This, on occasion, includes joint funding of a program or a program component.The emphasis is \"What can we do together in order to get this plan implemented?,\" ratherthan the more typical, \"I can't do it, you have to.\" There are no flexible funds available tothe Children's Clinic at this time, but the department is exploring potential mechanisms forthis.Resolving problems among agencies or agency components is a major part of the FamilyService Plan development. When issues cannot be resolved in the team meeting, they arebrought to the department director for resolution. The most common problems concern thecommitment of services not directly controlled by the participants of the Children's Clinic.For example, the child welfare component, feeling that it has a legal mandate, sometimesmay not think that foster care decisions should be made by the Children's Clinic. While mostof the time this type of issue is resolved by the team and consensus is reached, there areinstances in which the team wishes the child to be placed in foster care and the Children andYouth Services component refuses to make such a placement. At this point, the issue isresolved in consultation with the department director.The Family Service Plan is reviewed on a periodic basis, as determined in the plan itself.This review is cause for another meeting of the Children's Clinic team involved with thefamily. At that time, modifications of the plan and its services can be made. A review canalso be held on an emergency basis, if necessary. When the need for intensive mental healthor multiple services ceases, the family is discharged from the Children's Clinic. IX. SYSTEM OF CARE ACTIVITIES Family InvolvementPerhaps the most important aspect of the Northumberland County system of care is theintegral role of families. The underlying philosophy of the system of care is that naturalfamilies are the most important resource for a child or adolescent. Even in those instances 33 when youngsters cannot live at home, the family is included in the service planning anddelivery process. The Children's Clinic operates with the parents as team members. Whilemost parents approach the Clinic with some fear and trepidation, the process has beenconstructed in such a way that, by the end of the first Clinic meeting about their child, theparents have been made to feel that their input is vital to the process and that their concernsabout the services to be provided to them and their child have been addressed. While parentsdo not always completely agree with the final service plan for their family, they do leave theClinic meeting knowing that they have been heard and understanding why the majority ofthe Clinic team feels that a certain plan is valid within the context of the parent's objections.While such parent/professional team efforts are theoretically sound, many similar teamsacross the nation may struggle because the professionals have difficulty fully accepting therole of the parents and may appear patronizing or condescending as they tell the family whatthe service plan should be. This does not occur in the Children's Clinic where the family-based philosophy appears to be fully accepted by the professionals. The Clinic is currentlyexploring the feasibility of making a parent, or parent representative, a regular member.Another reflection of the family-based focus of the system of care is the predominance ofservice components that stress family involvement. All outpatient mental health services areoffered from a family therapy perspective. A new emphasis in foster care is to have fosterparents work with natural parents in an effort to facilitate reunification. The newestprogram of the agency is the Parent Center which is run by parents and provides support andtraining to enhance parenting skills.The development of a family support groups for parents of children with severe emotionaldisturbances has been slow. While the system understands the need for this kind of vehicle,the degree of involvement of parents in the Children's Clinic and the Parent Center hasheightened awareness of the need for a parent support network. It is anticipated that sucha parent support/advocacy group will be developed in the near future.Cultural CompetenceOne of the glaring gaps in the Northumberland County system of care is in the area ofcultural competence. County human service professionals readily agree that they have littleto offer the small minority population in the county. They are aware of the growing Hispanicpopulation leaving New York City and migrating to the county, and they know that theagency lacks staff that is culturally competent to work with this specific population that isstruggling with ethnic issues as well as the transition from an urban to a rural environment.They are further aware that in a county with a 99.6 percent white population, minority groupmembers' needs often are overlooked. Plans are currently in place to provide some trainingon cultural issues.TransitionAdolescents who are ready to transition from families to independent living and fromchildren's to adult services are supported by several programs in the Northumberland Countysystem of care. Transitions from children's to adult services are made easier in this systemby virtue of the unified nature of the agency and the representation of all agency componentsin the Children's Clinic. The limited size of the county and the Department of Human34 Services also makes the informal connections between agencies work better for youth who aretransitioning from one service to another.Specific programs that facilitate transition, all described previously, are not necessarilylabeled as such, yet have features that serve this purpose. CLANCY, for example, has arehabilitation focus that helps teach independent living and social skills, offers a GED, andprovides job training and job coaching. Transitioning adolescents are prime beneficiaries ofthese services, although younger adolescents also partake of them. Additionally, Childrenand Youth Services offers an Independent Living Program for older adolescents who aregetting ready for emancipation.Populations at High RiskWhile most of the traditional high-risk groups such as homeless/runaway youth, those whoare HIV infected or at risk for AIDS, and children of parents with chronic mental illness arenot of great prevalence in Northumberland County, it is noteworthy that the Department ofHuman Services has developed the capacity to deliver services to youth through analternative service mechanism. This is done within the agency through the CLANCYProgram which was created to meet the needs of youth who were not benefitirg from thetraditional agency services. Alternative services initially took the form of day treatment andspecial alternative schooling, but have been expanded to include the transition programsmentioned above, therapeutic camp, and other programs that work with youth who have beenalienated and/or do not respond well to more traditional services. CLANCY has the capacityto change its programs to meet the changing needs of the youth that it serves. With thistype of alternative service structure, the system of care is in a good position to create thoseservices that might be needed by any high-risk group that becomes evident in the county.AdvocacyAdvocacy for children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbances in NorthumberlandCounty is primarily focused on CASSP. The CASSP Coordinator has the role of conveningthe appropriate advocates in the community to create and put forth an advocacy agenda.This activity has included all participants in the service system including programmanagement and service delivery personnel and consumers. The CASSP Team also has anongoing needs assessment function, identifying service gaps that need attention.The Central Susquehanna Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an affiliate of the National Alliancefor the Mentally Ill (NAMI), had been a strong force in Northumberland County over the last10 years, but no Alliance for the Mentally Ill-Child and Adolescent Network (AMI-CAN) orParents In Need (PIN) groups have been started in the county. The county recognizes theneed for a parent advocacy group to assist in the further development of the system of care. X. FINANCING The Northumberland County Department of Human Services uses traditional fundingstreams for the financing of its services. Through a series of state block grants, state35 categorical grants, and allocations of local tax dollars, it weaves together the funding for anarray of services.Categorical dollars are used to fund the programs for which they aremandated. The agency uses the greatest amount of flexibility possible in moving thesemandated funds into programs that qualify, often using innovative thinking to do so. Stateblock grants are used to fund the basic mental health, mental retardation, child welfare, andjuvenile justice programs, with the remainder being used to fund new initiatives,unsupported liaison and training functions, and to fill in when funding for other componentsruns short. For the mental health components of the system, the major funding source is thestate mental health/mental retardation allocation. Out of this comes the funding for the BaseService Unit and some of the services offered by NCCS.Most of the treatment plans developed by the Children's Clinic are jointly funded. Thisoccurs through each agency component or community agency outside of the Department ofHuman Services agreeing to pick up the cost of the care under its component. For example,a family may require mental health treatment which is provided in NCCS by mental healthand may also need shelter or respite which is provided by Children and Youth Services.Several programs are jointly funded. The most prominent of these is the CommunityResidential Rehabilitation (CRR) Host Home Program of therapeutic foster care. Thisprogram is shared by mental health and child welfare through both joint funding and jointstaffing. For each day of care, Children and Youth Services provides $20 (using Title IVEdollars) and Mental Health $4 (using the block allocation). In addition, Juvenile Court Services can provide funds for its children in CRR through the use of Title IVE fundsavailable to them. The program has staff primarily provided by Children and Youth Services,but the coordinator, who also acts as the clinical supervisor, is paid by mental health. WhileHomekeepers, the intensive mental health home-based treatment program, is fully fundedby a categorical state mental health grant, it, too, is jointly staffed, with one of its threefamily workers supported by Children and Youth Services.The CLANCY alternative youth program is jointly funded in another way. This program ismade up of several component programs which act together to meet a variety of the needsof the youth that it serves. These include job training, counseling, GED service, day camp,and social skills training.Various program elements are funded by different agencycomponents, often with categorical grants. While this program administratively sits in aSpecial Services Unit of the Juvenile Court Services component of the agency and most of itsservices are funded with juvenile probation funds, the social rehabilitation program is fundedat $50,000 through mental health. Additionally, CLANCY serves youth from all componentsof the agency who are referred through the Children's Clinic, regardless of whether or notthey are committed to Juvenile Court Services.The Parent Center is another jointly funded program. Originally funded by a grant from theGovernor's Drug Council, it currently is funded by Mental Health, Children and Youth, andDrug and Alcohol Services. The county blends discretionary funds from each of these budgetsto support the staffing and other expenses for this new program.The Student Assistance Program (SAP) is a state program for working with at-risk studentsin schools.It is funded through a state blending of drug and alcohol, mental health, andeducation dollars.While this is not local blending of funds, it acts as a model in the36 4 5- community for this type of program. One of the gaps within the county system is thatneither the school districts nor the Intermediate Unit for special education have participatedin joint funding with Human Services beyond the SAP. This has been further complicatedby the duplication of day treatment services by the Human Services Agency and the schools.However, through the schools' participation in the Children's Clinic, it is anticipated that theschools and the Intermediate Unit will become better partners in the future.There currently is no capacity for flexible funding of services or pooling of funds for specialuse on an individual case basis. On some occasions, petty cash funds are used to meet someneeds that are not covered by the programs in the system. This does not afford a great dealof flexibility, and the lack of this type of resource is seen as a gap by the system. XI. EVALUATION While there has been no formal evaluation of the Northumberland County system of care, theDepartment of Human Services has developed a Management Information System (MIS) thatoffers adequate capacity to track the success of most system components and to track themajor system outcome measures -- the reduction of out-of-home placement and theeradication of institutional placements. The Human Services Management Teamunderstands the importance of data in planning for current and future programming andfeels strongly that data is vital in the justification of spending funds on new and innovativeprograms. There is an understanding that in both planning and program development areas,only strongly supported outcome data will allow continued growth in new directions.The Human Services Department has committed significant resources in the last severalyears to the development of a cross-agency MIS. Funded originally through a state crime anddelinquency grant, this MIS provides an interactive database across each of the Departmentof Human Services component agencies. Each categorical program has a specializedinformation system to meet its own unique needs, and there is also an interactive cross-system mechanism which allows for tracking of children and families across the variouscomponent agencies. While it feels that it has made great strides in the area of MIS, theagency thinks that the sophistication of the MIS should be increased in order to better trackindividual children and families within and across service components. Ultimate:y, thedepartment hopes to improve the system to the point where it can integrate the MIS with onecurrently in use in the special education Intermediate Unit (the Intermediate Unit SpecialEducation Child Tracking System) and, ultimately, with the local school district informationsystems.A primary measure of system effectiveness has been the reduction and virtual eliminationof institutional placements and hospitalizations. While not a sophisticated mechanism, theHuman Services Management Team and the Children's Clinic use this basic data to track thesuccess of the system. They work from an assumption that community-based, home-based,and family-centered care leads to equal, if not better, outcomes than a system that supportsmore institutional options. The data used to confirm this assumption are primarily anecdotaland based on clinicians' impressions of how the children and families do relative to how theydid under the old system.37 County data demonstrate that the current service continuum and related coordination andindividualized service planning mechanisms have resulted in significant reduction ofrestrictive residential placements. The number of residential/institutional programs droppedfrom 12 in 1985 to none in 1990 and 1991. Similarly, group home placements have beeneliminated, from two to four in 1985-1986 to none since 1988. The use of Medicaid dollarsto fund hospitalizations has dropped over the same period of time from a high of $148,000in 1986-1987 to $65,000 in 1990-1991.This drop in utilization of the most restrictive placements was at first reflected in an increasein county-operated and county-purchased foster care placements, which peaked at 220 in1987. This is related to the use of both regular and therapeutic foster care by the system,and reflects the capacity to keep more disturbed children in these types of placementsthrough the availability of supportive services obtained through the Children's Clinic. Withthe advent of Homekeepers and other home-based services, the number of foster careplacements has now dropped below 120. These reduced numbers include increased utilizationof foster care for crisis shelter placement, respite for children and/or families, and intensivetherapeutic placements as well as for traditional protective placements. With these new usesof foster care considered, the relative numbers of foster care placements has actually fallento a greater extent than the numbers indicate on the surface. XII. MAJOR STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES Participants representing each of the agency components and other community constituenciesin the Northumberland County system of care have identified several factors that drive thesystem and have made it successful. The major strengths of the Northumberland Countysystem include the following:oLeadership - Far and away the most commonly stated factor influencing the successof the development and continuation of the Northumberland County system is itsleadership. Beginning with the feeling among agency directors that the system wasnot working, and mirrored by the desire of the County Commissioners for a moreresponsive system, the county began in the mid-1980's to move ahead toward a newsystem of care. The vesting of power by the County Commissioners in the rightindividual at the crucial first moments of system's change was a most important factorin the development of the system's vision, structure, and acceptance by the agencydirectors. That individual not only reflected the prevailing spirit of the need forchange, but also added two vital ingredients. The first of these was the ability tomake the kinds of deals with the Commissioners that would consolidate the system'scomponents. The second was the capacity to convince other individuals in leadershippositions that, by joining together under his leadership, they would all move towardtheir goal of a more functional system of care. To do this, the director relied on hisown vision of the system and a management structure which shared the power in anonthreatening way, while at the same time acting as a strong and powerful leader.oSystem Management - The system, as it has developed, has a unique managementstyle that is generally accepted as a strength. The management of the system384 7 operates at several interactive levels. The first of these is the Human ServicesManagement Team which consists of the directors of the various agency componentsof the Department of Human Services. It regularly reviews the service needs that areidentified by the Children's Clinic and by the other multidisciplinary service planningsystems which have developed. This team serves as the focal point for all policydevelopment and refinement within the Department of Human Services. The teamhas the capacity to wcek together creatively on such issues as cross-system trainingand blended funding as well as on the planning for new agency components. Thedevelopment of the Parent Center is an example of how system needs can be solvedby joint decision making and funding.A second level of management is the Quality Circle process which is the annual self-assessment conducted by the department. Through this process, staff at all levelswithin the agency are encouraged to work together to identify weakness and utilizeexisting talents within the agency to correct them. This process not only empowersstaff at all levels to feel part of the decision making process, but also requires theupper level management to be responsive to the assessment and development capacityof the entire agency.This process ultimately lets all staff feel as though thedepartment is \"their\" agency and that their concerns about children and families canand will be heard and addressed.The Children's Clinic is another level of management. While created as a clinicalcoordination and not as a management tool, the Clinic operates in a way thatencourages creativity in system planning in addition to developing individualtreatment plans. The directors of the various component agencies are represented andoften personally sit in on Children's Clinic meetings. As noted, input from thesemeetings regarding system gaps and problems is immediately fed back to the HumanServices Management Team. Thus, policy making and clinical practice have constantinteraction, assuring that the policy decisions are relevant to clinical and other familyneeds.Through their participation in the Children's Clinic, parents and otheragencies, especially the schools, have access to the decision making of the HumanServices Management Team.A fourth level of management of the system comes through the local CASSP Team.Like the Children's Clinic, representation on CASSP includes not only the directorsof the agency components of the department, but also representatives of the schooldistricts and the Special Education Intermediate Unit. Within the context of theCASSP Team, each of these agencies has an impact on the decision making of thesystem of care. As the CASSP Team has developed, the participants have felt that ithas acted as a conscience for the system. oProblem-Solving Approach - The style of management in the NorthumberlandCounty system encourages a problem-solving approach that is empowered by thesystem. Frequently heard in interviews with upper management were comments ontheir expectations of line staff such as, \"Let them do it;\" \"Creativity is more thanvalued, it is expected;\" and \"Do what you have to.\" Inherent in these phrases is theunderstanding that the staff are in touch with the needs of children and families andthat the system is there to meet those needs. The system then must be created and39 directed in a manner that enables the staff to do what is necessary, even when thatmeans bend Ong or even changing the system. System boundaries and regulationsgenerally are seen as barriers, and the prevailing approach is to tear down or defeatthem when necessary.oShared Vision - Among the leaders and staff of the Department of Human Servicesis a unitary vision which is seen as a strength in the system. Since at least 1984, thesystem has been driven by individuals who have shared certain understandings ofwhat the delivery of services is all about. With a degree of luck and natural attrition,the system is currently staffed with a vast majority of individuals that have a sharedmission. The most important aspects of this shared vision are that: 1) families arefirst; 2) services should be provided in the community; 3) the system is in place toserve the needs of individuals and families in the community; and 4) the needs of theon-line providers of services also must be met. As one division director stated, \"Whois the client?It is the community, the providers, and the families!\" With the CASSPTeam acting as the watchdog and conscience of the system, these principles are inconstant discussion. There appears to be an implicit understanding that if the visionis not always kept prominent, that the system will have a natural bureaucratictendency to revert.oUnique Concept of the Continuum of Care - The Northumberland County systemoperates its services with a unique understanding of the continuum of care. Ratherthan working from the assumption that the least intensive intervention is outpatientpsychotherapy, there are several less-intensive levels. These levels include servicessuch as referral, assessment, crisis intervention, basic-level case management, at-riskgroups, AA, and parent skills groups. The result of this conceptualization of thecontinuum of care is that every case worker, teacher, or other worker is included asan important member of the team, regardless of the fact that he or she is notperforming interventions that are traditionally seen as \"therapy.\" Each worker andeach service can and will be of use in various individual intervention plans. oFamily Focus and Parent Participation - The participants in this system trulybelieve that the family is the most important resource for a child. This basic premiseleads to the understanding that services should meet the needs of the family and thatthe family must be part of the system in order for this to occur. Unlike many settingsin which the family-centered rhetoric is not reflected in interactions with families, inNorthumberland County, professionals work with families to encourage them to bepart of the system and to believe that the system is geared to meet their needs. Manyof these families have had negative experiences with the system in the past, and thereis a heavy burden on the current system to prove that it is different. The family-oriented vision keeps the whole system on track. oCommunity Characteristics - The people who live and work in NorthumberlandCounty see themselves as tough. One described their \"coal region stamina\" as a majorfactor in tackling the difficult job of meeting the needs of troubled families. Thisfeeling of self- and community-reliance has brought people together to make the bestout of what was felt to be a terribly inadequate system of care. The building of the 404 'd current system has taken a great amount of effort, and the people of this communityhave been more than up to the task.In spite of the success of the system building efforts in the county, several issues have yetto be resolved. These include: oCategorical Agency Regulations - The participants in the system feel bound bycategorical restraints placed upon them by state funding streams and legalities. Themost frequently cited problem is the one presented by foster care regulations. Thesystem uses foster care and therapeutic foster care to meet many needs. However,these services are funded through child welfare and are bound by state child welfareregulations. This means that any child or adolescent who needs placement in sucha setting for more than 30 days must be committed by the court to the department'schild welfare programs.While ability to place for an initial 30 days withoutcommitment is longer than in many states, and most placements can be terminatedwithin this time period, this regulation still places a burden on the system that iscontrary to its philosophy. These conflicts between regulation and system philosophyimpede system development. oA Formal Gateway to More Intensive Services - Regardless of the success of theChildren's Clinic in reducing institutional placements, the lack of a formal gatekeeperin the county system allows the schools and private sector agencies to continue tomake restrictive placements. Until this type of mechanism can be developed for allparts of the service system, there will be cases that are placed in long-term residentialand hospital programs instead of receiving the less restrictive services that areavailable in the system of care. oTurnover - A frequently mentioned problem in the system of care is staff turnover.In spite of the management structures and the shared vision which encourageempowerment of staff, certain jobs in the system lead to burn out. This is especiallytrue of the more traditional child protection positions. These workers rarely areafforded the luxury of being part of the exciting new system because they are too busycoping with an ever-growing problem of child abuse and neglect. Even this innovativeservice system has not determined I--cw to expand some of its exciting philosophy andsupport to this overworked segment of the staff. Another aspect of turnover relatesto the national problem of underpayment of human service workers, especially inpublic systems.This is true in Northumberland County as well, where there iscompetition both in terms of pay and excitement with larger cities in the state. oLagging Agencies - While the Department of Human Services' components all havebecome active partners in the system of care and all of its coordination andmanagement structures, some community agencies have been slower in becomingwilling partners.This has been especially true with the school districts, theIntermediate Unit, and the programs at the Geisinger Medical Center. The schoolswere slow to see the Children's Clinic as a gateway for their more intensive services.However, over time the benefits of participation and the success of joint programminghave become apparent, and they are now becoming more active partners. The Geisinger Hospital's mental health programs still tend to operate outside ofthe41 system of care.While it is true that the medical staff of the hospital work asmedical/psychiatric consultants to this system, they are not members of the Children'sClinic or the CASSP Team.The most evident result of reluctant participation by some community agencies hasbeen the duplication of services. Day treatment/day school programs have been runby the Department of Human Services' CLANCY program for many years. Yet thepublic school Intermediate Unit has recently set up its own Day School Program, andthe Geisinger Hospital has also instituted a Day Treatment Program. The system ofcare would be better served if all service providers saw themselves as part of thesystem and planned services jointly. oCultural Competence - The county has a rapidly expanding minority population andfeels that it has not adapted its services to be delivered in a culturally competentmanner. It hopes to hire more minority staff and to train current staff on culturaland ethnic issues. However, it is difficult to recruit minority professionals to live inrural areas with a vastly white majority. oFlexible Funding - A pool of flexible funds is felt to be needed to afford theChildren's Clinic full creativity in implementing appropriate and responsive serviceplans. These noncategorical funds would support services to children not eligible furMedical Assistance or for third party support. Flexible funds would also allow theprovision of nontraditional services which are not funded through any existing fundingstreams and which are unavailable in the current continuum of care. oShort-Term Crisis Hospitalization - There are currently no psychiatric beds foryounger children within 60 miles of the county. On those rare occasions in which itis necessary to hospitalize a child under age 12, resources must be sought outside ofthe community. This is felt to disrupt the service plan and to defeat the family-centered, community-based philosophy of the system of care. Currently, the onlyalternative is therapeutic foster care. oParent Support and Advocacy - In a system that places such a high priority on theparticipation of parents in the care of their children, it is curious that a strong parentsupport and advocacy network has not developed. This may be due to the fact thatthe inclusion of families in the system has been so effective that a parent network hasnot been necessary and, therefore, has not been seen as a high priority in thedevelopment of the system. However, the participants in the system currently feelthat such a parent advocacy and support capacity is important as the system developsfurther and plan to facilitate the development of this capacity in the future.Beginning in 1992, the county has obtained a new grant from the state which will provideservices to address many of the weaknesses identified by the system. This Living In FamilyEnvironment (LIFE) grant will provide funds to do the following: oEnhance the \"Gatekeeping\" Function - While there has been considerable successin reducing the need for hospitalization for children and adolescents served in theprivate sector, this grant will create a \"managed care capacity\" in the county by hiring42 U.1 a consultant to work wits a variety of insurance carriers and health maintenanceorganizations to encourage them to buy hospital diversion services from the countysystem of care. oIncrease Family Support Services - To enhance family support services, the newgrant will allow the implementation of a family-driven cash support model which willprovide a specific cash payment to families of emotionally disturbed children andadolescents to enanle them to secure appropriate support services, including respite.This would be similar to a current program for families served by the mentalretardation system. oEnhance Cultural Competency - The increasing minority population necessitatesa comprehensive, ongoing training program to develop an understanding of culturaldifferences and to increase the ability of staff to appropriately meet the special needsof the minority population. Beyond training, the project aims to appoint minoritygroup members to various policy groups and to recruit minority staff. oEnhance Intensive Case Management and Homekeepers Services - It isrecognized that the demand for these services is growing and, in order to meet countymandates for service, the capacity to provide them must be expanded to prevent futureinstitutionalization.oExpand and Develop an Array of School-Based Services - The geographiccharacteristics of the county continue to impede access to centrally delivered services.The development and expansion of services in the schools will serve as a vehicle todecentralize services in each of the communities in the county and to make themreadily available to children and families in their own communities. This will includeexpanding the group counseling services currently provided in all school districts.Increased liaison with the schools generated by these services will lead to moreopportunities for working jointly toward expanded training and toward increasedschool-based services.An example of a program under consideration is socialrehabilitation with a built-in opportunity for outward bound experiences. oDevelop an Integrated Management Information System - Under the new grant,the county will enhance the capacity of its MIS to track children and families acrossagencies and within the department. The improvements will allow the Departmentof Human Services to better monitor its service capacity needs and, ultimately, willlead to the integration of human service and special education data systems. oDevelop Short-Term Hospital Crisis Stabilization Capacity - The grant willallow the development of an alternative method for providing short-term inpatientcrisis stabilization services for children under the age of 12. This will, hopefully,involve the use of general pediatric beds in the Geisinger Hospital, with added supportfor the child and staff.One of the strengths of a system is the ability to recognize its weaknesses and to be able tocontinue to build the system in order to overcome those deficits. This is one of the clearstrengths of the Northumberland County system. Regardless of the degree of success that43 already has been attained, the county is working to fill the identified gaps. Its managementstructure also encourages the system to change as the needs of the community change. Theaccomplishments of this system of care are the result of hard work, constant negotiation, andconstructive response to ongoing change. These accomplishments did not occur overnight.Rather, they have been the result of many months and years of building on what and whowas there, and then building again upon these results, and then building again. The systemthat is now in place could not have been conceived of in 1984 when the change process began,and the system that is in place in the year 2000 will, hopefully, be equally innovative. XIII. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES Northumberland County has developed significant expertise in providing technical assistanceand consultation to other counties in their efforts to develop a coordinated service deliverysystem and to enhance their system of care. The county human services management staffis committed to increasing its ability to convey the various outcomes and technologies whichhave enabled them to improve their service capacity. They have developed some technicalassistance information concerning the Children's Clinic including a video describing the Clinicand a brochure, \"Service Description of the Children's Clinic.\" Additionally, staff are in theprocess of developing a set of handouts for parents on early intervention services. 445,4 N PT-14 UM i3LAINT15W501:11-CHILDREN ' Birth: ____/____/_--_____(mm) (yyyy)Age time of Referral: ____ FAMILY Home (____) Child lives with: SIBLINGS IN AND OUT OF HOME / OTHER INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH CLIENT:Lives M F// Y N 3.

Profiles of Local Systems of Carefor Children and Adolescentswith Severe Emotional Disturbances RICHLAND COUNTY, OHIO Prepared By:Beth A. Stroul, M.Ed. CASSP Technical Assistance CenterCenter for Child Health & Mental Health PolicyGeorgetown University Child Development CenterFunded by the National Institute of Mental HealthChild and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP)July 1992 INTRODUCTION This case study was developed through a project conducted by the Child and AdolescentService System Program (CASSP) Technical Assistance Center at Georgetown University.It is part of a descriptive study of local systems of care which was initiated in 1990 andfunded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Child and Adolescent ServiceSystem Program. The project has involved identifying and studying communities which havemade substantial progress toward developing comprehensive, coordinated, community-basedsystems of care for children and adolescents who are severely emotionally disturbed and theirfamilies. Individual case studies of each local system of care are the products of this effortand are intended as technical assistance resources.Systems of care for troubled children and adolescents have been of great interest over the lastseveral years. In 1982, Knitzer estimated in her seminal study, Unclaimed Children, thatof the three million children with serious emotional disturbances, two-thirds were receivingno treatment whatsoever and countless others were receiving inappropriately restrictive carebecause of the lack of community-based service alternatives. In 1986, Saxe conducted a studyfor the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress which confirmedKnitzer's findings and stated that \"Mental health problems are a source of suffering forchildren, difficulties for their families, and great loss for society. Though such problems aresometimes tragic, an even greater tragedy may be that we currently know more about howto prevent and treat children's mental health problems than is reflected in the careavailable.\"In response to these problems and to the growing number of calls for change, the NationalInstitute of Mental Health launched the Child and Adolescent Service System Program(CASSP) in 1984 to assist states and communities in developing community-based systemsof care for this underserved population. Through grants and technical assistance activities,CASSP has supported the development of interagency efforts to improve the services providedto the most troubled children and youth and their families. To provide a conceptualframework for system of care development, CASSP supported the publishing of A System ofCare for Severely Emotionally Disturbed Children & Youth by Stroul and Friedman in 1986.This monograph has been called a blueprint for action in the child mental health field, andit describes the various service options required by these youngsters and the need for servicesacross all of the relevant child-serving agencies. From these components, Stroul and Friedman proposed a design for a \"system of care\" encompassing both the full range ofservices and the mechanisms required for the assurance of their appropriate delivery.Currently, there is widespread agreement that community-based systems of care foryoungsters who are severely emotionally disturbed and their families are needed, and thedevelopment of these systems has become a national goal.Despite the calls for such systems of care, until recently there were few, if any, examples oflocal systems of care which combined an array of community-based services with otheressential elements including interagency collaboration and case management. Today, thereis what might be described as an explosion of activity related to system of care development.The activities of CASSP, which have now involved every state, have played a crucial role instimulating system development at state and local levels. Increased attention to children's mental health by advocacy groups also has had a major impact. Further, system building hasbeen advanced significantly by initiatives such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation'sMental Health Services Program for Youth, which has provided funds for the developmentof systems of care in selected local areas, and extensive system development initiatives in anumber of states. As a result, many communities now have evolving systems of care whichcan be studied and described. Descriptions of the system building approach and experien'of these communities are designed to assist other communities which are attempting todevelop such systems.Potential sites for inclusion in this study were identified through a process of consultationwith key informants including individuals at national and state levels who have extensiveknowledge of developments in the children's mental health field and in the development oflocal systems of care in particular. Through these initial discussions, approximately 20communities were identified. These localities were characterized as having made significantprogress toward the development of community-based systems of care consistent with thephilosophy and principles which have been promoted by CASSP and which are displayed onthe following page. Accordingly, an attempt was made to locate local systems which arefamily focused, emphasize treatment in the least restrictive environment, involve multipleagencies, individualize services, and so forth. Similarly, an attempt was made to locatesystems which have moved beyond the more traditional outpatient, inpatient, and residentialtreatment services and have begun to develop a more complete and balanced array ofnonresidential and residential services including home-based services, day treatment, crisisservices, therapeutic foster care, respite care, case management and others.The second phase of the selection process involved extensive telephone interviews with arepresentative from each site to obtain detailed information about the array of servicesavailable in the community, the nature and functioning of the system level coordinationmechanisms, and the nature and functioning of the client level coordination or casemanagement mechanisms. In addition, information was collected about any special systemactivities related to such issues as financing the system, evaluating the system, involvingfamilies in planning and delivering services, and enhancing the cultural competence of thesystem of care. A chart was prepared for each potential site summarizing the service array,system level coordination mechanisms, and client level coordination mechanisms.Selection of sites for further study was accomplished with the assistance of an advisorycommittee and was based on the following set of criteria: 1.Must have a range of services in place (home-based services, crisis services,therapeutic foster care, and others).2.Must have interagency coordination mechanisms in place.3.Must have client level coordination mechanisms in place, e.g., case management.4.Must be a sufficiently well-developed local system to be able to serve as a usefulexample to the field and to receive national attention. ii: -I <1 CORE VALUES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.The system of care should be child-centered and family-focused, with the needs of thechild and family dictating the types and mix of services provided.2.The system of care should be community-based, with the locus of services as well asmanagement and decision-making responsibility resting at the community level. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.Emotionally disturbed children should have access to a comprehensive array ofservices that address the child's physical, emotional, social, and educational needs.2.Emotionally disturbed children should receive individualized services in accordancewith the unique needs and potentials of each child and guided by an individualizedservice plan.3.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services within the least restrictive,most normative environment that is clinically appropriate.4.The families and surrogate families of emotionally disturbed children should be fullparticipants in all aspects of the planning and delivery of services.5.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services that are integrated, withlinkages ',etween child-caring agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning,developing and coordinating services.6.Emotionally disturbed children should be provided with case management or similarmechanisms to ensure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated andtherapeutic m.nner and that they can move through the system of services inaccordance with their changing needs.7.Early identification and intervention for children with emotional problems should bepromoted by the system of care in order to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes.8.Emotionally disturbed children should be ensured smooth transitions to the adultservice system as they reach maturity.9.The rights of emotionally disturbed children should be protected, and effectiveadvocacy efforts for emotionally disturbed children and youth should be promoted.10.Emotionally disturbed children should receive culturally competent services which aresensitive and responsive to cultural differences and special needs and are providedwithout regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, physical disability, or othercharacteristics.iii 5.Should have some noteworthy activities in one or more areas including familyinvolvement, cultural competence, transition, high-risk children and adolescents,fmancing, and evaluation.An initial group of five communities was selected for site visits by the project team. The sitevisits generally involved spending three to four days in each community engaged in a varietyof activities designed to provide insight into the functioning of the system of care. Theseactivities included interviews with a number of individuals and groups including key systemmanagers, senior management representatives of the major child-serving agencies (mentalhealth, child welfare, education, and juvenile justice), case managers, youngsters, parents,and advocates.Additionally, the schedules included visits to three or more servicecomponents in the system of care where activities were observed and discussions held withprogram managers, staff, and, in some cases, clients. An important aspect of the site visitswas observing the functioning of interagency entities. Site visitors attended meetings ofinteragency entities focusing on system-level coordination as well as meetings of interagencyteams organized for the purpose of creating individualized service plans for specificyoungsters and their families. The site visits provided a wealth of information about eachsystem of care -- its developmental milestones, strengths, and obstacles yet to be overcome.The sample of communities studied yield valuable insights into the process of buildingsystems of care.Due to an enormous increase in system development activities incommunities across the nation, there currently are many more noteworthy examples of localsystems of care. It should be emphasized that none of the communities selected for studyhave fully developed systems of care, and all are struggling to overcome financial and otherobstacles to system development. Rather, they are communities which have succeeded inputting some basic building blocks into place and have demonstrated progress towardachieving system development goals. The resulting case studies are intended to serve astechnical assistance resources for other states and communities as they approach thechallenge of developing local systems of care for youngsters with severe emotionaldisturbances and their families.

COMMUNITY CONTEXT The system of care to be described serves children and families of Richland County, Ohio,situated in the north central region of the state. The county is chiefly identified as rural, butis located approximately midway between the cities of Cleveland and Columbus and ispositioned along the major transportation routes between these two urban centers. As aresult of its location, an urban influence on the character of the community is reported. TheCity of Mansfield, which is the county seat, is described as a small city which is a microcosmof Cleveland and Columbus.The population of Richland County was 126,137 in 1990, a slight decrease from the 1980population figure of 131,205. Approximately 40 percent of the county's populace resides inMansfield, which had a population numbering 50,627 in 1990. The next largest populationcenter is the city of Shelby with a population of 9,564. The remainder of the county consistsof a series of small villages and communities spread over a 420-square-mile rural area.Census data from 1980 indicate that the vast majority of the Richland County populadon iswhite, 91 percent. Approximately nine percent of the residents belong to minority groups,with most being African Americans. Much of the African American population isconcentrated in Mansfield where the minority population is 19.8 percent. Less than onepercent of the county's population is comprised of Native Americans, Asians, and Hispanics.During the growing season, the county experiences an influx of migrant workers whose needsmust be considered. Additionally, a small group of Japanese families (currently numberingnine) reside in the county on five-year working visas primarily for managerial roles. Effortshave been made to accommodate these families, including organizing a Japanese SaturdaySchool for youngsters in kindergarten through 12th grades at the Ohio State UniversityMansfield Campus.Census data further indicate that the median family income in 1990 was $35,600, andapproximately seven percent of Richland County's families were below poverty level. ForAfrican American families residing in the county, poverty was much more pervasive with 26percent falling below the poverty line. At that time, approximately one-third of the county'spopulation was comprised of children and adolescents, age 18 or under, and there is someevidence that social and economic problems affect many of Richland County's children. Datacited in a recent application for an early intervention preschool program indicate thatapproximately 23 percent of Richland County's student population comes from families livingin poverty, 22 percent were born out of wedlock, 16 percent were born to teenage mothers,and 13 percent receive public assistance.The primary sources of income for Richland County are provided by a combination of industryand farming.For the past 50 years manufacturing dominated the county's economy.However, local industry was extremely hard hit by the recession of the late 1970s resultingin plant closings and general industrial decline. The closing of plants, such as Mansfield Tirein 1975, produced unemployment rates approaching 13 percent at the height of the recession. 4lJ The area has never completely recovered from this industrial decline, and more recently hassuffered the loss of additional companies such as Ohio Brass, White Consolidated Industries -Westinghouse Division, Peabody Barnes, and Techform Industries which was based in Shelby.Other employers are reducing their workforces. As a result, the community continued toexperience the net loss of a significant number of jobs in the 1980s.Since 1975, Richland County has been involved in aggressive efforts to retrain displacedworkers and to recruit new businesses to the area in order to rebuild its industrial base. Agreat deal of effort and collaboration among public and private sectors has been devoted torevitalizing the community's economy and to training and retraining the primarily blue collarworkforce. Community leaders report that a great dear has been accomplished to offsetprevious losses.Currently, Richland County is described as a community in transition, shifting to an economybased more upon service occupations and small businesses as well as manufacturing andagriculture. The largest current employers in the county include Chevrolet Pontiac CanadaDivision (General Motors), United Telephone Company of Ohio, and Empire Detroit Steel.Over 1500 farms operate in the county which yield crops, livestock, and associated products.In 1989, the unemployment rate for Richland County was 6.57 percent, a rate only slightlyhigher than the overall unemployment rate for Ohio. However, by August 1991 RichlandCounty's unemployment rate had grown to 9.8 percent as compared with a 6 percent stateunemployment rate, and Mansfield had the highest jobless rate among all Ohio's cities.The climate of Richland County is characterized by four seasons and cold winters;temperatures are frequently below freezing from mid-November to mid-March. Promotionalliterature describes the county as the \"last outpost of the Allegheny Mountain foothills,\" andtwo ski resorts are supported by the hilly terrain. Two state parks offer recreationalopportunities to the community as well. Higher education opportunities are provided by theMansfield Campus of Ohio State University and the North Central Technical College. Thesetwo institutions share a common campus and facilities. Ohio State University offers a varietyof associate, bachelor's, and some graduate programs, while the Technical College offersassociate degree programs.The most frequently cited challenge facing Richland County is the need for economicredevelopment in the community. Rebuilding the county's economic vitality involves not onlycreating jobs and training displaced workers, but also educating and training young peoplefor the employment market. Thus, jobs and job training are considered to be among the highest priority needs in the community.Substance abuse is also cited by many people as a significant and widespread problem in thecommunity, with the need for enhanced prevention as well as treatment activities for bothyoungsters and adults. Some agency executives indicated that problems facing the urbancenters of Cleveland and Columbus often surface in Mansfield several years later. As aresult, they anticipate an escalation of problems associated with drug abuse such as childrenof crack-addicted parents, AIDS babies, and the like. While these problems have not as yet been encountered in the community, it is recognized that planning for future social, health,and mental health services must anticipate these problems and consider needs for bothtreatment and placement resources. 2 A major strength of Richland County appears to be in the proactive attitude taken towardtackling problems facing the community coupled with a noteworthy history of collaborationamong public and private agencies and organizations. Relevant agencies and groups havecome together and designed initiatives to address problems including job training, economicdevelopment, substance abuse, educational reform, and early intervention as well as theneeds of troubled children. This history of collaborative efforts to solve community problemshas created an environment in Richland County that is us tiquely suited to the developmentof a community-based system of care for emotionally disturbed youngsters and their families.The human service system at the state level in Ohio consists of seven cabinet leveldepartments including Departments of Mental Health, Mental Retardation/DevelopmentalDisabilities, Youth Services, Human Services, Health, Education, and the recently createdDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services. While these agencies fund, regulate,and oversee local services, the service system in Ohio is largely county operated withcommunity boards planning and directing service delivery in many of the categorical areas.Thus, the service system environment in Richland County is seen as one of local control andautonomy, with community level responsibility and decision making.The following child-serving agencies and systems provide services in Richland County andare key players in the system of care: oMental Health: Richland County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board and TheCenter for Individual and Family Services (The Center), a contract agency of theMental Health Board oChild Welfare: Richland County Children Services Board oEducation: Boards of Education in 13 School Districts and the Richland County Boardof EducationoJuvenile Justice: Richland County Juvenile Court and Ohio Department of YouthServices Regional Office oHealth: Mansfield/Richland County Department of Health oMentalRetardation:Richland County Boardof MentalRetardationandDevelopmental Disabilities II. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF SYSTEM OF CARE DEVELOPMENT History of System of CareSystem building efforts on behalf of children and youth in Richland County date back to aseries of meetings of human services representatives which were initiated in the mid-1970sby the newly elected Juvenile Court Judge. The meetings included any agency ororganization involved in providing services to children end were used as a vehicle for sharing 3u information about each agency's role, responsibilities, and activities. The group becameknown as the Youth Services Coordinating Council (YSCC). Activities undertaken by theYSCC included a needs assessment and the compilation of a manual which described theservices cf each of the youth-serving agencies.Another outgrowth of the YSCC was the successful application for a grant from the LawEnforcement Assistance Administration in 1981 to support the hiring of staff to manage andpursue efforts to coordinate services for children and families.The three-year grant established the Youth Resource Center and provided resources to support a director,assistant, and secretary. The Youth Resource Center grant was not actually implementeduntil 1983 due to a number of difficulties including the recruitment of qualified staff. In addition to the start-up delays, further operational problems were attributed to a yearlyreduction in funding. By the third year, funds were available to support only a half-timeposition, and the scope of activities of the Resource Center was substantially reduced. Duringits brief tenure, the Youth Resource Center focused primarily on information sharing amongagencies and coordinating multiagency staffings related to individual youngsters. Eventuallythe Youth Resource Center merged with another emerging group in Richland County,Community Action for Capable Youth (CACY), and remaining funds were transferred toCACY. As a result of the merger, the focus of activities shifted to substance abuse preventionand coordination activities which were, and currently remain, CACY's primary agenda. TheYouth Resource Center was not considered an overwhelming success during its existence, butits concept and philosophy helped to lay the groundwork for contemporary system of caredevelopment.The YSCC met over a period of years, typically on a quarterly basis. The group produced anagency directory and developed a model for multiagency staffings which called for theparticipation of all relevant youth-serving agencies in developing service plans andcoordinating service provision to individual multineed children. While the YSCC continuedto meet, there was considerable frustration related to its mission and role; many of itsintended functions were not fulfilled. For example, the staffing model was never fullyadopted by the participating agencies and was used only sporadically. Further, the directorsof the key youth-serving agencies were not involved in the YSCC activities, indicating atenuous commitment to the interagency process. By the mid-1980s, it became clear that theYSCC was floundering.The system development process in Richland County was given a boost in 1984 when theGovernor of Ohio signed an executive order mandating that each county establish a \"cluster\"of youth-serving agencies to coordinate and develop services for multineed youngsters. Agroup from Richland County attended a state-sponsored technical assistance meeting oncluster formation in Toledo and returned to the county ready to initiate this effort locally.Thus, the Richland County Interagency Cluster (initially referred to as the InteragencyLinkage Group) was established in 1984 for the expressed purpose of developing, overseeing,and evaluating policies related to \"the maintenance of interagency staffings of multineedyouth.\"One of the first products of the Cluster was the issuance of a joint policy statement oninteragency staffings which was signed in September 1984 by 10 youth-serving agencies. The\"Policy Statement on Multiagency Staffings\" began by recognizing that a significant number 4 C.1: I of youth have multiple and complex needs and that youth and families require the close andsustained cooperation of the agencies involved in providing services to them. The agencieswhich signed the policy statement pledged their firm commitment to such formal cooperationand to the provision of a \"continuum of quality services\" for multineed children and theirfamilies. Additionally, the policy statement declared the intent to provide services \"as closeto home as possible and in the least restrictive way.\"The process designed during the early developmental phase of the Cluster involved theformation of small interagency staffing groups drawn together for a specified case. Thesemultiagency staffings were not limited to the agencies signing the policy statement, but wereenvisioned as including representatives of all agencies involved with a particular child andfamily. Further, procedures were specified for developing a unified written service plan asthe product of the staffing as well as selection of a primary case manager to assumeresponsibility for assuring that planned services were carried out and coordinated in aneffective and timely manner. It was envisioned that the primary case manager would be astaff person from the custody holding agency if applicable or the professional worker in theagency providing the major care in each particular case. The steps outlined for theinteragency staffing process included: 1.Problem Identification2.Staffing Team Meeting3.Sharing of Relevant of Primary Source5.Identification of Strategies/Services and Preparation6.of Joint Service PlanProgress Meetings7.Evaluation of Service Delivery and OutcomesA single release of information form also was devised to allow agencies to obtain consent fromfamilies for sharing necessary information among specified agencies in order to develop,implement, and monitor unified service plans.With the formation of the Cluster, agency directors began to attend meetings somewhat moreregularly.During its initial years, the Cluster focused almost exclusively on individualyoungsters whose needs were not adequately being met with available community services.Cluster members recall that the first case they handled involved a child who was hearingimpaired, severely emotionally disturbed, and developmentally disabled. Issues needingresolution involved custody, treatment, education, and more. This complex situationsuccessfully brought many agencies together to consider the issues and to pursue solutions.The search for appropriate and effective options for this particular youngster eventuallybecame a joint effort of the Richland County Cluster and the State Level Interagency Cluster.Gradually, the Cluster began to focus on other children whose needs vastly exceeded localresources. The majority of the youngsters considered by the Cluster were candidates for out-of-county placement, and many were referred to the State Level Interagency Cluster in orderto access state funds to share in the cost of these placements. In fact, during its early yearsof operation, the Richland County Cluster had an inordinately high rate of referrals to theState Level Cluster as compared with other counties. This high rate has been attributed, in 5 large part, to the lack of local treatment and placement resources. While this was notnecessarily the intent, the early focus of the Richland County Cluster might be characterizedas primarily arranging for and funding out-of-county placements.By 1986, the Cluster had further formalized its role and decided to meet every other monthat a fixed date and time. The logistics and support for Cluster activities were provided bya staff person from Richland County Children Services who assumed the role of coordinatorin addition to his agency responsibilities. Participants report that the group was beginningto crystallize and function well together but that two preconditions for further systemdevelopment were becoming increasingly obvious: oAn essential condition for cluster functioning was the attendance, participation, andcommitment of agency executives. It was characterized as exasperating for staff whoattended cluster meetings to jointly develop a treatment plan for a youngster only tolater find their agency unable or unwilling to commit to the plan or to support itfinancially. oThere was a critical need for the Cluster to move beyond its focus on individualchildren and to shift the focus to system issues and to improving the system of carefor children and families in Richland County. This recognition was directly relatedto the growing concern about the large outlay of funds going to support out-of-countyresidential placements with questionable long-term results coupled with a growingcommitment to serve youngster3 closer to home in the least restrictive environment.Cluster participants were becoming convinced that the development of communityservices could reduce reliance on out-of-county and out-of-home placements.Several Cluster members were instrumental in moving the group from discussing the needto develop a system of care to taking action to pursue this goal. With the leadership of theseindividuals, the Cluster prepared applications for grants which would provide funds to beginthe system building process in the county. One of the first grant applications requested statefunds to support a program developer-consultant for community-based services to specialneeds populations. This program developer would help to design and implement missingservice components, such as intensive home-based services, and make recommendations tothe Cluster regarding further service development. Unfortunately, this grant was not funded,nor was a second grant application for similar purposes.In 1988, a third grant opportunity became available, and, despite the disappointment of twopreviously unsuccessful applications, the Cluster decided to devote staff time to thepreparation of yet another grant application for state funding. This request for applicationscalled for the development of an entity to provide centralized intake services and casemanagement services for multineed children and their families. This grant application wasthe only one selected for funding in the state; the centralized assessment and casemanagement services were implemented in 1989 as an interagency project which becameknown as Gateway. An administrative board comprised of the executives of the major child-serving agencies was organized to cooperatively manage Gateway.The Gateway grant was a major milestone in the development of Richland County's systemof care and is said to have caused \"cataclysmic\" changes. Most obviously, the grant provided 6 much-needed resom ces to devote to local system development. However, the substantialimpact of the grant can be attributed to a number of factors beyond funding. One reason forits momentous effect was the mandate that only chief executive officers of the key youth-serving agencies serve on the Gateway Administrative Board (which was similar incomposition to the Cluster). Therefore, agency executives were compelled to personallyparticipate in the system development process. This direct participation served to crystallizethe executives' commitment to the system development goals and process; executives wererequired to provide local match, attend meetings regularly, and work directly with theircounterparts to address system issues. A series of day-long retreats with an outsidefacilitator were held to develop the mission, goals, policies, and procedures for Gateway aswell as for the Cluster and were instrumental in the process of the securing the \"buy-in\" andcommitment of all key agency executives.Another reason for Gateway's impact on the continued course of system development inRichland County was the grant requirement that a needs assessment for the overall systemof care be conducted. The needs assessment led to clear directions and priorities for servicedevelopment in the community, providing a map for the future. The needs assessmentactivities have led to the preparation of additional grant applications for resources to pursuethe suggested directions. An example is the \"Intensive Services Grant\" for which the Clustersuccessfully made application to the State Level Cluster and received funding for a clustercoordinator, an intensive day treatment program, and an intensive home-based serviceprogram. These services were prioritized with the expectation that they would greatly reducethe number 'of youths placed outside the community and enhance the continuum of locallyavailable services. Implementation of these services began in 1990.Further, the task of developing Gateway as a cooperative, interagency service effectivelyshifted the orientation of the Cluster from nearly exclusive attention to staffing individualcases to a broader perspective which included consideration of policy and planning issuesrelated to the overall system of care. As a result, the Gateway grant is credited with a majorcontribution toward moving the evolutionary process of Cluster development from anindividual case focus to a system building focus. Documents produced in 1988 state that theCluster felt compelled to \"take a stand as a force for change\" in local service delivery tomultineed youth. The Cluster issued a new mission statement in 1989 to reflect this shiftin orientation.A letter from the Director of The Center for Individual and Family Services in support of theGateway grant aptly reflects the role of Gateway in Richland County's system developmentprocess.\"The Richland County Interagency Cluster has committed itself to develop acommunity-based system of care. While the commitment has been sincere, we have beenhampered by a lack of resources to accomplish our objectives. The Cluster has, therefore,aggressively pursued several grants during the past year in order to implement the RichlandCounty Plan.The grant preparation process [and the subsequent implementation ofGateway] has been en excellent experience for the Cluster. It has clarified our needs,solidified our plan, and strengthened the commitment of Cluster members to implement acomprehensive system of care.\"In addition to the development of Gateway and other key service components, themechanisms for system-level interagency coordination also have progressed in Richland 7 County. In 1990, the Gateway Administrative Board and the Richland County InteragencyCluster, which were nearly identical in composition, merged to form a single interagencyentity.This entity officially adopted the structure of a council of governments (COG),becoming the Richland County Youth and Family Council of Governments. The COGstructure allows the group to operate programs, apply for grants, hire staff, enter intocontracts, and the like. The stated purpose of the COG is to \"implement and coordinate therendition of services for children and families throughout Richland County and to coordinatethe rendition of services that are available for this purpose from various governmental andnonprofit organization.\"The COG also serves as the Interagency Cluster for RichlandCounty.State Influences on System of Care DevelopmentWhile Ohio is characterized as a state with strong local control and responsibility for serviceprovision, the state has had a significant influence on system of care development in RichlandCounty and throughout Ohio. One area of clear influence has been the state's leadership inemphasizing and requiring interagency collaboration and coordination in service delivery,initiated during the administration of Governor Richard Celeste. In March 1984, GovernorCeleste signed an executive order requiring interagency cooperation in service delivery tomultineed children. The order established an Interdepartmental Cluster for Services toYouth at the state level, including the six state departments involved in serving children andadolescents.The order also directed county agencies to work cooperatively with otheragencies in their respective districts, calling for the formation of local clusters to reviewspecific cases of children with severe and multiple problems, develop individual service plans,and access existing or alternative programs and funding to meet the needs of these children.The agreement specified that children and adolescents could be referred to the StateInterdepartmental Cluster after all attempts to resolve problems at the local level have failed.In 1987, the requirement for state and local clusters to coordinate services for multineedyouth was codified in legislation. The mandate included a provision specifying the sharingof funding for planned services based upon appropriate agency involvement in each case.It should be noted that collaborative efforts in Richland County preceded the state mandatefor collaboration. For approximately 10 years prior to the executive order, Richland Countyhad a locallyconceived interagency entity established for coordination purposes.Nevertheless, the existing body had been faltering, and the executive order served toformalize the local commitment to collaboration and provide new incentive and purpose tothe local collaborative effort.The availability and awarding of grants to Richland County also have provided significantsupport to Richland County's system building efforts. Richland County was the onlycommunity in Ohio selected for the central intake and assessment project, and Gatewayclearly has played a pivotal role in the development of the community's overall system ofcare. Fiscal year 1990 was the first year that a separate line item in the state budget wasallocated to the State Interdepartmental Cluster. More than half of the available $3.2 millionwas offered as \"system of care grants\" to local clusters in order to provide opportunities forcommunities to develop missing services. (The amount available in the fiscal year 1991 statebudget was $4.3 million.)The system of care or Intensive Services Grant awarded toRichland County has provided funds for a cluster coordinator as well as two service 8 components. Thus, the grant has provided resources enabling Richland County to expand thearray of available community services as well as to support and refine the mechanisms usedfor system coordination. These grants, as well as other funding which has been availablefrom the Ohio Department of Mental Health and other state level departments, have beenpredicated on collaboration among relevant agencies. In addition to providing much-neededstart-up resources for system development, grants offered by the state have requiredinteragency collaboration and reinforced its importance.The state has further facilitated system development in Richland County by providing aseries of training conferences regarding the role and functioning of clusters. Richland Countyrepresentatives have participated in these events, and state staff have come to RichlandCounty on numerous occasions to provide consultation and technical assistance. Additionally,the state provided funds for a consultant to work with Richland County in theimplementation of its system of care. The consultant has played an important role in allphases of system building and his assistance is considered one of the critical factors in thesuccess of Richland County's system building endeavors.Another potential influence on system of care development is the Mental Health Act of 1988passed by the Ohio legislature. This legislation, which became effective in fiscal year 1990,gives local mental health boards the responsibility for administering both inpatient andoutpatient mental health funds. Boards are authorized to take a specified percentage of theirallocation for inpatient care to utilize for alternatives to hospitalization. It was reported thatRichland County is among 11 out of 53 counties which have opted out of this program dueto their assessment of a potentially negative financial impact.Very few instances were cited indicating ways in which the state has hindered systemdevelopment in Richland County. Concerns were expressed about the seed money conceptby which the state provides short-term grants to begin certain services or activities withdecreasing levels of funding each year. Some of the grants provided to Richland Countydecrease substantially over a short period of time, making it extremely difficult for localagencies to absorb the costs. Many participants felt that it would be more realistic andfacilitative if g.-ants decreased more gradually and support were provided for longerdurations, giving communities time to seek alternative funding sources, adjust their budgetpriorities, and the like.On the whole, it appears that the state has had a significant influence on the course ofsystem development in Richland County by encouraging interagency collaboration and byproviding both financial and technical assistance to support system development. III. PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS While tivpRichland County philosophy had been evolving for some time, the retreats held in1989 provided opportunities to further define the system of care philosophy and to reachagreement among the participating agencies. The retreats resulted in a mission statementas well as goals and objectives for the system of care. Based upon the mission statement and 9 discussions with key system participants, four distinct elements of the Richland Countysystem's philosophy have been identified: oInteragency Collaboration - The system is based upon the premise that youth-serving agencies cannot operate in isolation or \"run their own show.\" Rather, in orderto provide effective services, agencies must collaborate with each other and shareresponsibility for developing, providing, funding, and overseeing service delivery. Thebelief in collective ownership of multineed children and their families appears to bestrongly held and consistently expressed. Representatives of a wide variety of youth-serving agencies stated repeatedly that no one agency can do the job, that no oneagency has ownership of a multineed child and family, and that there is a need for acoordinated network of services. This strong conviction in interagency collaborationpermeates the system and has its roots in an impressive history of collaborativeactivities in Richland County around multineed children and in a variety of otherareas.oKeeping Youngsters in the Community - Another element of the Richland Countysystem's philosophy is the commitment to providing services in the least restrictivesetting, to keeping youngsters within their homes and families whenever possible, andavoiding out-of-county placements to the greatest possible extent. In the early yearsof the Richland County Interagency Cluster, an average of 12 to 15 youngsters werein out-of-county placements at any given time. There was a growing recognition thatthe success rates of these expensive out-of-county placements were marginal, and thecommunity sought alternative approaches for working with youngsters at risk for suchplacement. At the time of the site visit, only four children were in out-of-countyplacements.This reduction was attributed to the concerted effort to developcommunity-based treatment resources, coupled with the coordinated service deliveryapproach that has been adopted. This element of the philosophy evolved fromeconomic as well as humanitarian concerns, in particular, the astronomical costs ofserving youngsters in out-of-county placements. Today, there appears to be widespread agreement that treatment in the least restrictive setting and keepingyoungsters within their homes and community is preferable on philosophical grounds,and efforts are devoted to this end.oFamily Focus - A third element of the system philosophy holds that children cannotbe isolated from their families and that the system of care must be committed tofocusing on the entire family in the planning and delivery of services. Both agencyexecutives and direct service workers talk about empowering families to reach theirmaximum potential and providing opportunities for families to succeed as units.Virtually all written documents related to the Richland County system consistentlyrefer to \"multineed children and their families.\" Further, all the new service components which have been developed in the community are family focused --Gateway focuses on the problems, strengths, and needs of the entire family; Home-Based Services intervenes with the family unit in an attempt to avoid out-of-homeplacement; and Intensive Day Treatment has a parent component which involvesproviding services and support. 10 oEarly Intervention - A recurring theme in both documents and discussion is theneed for early identification and intervention with multineed children and theirfamilies. In particular, the system is concerned with identifying children at risk forout-of-home placement and intervening earlier in the process to maximize thelikelihood of successful outcomes. There are a number of early intervention activitiesongoing in Richland County and the COG/Cluster is exploring ways to form moreextensive linkages with these efforts.The goals of Richland County's system of care parallel the elements of its philosophy andinclude the following:oTo provide comprehensive, coordinated services to multineed youth and their families. oTo provide services in the least restrictive setting and to keep children within theirhomes and community to the greatest possible extent.oTo promote the involvement of families in the planning and delivery of services. oTo promote early identification and intervention for multineed children and theirfamilies. W. TARGET POPULATION The target population of the Richland County system of care is broadly defined as \"childrenwith multiple needs and their families.\" There has been a deliberate attempt to avoidestablishing restrictive population definitions for the COG/Cluster or any of its programs.The rationale for adopting a broad, inclusive population definition is to reduce categoricalthinking among agencies and to promote the concept of shared ownership of the populationof youngsters with multiple needs and their families. The success of the current collaborativesystem development efforts in Richland County is attributed, in part, to the fact thatresponsibility for this population unambiguously rests with the COG/Cluster, and memberagencies recognize and accept the need for joint programming, joint finanr,ng of services andsupports, as well as mutual ownership of the target population.A particular focus of the system is on children at risk for out-of-home placement, with apriority on those at risk for out-of-county placement. As noted, large amounts of mentalhealth and children's services funds, as well as monies from juvenile justice and education,were being expended for out-of-county placements of questionable effectiveness. Thus, systembuilding efforts have been directed at serving many of these youngsters in their own homesand/or communities to the extent possible.The characteristics of segments of the target population have been described in various grantapplications. In the Intensive Services Grant application, submitted in 1989, a profile wasprovided of the 33 youngsters considered by the Cluster since its inception in 1984. Theyoungsters brought to the Cluster have proven to be the most difficult to serve due to theircomplex and multiple needs and the inability of local agencies to meet their needs within 11 existing programs and services. These youngsters were predominantly male (nearly 80percent) and predominantly white (nearly 80 percent). Their average age was just over 11,and more than three-quarters of these youngsters were described as having severe emotionalor behavioral disturbances. The group indeed reflects youngsters with multiple needs asdemonstrated by their involvement with multiple agencies. The youths had previousinvolvement with an average of 4.9 youth-serving systems and agencies including mentalhealth,specialeducation,children'sservices,juvenilecourt,health,mentalretardation/developmental disabilities, rehabilitation, and residential facilities. Theirhistories substantiate high risk for out-of-home placements -- more than two-thirds hadexperienced an average of two out-of-home placements prior to Cluster referral.Beyond the youngsters referred to the Cluster, the system of care is concerned with a broaderpopulation of youth with serious and multiple needs. For example, the Intensive ServicesGrant application states that in 1988 approximately 138 Richland County youths were placedin residential treatment facilities and group homes; 83 youths were seen at The Center forpsychiatric evaluations reflecting a near two-fold increase from the previous year; and over380 youths were seen by Juvenile Court and referred to community agencies for services.Additionally, a steady increase in the number of children and adolescents seen at The Centerwas reported. These data are presented as indicators of the need for improved serviceswithin the community.Gateway, as a central component of the system, also carefully constructed its visionstatement to establish inclusive target population guidelines and to ensure that Gateway'sservices are accessible to the entire system without restrictive eligibility criteria. Any childand family is eligible for Gateway's services, regardless of the referral source. Special careis taken to avoid any perception of excluding youngsters from Gateway's services. Gatewaystarted providing services by having its Clinical Advisory Board select 25 of the most severelytroubled, multineed children in the community who were not succeeding with the currentlevel of services.These children and their families were then referred for Gateway'sassessment and case management services. A strong argument for early intervention isprovided by the fact that in each of these 25 initial cases, a teacher in the early grades hadidentified a problem which had not been adequately addressed. At the time of the site visit,attempts were underway to increase early intervention efforts through Gateway. As a resultof these efforts, an early intervention specialist will be assigned to Gateway to conductintakes and coordinate services to youngsters ages zero to five.From its inception through September 1990, Gateway served 184 cases. Since Gatewayserves those youngsters who have multiple needs and who are not succeeding with thecurrent level of services from community agencies, this population reflects a substantialsegment of the system's target population. This group was 63 percent male, 37 percentfemale, and its racial composition was approximately 79 percent white, 21 percent black. Themajority of these youngster (more than 70 percent) come from families in which their naturalparents are either divorced or never married. The largest referral sources include JuvenileCourt, Children Services, Mansfield and Richland County School Systems, self referrals, andThe Center. The most frequently identified problems among the Gateway population includeschool problems, behavioral problems, emotional problems, and parent-child problems. 12 One issue related to the target population is that, although the COG/Cluster is striving toreduce categorical thinking regarding children and their families, line workers in the youth-serving agencies may still be required to document eligibility for their particular services orfunding. Systems of care must recognize and appreciate the \"Catch 22\" that may face lineworkers who may struggle with externally imposed eligibility requirements and otherconstraints. V. ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM System ManagementThe organizing structure for the Richland County system of care is provided by theCOG/Cluster. Within this framework all agencies participate in system management, andno single lead agency can be identified. While several agencies assume a more active,leadership role within the system of care, participants agreed that system management is acollaborative venture and that no one agency could be singled out as the \"lead\" agency. Infact, it was emphasized that there is little concern about which agency will own or manageservices and a much more concentrated focus on building services that will enhance thesystem, with management issues seen as secondary.The management approach adopted by the Richland County system was devised in 1990, inpart as a result of the Intensive Services Grant (also referred to as the \"system of care grant\")from the State Level Cluster which provided funds for a cluster coordinator and for intensiveservices including day treatment and home-based services. This Intensive Services Grant isseen as a significant leap forward in developing an interagency collaborative system in thecommunity since it clearly signified the intent of the Cluster to assume a principal role insystem management functions. The grant proposal called for collaborative efforts such asmanagement of the proposed day treatment program by the Cluster, a home-based servicesprogram implemented jointly by two agencies, and a system-wide process for qualityassurance. This grant was said to reflect the willingness of Richland County communityagencies to implement a fully integrated system of care.The dilemma presented to Cluster members by the Intensive Services Grant was the lack ofa legal entity or administrative structure for programs such as Intensive Day Treatment andGateway. A committee was formed to explore potential approaches to organizing a structureto operate these programs as well as to coordinate the entire system. The committeeconsidered entities such as a 501(cXS) corporation. Based upon prior personal experiencewith a Council of Governments formed for another purpose, the group decided to research theapplicability of the COG structure for the system of care. It was determined that Ohio'sstatutes governing COGs were advantageous, allowing the Richland County agencies toaccomplish their objectives.The COG structure would allow for hiring staff, operatingservices, receiving grants, and the like -- all functions that the Cluster could not performsince it was not a legal entity. Thus, the COG was formed in 1990 and became the primarysystem management structure. The stated intent is to place additional services under theCOG umbrella in the future. 13 The COG/Cluster has three officers -- President, President Elect, and Secretary/Treasurer.An Executive Committee is comprised of all COG members and includes the ExecutiveDirector of the Mental Health Board, the Executive Secretary of the Children Services Board,the Superintendent of the Mansfield City Schools, the Superintendent of the Richland CountySchools, the Superintendent of the Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities Board, andthe Health Commissioner. The Executive Committee plays a key system management role.In addition, the Cluster Coordinator plays a critical role in system management, serving asa tangible link between the planning and service delivery activities of all providersthroughout the system.The role of the Cluster Coordinator includes administrativeresponsibility for Gateway, Intensive Day Treatment, and other programs to be operated bythe COG/Cluster.The Richland County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board plays a vital role withinthe system by serving as its fiscal agent. The Board \"fronts\" the money for system activitiesbased on its cash reserves, and is then reimbursed when grants and other funds are received.By virtue of its fiscal agent role, the Board also performs some informal monitoring andauditing functions.At the time of the site visit, the COG/Cluster was struggling with some of the administrativeaspects of operating service delivery programs. For example, employees of COG programswere on the payrolls of a number of different agencies, with some on the payroll of TheCenter and others on the payroll of the Mental Health Board and the Mansfield City Schools,and were therefore governed by different personnel policies and under different benefit andretirement systems. To rectify this problem, the Richland County Board of Education wasapproached with the possibility of becoming the administrative agent for the system. Theproposed scenario involved an agreement between the COG and the Richland County Schoolsto pay staff through the county school system and to handle all benefits and employment-related issues. This approach, allowing all staff to be employees of the COG and equalizingsalaries and benefit packages among COG staff, was implemented as of January 1991.Role of Participating Agencies oMental Health: Richland County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board and TheCenter for Individual and Family Services (The Center).The Richland County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board serves as theadministrative and fiscal monitoring agent for mental health services in RichlandCounty. The Board contracts with various provider agencies in the community formental health and substance abuse services for adults and children. As noted above,the Mental Health Board plays an important role within the system of care by servingas fiscal agent for the COG/Cluster services including fronting funds to supportprogram operations and performing informal monitoring and auditing functions.One of the major contract agencies of the Mental Health Board is The Center forIndividual and Family Services which is a large, multiservice community mentalhealth center serving adults and children. The Center, in its current form, resultedfrom the 1975 merger of an existing community mental health center with a familyservice agency, and thus retains a strong child and family orientation. Despite this 14nj orientation, resources for children's services remain relatively small. Like manymental health centers, resources are devoted in large measure to serving adults withsevere mental illnesses. The Center has offices in Mansfield and Shelby, and providesa wide range of services including counseling for adults and children, mental healtheducation services, medical/psychiatric services, emergency services, communitysupport services, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, AIDS outreach services, forensic services,drug and alcohol services, and older adult services. oChild Welfare: Richland County Children Services BoardThe Children Services Board provides a variety of child welfare services. The intakefunction involves the evaluation of complaints related to neglect, physical abuse,sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, and dependency and determination of the needfor services from community agencies. Through a contract with the Richland CountySheriffs Department, a full-time detective works with Children Services conductinginvestigations of sexual abuse allegations and following these cases through thejudicial system. The agency's services also include protective services with ongoingsupervision of families, foster care, and adoption services. Children Services operatesa 23-bed residential facility (Down's Residence Hall) for children ages 8 to 18; behaviorproblems in home, school, and community are the primary reasons for admission.Additionally, Children Services operates two group homes and provides financialsupport for other residential placements for eligible youngsters when necessary.The Children Services Board also plays a key role in the system of care. A ChildrenServices staff person served as the Cluster Coordinator until the recent state grantenabled Richland County to hire staff to fulfill this role. Additionally, the currentCOG/Cluster chairperson is the Executive Secretary of the Children Services Board. oEducation: Boards of Education of 13 Local School Districts and the Richland CountyBoard of EducationRichland County contains 13 autonomous schools districts, each with its own boardof education and superintendent. The largest of these districts is the Mansfield CitySchools which provides a special education program for severely behaviorallyhandicapped youngsters in kindergarten through twelfth grades and serves a seven-county area for low incidence handicaps. The Mansfield City School System recentlywent through an extensive process to plan for the future of education in Mansfield.Two reports (\"The Classroom of the Future\" and \"Spectrum 2000\") have been issuedwhich establish long-range educational plans for the city. The philosophy espousedby these plans, as well as by the Superintendent of the Mansfield City Schools, is thatchildren must be served in the context of their families and that educational systemsmust be willing to collaborate with other agencies in order to provide effective servicesto families. The key elements of the plan include an emphasis on preschool/earlychildhood education, drug education, parenting skills education, after school care,special education, and a comprehensive high school which blends academic andvocational/technical programs. 15 In addition to the individual district boards, there is an elected county board ofeducation with an appointed superintendent who oversees the Richland County Officeof Education. The Richland County Board of Education does not directly operateschools but rather provides support and specialized programming including specialeducation services to the 11 smaller school districts. The professional and auxiliaryservices provided by the Richland County Office of Education to the participatingdistricts include a significant contribution to special education for all populations. Inaddition to providing four special education programs available to students from thelocal districts, the Office of Education provides special education consultants who visitlocal classrooms to evaluate students and instruction, implement changes instrategies, coordinate placements of handicapped students from local districts tocounty special education programs, and supervise and conduct in-service training forspecial education staff.The Office of Education also provides elementary andsecondary consultants, talented and gifted coordinators, school psychologists, work-study coordinators, speech and language pathologists, and attendance counselors.Both the Mansfield City Schools and Richland County Office of Education are activeparticipants in the COG/Cluster.oJuvenile Justice: Richland County Juvenile Court and Ohio Department of YouthServices Regional OfficeThe Richland County Juvenile Court operates with an elected judge, a courtadministrator, and staff. The Juvenile Court provides a range of services includingsecure detention; foster care for unruly and delinquent youth; a restitution assistanceprogram providing supervised employment with nonprofit agencies; \"Save OurStudents\" which provides remedial tutoring for middle school youth facing failure; andin-home detention with intensive supervision which serves as an alternative to securedetention for appropriate youth. A specialized probation program provides a trainedprobation officer to conduct assessments to determine drug and alcohol dependenceamong involved youths. Referrals to appropriate treatment programs are made whenindicated. Additionally, the Court contracts with The Center for psychological andpsychiatric services including evaluations and groups for unruly adolescents and sexoffenders. An agreement with Gateway provides the Juvenile Court with a Gatewayassessment specialist for one day each week to conduct assessments on families at theCourt. An interesting service offered by the Juvenile Court is the Parent Orientation -Mediation program which requires divorcing parents to attend a two-hour groupeducational experience about the potential effects of divorce on children and how tominimize the negative impact. Child custody mediation is available and is providedby training mental health professionals and attorneys.The regional office of the Ohio Department of Youth Services provides funding formany of the Juvenile Court programs as well as monitoring local service delivery. TheDepartment of Youth Sex vices assumes custody of youthful offenders uponcommitment by the Juvena Court for felony level offenses, thereby transferringresponsibility from the county to the state agency. 16Ct) oHealth: Mansfield/Richland County Department of HealthThe Department of Health provides a range of services to children and families inRichland County. Child and Family Health Services are funded by a block grant fromthe federal Bureau of Maternal and Child Health and include a range of componentssuch as community planning, public health outreach, child health services includingEPSDT screening, and perinatal services. The Health Department has a social workeron staff whose role involves identifying crises and adjustment problems amongchildren and families and ensuring that they receive appropriate interventions. Closelinkages are maintained with The Center, Gateway, Children Services, and otheragencies for this purpose. A number of other programs serve youth and familiesincluding an early intervention project involving home visits to children at risk fordevelopmental delays, and a program providing home visits to infants and families atrisk of child abuse.Both of these programs involve home visiting by nurses;assessment of medical, social, and environmental conditions; and provision ofeducational and supportive services as well as efforts to access whatever resources areneeded to respond to the situation. Both programs involve active follow-alongcomponents. Teen wellness, pregnancy prevention, and AIDS education programs alsoare provided.The Richland Child and Family Health Services Consortium is an interagency entitywhich plays a significant role in planning and coordinating health services for childrenand families in the community. Its activities have included developing and conductinga Child and Family Health Services Community Needs Assessment and using theresults as a foundation for planning. The consortium publishes a quarterly newsletterand sponsors an annual conference; the 1990 conference theme was \"Parenting in the90s. oMentalRetardation:Richland County Boardof Mental RetardationandDevelopmental DisabilitiesThe Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Board is responsible forplanning and providing educational and training programs for mentally retarded anddevelopmentally disabled children and adults. Services are offered beginning at birthand include evaluation, home visitation, parent counseling, case management,educational services, vocational services, and residential and respite care services.The Newhope School provides individualized educational programs and a range ofsupportive services to children and young adults ranging in age from 0 to 22, withcomponents including an early intervention program and preschool as well asprograms for school-age children. The Board operates four residential facilitiesserving severely and profoundly retarded children and adults as well as a foster careprogram serving both children and adults.In addition to these major child-serving systems, a number of other agencies participate inthe system by providing services to youth and families and through their involvement in theCOG/Cluster. These agencies include: 17 oRichland County Department of Human ServicesoCity of Mansfield Human Resource BureauoRichland County Private Industry CounciloBureau of Vocational RehabilitationoCommunity Action for Capable Youth (CACY)As in most communities, some agencies within the system assume a more proactive,leadership role in the organization and operation of the system of care. Other agencies areless active participants and assume a more peripheral role in system activities. While thereis a constant effort to enhance the involvement and commitment of all agencies, thereremains a core group of agencies which appear central to system management and servicedelivery, and which are prime movers in the system development process. VI. SYSTEM OF CARE COMPONENTS Outpatient ServicesOutpatient services are provided by The Center for Individual and Family Services. ACoordinator of Children's Programs manages the outpatient services for children andadolescents which include individual, family, and group counseling. Approximately 10 to 12therapists at the masters and doctoral level work with children and families, and two workexclusively in the children's area. A number of therapists at The Center have developedspecial expertise in areas including sexual abuse, play therapy, adolescence, adoption issues,separation/divorce, rage reduction, family systems, and others.Consistent with the philosophy of The Center, an emphasis is placed on working withfamilies whenever possible. Children and families may be seen for counseling once or twicea week, or more depending on the need and on the demands of the current caseload. Whilehome visits are not always encouraged due to the loss of billable clinical time at The Center,therapists have the flexibility to visit children and families at home, schools, hospitals, court,and other locations if necessary. Staff are encouraged to use creative approaches in workingwith youngsters.In addition to individual and family counseling, The Center offers a number of groups. Theseinclude self-esteem/social skills groups for children ages seven to nine, 10-week groups foradopted adolescents via contract with Children Services, groups for adolescents on probationvia contract with Juvenile Court, \"loss\" groups in the schools for children who have lostparents, and a variety of parenting skills groups. An approach often taken by The Centeris to respond to needs identified by other agencies. For example, the loss groups were theresult of a need identified during The Center's annual meeting with school guidancecounselors. The Center's STOP program consists of two staff persons who provide treatment,prevention, education, and interagency coordination around sexual abuse. Therapy groups,support groups, and other services are available to victims and offenders in child abusesituations as well as to family members. The Summer Youth Program, jointly operated byThe Center and the Mansfield City Schools, involves groups for fifth and sixth graders who 18c .../ t) are not succeeding in school. Group sessions focus on a range of emotional, family, andschool adjustment issues; parenting sessions are offered to families.Outpatient psychiatric services also are offered by The Center. A child psychiatrist worksat The Center four hours weekly, and two of the three other staff psychiatrists will seeadolescents.Psychiatric referrals are made for medication evaluations, psychiatricevaluations, and assessment of the need for hospitalization, homebound instruction, and thelike. Unfortunately, the wait list for psychiatric evaluations at The Center may be as longas three months, with the exception of emergencies which are seen immediately.The Center has felt the impact of the expansion of children's services within the RichlandCounty system of care. At one time, The Center had a Coordinator of Children's Programsand three or more therapists who specialized in working with children and adolescents.Some of these staff persons have left The Center to fill positions at Gateway as well as in thenew home-based service and day treatment programs; due to fiscal constraints, vacantpositions have not been filled. Thus, The Center has suffered the loss of some of itsspecialized resources in the children's area, even though the overall system has profited. Duein part to staff shortages, the wait list at The Center for children and families isapproximately four to six weeks and is considerably longer for psychiatric services.GatewayGateway, a pivotal component in the Richland County system of care, is a centralized intake,assessment, and case management program serving multineed youngsters and their families.Two planning retreats were held in 1989 with representatives from numerous youth-servingagencies to define the vision and guiding principles for Gateway and to determine its role inthe system. The resulting vision statement specifies that \"Gateway is a central point ofintake which will assist youth and their families in accessing appropriate human services andassist human service agencies to be responsive to each family's unique needs. Throughcustomized, individualized service plans, Gateway will encourage families to utilize theirstrengths and advocate for needed services. Gateway will serve as a mechanism forcooperative agency activities.\" Thus, Gateway was designed as a focal point for assessing theneeds of multiproblem children and their families, bringing together all needed communityresources to meet the identified needs, and ensuring that the services provided by multipleagencies are coordinated. An Administrative Board comprised of the executives of the majoryouth-serving systems and a Clinical Advisory Board comprised of mid-level managers fromthe various systems were used to implement Gateway and design the service delivery processand procedures.The initial phase of service delivery at Gateway is the assessment which entails gatheringinformatioi. from all involved agencies and holding a series of meetings with the child andfamily. The assessment focuses on all life domains and is designed to identify strengths aswell as problem areas, to establish goals for the child and family, and to provide interventionoptions for the family to consider. If it is determined that additional Gateway servicesbeyond the assessment are needed, case management services are then provided. Networkmeetings are an integral part of the Gateway case management approach. These networkmeetings bring together all agencies and professionals relevant to the specific case for thepurpose of sharing information, clarifying roles and responsibilities, and developing a 19 comprehensive, coordinated intervention plan for the child and family. The family is considered an integral part of the team and, along with adolescents, attends and participates in network meetings. Gateway has some flexible funds that may be used to assist families in a number of creative ways including sending youngsters to camp, purchasing toys, or paying for an adolescent to attend the YWCA Teen Series. Under some circumstances, money may used to meet an emergency need for a family, with the family making monthly payments to repay the \"loan,\" interest free.A major strength of Gateway is considered to be its neutrality, based upon its placement under the auspices of the COG. Since Gateway is not a part of any one agency, staff have the ability to push agencies to provide needed services and to network and coordinate with other agencies. Further, Gateway is in a unique position to identify system gaps and to plan for further system of care development, and is sanctioned by other agencies to play this role.Home-Based ServicesHome-based services were added to the array of services provided in Richland County as a result of the Intensive Services Grant received from the State Level Cluster. The program was jointly developed by The Center and Children Services Board, and the approach represents a melding of mental health and child welfare concepts of home-based interventions. Home-based workers are co-located, although one worker is employed by The Center and two others are employed by Children Services.Joint responsibility for the program is retained by the two agencies, with The Center and Children Services each implementing a component of the intensive home-based services. Both programs are directed at reducing the need for out-of-home placements.Home-based services are geared to families with at least one member at imminent risk of removal from the home. Both Gateway and the Children Services feeder system are used as referral pathways for home-based services. The duration of services is approximately 8 to 12 weeks, with a somewhat longer duration for \"mental health\" cases. Workers carry caseloads of only two to three families at a given time in order to enable them to work actively and intensively with each family. The goal of both the mental health and Children Services components is to empower families and to connect them with the services and resources needed for ongoing support. Workers state that they will do \"whatever it takes\" to assist youngsters and families, an attitude characteristic of many home-based programs. Meeting basic family needs is considered an essential part of service delivery as well as building relationships and providing counseling. A grant from the City of Mansfield (approximately $10,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds) provides flexible funds for home- based workers to use in a variety of creative ways to assist families.Day TreatmentThe Intensive Day Treatment Program is one of the services funded by the Intensive Services Grant received from the State Level Cluster. Implemented in 1990, the programserves youngsters ages 10 to 14 who are at high risk for placement outside the community. Eligibility criteria specified in the grant application target youth who are currently involved in the system, have not responded positively to existing interventions, are at risk for placement in a more restrictive facility, and have at least one parent or caretaker who is 20(-- . 'l_j i willing to participate in theprogram. The program consists of two major components. Thefirst is a full-day program which has a capacity of eight youngsters and includes a structured academic program, group therapy, structured recreation, medical screening, interpersonal skill building, and family participation. The second program component is an extended day program which operates 12 months per year and includes tutoring, group therapy, structuredrecreation, interpersonal skill building, and family participation. The extended day program serves 12 youngsters and operates from 2:30 PM to 7:30 PM during the school year and shifts to a full-day program when school is not in session.The program is too new to have established its optimal length of stay. Consideration is currently being given to adopting 18 months as the standard length of stay in the program, with flexibility to adjust this based upon the needs of individual youngsters. The program attempts to focus an array of services on each youngster and family and to transitionyoungsters back to schools as soon as possible. Staff includes a program coordinator, special education teacher, aides, recreation therapists, and a mental health therapist. Parental involvement is emphasized by the program. Counseling for parents is available with the mental health therapist and a parent support group is held biweekly. Attendance at the parent group, which has a combination support and educational agenda, has been outstanding. Additionally, home visits may be conducted by the therapist when indicated.The Intensive Day Treatment Program has important connections with a number of community agencies which play a significant role in service delivery. Gateway, for example, performs the assessments and prescreening of youngsters under consideration for admission to the Intensive Day Treatment Program. Richland County Special Education Consultants, employed by the County Board of Education, work extensively with the program and assist in designing and implementing its level system. Close working relationships are maintained with the schools, particularly in relation to youngsters' transitions into and out of the Intensive Day Treatment Program. Additionally, the program maintains close ties with The Center which provides ongoing consultation to the program coordinator and staff. Further, contributions of furniture, equipment, and services to the developing program have been made by many agencies.Crisis ServicesCrisis services are provided by The Center for Individual and Family Services. The central component of The Center's crisis response system is Help line, a 24-hour telephone crisis service. Help line responds to a wide range of crisis situations including those related to violence and abuse, drugs and alcohol, mental illness, emotional problems, and suicide. The primary services provided by Help line are crisis counseling, information and referral, and some noncrisis counseling as well as services to the deaf community through a teletype system. Help line is staffed by a core of full-time and part-time staff which is augmented by a cadre of volunteers. Volunteers receive more than 50 hours of formal training followed by an apprenticeship program and ongoing supervision. The program attempts to have bothpaid staff and volunteers covering the crisis telephone lines at all times and receives more than 2000 calls per month. It was estimated that approximately 40 percent of the crises handled are related to children. 21 Help line plays a key role in the community service system in that it provides after hourscrisis coverage for many community agencies. Rather than establishing separate 24-hourtelephone capability at each individual agency, contracts with Help line have been negotiatedto provide coverage for Children Services, The Center's Drug and Alcohol Program, NewhopeRespite Care (a Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities service), the Richland CountyInformation Line, and others. As a result, Hell:nine maintains close linkages with a widevariety of community agencies and has access to approximately 11 back-up systems whenservices beyond telephone intervention are warranted.A group of nine staff from The Center rotates to provide crisis back-up services. All havespecific expertise in crisis intervention and handle situations involving both adults andchildren. Rather than providing mobile outreach services to clients' homes, staff tend to meetclients in crisis at the hospital emergency room when face-to-face crisis intervention isneeded.Additionally, individual therapists may elect to provide their home telephonenumbers to clients or may instruct Helpline to contact them directly if specified clientsexperience a crisis. A missing component of crisis services in the community is a crisisresidential resource for children and adolescents. In some situations, short-term placementin emergency foster homes may be arranged. Some children in crisis are placed at theAttention (detention) Center for lack of other alternatives; a crisis stabilization unit of sometype was identified as a needed future addition to the system of care.Early InterventionEarly intervention is an area that has been emphasized in Richland County, and two majorearly identification and intervention programs are provided. The Richland County EarlyIntervention Program serves children with special needs from birth to age five. This programinvolves developmental screenings to identify children with a known or suspected handicapor signs of a delay in some area of development. To increase success in identifying childrenin need, free developmental screenings at the mall have been conducted on several occasions.Following an interdisciplinary assessment, the program offers classes for infants and toddlersand their families, support for parents, assistance for parents in locating needed communityresources, and group and individual services. The range of services which can be providedinclude physical and occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, educational services,social services, supportive home services, individual and family counseling, audiologicalservices, and parent training. The Early Intervention Program is a collaborative effortinvolving a number of county agencies including the Richland Newhope Center, Mansfield-Richland County Health Department, The Center, Department of Human Services, andRehabilitation Service.The second program is the Richland County Cooperative Preschool which was developed in1990 through a collaborative effort of education and social service agencies. The program isfunded primarily by a grant from the Ohio Department of Education to develop and operatean integrated early childhood \"special needs, at-risk\" program. The target population for thepreschool includes children ages three to five who have been identified as being at risk ofschool failure because of a host of factors including family abuse and neglect, lowsocioeconomic level, handicapping conditions including emotional disorders, inadequate healthconditions, inadequate educational readiness, family substance abuse, and others. It isestimated that approximately 25 percent of the children in the program have emotio:ial 22 disorders, with some exhibiting extreme behavioral problems. In order to ensure a morenormalized, integrated experience, half of the children admitted to the Cooperative Preschoolare in the at risk/special needs category and half are not considered to be at risk.The Cooperative Preschool is staffed by teachers, assistants, nurses, speech and occupationaltherapists, and a psychologist. An assessment specialist, obtained via contract with Gateway,also is included on the program staff. Multidisciplinary assessments are conducted to evaluate children and determine their needs as well as their potential eligibility for theCooperative Preschool.In addition to the preschool classes and specialized services, theprogram includes extensive work with parents. Parents volunteer to assist in classrooms,and a newsletter, monthly parent education meetings, and a parent advisory committee areconsidered essential aspects of the program.An approach to early intervention currently under consideration is the possible establishmentof an integrated Child Development Center serving children from birth through age five. Thebuilding would be donated by the Mansfield City Schools and would allow for the co-locationof a range of programs including the Early Intervention Program, Richland CountyCooperative Preschool, Headstart, and early childhood programs offered by the YWCA andthe Mansfield and Richland County school systems. A common assessment process isenvisioned with subsequent placement of children in the appropriate early intervention orearly childhood program.Substance Abuse ServicesSubstance abuse services are provided by The Ceer. Outpatient counseling, service coordination, and education are offered to chemically abusing youth, adults, and theirfamilies.Approaches include individual counseling which focuses on chemical abusetreatment, family counseling which includes the significant people in the chemical user's life,and group counseling which provides education and support for living a chemically free life.An intensive outpatient program is available for youth, involving daily group counseling forup to six weeks. In addition to the substance abuse services offered by The Center, thesystem of care has access to two detoxification programs.Community Action for Capable Youth (CAGY) represents a unique component in the RichlandCounty system of care. Founded by a group of parents in the late 1970s, CACY has primarilyfocused on issues related to substance abuse. The organization is described as a \"community catalyst,\" bringing the schools, parents, and larger community together to address substanceuse and abuse among children. CACY is funded by the Richland County Commission, Cityof Mansfield, United Way, and donations; some of its workshops are sponsored by the MentalHealth and Recovery Services Board. CACY's major emphasis revolves around providing andcoordinating a wide variety of training activities and events on substance abuse for audiencesincluding students in all schools, teachers, parents, law enforcement officers, professionals,churches. oervice clubs, and other community organizations. In addition to substance abuseprevention and education efforts, CACY, in collaboration with the Health Department andPlanned Parenthood, recently started the Richland County Parenting Coalition to identifyneeds and coordinate parent training activities in the community. 23 Residential ServicesYoungsters requiring treatment in residential settings have access to a number of placementoptions, several of which are located within Richland County. Richland County ChildrenServices operates two group homes and a 23-bed residential treatment facility, Down'sResidence Hall. Other residential treatment options used by the Richland County systeminclude Parmadale Family Services located in Parma and Bellefaire in Cleveland.Inpatient psychiatric services are available at Richland Hospital, a private hospital which hasa specialized psychiatric unit serving children and adolescents with both mental health andsubstance abuse problems. Sagamore Hills, a state psychiatric hospital for children locatedin Cleveland, is available to residents of the Richland County area and serves a primarily pre-adolescent and adolescent population.For adolescents, a separate mechanism for accessing and financing inpatient services was created when the Central Ohio Adolescent Center (a state psychiatric hospital in Columbusserving adolescents) was closed by the state in 1989. Ten mental health boards representing16 counties joined together and formed a 501(cX3) corporation entitled Alternative Care forTeens (ACT). ACT, and similar entities in other areas of Ohio, were given access to the money that had been used to fund the Central Ohio Adolescent Center to purchase inpatientcare in private psychiatric hospitals in the community. ACT negotiated contracts withRichland Hospital, Harding Hospital in Columbus, Ohio State University Hospital, andSagamore Hills to purchase inpatient services for adolescents. The original intent was that funds would be used to support alternatives to hospitalization as well as to finance inpatientservices. However, participants reported that funding levels coupled with the increasing costsof hospitalization may limit the feasibility of diverting funds to such alternatives.System Needs and GapsWhen the Intensive Services Grant application was prepared, it cited a marked lack of intensive treatment services within Richland County. In particular, the application notedfew, if any, services which provided more than one to two hours per week of intervention anddid not require out-of-home placement. Data presented in the application estimated that ofthe youngsters placed in residential programs by the Cluster, the needs of over half could have been met if intensive, community-based services had been available. Specifically, services such as day treatment, intensive home-based services, therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization services, and respite care would reduce the need for placement in residentialtreatment and hospital facilities, many of which are out of county. The Intensive ServicesGrant allowed Richland County to fill some of these gaps by developing day treatment andhome-based services.However, the need for additional intensive treatment options inRichland County remains.The gaps in the Richland County system of care fall in both residential and nonresidentialareas. There appears to be widespread agreement that the highest priority need within thesystem is for therapeutic foster care services. Despite the recent expansion of the system ofcare, the limited availability of beds in residential treatment programs within the countyresults in the placement of too many youngsters in residential programs outside of the community. The development of therapeutic foster care services in the county, as well as 24 additional options for residential treatment, would enable the system to meet these needs locally. Residential options for use in crisis situations, such as a crisis stabilization unit and emergency therapeutic foster homes, are also identified as a system need.In the nonresidential area, the reported system needs include: oDay treatment for children ages 6 to 10 and for adolescents (the current Intensive Day Treatment Program serves youngsters ages 10 to 14)oRespite careoTransitional services for older adolescentsoAdditional case management servicesThe chart shown on the following page displays a plan for the Richland County system of care. It shows those services which are currently operating and those which are considered future possibilities. Among the high-priority future possibilities are therapeutic foster care, a crisis stabilization unit, and respite care. The availability of resources to support these services will determine when the system will implement these services.Another area of need noted during the site visit is to enhance the availability of services in Shelby and towns in outlying areas of the county.Most services and resources are concentrated in or near Mansfield, and families residing in rural areas may have difficulty in accessing these resources. For many families, transportation is difficult, and they may be forced to travel 25 miles or more in order to keep appointments. VII. SYSTEM LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS Context for Interagency CollaborationThe interagency collaborative approach to the development of a system of care for troubled children is not without precedent in Richland County. In fact, there appears to be a history in the county of approaching problems through collaborative problem-solving strategies involving multiple agencies. Committees representing numerous agencies and organizations have been formed to address such diverse problems in the community as at-risk elementary age children, sexual abuse of children, early intervention, economic recovery, and others. Often, service development initiatives have emanated from these multiagency groups which have formed to address specific community problems. The Elementary School Children Coalition, Sexual Abuse Planning Group, Early Intervention Collaborative, and Parenting Coalition provide examples of the collaborative problem-solving approaches which are characteristic of Richland County. oElementary School Children Coalition - This group formed to address problems related to elementary age school children who have been coming to the attention of the schools and community agencies. The symptom common to many of these children is excessive absenteeism, but they exhibit an array of additional problems which place them at risk. The Coalition considered potential service delivery approaches for this population and presented its recommendations to the Cluster in 1989. A committee 25Iti KEYPersons/positionsServices/ProgramsNow OperatingActive Development COPY visor Therapeutic ........ . Parent.Skill.TrainingCoordinator. ParentSk iIITrainingPrograms ( .2 formed to further examine the nerds of this at-risk population and to recommendways in which schools and community agencies could network to develop programs and share the costs of service delivery.oSexual Abuse Planning Group - The rapidly growing problem of sexual abuse of children stimulated the formation of a multidisciplinary group to confront this issue. The group's membership included representatives of the medical community and mental health, child welfare, law enforcement, and judicial agencies as well as concerned private citizens. The result of this process was the development of a coordinated approach to handling sexual abuse cases in the community and for providing comprehensive treatment for child sexual abuse victims and their families. Children Services, The Center, the prosecutor and courts now work together to facilitate the legal process related to sexual abuse as well to facilitate treatment. The Center's STOP program is a tangible result of the collaborative planning process. The services provided by the STOP program include early identification; outreach; individual, group, and family counseling; specialized case management; and prevention and education programming. A comprehensive release form was developed to allow sharing of information among involved agencies and to simplify the intake process. The STOP program secured a full-time case manager who coordinates all services in an attempt to avoid the difficulties often encountered due to the involvement of multiple agencies in child sexual abuse situations.oEarly Intervention Collaborative - This interagency group was formed to integrate the agencies which serve young children and their families in Richland County and to create an organized network for referrals and services. A wide range of agencies and programs are represented on the Early Intervention Collaborative includingHeadstart, the Mansfield-Richland County Health Department, Children Services, Newhope Center, Department of Human Services, The Center, Richland County Schools, Mansfield City Schools, and Shelby City Schools. Also representedare the Chamber of Commerce, Ohio State University-Mansfield, and the Northcentral Ohio Special Education Regional Resource Center. Two of the major activities of the collaborative have involved conducting a needs assessment regarding early intervention and the development of the Richland County Comprehensive Early Intervention Plan.While the collaborative officially formed in 1990, the Early Intervention Program was established in 1983 to identify and serve infants and young children who have developmental delays or are at risk. This program was designed based upon an interagency collaborative model, with an interagency advisory committee and a formal interagency agreement signed in 1988.oParenting Coalition of Richland County - The Parenting Coalition was formed in 1990 under the leadership of CACY, the Health Department, and Planned Parenthood. It is a voluntary organization comprised of representatives of schools and community agencies which are involved in providing either education or services to parents. The purpose of the Parenting Coalition is to work cooperatively toward improving parenting skills in Richland County by providing a resource and support system. Specifically, the mission of the Coalition includes assessing the needs of parents, raising awareness of available services and educational opportunities, coordinating existing parenting education services, and sponsoring parent training programs. 27 As noted, a formal structure for interagency coordination with respect to multineed childrendates back to the Youth Services Coordinating Council which was formed in the mid 3970s.Among the accomplishments of the YSCC was the development of a model for multiagencystaffings involving all relevant youth serving agencies. Following Governor Celeste'sexecutive order, the mechanism for system level coordination changed with the creation ofthe Richland County Interagency Cluster in 1984 for the purpose of ensuring interagencycooperation in providing a continuum of services for multineed children and their families.Originally called the Interagency Linkage Group, the Cluster's initial focus was on caseplanning and coordination for individual youngsters. The Cluster's focus gradually broadenedto encompass planning for the development of a comprehensive system of care for childrenin Richland County. A number of grants were pursued by the Cluster in order to provide theresources to develop high-priority service components such as Gateway, Intensive DayTreatment, and home-based services.Most recently, the structure for system level coordination evolved further with the formationof the Richland County Youth and Family Council of Governments for the purpose ofimplementing and coordinating services for children and families throughout RichlandCounty. The COG, which also serves as Richland County's Cluster, is the mechanismcurrently used to coordinate the system of care and its component services.Richland County Youth and Family Council of GovernmentsThe Richland County COG/Cluster functions as an interagency structure for both systemlevel coordination and case review purposes. The agreement creating the COG was signedin October 1990 by the Mansfield Board of Education, the Richland County Board ofEducation, the Richland County Children Services Board, the Mansfield/Richland CountyBoard of Health, the Richland County Board of Mental Health and Recovery Services, andthe Richland County Board of Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities. The purposeof the COG, as stated in the agreement, is to implement and coordinate the rendition ofservices for children and families throughout Richland County. Participants noted thatRichland County was the first community in Ohio to formally organize its cluster as a COG,a legal entity which allows the agencies to act collectively for the purpose of operatingprograms, applying for grants, hiring staff, and other activities related to providing for theneeds of Richland County children and families. The agreement confers the authority on theCOG to:1.Study problems which are of concern to two or more members of the Council as itshall deem appropriate including health, safety, welfare, and economic conditions asthey impact on children and families.2.Promote cooperative arrangements and coordinate actions among its members andbetween its members and other agencies of local and state government and the federalgovernment.3.Make recommendations for review and action to the members of the Council and,upon request, to other public agencies which perform functions similar to that of theCouncil in Richland County. 28 4.Promote cooperativeagreements and contacts among the members, othergovernmental agencies, and private persons, corporations, and agencies.5.Apply for and accept funds, grants, fees, gifts, and services from the United States orany of its agencies, the State oT Ohio or any of its agencies, from political subdivisionswhether a member of the Council or not, and from individuals and privatecorporations whether for profit or not for profit and apply the same to carry out thepurposes of the Council.As noted, the COG is governed by an executive committee comprised of the six COG memberswith three officers elected annually. An advisory board consists of all COG members plus thechief executive officers of a wide variety of governmental and nonprofit agencies servingchildren and families in Richland County, i.e., all Cluster members. This structure was based upon a legal opinion that only governmental entities which are taxing authorities andhave their own boards could legally be part of the COG. The advisory board, created throughCOG by-laws, ensures that all other agencies become involved in the process and are not excluded from the interagency system building process.COG activities are coordinated by the Cluster Coordinator, a position initially funded by theIntensive Services Grant from the State Level Cluster. Prior to this grant, the role of ClusterCoordinator was fulfilled by a staff person who held full-time responsibilities within theChildren Services agency.In the grant application, it was stated that the Cluster haddeveloped to the point where a coordinator was needed who could devote a significant amount of time to overseeing system coordination and planning activities. The role of the ClusterCoordinator was envisioned as encompassing several facets, focusing both on individual youngsters who may come to the attention of the COG/Cluster and on interagencycoordination and service development efforts. At the time of site visit, the Cluste.... Coordinator was a newly established position, and the specific role of the Coordinator was evolving, particularly in view of the transition to the COG structure. As planned, theCoordinator fulfills a critical system coordination function, with responsibilities including:oCoordinating and handling logistical arrangements for COG/Cluster meetings andactivities.oMaintaining information and tracking children and adolescents served by theCOG/Cluster. oMaintaining contact with all system components and working with agencies andcoalitions of agencies to develop shared programming.oCoordinating the activities of a Quality Assurance Committee representing all youthand family serving agencies which is attempting to standardize and coordinate qualityassurance activities throughout the system.oPotentially serving as a screening point for all out-of-county placements and workingwith the community system to ensure that all possible county resources are utilized prior to bringing a child to the attention of the COG/Cluster. 29 & oOverseeing and coordinating service components operated by the COG.It was felt that the Cluster Coordinator position would significantly speed the evolution of the system of care in Richland County, allowing the COG/Cluster to play a more active role in service planning and coordination.COG/Cluster meetings occur monthly and are chaired by the current COG President and facilitated by the Cluster Coordinator. A typical meeting, which occurred in October 1990, addressed a number of agenda items ranging from individual cases to critical system planning and coordination issues. The portion of the meeting focusing on individual youngsters included updates on old cases, with discussion about progress and decisions about such matters as extending financial support for residential treatment for three additionalmonths, planning a step-down placement for a youngster in residential treatment, and strategies to enhance parental involvement in a difficult case. Two new cases were presented to the COG/Cluster for consideration, both presenting challenging circumstances and multipleneeds. In one case, that of a 15-year-old pregnant client diagnosed with manic depressive illness, the COG/Cluster members agreed to share the cost of a temporary supportive placement during the pregnancy while the client would be off medication. In the second case, the COG/Cluster agreed to purchase intensive home-based services from the Without Walls Program at Sagamore Hills Hospital, to seek MR/DD resources to provide training for the parents, and to possibly request assistance from the State Level Cluster.These cases illustrate the functioning the COG/Cluster with respect to individual cases whereby children and families whose multiple needs have not been met within existing services are brought to the group for consideration. Cases brought before the COG/Cluster must first go through the assessment process at Gateway or, alternatively, Gateway staff must review the assessments done by other agencies and play a consultive role in the process. Often, COG/Cluster member agencies agree to shake portions of the cost of purchasing needed services and supports for youngsters and families, typically based on whether the agency currently is or should be involved in the particular case A rather unique disposition agreed upon in the context of the COG/Cluster was to share the costs of sending a child, his parents, and a mental health therapist from the Center for Individual and Family Services to a nine- day rage reduction therapy program in Colorado. This action was seen as an alternative to residential placement for the child. The mental health therapist reported on this experience at the COG/Cluster meeting and offered in-service training for other professionals in rage reduction techniques.The remainder of the meeting focused on system level coordination and management issues. Both Gateway and Intensive Day Treatment, two services under the purview of the COG/Cluster, were considered in terms of programmatic and financial progress. A major problem area, that of a projected shortfall of $55,000 in Fiscal Year 1991, was discussed at length. Participants felt that the step-down formula in the Gateway grant was too severe, and could more aptly be described as \"leap down.\" Strategies to address this financial crisis were debated, and a decision was made to appeal to the state for additional funding as well as to increase local agency support for Gateway and other COG services. A one-day retreat was planned to focus exclusively on long-range financial planning for the system of care, with the specific objective of planning a more methodical approach to determining each agency's share of the local resources needed to continue to develop and support the system of care. 30I 0 The retreat did, in fact, result in a number of decisions related to the financial crisis as wellas future planning.Along with the adoption of cost containment measures, agenciescontributed additional monies to remedy the shortfall in Fiscal Year 1991. Participatingagencies reached agreement on their financial contributions for Fiscal Year 1992 andestablished four committees to continue the long-range planning process: Budget andFinance, Operations, Long-Range Planning, and Communications.COG/Cluster members reported that the most difficult issue they have dealt with has beenthe fiscal viability of the system of care. While they have developed several criticalcomponents of the system, the uncertainty of continued state support and the availability offunds from local agencies to operate these services remained unanswered questions at thetime of the site visit. The major priority of the COG/Cluster at that time was addressing theimmediate financial crisis as well as the long-term financing of the system of care.The functioning of the COG/Cluster was considered to be highly effective, though not problemfree. Many participants emphasized the importance of personalities to the collaborativeprocess, noting that agency administrators must be predisposed to the collaboration and mustbelieve in the concept and philosophy of a coordinated, community-based system of care. Itwas suggested that the need for collaborative systems of care for children has obviousimplications for the selection and training of administrators of child-serving agencies who canmake a critical difference in the collaborative process. The leaders of the Richland Countysystem repeatedly verbalized the need for coordination and appeared to view each service asone piece of an interconnected system.Further, the Richland County agency executives reported that they depend on their strongpersonal relationships with each other for the resolution of the inevitable conflicts whicharise. When conflicts occur, other players typically put pressure on the disagreeing membersto resolve their differences. A delegation may even be used to meet with members to urgeand facilitate compromise. Humor and friendly bantering play vital roles at COG/Clustermeetings in reducing tensions and nourishing the personal relationships among members.Some agencies in a community are invariably reluctant to join into the collaborative process.The advice of the Richland County participants is to continue to attempt to involve reluctantagencies, but not to allow unwilling participants to slow the collaborative process down.Ways to involve hesitant agencies may include attempting pilots of various collaborativeapproaches on a small scale to encourage their participation and offering \"carrots\" such asopportunities for cost sharing. While attempting to involve these agencies, the collaborativesystem development process should proceed unchecked. The result may be that agencieswhich decline a meaningful role in system development and coordination may ultimately seethe system developed and operated without their involvement, expertise, or benefit.Confidentiality issues have not proven to be impediments for the Richland CountyCOG/Cluster. A shared release form was developed, and a staff person from one of theinvolved agencies takes the lead in approaching parents to explain the interagency processand request that they sign the release. Rarely have parents refused permission forinformation sharing when they have been educated as to the purpose of the interagencyprocess for service planning and coordination. COG/Cluster members, however, are cognizantof the need to protect sensitive client information. Case records are shared with COG/Cluster 31T, members prior to a meeting to enable participants to familiarize themselves with the cases to be presented. Following the discussion, records and case summaries are placed in thecenter of the table, collected, and later shredded.COG/Cluster members indicated that although some communities appear preoccupied withconfidentiality issues, such issues need not prevent interagency collaboration. In some cases, confidentiality requirements may be used as an excuse for not working together. Participantsindicated that the Richland County agencies are not stymied by fear of liability in this area and that legal and ethic requirements governing confidentiality can be met with fewcomplications.Joint ServicesJoint services are another mechanism for ensuring system coordination, and Richland Countyhas numerous examples of programs planned, administered, or operated cooperatively bymultiple agencies. The most obvious examples of joint service delivery are provided byGateway and Intensive Day Treatment which are administered by a collaborative group of agencies through the structure of the COG/Cluster. These programs are cooperatively managed and financed by the COG agencies.In addition, a wide variety of agencies made contributions to these programs to assist withstart-up needs such as financial contribution3 from the Richland County Juvenile Court andMental Health Board, staff and computer software from The Center, furnishings andequipment from the Mansfield City and Richland County Schools, and more. Ongoing contributions by various community agencies to these programs are invaluable to their operation. For example, Richland Hospital provides staff to conduct group therapy and work with parents at Intensive Day Treatment.A number of other programs represent the collaborative efforts of two or more agencies such as the STOP program, the Summer Youth Program, Home-Based Services, and the EarlyIntervention Program. These programs reflect a propensity in Richland County to addressand solve problems by sharing resources and expertise in a coordinated manner. VIII. CLIENT LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS The client level coordination function in the Richland County system of care is fulfilled to a great extent by the case management services provided by Gateway. Gateway focuses on multineed children and their families and uses an extensive assessment process to identify the child's and the family's strengths and needs, set goals, and define potential interventions.During the assessment phase, a determination is made as to whether Gateway case management services are needed.Gateway employs three case managers, typically at the bachelor's degree level or below. Case managers carry caseloads of 15 to 20 active cases, a caseload which is considered appropriatefor their style of case management. The Gateway case manager is seen as the central point 32I() of information and coordination for the child and family. Similar to other case managementservices, the role of the Gateway case managers encompasses: oHelping the family to meet basic needs,oPlanning services and interventions,oLocating or designing creative service alternatives,oLinking, brokering, and accessing services,oCoordinating and facilitating service delivery,oMonitoring services,oAdvocating for the child and family, andoEducating and empowering the familyGateway case managers are guided by a well-articulated philosophy that emphasizes\"empowering\" families. This concept is defined as assisting families to select their own goalsand priorities and further helping by providing information, teaching skills, giving familiesoptions for services and supports, allowing families to assume responsibility and makedecisions, teaching families how to advocate for themselves, and instilling hope. Casemanagers made it clear that the family unit makes all final decisions about services.A critical aspect of Gateway's case management approach is the \"network meeting,\" whichbrings together all agencies and professionals who are or should be involved with the childand family. The family is considered part of the team, and the parents (and the youngsterwhen appropriate) are essential participants in the network meeting. The goal of thenetwork meeting is to obtain commitments from the various agencies for particular servicesand supports for the child and family. The initial network meeting is expected to result ina coordinated service plan, the \"network plan,\" with clearly defined roles and responsibilitiesfor all involved agencies and professionals. Follow-up network meetings for a particular childand family may be held if necessary, and, in particularly difficult cases, a series of networkmeetings may be needed in order to appropriately serve the child and family.The network meeting is organized and chaired by the Gateway case manager. In additionto the primary agenda of planning and coordinating services for an individual youngster, themeetings are seen by Gateway staff as an educational opportunity. They allow casemanagers to educate all participants about the role of Gateway as a service planning andcoordinating program rather than a treatment provider. Further, they continually attemptto convey the philosophy that no one agency can solve all problems, that responsibility formultiproblem youngsters and families must be shared, and that the network meetings area strategy for accomplishing such interagency sbaring and coordination. While agencyexecutives have become committed to this philosophy, line staff are used to more categoricalthinking Often, they have had little experience of an interagency network and how it canfunction to benefit both the family and the system. Further, line staff may have had littleexposure to the philosophy of family involvement and empowerment, and of making thesystem fit the family rather than making the family fit the system. As a result of participating in network meetings and in coordinated service plans, the line staff of otheragencies and systems in Richland County are increasingly becoming more aligned with thephilosophy espoused by Gateway and the system of care, particularly regarding the need forinteragency collaboration and family focus in service delivery. 33 1. The Gateway case manager then monitors the implementation of the network plan, appraising service delivery as well as client progress. While Gateway case managers have no formal authority, they appear to have a good rapport with staff from community agenciesand are able to prompt them to provide agreed-upon services when necessary. Some flexible funds are available to Gateway case managers to meet special needs. Case managers may use these funds for diverse needs such as paying an emergency bill, buying toys, taking a youth or family to lunch, or sending a child to camp. In some cases, families may make monthly payments to repay an outlay made by Gateway in response a pressing need. The total amount of flexible funds available to Gateway case managers currently is $2000. However, recommendations to increase the amount of flexible funds are under consideration.Another task to be accomplished at the network meeting is the assignment of a \"lead case manager\" for each child and family from one of the involved service providing agencies. The lead case manager role is assigned to the agency or person who most logically could fulfill this role. There is no restriction on who might serve as lead case manager; in one case, the child's mother was assigned the lead case management role. The Gateway case manager, who typically works intensively with the family and involved agencies in the early phases of service delivery, may step back over time as service agencies and the lead case manager assume greater ongoing responsibility. Thus, over time the Gateway case management roleshifts to one of monitoring and evaluating the service plan, contacting the family and lead case manager regularly to assess service delivery and progress, and determining if thenetwork team needs to be reassembled for any reason. Gateway case management services typically are provided for a period of approximately six months or less, with the lead case manager and service providing agencies continuing to deliver services on an ongoing basis.Using lead case managers from service providing agencies is an approach reportedly involving some challenges and complexities for the system of care. Through this approach, staff withvarying backgrounds and skills may become lead case managers.While they may be experienced and skilled in their own fields, they most likely have not had any training specific to case management roles, skills, and activities. An additional responsibility for Gateway case managers often is to \"train\" staff from other agencies regarding the roles and responsibilities of case managers so that they can effectively assume the lead case management role.Beyond training, lead case managers may face time limitations and conflicting demands from other aspects of their jobs in their own agencies which may frustrate their efforts to adequately fulfill case management functions. In many cases, however, the lead case managers from service agencies are highly effective in monitoring and coordinating services for youngsters and families.Thus, ix combination of Gateway case management for multineed youngsters, network meetings, and the assignment of lead case managers from service agencies is used for client level coordination in the Richland County system. Given the extensive need for case management services, it was suggested that additional specialized case managers would be an important addition to the system. In particular, the system would benefit from case managers with the ability to work with youngsters and families for longer periods of time. These case managers might be added to Gateway or, alternatively, a case management component for children might be appropriately added to The Center, much like the case management component for adults with mental illness. Given the current fiscal constraints facing the system, there are no current plans to expan,.:. case management services. 34 Although it may not be feasible to hire additional case managers for the system of care, casemanagement training is an area receiving attention. North Central Technical College offersa course in case management as part of its Human Services Program. Additionally, theHuman Services Program has sufficient flexibility to allow a student to tailor an associatedegree program in case management. Gateway staff have taken advantage of thisopportunity. Staff from the system have taken advantage of training in case managementoffered by the Ohio Department of Mental Health over the past five years, including the FirstNational Case Management Conference held in Cincinnati in 1990. Several respondentssuggested that ths. COG might consider sponsoring case management training opportunities,particularly for staff who serve as lead case managers within the various service agencies. IL SYSTEM OF CARE ACTIVITIES Family InvolvementA primary element of the Richland County system of care philosophy is that children cannotbe isolated from their families and that the system must be committed to focusing on theentire family in the planning and delivery of services. This belief has been operationalizedby ensuring that the family is a full participant in all phases of service delivery. Firstimplemented by Gateway, families are included as essential participants in network meetingsand all other efforts to develop and implement a service plan, and they are the primarydecision makers throughout the service delivery process. Other agencies have embraced thephilosophy of family involvement and family empowerment and have begun functioning insimilar ways. Indeed, the rhetoric as well as practice in Richland County seem to indicatewidespread acceptance of the importance of the involvement of families in service delivery.The new service components within the system are clearly family focused (such as Gatewayand Home-Based Services) or have a family component (such as Intensive Day Treatment).Despite the emphasis in family involvement at the service delivery level, Richland Countyhas not as yet afforded families a meaningful role in policy making, planning, andadministering services at the system level. Families and consumers are represented on theRichland County Mental Health Board, but are not yet included in any capacity on theCOG/Cluster or other advisory committees related to the system of care for children.Another gap is the lack of parent support or parent advocacy groups for childrea withemotional lisorders in Richland County. The Northcentral Ohio Special Education RegionalResource Center is located in Mansfield and offers a series of parent training sessions on avariety of topics as well as support groups of parents Pf youngsters with various handicappingconditions. Few of these activities specifically address the concerns of parents of youngsterswith emotional disorders, and there have been few attempts to stimulate the developmentof family support and/or advocacy groups for this population. Efforts to initiate an \"Advocatesfor Invisible Children\" group have met with limited success to date. 1-35t) Cultural CompetenceAll participants in the Richland County system acknowledge the importance of creating aculturally competent system of care. However, it was also conceded that this is an area inwhich little progress has been achieved. Some actions have been taken toward reaching outto the minority community and enhancing both the accessibility and the cultural competenceof services. For example, some agencies within the system actively attempt to recruit andhire minority staff. The Center attempted to place an outreach office in the Human ResourceBureau building which is located in an area accessible to the African American communityin Mansfield. While this approach met with limited success, it indicated a desire on the partof the mental health system to improve its services to minority citizens in the county.Gateway has had some success in reaching the minority community, with 20.7 percent of itsclientele being minorities. This compares favorably with the percentage of minority clientson the caseloads of other agencies within the system. The improvement appears to be dueto a location accessible to the minority community and efforts by Gateway staff to acquaintpeople in the minority community with their services. As an example, Gateway casemanagers visited African American churches to discussed Gateway services. In addition,acceptance of Gateway services in the minority community seemed to be enhanced followingtwo successful episodes of services to minority families.One agency within Richland County which has had considerable success in achieving culturalcompetence is the Human Resource Bureau. This agency works with a population comprisedof 58 percent minority youth and provides a host of education, training, and employmentprograms. Among the strategies used to enhance cultural competence are: oPhysical location accessible to the African American community.oOutreach to African American agencies, churches, and community organizations toeducate people about services and recruit potential clients.oRecruiting and hiring African American staff.oAccommodating the needs of the client population by staying open until midnight,bringing medical personnel to the facility to perform required physicals, etc.oIncluding Black Ministerial Alliance and other key community groups in an advisorycapacity.The services of the Human Resource Bureau are described as client centered and areorganized to facilitatc. the involvement of minority clients. Other agencies within the systemmay need to adopt similar strategies in order to reach and effectively serve the minoritycommunity. To date, little training in cultural competence has been available to staff inRichland County's child-serving agencies beyond a training event sponsored by the OhioDepartment of Mental Health. It is recognized that improving the cultural competence of thesystem of care is a critical goal for Richland County.TransitionThe population of youth in transition to adulthood requires a constellation of specializedservices in order to prepare them for independent living and for employment and to link themwith needed services and supports within the adult service system. The Richland County 36 system of care includes several services that aid troubled youngsters in transition. First, theschools develop transition plans for older adolescents in special education, primarily focusingon vocational issues. Children Services offers a program for emancipated youth reaching theage of majority. Through this program, the agency may help to set the adolescent up on hisor her own and provide a caseworker to offer support and instruction in independent livingskills. Eligible youngsters are those in foster care or residential placements. Additionally,the YWCA offers a Home and Family Living Series which includes a series of sessions for aperiod of 10 to 12 weeks which can be followed by support groups.While these programs offer some support to youth in transition, this clearly is an area inwhich the system must devote increased effort and attention. It was reported that linkagesbetween the children's system of care and adult mental health system rest more on personalrelationships than on formalized arrangements for ensuring appropriate transitions. Forexample, one of the Gateway case managers formerly worked as a case manager for adultsat The Center and, by virtue of her ties with the staff, is able to involve youths in the adultmental health system on an individual case basis. More systematic provisions to link youthin transition are needed as well as more extensive programming to address the needs of thisgroup.AdvocacyThe system of care for children in Richland County has developed despite the lack oforganized advocacy activities on behalf of troubled children. There are no Mental HealthAssociation or Alliance for the Mentally Ill chapters in Richland County, and no otheradvocacy groups focusing on emotionally disturbed children. Respondents indicated that theadvocates for children in Richland County are workers within the system. X. FINANCING The primary strategies used to finance the system of care in Richland County includeinteragency funding of services on an individual case basis, interagency funding of systemcomponents, third party reimbursement, and local tax levies. Interagency funding of servicesfor individual children is a strategy which originated when the cluster system was implemented in Ohio in 1984. The COG/Cluster considers cases of youngsters and theirfamilies with multiple and particularly challenging needs. If the COG/Cluster makes adecision to provide financial support for the service plan designed for a youth and family, an agreement is then reached among the participating agencies regarding their relativecontributions. Often, it is the costs of an out-of-home placement that the agencies mustshare, but such arrangements may be designed for virtually any type of services or supports. At the time of the site visit, there was no set formula governing the participation of thevarious agencies in funding services. Typically, agencies contribute based upon theirinvolvement with the particular youngster under consideration. For example, if the MentalHealth Board, Children Services, and Juvenile Court are already involved with the youngster,they would most likely be the agencies which share the cost of the jointly developed serviceplan.There may be instances in which an agency assumes a share of the costs if theyoungster should be involved or is eligible for that agency's services. In one case, the 37 Wit) Juvenile Court participated because the child had the potential to be a serious offender. Aquestion under consideration by the COG/Cluster is whether an established formula shouldbe developed to govern the percentage of financial participation of each agency in fundingagreed-upon interagency service plans. In the interim, the agencies appear to achieve readyagreement regarding financial support for individual cases at COG/Cluster meetings.Joint funding of service components is a second strategy employed successfully in RichlandCounty to support system development. Gateway is a prime example of how funds from avariety of local agencies can be blended to develop and operate services considered centralto the system's operation. In 1990, local agencies were prc siding 24 percent of Gateway'sfunding, local match fix the Ohio Department of Mental Health grant. The largestcontributors of local funds were the Mental Health Board and the Children Services Board;funds were also provided by the Mansfield City Schools, Richland County Schools, JuvenileCourt, Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities Board, and Health Department. Partof the rationale for such blended funding is lies in the ability to reduce the use of residentialplacements by providing intensive, coordinated services. Savings to individual agencies resulting from :reductions in residential placements can then be applied to additionalcommunity-based services. In addition to cash, agencies provide a wide variety of in-kindcontributions to Gateway, Intensive Day Treatment, and others.Due to the decreasing state grant fur ding mechanisms, it was anticipated that the localfunding for Gateway and other system components would increase substantially by 1991 andfurther increase over the next several years. A major issue facing the COG/Cluster at thetime of the site visit was the future financial viability of the newly developed servicecomponents and the extent of financial participation of each agency in supporting theseservices.At the time of the site visit, third party reimbursement was not a major source of funds forthe system of care. However, options for third party reimbursement were being explored witha view towards accessing fees, Medicaid, and other third party sources for services providedunder the auspices of the COG/Cluster. There was some concern that COG/Cluster serviceswould not be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement since they were not provided by a qualifiedmental health agency with psychiatric supervision. In addition, state barriers to Medicaidbilling were a concern, in particular whether the COG was an eligible entity. As a result ofconsiderable effort in working with the Ohio Department of Mental Health, these barriershave been overcome. As of July 1991, services provided by the COG/Cluster are eligible forMedicaid reimbursement.Local tax levies provide a major source of funding for the operation of most of the agencieswhich participate in the system care. Levies for mental health, children's services, mentalretardation/developmental disabilities, and others are held to provide local tax dollars tosupport service delivery.Each of the agencies relies upon levy funds to participate ininteragency funding for individual yo..mgsters and for service components such as Gateway.While no decision h,.s yet been made, some respondents indicated that a tax levy may be themost consistent, secure mechanism for the long-term financing of COG services. Levies areburdensome and tend to be an unpopular funding strategy, particularly in an environmentin which the public is reluctant to assume an additional tax burden. Nevertheless, the 38 14U COG/Cluster may consider an additional tax levy in mental health or another of the agenciesin order to ensure sufficient funds for continued system development efforts.At the time of the site visit, the Richland County system was grappling with a troublesomefunding crisis. Of immediate concern, was a projected $55,000 shortfall in the funds availableto support Gateway's operation through the fiscal year ending June 30, 1991. This deficitwas attributed to what was described as a drastic stepdown of state funding for this service.A portion of the October 1990 COG/Cluster meeting was devoted to discussion of this criticalproblem. A two-pronged strategy was devised -- approaching the state for additional fundsto continue Gateway's operations and a more realistic stepdown formula as well as increasinglocal agencies' contributions.Beyond the immediate funding crisis, the COG/Cluster members recognized the need to beginplanning for the long-range fiscal viability of the Richland County system. Respondentsnoted that the system development process in Richland County has not been stymied by \"fearof financing,\" as has occurred in many other communities. Rather, the agencies have createdthe system structure and basic service components, leaving the design of long-term financingstrategies to a later stage of development. During the October 1990 COG/Cluster meeting,a retreat was planned in order to begin to address these financing issues. The major agendaitem for the retreat was to be the development of a more methodical system for determiningeach agency's share of the funding for Gateway and other COG/Cluster services and designingstrategies to ensure the long-term fiscal viability of the system. The retreat, held inDecember 1990, resulted in additional agency contributions to remedy the Fiscal Year 1991shortfall as well as decisions regarding Fiscal Year 1992 contributions. Participants notedthat if the COG/Cluster is committed to maintaining the existing services and to furtherdevelopment of the system, then member agencies must begin to build these costs into theirbudgeting processes in order to underwrite the future of the system of care. A finance committee was established in order to explore all potential funding options for the RichlandCounty system of care. XL EVALUATION Evaluation is an area that has lagged behind in the Richland County system. Few evaluationactivities have been undertaken either with respect to individual components or the systemof care as a whole. Participants report that when there is a choice between devoting timeand energy to program development and direct service activities versus evaluation activities,program development and direct service always take precedence. While the importance ofevaluation is recognized, it has not as yet occurred in any formalized or systematic manner. According to respondents, external pressure and perhaps specially targeted resources may be necessary incentives for serious attention to evaluation.Despite the lack of attention to evaluation, there appears to be consensus as to some of the measures that might be used to assess the effectiveness of the system of care. These include: oIncreased number of children served,oIncreased number of children maintained in their own homes, 39 oReduction in money spent on out-of-county placements,oEffectiveness of individual service components, andoYounger average age of children served (earlier intervention).One crude measure of progress may be provided by considering the number of referrals fromRichland County to the State Level Cluster. This provides a rough estimate of the numberof youngsters whose needs could not be met locally through the collaborative efforts of theRichland County agencies. In 1986, Richland County referred 22 youngsters to the StateLevel Cluster for consideration; by 1990 referrals to the State Cluster were reduced to three.This has been attributed to the new community-based services developed locally as well asto the interagency effort to create and fund services and supports needed by youngsters andfamilies.Quality assurance is an area that the system is beginning to address. A plan has beendeveloped to establish a system-wide Quality Assurance Committee which will function underthe auspices of the COG/Cluster. The Committee will conduct case reviews and developstandardized quality assurance requirements for the entire system of care. The initial focusof the Quality Assurance Committee will be on COG services.Another role planned for the Quality Assurance Committee is to identify youngsters in out-of-county placements and assess the likelihood of success in these placements as well as thefeasibility of bringing these youngsters back to Richland County for services. It is expectedthat the Quality Assurance Committee will be a vehicle enabling Richland County to beginto think in terms of system outcomes rather than individual agency or provider outcomes.While there are no cross-agency management information or tracking systems, Gateway hasdeveloped a tracking system for children and families. Additionally, aspects of Gatewayservices have been assessed based on samples of cases served by the centralized intake,assessment, and case management agency. For example, a sample of 20 randomly selectedcases was used to assess the success of the referrals made by Gateway. It was found thatfamilies referred to Gateway were already involved with an average of about two agenciesor services; Gateway assessments took approximately 22 days; the average number ofidentified needs per family was about 4; the average number of referrals per family was 2.7;and the average number of case management hours per family was nearly 12. Of the 57referrals made for the sample of 20 families, 59 percent were considered successful, 8.5percent inappropriate, 26.2 percent delayed, and 7 percent incomplete.In addition to these efforts at Gateway, the Richland County system participated in anevaluation sponsored by the State Interdepartmental Cluster for Services to Youth. Theevaluation, conducted by the Ohio State University College of Social Work, assessed thesystem of care development efforts of 11 counties in Ohio which have been recipients ofgrants from the State Level Cluster. The evaluation consisted of site visits to RichlandCounty and the other participating counties and involved gathering a blend of qualitative andquantitative data reflecting system development. The evaluation was designed to focus onthe service delivery level and the syste m level, i.e., clusters. Areas assessed relative to service delivery included impact of the local system on children and families served,satisfaction of children and families, characteristics of children and families served, andperformance indicators such as number of out-of-home placements and number of referrals 40 to the State Level Cluster. At the system level, evaluators assessed the effectiveness of thecounty cluster by examining degree of collaboration and commitment, current and futurefinancial commitments, probability of the project continuing after funding ends, barriers toimplementation, and strengths and weaknesses of the cluster. While not specific to RichlandCounty, the evaluators reached a number of general conclusions regarding the system of caredevelopment efforts in the 11 funded counties. They determined that system developmentefforts did, in fact, result in the following benefits:oIncreased collaboration and intersystem communication.oIncreased flexibility and creativity in programming to serve multineed children andtheir families.oExpanded community -based services allowing communities to reduce their reliance on out-of-home andif-county placements.oIncreased use of less restrictive placements.oIncreased involvement of systems which have traditionally operated separately suchas education.oIncreased use of individualized case planning approaches and involving families in theservice planning process.oIncreased availability of prevention and early intervention services.oEnhanced community investment, particularly financial, in maintaining the systemof care. XII. MAJOR STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES Through interviews with key informants representing a wide variety of constituenciesinvolved in the Richland County system of care, a number of factors which are critical, to thesuccess of the system were identified. The major strengths of the Richland County systeminclude the following:oLeadership- By far the most frequently noted strength of the Richland Countysystem lies in its leadership. Initially, system development efforts appear to need acore group of two to three individuals who are willing to devote a great deal of timeand energy to initiating collaborative activities and convincing others as to the potential benefits of collaborative system building efforts. A core group of activeleaders was instrumental in the early stages of system building and continues to beevident in Richland County.It was repeatedly emphasized by many respondents that the close involvement of theagency executives of the key child-serving agencies in planning, developing, andoperating the system is critical to its success. Most contend that communities willhave difficulty achieving system development goals if agency executives are notdirectly involved in the interagency process and if they are not willing to put asidedifferences, share resources, and work toward common goals. Thus, the involvementand commitment of agency executives and their willingness to collaborate are crucial. In Richland County, agency executives meet regularly through the COG/Clusterstructure and appear uniformly committed to pursuing collaborative strategies in 411.cl order to achieve common system development goals. It is their leadership, clear senseof mission, values, and modeling of collaborative behavior that sets the tone for staffat all levels of the system.Respondents noted that the longevity of the key players in Richland County may havesome positive effect on the system building process. A number of the agencyexecutives have been in their current positions for some time or have held otherpositions within Richland County. As a result, they have a history, or working throughproblems with each other and are intimately familiar with the structure and politicsof the system. Respondents speculate that continuity of leadership may be an asset,and that it might be difficult to pursue the system building agenia with significantturnover among the leadership.oShared Responsibility and Vision - Another strength is in the clear acceptance ofmutual responsibility for the target population of youngsters and families among theagencies participating in the system of care. There appears to be a pervasive beliefat the highest levels of the system operation that troubled children and their familiesare the shared concern and responsibility of all involved agencies, that no one agencycan meet the needs in isolation, and that joint funding and programming areessential. Perhaps of even greater importance is the common vision shared by theagenda involved in Richland County's system. The mission and goals of the systemwere developed at a retreat with the assistance of an outside facilitator. The jointlydeveloi. ld mission and goals provide a clear sense of purpose and guide systemdevelopment efforts.It appears that the explicit acknowledgement of sharedresponsibility and the shared \"big picture\" or vision for system development amongagencies comprise an important strength in Richland County.oProactive Attitude - Apparent in this and other initiatives in Richland County is aproactive attitude toward problem solving. When a problem is identified, it often isseen as a challenge to devise creative and collaborative solutions. Respondents notedthat people in Richland County have not been stymied by obstacles presented byfunding sources or lack thereof, by political forces, or by seemingly overwhelmingeconomic and social problems. Rather, they tend to take action and proceed toattempt to develop viable solutions. Rather than asking \"Can we do that?,\" RichlandCounty players ask \"How can we do that and pay for it?\" This willingness or abilityto \"j Amp in with both feet\" and to take a proactive approach toward collaboration andsystem development is a clear strength. Several of the agency executives have eventaken risks within their own systems, for example by redirecting funds to collaborativeservices such as Gateway. This spirit of determined dedication among the leadershiphas enabled the community to move beyond planning to actual system implementationand to piece together the resources needed to accomplish this. oMeaningful Interagency Process - The COG/Cluster process that has evolved in Richland County is meaningful, a process which deliberates critical issues and hastangible and significant outcomes. Collaborative processes are doomed to failure ifparticipants feel that they are attending just another meeting and that the impact oftheir efforts is likely to be negligible. In Richland County, participants in theCOG/Cluster typically feel that it is a vital collaborative process which focuses on 42 ILu issues of grave importance to children and families in the community and whichpotentially could create dramatic system improvements. Motivation to attend and toparticipate is most certainly enhanced by ensuring that the collaborative process isa meaningful one.oTeam Approach to Problem Solving - A number of respondents noted thatRichland County leaders tend to use a team approach to problem solving. Whateverthe issue may be, they generally are willing to sit down and hammer it out until it isresolved, even if this involves confrontation. Turf issues surface no matter how wellfunctioning a system may be. However, it appears that the Richland County systemis able to move beyond turf issues in many instances in order to negotiate and developsolutions to the pressing operational and financing problems facing the system_Retreats have been used effectively in Richland County to create a structure forproblem solving, and outside facilitators also have proven valuable in helping theleadership to reach consensus at critical junctures in system development.oService Implementation - The ability to move from planning to the actualimplementation of several service components is seen as a strength of the RichlandCounty system. The Gateway grant, a pivotal milestone in the system's development,provided the opportunity to accomplish something concrete. The development andsuccessful operation of Gateway, in turn, has created considerable momentum andmotivation to continue the system building process and to create additionalcomponents such as Intenc;ve Day Treatment, Home-Based Services, and others. Anumber of respondents indicated that it may be essential for communities to have an opportunity to start putting their system of care plans into action by actuallyimplementing service components.oSize of Community - Richland County is a relatively small community. A numberof respondents indicated that the small size of the community is an asset to systemdevelopment efforts in a number of respects. In a smaller community, the number ofinvolved agencies is manageable, individuals from the various agencies are familiar with each other, and lines of communication are fairly easy to maintain. Further,agency directors tend to be in closer touch with clinical realities and service deliveryproblems than they might be in larger communities. Thus, the size of the communitymay be a factor that has contributed to the success of system building efforts inRichland County.While the Richland County system embodies a number of noteworthy strengths, it also facesa number of challenges or problems which must be overcome in order to ensure continueddevelopment of a coordinated, community-based system of care. These include:oLong-Term Financing - The lack of a long-term financing plan for the RichlandCounty system of care is undoubtedly the largest challenge looming in its future.State grants and a patchwork of local match have provided the primary means to begin the system development process, allowing the development of Gateway, DayTreatment, end Home-Based Services as well as the hiring of a Cluster Coordinator.On a short -term basis, these grants have had a powerful impact on the system byenabling the community to begin to implement service components fairly quickly. 431, These grants, which provide decreasing levels of funding over their lifetime, must becompletely replaced by other funding streams within several years, a relatively shortperiod of time. Without efforts to secure a long-term stable funding base for theseprograms, their viability is in question as well as the community's ability to continueits efforts by putting additional components into place.The financing plan for the system of care will have to include a number of elementsincluding both public and private funds. Participants recognize that local agencieswill be forced to contribute increasing shares of the costs of the system of care from their own budgets, invariably necessitating redirecting funds from other functions orservices. The boards of the participant agencies must be educated more fully as to theimportance of the system of care and must be prepared to take on increasing sharesof system costs. The need for a full-time grant writer to apply for any available sources of support is recognized as well as the need to maximize opportunities forthird party reimbursement for services. Funding problems are complicated by whatis described as inflexible state regulations around funding and reimbursement forservices. For example, there are stringent time limitations on funding for residentialtreatment with little or no ability to adjust this based on an individual child's needsand restrictive rules governing reimbursement for case management. Regardless ofthe difficulties inherent in tackling this issue, the viability of the entire RichlandCounty system is threatened by the lack of secure, long-term financing for system ofcare services.oHuman Resource Needs- Another critical challenge facing the Richland Countysystem relates to the need for qualified staff to provide services within the system ofcare. The need to consider and address the human resource implications of systemdevelopment is becoming increasingly apparent. For example, The Center had a cadre of trained clinicians specializing in working with children and adolescents. A numberof these therapists left The Center in order to develop and staff some of the new service components. Due to fiscal constraints, The Center has been unable to fill thevacant positions resulting in a loss of competent children's mental health staff at TheCenter.Thus, while the system of care has gained, there have been adverseimplications for The Center and for its ability to provide services to children. Whiledemand for services is increasing, The Center is left with fewer staff members withspecialized skills in working with children and adolescents. It was reported that some agencies are offering incentives to staff to keep them from leaving for other jobswithin the system. Thus, it is clear that along with plans for service development,Richland County must consider plans to meet its human resource needs including recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining staff with expertise in community-basedservice approaches for youngsters and families.oTraining of Line Staff- While agency leadership has \"bought into\" the philosophyand collaborative approach to service delivery, the philosophy and approach have not yet filtered down to all line staff throughout the system. Respondents identified theneed for additional in-service training opportunities for line staff in all child-servingagencies to convey the mission and goals of the system of care as well as information on the purpose and functioning of Gateway, network meetings, case management,home-based services, and so forth. The collaborative philosophy and process cannot 44 totally succeed until it has permeated all layers of the system. It was reported thatstaff become committed to this approach after they have experienced a networkmeeting organized by Gateway or have had the opportunity to be involved in acollaborative planning and service delivery episode around a particular youngster andfamily. Participation in the process helps to instill a sense of confidence about thepotential inherent in this approach as well as the potential for helping staff to do theirown jobs more effectively.While first hand experience is undoubtedly the besteducation, training opportunities both within individual agencies and across agenciesare necessary to convey new attitudes, plans, and procedures for the system of careand to overcome mistrust and old patterns of turf protection. oService Gaps - Richland County has made remarkable progress in developingservices within a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, a number of significantservice gaps still exist in the community. As noted, needed services includetherapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization resources, day treatment for additional agegroups, respite care, transitional services for older adolescents, and additional casemanagement services. A substantial challenge facing the community is to identify andaccess the resources needed to develop these services. oCommunity Education and Involvement -In addition to educating staffthroughout the system, another identified challenge relates to educating both the layand professional communities in Richland County about the needs of troubled childrenand their families and about the evolving system of care. Respondents indicated thatthe public is essentially uninformed and uninvolved and does not understand whatservices are available or why the system of care is important to the community.Similarly, efforts to involve the community in the care of troubled children throughthe use of mentors, volunteers, Big Brothers and Sisters and the like also are scarce.Lack of community awareness and involvement is considered a potentially serious flawfor the system of care, and extensive and assertive efforts are needed to fosterunderstanding and support for system building efforts. oReluctant Agencies - No matter how well developed a system may be, there remainsthe potential for agencies to be reluctant to participate in system activities. Resistant,or simply less committed, agencies can prove to be a frustration for those agencieswhich have dedicated themselves to an interagency collaborative approach to systemdevelopment and operation. Richland County has several agencies which are less enthusiastic participants in the system. While system building activities have notbeen delayed, continued efforts to involve all child-serving agencies in the system are needed. oParent Involvement - The entire system of care is based on a strong philosophy ofserving families and of involving families in planning and delivering services. Achallenge for the Richland County system is to take this philosophy even further andinvolve parents more fully in system-level policy making and planning activities.Efforts also are needed to stimulate the development of parent support groups as there currently are few opportunities for mutual support among parents of youngsterswith emotional disorders. The need to improve the capacity for parent advocacy is yet 45 t) another important challenge. Parent advocacy could be crucial to the future growthof the system of care.oCultural Competence - Modest efforts have been devoted to reaching out to theminority community and to enhancing the cultural competence of services. Culturalcompetence is recognized as an area needing increased attention within the systemof care, and much remains to be done to better meet the needs of minority childrenand families in Richland County.Despite these challenges, progress toward developing a comprehensive, coordinated, systemof care for troubled children and their families in Richland County has been impressive.Respondents emphasized several strategies which have been particularly helpful in advancingthe pace of system development in the community. First, obtaining the direct participationand involvement of agency executives has been critical to Richland County's progress.Second, the use of an outside facilitator with strong mediation skills has helped theparticipants to work through difficult tasks and problems. A skilled facilitator can assist agroup to remain focused on long-range system planning issues and to avoid being stalled byan exclusive focus on the day-to-day crises that invariably confront the system. Third, theuse of periodic retreats offe's an opportunity for busy administrators to concentrate withoutinterruption on the challenges facing the system of care and on designing strategies toaddress them. Retreats have been used to reach consensus on the mission and goals of thesystem as well as to respond to the financial crisis and to the need to begin developing a long-range financing plan.Finally, respondents emphasized that interagency collaboration and system development areevolutionary processes which cannot happen overnight. Team building in interagency groupssuch as the COG/Cluster takes an enormous investment of time and energy and goes throughvarious stages of development. Involving agency executives, and using facilitators, retreats,and the like can speed the process and progress of such efforts. Nevertheless, system building efforts take time, patience, and nurturance. KIM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES Richland County has been involved in providing technical assistance to other communitieswhich are interested in developing systems of care. The consultation provided has takenseveral forms including telephone consultation, presentations and workshops at conferences,and on-site visits to the community to observe the functioning of Gateway, the COG/Cluster,and other aspects of the system. Participants are in the process of preparing a \"replicationmanual\" which will summarize the steps taken to develop the Richland County system. Thisdocument will be available in 1992. 46 THE RICHLkND COUNTY YOUTH AND FAMILY REGIONAL COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS' VISION STATEMENT A family serving system should be based on proactive intervention and empoweringfamilies to reach their maximum potential.

First, a number of families have difficulties that require them to be involved simultaneously with several agencies.Despite each agency's efforts to produce streamlined formal service plans and to cooperate with other agencies' efforts, there is no formal way to insure that coordinated comprehensive multi-agency service packages are developed and delivered with a minimun of accessing demands to the families. Services to help multi-problem families run the risks of being redundant, overlooking important treatment issues, being delivered only after problems have reached crisis proportions or being delivered in such a way that the family becomes exhausted and discouraged with a host of appointment times, history takings, diagnostic procedures and treatment sessions. This siutation becomes more apparent as the number and complexity of the family's presenting problems in- creases.A second service delivery problem is the presence of gaps in the array of needed services. Service provision to children and their families is carried out by a number of agencies, each with its own legal mandate and its unique sphere of operation. It has become clear that gaps do exist in the continuum of services that we aspire to.In part, this is because no single body is available to carry out a general evaluation of services to multineed children and their families in Richland County and either make recommendations for program development or implement its own programs to improve the overall service delivery picture.In light of this situation, the goal of the Richland County Interagency Cluster for Services to Youth is to promote the coordination of human services to multineed youth and their families. The Local Cluster will take steps to insure that a comprehensive continuum of services is made available to multineed youth and their families with a minimum of duplication, as early as possible in the child's life, in the child's own home wherever possible and with a minimum of service access demands upon the family.In order to accomplish this goal, the Local Cluster will conduct and keep minutes of bi-monthly meetings of those agencies mandated by H.B. 304 to be invovled in Interagency Cluster activities. Other agencies and persons will be invited to attend those meetings as is deemed appropriate by the above mandated agencies.The Local Cluster will review cases of multineed children whose service needs exceed local service capabilities and/or financial resources.Based upon a review of such cases, the Cluster will develop when necessary a formal written unified service plan that will identify the role of each agency in serving this child/family.If necessary, the Local Cluster will refer the case to the State Interdepartmental Cluster for Service to Youth for additional service recommen- dations and/or participation in the funding of special services.The Local Cluster will monitor the progress of the cases it accepts and will correspond with the State Cluster regarding these cases when appropriate.The Local Cluster will play a leading role in developing and maintaining a process for the early identification of children with multiple needs who are potentially at-risk of out-of-home placement.In order to accomplish this objective, the Local Cluster will both develop policies and procedures for reviewing such cases I Mission Statement cont. Page 2 and developing unified service plans and also either allocate existingfunds or seek new funding to support this process.Finally, the Local Cluster will devise a procedure for evaluating communityservices to multi-need youth and promoting. enhancements to or additions toexisting services. The Local Cluster will establish a body of direct servicespecialists to research the needs of multi problemed youth and their families.It is envisioned that the Local Cluster will be actively involved in the .creation of new services to such youth and to the augmenting of existingservices and will seek funding for such services.This Mission Statement was approved by the Richland County InteragencyCluster at a special meeting held on 01/10/89.

Stroul, M.Ed. CASSP Technical Assistance CenterCenter for Child Health & Mental Health PolicyGeorgetown University Child Development CenterFunded by the National Institute of Mental HealthChild and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP)July 1992 It) INTRODUCTION This case study was developed through a project conducted by the Child and AdolescentService System Program (CASSP) Technical Assistance Center at Georgetown University.It is part of a descriptive study of local systems of care which was initiated in 1990 andfunded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Child and Adolescent ServiceSystem Program. The project has involved identifying and studying communities which havemade substantial progress toward developing comprehensive, coordinated, community-basedsystems of care for children and adolescents who are severely emotionally disturbed and theirfamilies. Individual case studies of each local system of care are the products of this effortand are intended as technical assistance resources.Systems of care for troubled children and adolescents have been of great interest over the lastseveral years. In 1982, Knitzer estimated in her seminal study, Unclaimed Children, thatof the three million children with serious emotional disturbances, two-thirds were receivingno treatment whatsoever and countless others were receiving inappropriately restrictive carebecause of the lack of community-based service alternatives. In 1986, Saxe conducted a studyfor the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress which confirmedKnitzer's findings and stated that \"Mental health problems are a source of suffering forchildren, difficulties for their families, and great loss for society. Though such problems aresometimes tragic, an even greater tragedy may be that we currently know more about howto prevent and treat children's mental health problems than is reflected in the careavailable.\"In response to these problems and to the growing number of calls for change, the NationalInstitute of Mental Health launched the Child and Adolescent Service System Program(CASSP) in 1984 to assist states and communities in developing community-based systemsof care for this underserved population. Through grants and technical assistance activities,CASSP has supported the development of interagency efforts to improve the services providedto the most troubled children and youth and their families. To provide a conceptualframework for system of care development, CASSP supported the publishing of A System ofCare for Severely Emotionally Disturbed Children & Youth by Stroul and Friedman in 1986.This monograph has been called a blueprint for action in the child mental health field, andit describes the various service options required by these youngsters and the need for servicesacross all of the relevant child-serving agencies. From these components, Stroul and Friedman proposed a design for a \"system of care\" encompassing both the full range ofservices and the mechanisms required for the assurance of their appropriate delivery.Currently, there is widespread agreement that community-based systems of care foryoungsters who are severely emotionally disturbed and their families are needed, and thedevelopment of these systems has become a national goal.Despite the calls for such systems of care, until recently there were few, if any, examples oflocal systems of care which combined an array of community-based services with otheressential elements including interagency collaboration and case management. Today, thereis what might be described as an explosion of activity related to system of care development.The activities of CASSP, which have now involved every state, have played a crucial role instimulating system development at state and local levels. Increased attention to children's mental health by advocacy groups also has had a major impact. Further, system building hasbeen advanced significantly by initiatives such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation'sMental Health Services Program for Youth, which has provided funds for the developmentof systems of care in selected local areas, and extensive system development initiatives in anumber of states. As a result, many communities now have evolving systems of care whichcan be studied and described. Descriptions of the sy,2tem building approach and experienceof these communities are designed to assist other communities which are attempting to develop such systems.Potential sites for inclusion in this study were identified through a process of consultation with key informants including individuals at national and state levels who have extensiveknowledge of developments in the children's mental health field and in the development oflocal systems of care in particular. Through these initial discussions, approximately 20communities were identified. These localities were characterized as having made significantprogress toward the development of community-based systems of care consistent with thephilosophy and principles which have been promoted by CASSP and which are displayed on the following page. Accordingly, an attempt was made to locate local systems which are family focused, emphasize treatment in the least restrictive environment, involve multipleagencies, individualize services, and so forth. Similarly, an attempt was made to locate systems which have moved beyond the more traditional outpatient, inpatient, and residentialtreatment services and have begun to develop a more complete and balanced array of nonresidential and residential services including home-based services, day treatment, crisisservices, therapeutic foster care, respite care, case management and others.The second phase of the selection process involved extensive telephone interviews with a representative from each site to obtain detailed information about the array of services available in the community, the nature and functioning of the system level coordinationmechanisms, and the nature and functioning of the client level coordination or case management mechanisms. In addition, information was collected about any special system activities related to such issues as financing the system, evaluating the system, involvingfamilies in planning and delivering services, and enhancing the cultural competence of the system of care. A chart was prepared for each potential site summarizing the service array, system level coordination mechanisms, and client level coordination mechanisms.Selection of sites for further study was accomplished with the assistance of an advisory committee and was based on the following set of criteria:1.Must have a range of services in place (home-based services, crisis services,therapeutic foster care, and others).2.Must have interagency coordination mechanisms in place.3.Must have client level coordination mechanisms in place, e.g., case management.4.Must be a sufficiently well-developed local system to be able to serve as a useful example to the field and to receive national attention. ii CORE VALUES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.The system of care should be child-centered and family-focused, with the needs of thechild and family dictating the types and mix of services provided.2.The system of care should be community-based, with the locus of services as well asmanagement and decision-making responsibility resting at the community level. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.Emotionally disturbed children should have access to a comprehensive array ofservices that address the child's physical, emotional, social, and educational needs.2.Emotionally disturbed children should receive individualized services in accordancewith the unique needs and potentials of each child and guided by an individualizedservice plan.3.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services within the least restrictive,most normative environment that is clinically appropriate.4.The families and surrogate families of emotionally disturbed children should be fullparticipants in all aspects of the planning and delivery of services.5.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services that are integrated, withlinkages between child-caring agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning,developing and coordinating services.6.Emotionally disturbed children should be provided with case management or similarmechanisms to ensure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated andtherapeutic manner and that they can move through the system of services inaccordance with their changing needs.7.Early identification and intervention for children with emotional problems should bepromoted by the system of care in order to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes.8.Emotionally disturbed children should be ensured smooth transitions to the adultservice system as they reach maturity.9.The rights of emotionally disturbed children should be protected, and effectiveadvocacy efforts for emotionally disturbed children and youth should be promoted.10.Emotionally disturbed children should receive culturally competent services which aresensitive and responsive to cultural differences and special needs and are providedwithout regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, physical disability, or othercharacteristics.in 5.Should have some noteworthy activities in one or more areas including familyinvolvement, cultural competence, transition, high-risk children and adolescents,financing, and evaluation.An initial group of five communities was selected for site visits by the project team. The sitevisits generally involved spending three to four days in each community engaged in a varietyof activities designed to provide insight into the functioning of the system of care. Theseactivities included interviews with a number of individuals and groups including key systemmanagers, senior management representatives of the major child-serving agencies (mentalhealth, child welfare, education, and juvenile justice), case managers, youngsters, parents,and advocates.Additionally, the schedules included visits to three or more servicecomponents in the system of care where activities were observed and discussions held withprogram managers, staff, and, in some cases, clients. An important aspect of the site visitswas observing the functioning of interagency entities. Site visitors attended meetings ofinteragency entities focusing on system-level coordination as well as meetings of interagencyteams organized for the purpose of creating individualized service plans for specificyoungsters and their families. The site visits provided a wealth of information about eachsystem of care -- its developmental milestones, strengths, and obstacles yet to be overcome.The sample of communities studied yield valuable insights into the process of buildingsystems of care.Due to an enormous increase in system development activities incommunities across the nation, there currently are many more noteworthy examples of localsystems of .are.It should be emphasized that none of the communities selected for studyhave fully developed systems of care, and all are struggling to overcome financial and otherobstacles to system development. Rather, they are communities which have succeeded inputting some basic building blocks into place and have demonstrated progress towardachieving system development goals. The resulting case studies are intended to serve astechnical assistance resources for other states and communities as they approach thechallenge of developing local systems of care for youngsters with severe emotionaldisturbances and their families.

COMMUNITY CONTEXT The system of care to be described serves children and families of Stark County, Ohio, whichis located in the northeastern part of the state. The county is not far from other major Ohiocities, with Akron about 30 miles north, Cleveland about 50 miles north, and Columbus about120 miles southwest.Stark County is the seventh largest county in Ohio and has apopulation of 367,585. Half of the county's population is concentrated in the central areawhich includes Canton and North Canton. While the Canton area is described as urban, thesurrounding areas are described as suburban and rural. Within a mere ten minutes ofdowntown Canton, the landscape shifts to primarily large, rural farming districts.In addition to the concentration of population in the Canton/North Canton area, StarkCounty has two additional population centers -- Massillon and Alliance. Due to the distances between the three population centers and the lack of a good transportation system linkingthem, services are typically offered in each of the three areas. As might be predicted, theCanton/North Canton area boasts the richest array of services, and the service array tendsto be less well developed in the Massillon and Alliance areas.The population of Stark County is predominantly white, nearly 92 percent. Census dataindicate that 8.3 percent of the population belongs to minority groups, with most beingAfrican American (7.5 percent) and the rest being Hispanic. Much of the county's AfricanAmerican population is concentrated in Canton; approximately 18.2 percent of the populationof the City of Canton is African American, and African American children comprise about 30percent of the student population of the Canton City Schools.Census data indicate that the median family income in 1990 was $29,425, and about 13.5percent of Stark County residents had household incomes below the poverty level. Based ona more realistic standard for assessing poverty (incomes below 125 percent of the povertylevel), it is estimated that nearly 18 percent of Stark County's families can be consideredpoor.In fact, poverty in Stark County has increased by 15 percent since 1985, and thecounty's poverty rate exceeds the statewide average by 20 percent. A significant and growinggroup in Stark County consists of the working poor.Historically, Stark County has been a leading manufacturing center. In 1980, the largestindustry in the county was manufacturing, which accounted for nearly 36 percent of thecounty's jobs. Headquarters and plants have been located in Stark County for many largeindustries including alloy steel, roller bearings, vacuum cleaners, building materials, gasolineand diesel engines, and bank security and transaction technology. Along with the rest of theMidwest, the county has suffered from the scaling back of the steel and rubber industriesduring the 1970s and 1980s.While plant closings have resulted in losses in jobs, it was reported that Stark County was not as devastated by the industrial declines as were other areas. This is attributed to greaterdiversification as well as continued investments by large companies such as Timken Steel. 1 Despite the economic crisis, the county still has an industrial base. Further, the relativelylow cost of living has attracted many new residents, and the Canton/North Canton area hasexperienced rapid growth over the past 15 years.Currently, the major employers in the county include Timken Roller Bearing and SpecialtySteel, Hoover, Diebold, and Republic Engineered Steel. In addition, large numbers of citizensare employed by two general hospitals (Timken Mercy Medical Center and Aultman Hospitaland the Massillon Psychiatric Center, a state hospital serving adults with mental illness.Agriculture also contributes to the county's economic base. Not unlike other midwesterncommunities, Stark County's economy is moving from a primarily industrial job base to aneconomy that includes more service occupations as well as manufacturing and agriculture.The county offers a variety of cultural, recreational, and educational opportunities. It is perhaps best known for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a significant tourist attraction.Cantts was selected at the site for the Hall of Fame because the National Football Leaguewas founded there in 1920. There is a strong interest in sports in the area, from the minorleague Canton Indians and the professional soccer team, the Canton Invaders, to the sportsteams in nearby Cleveland. The community is home to a symphony orchestra, civic opera,ballet company, and players guild and has museums including the Hoover Historical Centerand the William McKinley Museum of History, Science, and Industry. Two four-year liberalarts colleges are located in Stark County (Malone College and Walsh College) as well as theStark Technical College and the Stark County campus of Kent State University.Stark County faces a number of significant problems. Transportation was among those citedmost frequently. The lack of a good public transportation system affects the community asa whole and creates formidable barriers to accessing services. Another frequently citedproblem was poverty, particularly the growing segment of the population which can be classified as working poor. Family instability also is perceived as a major problem for thecommunity, since Stark County has one of the higher divorce rates in the state.In order to explore the needs of community in a systematic way, the United Way of CentralStark County sponsored a county-wide needs assessment which was completed in 1990.Focus groups, telephone surveys, information and referral tabulations, and other data andreports were analyzed to identify needs and rank them in priority order. This process resulted in the identification of priority needs for the county including:oSubstance Abuse oHunger/NutritionoParenting/Family highest ranked need reflects the community's growing concern about substance abuse.Crack houses have been identified in Stark County, and there has been a 90 to 100 percent increase in the incidence of crack babies in the past several years as well as a significant increase in requests for services related to crack addiction. The Department of HumanServices (DHS) reported that 68 percent of all child abuse and neglect cases handled in 1990 2 invc'ved substance abuse in some way. Of significant concern is the growing incidence ofgang violence related to drug abuse, particularly in one section of Canton. Gangs from theLos Angeles area have been identified in the county, a cause for alarm among citizens, lawenforcement, and human service providers.Along with substance abuse services, other needs receiving the highest rankings includesupports for parenting and families, mental health services, and services to address childabuse and neglect. The four highest priority needs discerned by the United Way needsassessment process are all directly associated with the current activities of the Stark Countysystem of care for troubled children and families.The human service system at the state level in Ohio consists of seven cabinet leveldepartments including Departments of Mental Health, Mental Retardation/DevelopmentalDisabilities, Youth Services, Human Services, Health, Education, and the more recentlycreated Department of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services. While these agencies fund,regulate, and oversee local services, the service system in Ohio is largely county operatedwith community boards directing and planning service delivery in many of the categoricalareas. Thus, the service system environment in Stark County is sr-,en as one of local controland autonomy, with community-level responsibility and decision making.The following child-serving agencies and systems provide services in Stark County and are key players in the system of care:oMental Health: Stark County Community Mental Health Board and Child andAdolescent Service Center oChild Welfare: Stark County Department of Human ServicesoEducation: Stark County Board of Education and 17 School Districts with Boards ofEducation including Canton City SchoolsoJuvenile Justice: Stark County Family Court, Regional Office of Ohio Department ofYouth Services, and the Stark County Prosecutor's OfficeoHealth:Stark County Health Department, Canton City Health Department,Massillon Health Department, and Alliance Health DepartmentoMental Retardation: Stark County Board of Mental Retardation and DevelopmentalDisabilities oSubstance Abuse: Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board of Stark County 3 II. BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF SYSTEM OF CARE DEVELOPMENT History of System of CareSystem building efforts on behalf of children and youth in Stark County can be traced backto the passage of a mental health levy in 1973. At that time, there was only one mentalhealth provider agency in the county, the Central Mental Health Center. This mental healthcenter provided services almost exclusively to adults, although there was one occupationaltherapist on staff who provided services to children. The Stark County Community MentalHealth Board appealed to the citizens for additional mental health funding through the levy,with a significant portion of this funding to be applied to developing a capacity to provide mental health services to children.With the passage of the levy, the Mental Health Board appointed a children's committee to make recommendations on how best to proceed in order to develop and coordinatecomprehensive mental health services for children and adolescents. The primary recommendation of this committee was to create a separate, priVate nonprofit agency to provide mental health services to children. This proposal created a great deal of controversy and was vigorously debated. In 1975 the Stark County Community Mental Health Boardapproved the proposal to create a separate children's agency by the narrowest of margins,only one vote. As a result, the Child and Adolescent Service Center (CASC) was founded in 1976 with a staff of six professionals and funding of approximately $170,000 from the MentalHealth Board.Those in favor of the formation of a separate children's agency felt that such an organizational arrangement would offer a number of advantages including creating more visibility for the needs of children, raising confidence in the quality of services, facilitatingprospects for obtaining funding, and attracting more professionals with interest and expertisein children's mental health. In fact, these predictions have largely come true. Currently, the CASC has a staff of more than 30 professionals and a budget of more than $2.6 million for children's services, significantly more than comparable communities without a separate children's agency. While this assertion has not been tested, it appears that the Ohio countieswith separate children's agencies have garnered greater attention and resources for children'sservices than have other counties where children's services tend to be overshadowed by adultservices.Thus, the formation of the CASC is considered a principal milestone in thedevelopment of the Stark County system of care.Once the CASC was established, it was given a great deal of latitude and support by the Mental Health Board to create a system of care, and steady progress has been achieved over time. The basic philosophy for this system of care was established early in the developmentalprocess. The same children's committee which recommended the creation of a children'sagency also provided a philosophical base for the agency and its activities. From the beginning, system development activities were guided by the desire to view the child in thecontext of the family and to provide treatment within or close to the child's home. Concernabout separating children from their families and relying on out-of-community or out-of-state placements led the CASC to explore community-based programmatic approaches as it expanded its service array. Further, a board of trustees to guide the CASC was developed4 and included representatives of the other key child-serving systems. This group was the firstinteragency entity formed to plan, develop, oversee, and coordinate the county's evolvingsystem of care for children.With a clear philosophical base and interagency guidance, the CASC proceeded to develop itsservice capacity. In 1980, CASC was awarded an initial community mental health centeroperations grant of $280,000. This infusion of funds allowed the CASC to move beyondoutpatient counseling services and to establish and begin to pursue the long-range goal ofdeveloping a comprehensive continuum of care emphasizing an array of nonresidentialservices.This commitment to focus on nonresidential service components is evidenced in key decisionsto invest in day treatment programs rather than in residential treatment. In 1980, the CASCassumed responsibility for a preschool day treatment program that had previously been runby United Cerebral Palsy and shifted this program to a defined mental health focus. Shortlythereafter, an interagency task force was established to explore the need for a residentialtreatment program or some type of alternative. Based upon the work of this task force, theCASC expanded its day treatment capacity by opening, in cooperation with the Canton CitySchools, a school-age day treatment program in 1983. Another service element added duringthis time was called the Cities in School Program and involved sending staff into the CantonCity Schools to provide consultation and therapeutic services and to coordinate servicedelivery to students. Assessment, consultation, and therapeutic services also were offeredto the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. Thus, during the early 1980s, a strategicplan for the development of a broad continuum of services for children in Stark County beganto take shape.System development efforts in Stark County were furthered in 1984 by the convening of theStark County Interagency Cluster by a Family Court judge. The organization of the Clusterwas in response to an executive order signed by Governor Richard Celeste which requiredthat each county establish a \"cluster\" of youth-serving agencies to coordinate and developservices for multineed youngsters. All key child-serving agencies became Cluster membersand proceeded to work together to continue to build the county's system of care. Asmandated by the State of Ohio, the Cluster reviewed cases of multineed children whose needswere not being met by the existing service system; a protocol for Cluster referrals wasdeveloped.By 1985, there were 55 children in out-of-county psychiatric residentialplacements as compared with 141 when the CASC was created in 1976. This significantreduction was attributed to the expanded service array available in the community and toenhanced interagency collaboration in serving children and their families.As additional funding sources became available, the system of care v ,s developed further.For example, a grant from the Ohio Department of Mental Health (ODMH) in 1985 allowedthe addition of case managers and therapists to the Day Treatment Program. Theavailability of ODMH funds for children with severe emotional disorders (508K funds) in 1986enabled the community to develop an intensive home-based service program calledTherapeutic In-Home Emergency Services (TIES). Interestingly, most other Ohio countiesinitially used 508K funds to develop residential services and some day treatment.Respondents believe that Stark County may be the only county which developed a home- 54t based service capacity at that time, a move which was consistent with the philosophy ofkeeping youngsters at home and in the community to the greatest possible extent.The Child and Family Advocacy Program, established in 1987, is a multiagency collaborativeprogram to provide and coordinate services for children who have been sexually abused. TheYouth Sex Offender Program, started in 1988 with a grant, is a program jointly funded bythe Mental Health. Board and the Family Court. Additional grant funds received from theODMH in 1989 enabled the community to develop mental health case management andintensive home-based services. With the addition of these services, by 1991 there were only15 youngsters in out-of-county placements, and the utilization of Sagamore Hills Children'sPsychiatric Hospital, the state hospital for children, had dropped substantially as well.The ODMH grant which supported the development of case management and intensive home-based services also supported an activity called \"system of care enhancement.\" This process has proven to be vital to the continued evolution and refinement of the system of care in Stark County.It has centered around a series of retreats, coordinated by an outsidefacilitator, which have served as vehicles for the Cluster to deliberate, reach agreement, plan,and establish priorities on critical issues facing the county's system of care.In effect, the retreats were used to design a blueprint for the development of the system of care. The firstCluster retreat was used to develop both a vision statement and guiding principles for thesystem.Subsequent retreats have focused on issues including coordination of casemanagement, establishing therapeutic foster care, establishing a cluster coordinator position,research and evaluation, and system collaboration. During one retreat, a role play of a case presentation at a Cluster meeting was used to plan how cases should be presented and whatwould be needed to make the interagency case review process work. A retreat held in 1991was devoted to considering approaches to funding services and ultimately resulted in acontract defining each agency's financial commitment to serving children coming before theCluster. In all, five such retreats have been held. All respondents agreed that the retreats,along with the assistance of the outside facilitator, have been instrumental in designing andimplementing the Stark County system of care.In identifying the critical events in the development of the Stark County system of care to date, there was nearly universal agreement that system development was profoundly affected by: 1) the creation of the CASC as a separate children's mental health agency, 2) the decision to invest in day treatment programs rather than residential programs thereby setting theprecedent for continued system development, and 3) the use of an outside facilitator to workwith the Cluster in a series of retreats for system planning and coordination purposes.State Influences of System of Care DevelopmentOhio is characterized as a .:ate with strong local control and responsibility for serviceprovision. Nevertheless, the state government has had a significant influence on system of care development in Stark County and throughout Ohio. One area of clear influence hasbeen the state's leadership in emphasizing and requiring interagency collaboration andcoordination in service delivery, initiated during the administration of Governor RichardCeleste. In March 1984, Governor Celeste signed an executive order requiring interagencycooperation in service delivery to multineed children. This executive order established an Interdepartmental Cluster for Services to Youth at the state level, including the six state departments involved in serving children and adolescents. The order also directed countyagencies to work cooperatively with other agencies in their respective districts, calling for theformation of local clusters to review specific cases of children with severe and multipleproblems, develop individual service plans, and access existing or alternative programs andfunding to meet the needs of these children. The order specified that children and adolescents could be referred to the State Interdepartmental Cluster after all attempts toresolve problems at the local level have failed. It also included a provision specifying thesharing of funds for planned services based upon appropriate agency involvement in eachcase.In 1987, the requirement for state and local clusters to coordinate services for multineedyouth was codified in legislation. There are now active clusters in most Ohio counties. Whileevidence of interagency planning and collaboration in Stark County preceded the executiveorder, this mandate spurred the county into formalizing its interagency efforts. Further, theStark County Cluster has played an indispensable role in conceptualizing and implementingthe system of care. Thus, the state mandates relative to the formation of interagency clustershave had a positive and significant effect in Stark County.State legislation also created the Children's Cluster Fund to support expenses of the StateInterdepartmental Cluster and to allow for direct grants from the State Cluster to localcluster participants.The grants could be used for partial support payments andreimbursement fr-r the maintenance and treatment costs of multineed children who come tothe attention of the State Cluster and also for the development of service delivery programsfor multineed children.While some counties have received these \"system of care grants\" from the State Cluster,Stark County has not been the beneficiary of such funding. In fact, respondents indicatedthat, in contrast to other Ohio counties, system development in Stark County has proceededwith few specialized grants from the state. The beginnings of the county's system of carephilosophy and its interagency planning efforts both predate similar developments at thestate level.Respondents emphasized that the directions for system development in thecounty were established as a result of local initiatives and that the state role has largely beensupportive and facilitative. The state role has been primarily to establish a climate that isconducive to the growth of a system of care in Stark County, to reinforce the directionsadopted by the county, and to provide technical assistance.Another potential state influence on system of care development is the Mental Health Act of1988 passed by the Ohio legislature. This act, which became effective in fiscal year 1990,gives local mental health boards the responsibility for administering both inpatient andoutpatient mental health funds. Boards are authorized to take a specified percentage of theirallocation for inpatient care and utilize it for alternatives to hospitalization. Ideally, thislegislation was intended to create incentives for reduced reliance on hospitals and to increasedevelopment of community services and supports. In reality, however, the rising costs ofhospital care and serving severely disabled persons in the community have made it difficultto realize this goal within available levels of funding. To rectify this situation, an associationof mental health boards in the northeast area of Ohio has recommended the closure ofSagamore Hills Hospital to ODMH. This would ostensibly free resources for the developmentof community-based alternatives. During the site visit, no instances were noted suggesting ways in which the state hashindered system development in Stark County. On the whole, it appears that the state hashad a positive influence on the course of system development in Stark County by encouraginginteragency collaboration and by providing philosophical support and technical assistance. III. PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS As noted, the roots of the philosophy of the Stark County system of care can be traced to thechildren's committee which was instrumental in advocating the formation of a separatechildren's mental health agency. Though the process began nearly 20 years ago, the basicelements of the philosophy have remained constant over time. Four basic elements appearcentral to the philosophy of the Stark County system:oInteragency Collaboration - The system of care is based upon the premise thatchildren and families have problems which relate to multiple systems and that no oneagency alone can be effective in serving them. The child-serving agencies in thecommunity consistently express the conviction that agencies cannot be as effectiveinuividually as they can be together, and that no single agency has either the abilityor resources to meet all the needs of a child and family. This philosophy ofinteragency collaboration has been well-ingrained in Stark County, and interagencyparticipation is evident in planning and service delivery activities. oProviding Services within the Home and Community - A belief in providingservices to youngsters within their homes and within the community has been evidentthroughout the development of the system of care. The choices to develop daytreatment and home-based services as alternatives to residential services were basedupon a strong philosophical commitment to provide services in the least restrictivesetting, to keep youngsters with their families to the greatest extent possible, and tokeep youngsters within the county to the greatest extent possible. oFamily Focus - A third element of Stark County's philosophy is that the child mustbe viewed as a member of a family In this context, a primary role of the system ofcare is to support positive family functioning. The family-centered approach embracedby the system of care was evident both in documents and in discussions with agencyexecutives and staff. Throughout the planning and delivery of services, the systemfocuses on the needs of the entire family and on involving parents as partners. oStrengths Focus - Another recurring theme in both documents and discussion is theneed to focus on the child's and family's strengths rather than on pathology. Thisphilosophy compels the system of care to seek opportunities to build on strengths,even for the most troubled children and families. An interagency service planningprocess, used for difficult cases, centers on the identification of strengths that can beemployed creatively in the development of service and treatment plans.The philosophy and principles governing service delivery have been refined over time. Thefirst Cluster retreat, held in 1989, was devoted to articulating the vision and driving 8 principles for the county's system of care. While some communities may struggle to reachconsensus on their values and principles, this was characterized as a relatively easy task inStark County. Many of the elements of the philosophy had been in place for some time,necessitating refinement rather than reinvention. The retreat resulted in the developmentof a vision statement for the Stark County system:\"We visualize a unified system that energizes all services around each child'sneeds so they can realize their maximum potential. This system providespositive alternatives within the community so that the child will have theopportunity to build on his/her strengths. This system effectively supportspositive family functioning and nurtures children in a socially, emotionally,and educationally sound environment which persists into adult life.\"The driving principles for the system of care developed during the retreat reflect thephilosophical commitment to interagency collaboration, providing services within the homeand community, focusing on families, and focusing on strengths. These principles include:o\"Identify and accept without exception all those who are in need through a proper andappropriate assessment.oChild centered and individualized service with a family focus.oDevelop an aggressive program that wraps services around the child's/family's needsand provides whatever services are needed. (Whatever it takes!)oThe community is part of the solution and not the problem.oEveryone has the right to life, liberty, and happiness.oParents of the youth are involved as partners in the definition of issues as well as thesolutions.oHave the least restrictive, community-based services.oHave community awareness of various systems that provide services to children.oThe focus is on prevention and the child's and family's strengths, rather thanpathology.oEveryone has self-worth, and change can occur.oThe system of care will accept every child no matter what his or her disability witha \"no eject, no reject\" philosophy.\"The goals of Stark County's system of care parallel the elements of its philosophy and includethe following: 9 oTo provide a unified system of service delivery.oTo provide services which enable children to remain within their homes andcommunity to the greatest possible extent. oTo reduce the numbers of children in out-of-home and out-of-county placements. IV. TARGET POPULATION As the Cluster designed a blueprint for a system of care in Stark County, one of the majorissues considered was defining the target population. During the first creative planningretreat, the Cluster generated a set of identifying factors to set parameters for the populationto be served.Two primary elements appear to define the target population from theperspective of the Cluster -- multiple needs and difficulty meeting these needs within existingservices. Thus, the Cluster defines the target population for the system of care as childrenwith multiple needs and their %raffles for whom current or existing services have beeninadequate or unsuccessful. Some of the identifying factors for the target population citedby the Cluster specify youngsters needing multiple systems for support, needing highlyspecialized or intensive services, at high risk for institutionalization, or presenting as\"failures\" within individual agencies. In May 1992, the Cluster adopted a formal definitionfor its target population, specifying the following criteria:oStark County residento0 - 18 years of age (through 21 in many cases)oInvolved in at least three child-serving systems (Juvenile Justice, Child Protection,Health, Mental Health, Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities, Alcohol andDrug, Experiencing Problems in Education)oChild's multiple needs must exist within the child's physical, health, medical,emotional, developmental or intellectual functioning as primary obstacles to the child'soptimum growth and development.The target population is further defined by a planning document prepared by the StarkCounty Community Mental Health Board. Based on discrepancies between the needs ofchildren and adolescents and available resources, the Board proposed priorities for serviceswithin the mental health system as follows:A.Children and adolescents with a mental health diagnosis and adolescents with a mental health diagnosis plus at least three riskfactors (e.g., low income, single parent family, abused, etc.)D.Children and adolescents who request servicesAn additional definitional tool is provided by ODMH which has established criteria forcertifying youngsters as severely emotionally disturbed (508K certification). The criteria forsuch certification specify that youngsters have the following characteristics:oAge birth to 18 yearsoMarked to severe impairment within the past six monthsoImpairment which seriously disrupts academic or developmental progressoImpairment which seriously disrupts family or interpersonal relationshipsoProblems leading to the impairment which have lasted six months or longeroRequires the services of other youth-serving systems, e.g., education, human services,juvenile court, health, MR/DD, and youth servicesThese definitions appear compatible in that they all emphasize serving youngsters who havemultiple needs and are involved with multiple systems, youngsters with serious problems andneeding intensive services, and youngsters in or at risk for out-of-home or out-of-countyplacements of various types.Data were provided to describe youngsters coming before the Cluster as well as youngstersserved by the CASC. A profile of 25 youngsters presented to the Cluster from 1984 to 1989shows that the majority were male (76 percent) ranging in age from 9 to 19, with the modalage categories being 15 and 16. Nearly 80 percent of the youngsters had IQ scores below 84,and 80 percent came from families which were not intact. An overwhelming majority of theyoungsters (88 percent) had previous out-of-home placements, the most frequent of which wasat Sagamore Hills Hospital where one-third of these youngsters had previous episodes ofpsychiatric care. All of the youngsters had previous involvement with multiple agencies; over70 percent were involved with three, four, or five agencies. These data indicate that theCluster does appear to be serving youngsters with multiple needs who are at risk for out-of-home placements and for whom existing services from multiple agencies have provenineffective.CASC data from fiscal year 1991 suggest that the population served by that agency also fallswithin established priority groups. More than 85 percent of the agency's 1991 client population was certified as severely emotionally disturbed based upon the state's 508K 11 I r certification criteria. About 40 percent of the client population had level of functioning scoresof less than 50 on the Global Assessment Scale, indicating serious impairments in allspheres. The client population exhibited risk factors as well; more than 40 percent lived insingle mother households, and nearly 70 percent were eligible for some type of governmententitlement suggesting high levels of poverty. About two-thirds of the youngsters werereferred to the CASC by another agency or system, most frequently by the child welfare orjuvenile justice systems or by the schools. About 15 percent of the population served by theCASC belonged to minority groups, almost exclusively African American. V. ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM System ManagementThe organizing structure for the system of care in Stark County is provided by the Cluster.Within this framework, all agencies participate in system management in accordance witha deliberate decision not to have a lead agency. The Cluster itself was characterized as thelead agency, a collective body assuming responsibility for plgnning and overseeing the systemof care. The decision not to have a designated lead agency appears to be based upon theassumption that the system would be less effective if one agency took the lead, whereas jointmanagement would lead to joint ownership of the system of care. Further, respondentsindicated that with a joint management approach, it is more difficult for individual agenciesto \"cop out\" or shift their responsibility onto another agency. Based upon this approach,responsibility for chairing the Cluster rotates among the participating agencies on a regularbasis, every six months. At the time of the site visit, the Executive Director of the MentalHealth Board was serving as Cluster Chair to be followed by the Administrator of the Familyand Children's Services Unit (the Cluster representative from DHS.)Until recently, Stark County did not received any special funding to support the operationsof the Cluster. The Cluster functioned within the administrative budgets of participatingagencies. For example, Cluster meetings are held in the conference room of the MentalHealth Board, and the Mental Health Board also has provided secretarial support for Clusteractivities. The Cluster considered potential funding opportunities for a cluster coordinatorposition to manage Cluster activities and coordinate activities related to the system of care.A number of options were explored including approaching the County Commissioners toprovide funds for such a position and blending funds from the participating agencies for thispurpose. When the Mental Health Board recruited a Children's Coordinator, this individualnaturally began to assume some of these coordinating functions. Ultimately, the Clusterdecided that the Children's Coordinator from the Mental Health Board would fulfill the roleof cluster coordinator, and, as a result, the need for a separate cluster coordinator positionhas diminished.In December 1991, the Cluster and Mental Health Board officiallyrecognized that the Children's Coordinator was, in fact, serving as cluster coordinator.Subsequently, a grant proposal was submitted to the State Level Cluster, and funds werereceived to support 50 percent of the salary of the Children's Coordinator in recognition ofthe crucial role she fulfills for the local Cluster. 12 11111Role of Participating AgenciesoMental Health: Stark County Community Mental Health Board and Child andAdolescent Service Center (CASC)The Stark County Community Mental Health Board serves as the administrative andfiscal monitoring agent for mental health services in Stark County. The Boardcontracts with various provider agencies in the community for mental health servicesfor children and adults. Unlike mental health boards in many other communities, theStark County Board has had a long-standing commitment to children's services. Thisis evidenced by its decision in 1975 to create a separate children's agency and in itsprovision of support and resources for the development of a service array for children.In 1990, a new position was created at the Board for a Children's Coordinator, furthersolidifying the Board's commitment to building the county's system of care. TheChildren's Coordinator plays a key role in coordinating the activities of the Clusterand planning for the system of care.The major contract agency of the Mental Health Board for children's services is theCASC.The CASC, founded in 1976, currently employs approximately 30professionals, has a budget of over $2.6 million, and is accredited by the Council onAccreditation for Services to Children and Families, Inc. The CASC offers a widerange of mental health services including individual, group, and family counseling;psychological testing; psychiatric evaluation and medication services; day treatment;case management; management groups; consultation, education, and preventionservices; intensive home-based services; and services for victims of child sexual abuseP.3 well as for youthful sex offenders. From its inception, the CASC has reached outto other child-serving agencies, involving them on its board and other advisorystructures. Thus, other community agencies have played active roles in establishinglirections for the CASC's continued development. A perennial problem for the CASChas been a high demand for its services as compared with its service capacity. Theresult has been a wait list for most programs and an ongoing tension between thedesire to serve more people versus the desire to provide highly intensive and effectiveservices to those judged most in need. As the primary service provider agency forchildren's mental health in the county, the CASC also is represented on the Cluster.oChild Welfare: Stark County Department of Human Services (DHS)The Social Services Division of the Stark County DHS provides a variety of childwelfare services. Intake units provide protective services for children by investigatingreports of alleged child abuse and neglect, with over 3600 referrals investigated in1990.In cases of alleged sexual abuse and abuse cases with potential criminalinvolvement, teams of sheriffs and social workers are assigned to conductinvestigations jointly. Family service units provide protective services on an ongoingbasis to families requiring continued supervision and intervention in order to insurethe well-being of children and to maintain the family unit.In addition to protective services, a range of child placement services are offered byDHS. Foster care services include recruiting, licensing, and training foster families 13 and providing supervision and case management for youngsters in foster care. Agroup home system with two homes for boys and two homes for girls is operated in thecounty, with approximately 30 children in group home care at any given time. Mostchildren in the group homes have some degree of emotional or behavioral problem.DHS contracts for residential treatment for youngsters needing specialized treatmentfor emotional disorders. An adoption unit provides services to children who are legally free for adoption. Other services provided by DHS include a shelter system, parentaide services, single parent services, and day care services.In 1990, a children's services levy was passed in Stark County. The levy will createa stable base of funding for the delivery of children's services for a five-year period.Respondents indicated that the passage of the levy demonstrated the commitment andconcern of the general public about the needs of children and families in thecommunity.oEducation: stark County Board of Education and 17 School Districts with Boards ofEducation including Canton City SchoolsStark County contains 17 autonomous school districts, each with its own board ofeducation and superintendent. County-wide, over 12,000 children are identified as needing special education services. Most of the local school districts provide specialeducation services for high incidence problems. For low incidence disabilities, servicesare provided by the Stark County Board of Education. Among the county-operatedspecial education units are classrooms for youngsters with severe behavioralhandicaps. The County Board of Education contracts with the CASC to provide a psychologist to consult with teachers and provide group counseling for youngsters inspecial education classes. The Stark County Board of Education also provides schoolpsychologists and other specialized services that the smaller districts cannot affordindividually. The County Board of Education is represented on the Cluster.The largest of the local school districts is the Canton City Schools. The Departmentof Special Education offers a comprehensive range of special education and relatedservices and supports for all handicapping conditions, including a severe behaviorhandicapped program. The Canton City school system participates actively in theCluster process and the system of care. For example, the Day Treatment Program,which is accessible to all children in Stark County, is a collaborative program between the Canton City Schools, the CASC, and DHS. In addition, the Director of SpecialEducation attends Cluster meetings and has taken responsibility for sharinginformation with the other school districts through regularly held roundtables forspecial education directors.Representatives of other school districts typically participate in the Cluster process on an individual case basis, but are less activelyinvolved in system planning and coordination activities.Several activities have been undertaken to improve both regular and special educationin the community. One of these involved forming a task force with multiagencyrepresentation to identify the problems involved in serving children with emotionalproblems and to develop recommendations. One result of this Severe BehavioralHandicapped Task Force was a proposal to develop a collaborative program between14u the schools, court, and mental health agencies to serve youngsters with conductdisorders for which funding is still being sought. Another activity was sponsored bya foundation in Stark County, the Education Enhancement Partnership, whichallocated $3 million in 1990 to improve education in the county. The funds are beingused in a public/private partnership to assess needed improvements in the county'seducational system and to develop plans. The planning process has emphasized theneed to look beyond the six-hour school day and work toward strengthening familiesas well as the need for early identification and intervention for special needs. oJuvenile Justice: Stark County Family Court and Regional Office of Ohio Departmentof Youth ServicesThe Stark County Family Court consists of the Juvenile Court and Domestic RelationsCourt and has three judges. The Family Court presents its mission as \"protection andwelfare of the community by providing a network of services and innovative programsfor families and youth through cooperation with community agencies in an effort tomake juveniles and families more responsible and accountable.\" To fulfill this mission, the court offers a range of services which are directed at prevention,diversion, and alternatives to institutionalization. These include intensive probationservices provided by a probation officer who is skilled in parent effectiveness training;courses in parent effectiveness; in-home detention involving short-term, intensivesupport and monitoring for offenders as an alternative to incarceration; restitutionprograms providing supervised work for youth which allows them to compensatevictims; and job skills training programs for youth at risk. Services for sex offendersare a priority for the court since there has been a substantial increase in the numberof youths involved in sex offenses in recent years. Services include those of a probation officer trained in working with sex offenders as well as diagnosis andtreatment offered in conjunction with the CASC. Additionally, prevention programsthat stress responsibility and law are provided in the schools for youngsters in third,fourth, and fifth grades. The juvenile justice system in Stark County also includesresidential options both provided and purchased by the Family Court.The Multi-County Juvenile Attention Center, which is located in Stark County, servesas the detention facility for a five-county area. A council of governments was formedby the counties to administer the facility. The regional office of the Ohio Departmentof Youth Services provides funding for many of the Family Court programs as well asmonitoring local service delivery. The Department of Youth Services also assumescustody of youthful offenders upon commitment by the Juvenile Court for felony leveloffenses, thereby transferring responsibility from the county to the state agency. oHealth: Stark County Health Department, Canton City Health Department, MassillonHealth Department, and Alliance Health DepartmentThe health departments in Stark County provide a variety of services available tochildren and families.Public health nurses conduct physical assessments whichinclude evaluation of growth and development for infants and children through age18. Childhood immunizations are provided as well as testing for various communicablediseases such as tuberculosis. Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases is another important function of these agencies, along with follow-up onsexual contacts and education regarding the prevention of sexually transmitteddiseases. Increasingly utilized services are testing and counseling for HIV infectionand education regarding the transmission and prevention of AIDS. The healthdepartments fulfill a variety of health education functions by providing informationand educational programs in many settings including schools. oMental Retardation: Stark County Board of Mental Retardation and DevelopmentalDisabilities (MR/DD)The Stark County Board of MR/DD was formed in 1968 and provides a \"lifetime ofservices\" to people of all ages with mental retardation and developmental disabilities.The MR/DD Board operates seven facilities and provides a range of programs including Early Childhood Intervention, Schools, Adult Services, Family Resources,Case Management, and Social Services.In 1991, the MR/DD Board adopted a new population definition as required by thestate. The new definition expanded the population to be served by the agency byraising the age limit for services from 18 to 21 and by emphasizing substantialfunctional limitations in determining eligibility. The new definition was presented and discussed at the Cluster meeting. oSubstance Abuse: Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board of Stark CountyIn 1990, Governor Celeste created a new Department of Alcohol and Drug AddictionServices at the state level. Counties were given the option of having a separate board to plan and oversee substance abus ; services or of consolidating this function undertheir mental health boards. In the majority of Ohio counties, the substance abusefunction is combined with mental heflth under the authority of a single board. Stark County, however, is one of eight counties that elected to have a separate board for substance abuse services.The Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board of Stark County was formed in 1990with the mission to plan, fund, and evaluate alcohol and drug addiction services in thecounty. As part of its planning responsibilities, a needs assessment was conductedand a five-year plan for substance abuse services was developed. The Alcohol andDrug Addiction Services Board provides funds to Quest Recovery Services, which isthe major substance abuse provider agency serving children and adolescents.In addition to these major child-serving systems, a number of other agencies participate inthe system by providing services to youth and families and through their involvement in theCluster. These agencies include: oLincoln Way Special Education Regional Resource Training PartnershipoOhio Rehabilitation ServicesoStark County ProsecutoroEarly Childhood Collaborative 161CJ As in most communities, some agencies within the system assume an especially active rolein the organization and operation of the system of care. Other agencies are less activeparticipants and assume a more peripheral role in system activities. Thus, although thereare continual efforts to enhance the involvement of all agencies, Stark County has a coregroup of agencies which are central to system management and service delivery. VI. SYSTEM OF CARE COMPONENTS Outpatient ServicesThe CASC provides a range of outpatient assessment and treatment services; these areconsidered to be the least intensive treatment option. Outpatient services are offered throughoffices of the CASC in Canton, Massillon, and Alliance as well as at an alternative schoollocation established for enhanced accessibility to minority families. During fiscal year 1991,outpatient services were provided to more than 700 children and their families. According todata derived from the Global Assessment Scale, approximately 80 percent of the youngstersreceiving outpatient services from CASC are considered to have severe emotionaldisturbances.Outpatient services typically begin with a multifactored assessment which is conceptualizedin two phases: the intake assessment and the clinical assessment. The intake assessmentinvolves gathering basic data in order to determine the reason for admission, presence of life threatening situations, need for a physical examination, preliminary treatment goals, and an indication of what services might be needed. A clinical assessment is completed by theassigned therapist and covers history, current functioning, and strengths and weaknesses ina variety of domains. The assessments conducted by CASC may require multiple sessionsand emphasize family and ecological factors. When necessary, psychological and psychiatricevaluations are used to aid in the diagnostic process. Psychological evaluations are used extensively for youth sex offenders referred by the Juvenile Court to assist it in judicial orplacement decisions. The assessment process generally culminates in a treatment plan thatis developed collaboratively with the parents and youngster as appropriate.Individual and family therapy also are offered by the CASC. These services typically consistof office-based counseling appointments which take place once or twice a week dependingupon the need. The CASC is working towards increasingly providing its outpatient servicesin natural environments such as the home, school, or community centers. In fact, a goal for1992 is for 50 percent of all outpatient services to be delivered in such natural settings ratherthan in CASC offices. Specialized outpatient services are available for youngsters who are dually diagnosed as mentally retarded /developmentally disabled and emotionally or behaviorally disordered. These services involve counseling to children and families as wellas classroom consultation. In addition, a variety of groups are offered. For youngsters, groupcounseling opportunities include social skills groups, sexual abuse groups, and groups onhuman sexuality. For parents, child management, communication, and assertiveness trainingworkshops are offered as well as groups for parents of preschoolers, parents of teens, teenmothers, single parents, and parents of youngsters with attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. Outpatient psychiatric services also are offered by the CASC. A child psychiatrist works atthe CASC for a total of two and a half days per week, offering diagnostic assessment andconsultation. Psychiatric referrals are made for psychiatric evaluation and for prescriptionand monitoring of medications. In addition, the psychiatrist provides consultation to otherCASC programs. Recruitment of child psychiatrists has proven difficult for the CASC, andthe wait for a psychiatric appointment may be as long as six to eight weeks. The Cluster isactively recruiting a full-time child psychiatrist to work both at the CASC and the CrisisCenter.While many of the youngsters involved in outpatient services improve, staff acknowledge thatmany have serious problems and would benefit from more intensive service options.However, the more intensive service options are difficult to obtain due to wait lists. Waitlists are a problem for outpatient services as well; there may be a delay of as much as sevenor eight weeks to get an outpatient appointment. In order to serve those most in need, theCASC attempts to prioritize cases based upon seriousness, providing services to youngstersat risk for harm to themselves or others or those returning from out-of-home placements asa first priority. Additionally, limits on length of stay in treatment have been considered asa way to extend services to more youngsters.Prevention and Early InterventionAn assortment of programs and services included in the system of care fall into the generalcategory of prevention and early intervention. For example, the CASC operates the PeerListening Program which involves training and supervising adolescents age 15 to 17 to serveas peer listeners. The trained teens offer confidential active listening, support, information,and referral to other adolescents to help them to resolve or explore solutions to theirproblems. The CASC provides training to groups of 20 to 25 adolescents at a time andfocuses on developing communication and helping skills.Another program is entitled \"Friends Can Keep You Healthy\" and is a collaborative effortbetween the CASC and tb a Canton City Schools. The program involves biweekly supportmeetings for a small group of elementary school youngsters in several inner city schools. Theyoungsters considered for inclusion in this program exhibit mild behavioral or socializationproblems. It is anticipated that the support meetings will promote more positive feelingsamong the youngsters toward themselves and others and will reduce the likelihood of moreserious problems.An \"At-Risk Dropout Prevention Grant\" received by the Canton City Schools also targetshigh-risk elementary schools in an effort to minimize future mental health and educationalproblems. The grant funds therapeutic services in the schools on an individual and groupbasis for students as well as groups for parents. Behavior adjustment classes are a part ofthis project and involve developing a behavioral plan for a particular child with parentinvolvement. These behavioral plans are then implemented with the assistance of behavioraladjustment coaches. Additionally, a school pride incentive program provides tangible rewardsand incentives for youngsters who follow the rules.Early intervention activities in Stark County are coordinated by the Early InterventionCollaborative, a multiagency group which coordinates early intervention services for 18 youngsters from birth to two years. The Collaborative attempts to identify children at-riskfor all types of problems at an early age through a centralized resource called the KidsConnection. In addition to early identification, the Collaborative provides developmentalinformation to parents, referrals for services, and parenting classes.Early intervention activities for children age three to five are coordinated by the local schooldistricts. The Canton City Schools operate preschool programs for at-risk children, includingthose at risk for emotional disorders, and the CASC provides the mental health componentof the community's Head Start Program. The Stark County Board of MR/DD Board alsoserves a population of children age birth to five who are at risk. For infants and toddlers,a teacher-based service is offered along with individualized occupational therapy, physicaltherapy, and speech and language therapy as needed. For preschool-age youngsters, anintegrated preschool is provided along with several other preschool and day care options forat-risk children.A unique Preschool Community Services Program is provided to children from birth to fiveyears of age, with a major focus on children with emotional disturbances. The program offershome-based services and consultation in normal preschool settings and provides both clinicaland case management services. Until July 1991, these youngsters were served within thePreschool Day Treatment Program which utilized a combined center-based and home-basedapproach. At this time, the new approach of the Preschool Community Services Program wasadopted, and staff was redeployed to attempt to work with these young children in morenatural environments including their homes and regular preschools. Following the first fullyear of operation, the approach is being assessed to determine the continued feasibility of\"mainstreaming\" these preschoolers. A more specialized setting may need to be reconsideredfor some children who present particularly challenging problems and behaviors.Home-Based ServicesThe Stark County system of care includes both short-term and longer-term home-basedservices. The short-term program, Therapeutic In-Home Emergency Services (TIES), wasinitiated in 1986 as a joint program between the CASC and the Crisis Intervention Centerof Stark County. As a result of administrative complications, the program is now operatedsolely by the Crisis Center, but it remains closely coordinated with the CASC and with othercomponents of the system of care.TIES is a crisis-oriented program which serves youngsters with serious emotional orbehavioral problems who are at imminent risk for out-of-home placement. In order to beeligible for TIES services, the parents must have the desire to keep the family together andbe willing to participate in the home-based intervention. The goal of the TIES program isto prevent out-of-home placement by working toward solving problems within the home andfamily. Like most home-based programs, TIES therapists are available 24 hours a day, sevendays a week; the intervention takes place primarily in the home; and visits are scheduled atthe family's convenience. Therapists work with only two families at a time, allowing forhighly intensive and flexible services for each family. Therapists typically spend an averageof six to 10 hours per week with a family; service intensity may reach as high as 20 hoursper week with a family depending upon the need. Services are based on an individualizedtreatment plan for the child and family and include crisis intervention, individual and family 19 ! therapy, case management, and a range of support services tailored to each family's needs.The program was started with a service duration of six to eight weeks, but found that thiswas not sufficient time to respond to a crisis and adequately link the family with ongoingservices. As a result, the time frame was expanded to 12 weeks. If families experiencefurther difficulties at some point following completion of a TIES intervention, they may callto request additional services. Program staff visit may the families to provide \"booster shots\"and continue to remain available by phone for continued support.The longer-term home-based service program is called Intensive Home-Based Services andis operated by the CASC. The priority target group for this program is comprised ofyoungsters who are or have been in out-of-home placements for treatment purposes and arenot likely to reunify successfully with their families without assistance. Accordingly, theprogram emphasizes serving children who are returning home from long-term psychiatriccare or other residential placements. The Intensive Home-Based Services program is staffedby master's level therapists, each of whom works with a caseload of approximately fourfamilies. Caseloads may exceed four if a family is transitioning out of the program and needsa relatively low level of services; caseloads may be reduced if a therapist is working with afamily requiring highly intensive intervention. In some cases, two therapists may beassigned to a particular family for either therapeutic or safety reasons such as the potentialfor violence or abuse. Therapists are available 24 hours a day and work with families for anaverage of one year, although the duration of services is flexible depending upon the family'sneeds.The program is designed to stabilize, maintain, and strengthen families and to assist themto function to their maximum potential within the community. It is described as a \"clinicalmodel\" which involves an assessment of each family's strengths, weaknesses, and serviceneeds; a treatment plan unique to the identified and prioritized needs of each family; theprovision of therapeutic services in a natural and nonthreatening setting that focus onfunctioning within the family system; and linkages to community resources. In addition toindividual and family therapy, therapists perform \"case management\" functions includinghelping families to meet basic needs, accessing needed services and resources, and helpingfamilies in concrete ways -- in short, doing whatever needs to be done to assist the family.When a family is stabilized, concrete needs are met, and there is a low risk of out-of-homeplacement, transition plans are then developed to link the family with other ongoing services.At minimum, case managers follow families when home-based services are discontinued.Families experiencing further difficulties following termination may be referred for additionalhome-based services. The program reassesses these families and attempts to meet theirneeds either by consulting with the staff currently involved with them (e.g., outpatienttherapist or case manager) or by short-term reentry into the program with dearly specifiedgoals.To date, no child served by the program has been returned to long-term psychiatricor residential care.At the time of the site visit, there were 20 families on a waiting list for the Intensive Home-Based Services program; 10 families currently are waiting for these services. Staff usecreative approaches for coping with the high level of demand for services such as consultingwith other staff who are working with the family at the time of referral or even doing homevisits with outpatient therapists to assist them in working more effectively with particularfamilies.20411 Day TreatmentThe Day Treatment Program in Stark County serves youngsters ranging in age from five to17.The program is designed to serve children who are experiencing severe emotional,behavioral, and/or social problems to the degree that they cannot be adequately treated withless restrictive therapeutic or educational services. The program is a collaborative effortbetween the education and mental health systems (the CASC, the Canton City Schools, andthe DHS) and is described as psychoeducational. Its educational philosophy and structureis based on the Positive Education Program (PEP), which draws upon the philosophy ofNicholas Hobbs and emphasizes positive achievements as opposed to negative behaviors. Alevel system is used in each classroom and is adjusted to the maturity, cognitive ability, andsocial awareness of the students. Multidisciplinary treatment teams provide services toyoungsters in day treatment, and a wide variety of specialized services are arranged to meetthe needs of individual youngsters. Family involvement and participation is considered anessential element of the program. A summer program is offered for eight weeks for all agegroups, and the average length of stay in Day Treatment is approximately 18 months.The School-Age Day Treatment Program consists of four classrooms which serve a maximumof 28 youngsters from kindergarten through high school. Many of the youngsters have beenhospitalized at Sagamore Hills or are being diverted from such a placement; more than 70percent of the youngsters in Day Treatment have been in a hospital or residential treatmentcenter at some time. The vast majority have had multiple school placements, and many areinvolved with the juvenile justice system. Thus, the Day Treatment Program serves a groupof youngsters with extremely serious problems, comparable to the population once served bythe state hospital and other psychiatric treatment settings.In order to be eligible for the program, a youngster must be age five to 17; exhibit severebehavioral, emotional, and/or social disorders; be eligible for enrollment in a Severe BehaviorHandicapped Unit as defined by Ohio Department of Education criteria; and be unable tofunction in a public school setting among other criteria. A structured level system is usedin each classroom emphasizing positive reinforcement, and a multidisciplinary team providesa range of services and support to the youngsters and their families. Mental health servicesinclude individual, group, and family therapy. A parent group assists parents by providinginformation on management techniques and an opportunity for mutual sharing and support.In addition to the mental health and educational services which form the core of the program,the youngsters receive extensive case management services, social skills groups, recreationalservices, speech and language programming, and other related services. A psychiatrist workswith the program for approximately six to eight hours each week providing consultation tostaff, observing in classrooms, and seeing individual youngsters. Approximately one-thirdof the children in the program are on some type of medication.While the average length of stay is 18 months, the program is flexible and willing to makedecisions based upon the needs of each individual youngster. An attempt is made to moveyoungsters into more normalized educational and treatment settings if possible. However,if it is clear that an extended stay in the Day Treatment Program is best for a child, theprogram will allow the youngster to stay. Transitions back to regular public schools arehandled gradually, beginning with a visit and tour. Reintegration may begin with attendanceat the school one day per week, with gradual increases over time. Case management and21 outpatient mental health services are continued both during and following the transition outof Day Treatment.The longest wait'ng list for the Day Treatment Program is for older adolescents, the agegroup which is 'dso considered the most difficult to serve. The program is attempting toprovide additional vocational programming and independent living skills training to betterserve this age group.At the time of the site visit, day treatment services included a Preschool Day Treatmentprogram accommodating a maximum of 24 children age two and a half to six years. Theprogram served all of Stark County, with transportation provided by Goodwill- and itoperated five days a week, six hours per day. The admission criteria for the programspecified that preschoolers exhibit severe behavioral, emotional, or social problems; that theydid not benefit from previous services in outpatient mental health or other communitysettings; and that they have had a complete medical screening. The program utilized ahighly structured level system coupled with school readiness activities, socialization groups,and individual therapy when appropriate. Parents were closely involved in all aspects of theprogram. In addition to home visits by staff, parents come into the program to observe theirchildren, spend time with therapists, attend family therapy session, and accompanyyoungsters on field trips.A unique aspect of the Preschool Day Treatment Program was the development of a combinedcenter-based and home-based approach for the majority of youngsters. One group ofpreschoolers attended the five-day school program. Two additional groups were involved inan intensive preschool home-based program. This approach was developed in recognition ofthe difficulty in translating gains in the treatment setting to the home environment. It wasdecided to reduce the amount of time children spent in the center to two days per week andto provide a therapist, called an \"early childhood interventionist,\" to visit families at homeonce or twice weekly for one to two hours depending upon the family's needs. Theinterventionist worked with families on child development, behavior management, nutrition,homemaking skills, and obtaining needed services and supports. The success of thiscombined center and home-based approach led to the decision to transform the Preschool DayTreatment Program into the Preschool Community Services Program. Staff were redeployedto work with these youngsters in more natural settings including their homes and regularpreschools.The interventionists provide clinical and case management services to thechildren and their families as well as consultation to the preschools that the children nowattend. The new approach, adopted in July 1991, currently is being evaluated with particularattention to the feasibility of mainstreaming these preschoolers with emotional andbehavioral disorders.Consideration may need to be given to reestablishing a morespecialized setting for some youngsters who present particularly difficult challenges.Crisis ServicesMental health crisis services in Stark County are provided by the Crisis Intervention Centerof Stark County, a free-standing, nonprofit agency. The Crisis Center is funded primarily bythe Mental Health Board and serves as a county-wide emergency services system. Theagency characterizes its purposes as providing crisis intervention in the community,decreasing the need for hospitalization, and assuring appropriate use of community resources.22 The Crisis Intervention Center is accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditationof Health Organizations (JCAHO).The Crisis Center was started in 1970 as a crisis telephone hotline staffed by volunteers.Although volunteers are still utilized for the hotline, the Center now relies on staff who arespecialized and highly skilled in handling crises. The agency recruits staff who are well suited for crisis work and boasts an average staff tenure of about 7.5 years, a noteworthyaccomplishment in the area of crisis services where burnout is prevalent.The Crisis Center offers a range of crisis services. Telephone crisis services are offeredthrough a 24-hour hotline answered by staff with the assistance of volunteers. Volunteersreceive 48 hours of classroom training as well as close supervision to prep*Ire them for thisrole. Through the hotline, the Crisis Center provides after-hours phone coverage for allcontract agencies of the Mental Health Board and for other agencies as well. The CASC, thethree adult mental health centers, and the substance abuse treatment agency in the countyall rely upon the Crisis Center for after-hours telephone coverage. The DHS childabuse/neglect report line and Parents Anonymous are among the other agencies and groupsutilizing the Crisis Center's telephone crisis services. The Crisis Center has estimated thatapproximately 20 percent of its calls are related to children.Face-to-face crisis services also are provided, primarily on an outreach basis. The philosophyof the agency involves going out to where the crisis is occurring in order to intervene mosteffectively. The Crisis Center estimates that more than half of its outreach services involvechildren and adolescents and their families. Individual staff members perform outreach services 24 hours a day; a team which includes a psychiatrist may respond whenhospitalization is a potential disposition. Walk-in crisis services also are available at the Center, along with a number of groups such as a treatment group for men involved indomestic violence, a group for persons who have lost someone through suicide, and a support group for people with HIV or AIDS and significant others.In cases involving children, the Crisis Center works closely and cooperatively with the CASC.Home-based therapists and case managers are available 24 hours a day and can be contacted if crises involve their clients. In other cases, particularly in serious clinical emergencies, theCrisis Center's staff handle the crises directly. Where there is a question of psychiatrichospitalization, the Crisis Center contacts CASC staff members who are responsible for thescreening, assessment, and procedural arrangements. In order to ensure continuity ofservices, the Crisis Center prepares a list of clients with whom they have had contact for eachof the participating agencies. This list is faxed daily to each agency including the CASC. Ifthe client has a case manager, the crisis worker calls the case manager to provideinformation about the crisis contact.Anther type of crisis service is observation beds at the Crisis Center which provide an opportunity for brief respite, further observation, and stabilization. At the time of the sitevisit, only two such beds were available for both adults and children, and there was universalagreement that two beds for the entire county was insufficient to meet the need. In fact,respondents agreed that a missing component in the system of care is some type of short-term, crisis residential option for children. In response to this need, the Mental Health Boardand Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board are providing funds for an expanded capacity23 1f, for crisis residential services. The third floor of the Crisis Center is undergoing renovationto serve as a short-term residential crisis option with 12 beds. A separate section with fourbeds has been designated to provide short-term crisis placements for children andadolescents. The new crisis residential services should be operational by August 1992.Child and Family Advocacy ProgramIn response to the growing problem of child sexual abuse in the community, a workingcoalition of agencies formed in 1986. The coalition included DHS, the Juvenile Court, theMental Health Board, the CASC, the Crisis Center, Junior League, law enforcement agencies,and others and resulted in a plan for a program to provide assessment and therapeuticservices related to sexual abuse. A grant application was prepared by the Crisis Center, andfunding was received from the Victims of Crime Act to initiate the program; the CASCreceived additional monies to supplement the program. Thus, the Child and Family AdvocacyProgram was started in 1987 as a joint program of the Crisis Center and CASC.Due to complex administrative problems, the funding was ultimately combined and theprogram unified under the administrative auspices of the CASC. Currently, the Child andFamily Advocacy Program conducts assessments of sexual abuse situations includingpsychological evaluation of the child, assessment of the ability of a child to testify, veracityof allegations, potential effects of a court hearing on the child, and child placement issues.Staff provide therapeutic services including individual and family therapy for as long asnecessary. Group treatment also is offered including a teen support group and a mothersgroup. Services provided by the program are limited to nonoffending family members withoffenders referred to other treatment resources. In addition, the program advocates for thechild with other agencies, including attending regular meetings with the prosecutor handlingthe child's case to assist in decision making at each stage. The program also has aneducational function, conducting seminars and preparing brochures and other materials toassist teachers and other agencies to identify and respr,nd appropriately to situations whichmay involve sexual abuse.Substance Abuse ServicesThe primary provider of substance abuse services to children and adolescents in Stark Countyis Quest Recovery Services. Quest's major service is its Intensive Adolescent OutpatientTreatment Program, which consists of daily programming from Monday through Friday from4:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M. for a period of more than four weeks. This program providesindividual counseling, family and group therapy, personal growth/self- awareness activities,refusal skills, lectures and speakers, videos, group discussions, and access to medical services.Following this initial intensive program, a 12-week continuing care program is providedwhich offers emotional support to adolescents and their families and encourages continuingpersonal growth. A complete assessment, including a physical examination, is required priorto admission to the program. In addition to the Quest's services, a number of area hospitalsoffer substance abuse treatment on an inpatient basis. 24 Youth Sex Offenders ProgramThe Youth Sex Offenders Program is a joint program of the Stark County Family Court andthe CASC. The program focuses on adolescents who are already adjudicated adolescent sexoffenders or youngsters with problems severe enough to place them at high risk for thisoutcome. The services begin with a diagnostic assessment, a major component of which isa community risk assessment used to determine the safety of working with the youngster inthe community.If the risk is deemed too high, a. secure treatment setting is sought.Unfortunately, there is no secure treatment program for sexual offenders within StarkCounty.For those adolescents who can remain in the community, the program provides counselingand psychotherapy on an individual and group basis. A group for youth sex offenders is co-lead by a mental health therapist from the CASC and a probation officer, both of whom havereceived highly specialized training in this area. The program is seen as an alternative tomore costly and restrictive institutional placements and serves approximately 25 children peryear. As of fiscal year 1992, none of the youngsters have committed additional offenses whileinvolved in the program.Respite ServicesThe major provider of respite services is the Tri-County Easter Seals Society. Easter Sealsoffers in-home respite utilizing trained adults as providers, out -of -home respite in theprovider's home, and emergency respite. The trained respite providers provide families witha much needed break from the physical and emotional demands of caregiving. In the past,Easter Seals respite services were available only to individuals with mental retardation or developmental disabilities.Respite services have been expanded to serve families ofyoungsters with serious emotional disorders and adults with severe mental disabilities. Forchildren, arrangements for respite services are handled on an individual case basis and typically are purchased by the Cluster or the CASC. Respite providers with Easter Sealsreceive over 40 hours of specialized training related to the needs of developmentally disabledand/or mentally disabled populations. Easter Seals is working with the CASC to develop a training package for respite workers that is specifically geared toward working more effectively with children who have emotional disturbances.In addition, a list of independent on-call support persons has been prepared by the CASC.These persons can be contacted as needed to provide respite or other types of support tochildren and families. A goal is to computerize this list of on-call support persons and make it available to all Cluster participants. In addition, a training program for these support persons is being developed.Residential ServicesYoungsters requiring treatment in residential settings have access to a number of placementoptions. Ohio Mentor provides some therapeutic foster care services in the county, but thesehave primarily been targeted for children with mental retardation. The Stark County DHSoperates a system of group homes which serve youngsters with emotional or behavioraldisorders. Residential treatment options used by the Stark County system of care are all25 located outside of the county and include such facilities as Berea Children's Home, Marycrest,Parmadale Family Services, and Beechbrook, all located in Cleveland, and Smithville BoysVillage in Wooster. When a Stark County youngster is in any of these facilities, a liaisonfrom the county is assigned to work with the child and the therapist to ensure that highquality services are being provided. An attempt is made to visit each child in out-of-countyplacement at least once per month.Inpatient psychiatric services are provided by Timken Mercy Hospital which is located inStark County and has a specialized adolescent psychiatric unit. Aultman Hospital, alsolocated within the county, does not have a separate children's unit but does on occasion admitadolescents over age 16 to its psychiatric unit. A psychiatric unit for children andadolescents also is available at Akron Children's Hospital Medical Center, approximately 30miles away in neighboring Summit County. Sagamore Hills, located in Cleveland, is thestate psychiatric hospital for children. The hospital serves adolescents ages 12 to 18 who areharmful to themselves or others. The hospital has been significantly downsized, however,and the state plans to transform it into community-based programs. Residential andpsychiatric hospitalization are paid for with Cluster funds unless there are other sources offunding, such as Medicaid or insurance, which are drawn upon first.System Needs and GapsStark. County has systematically built the service array included in its system of care. Inparticular, the community has attempted to increase the array of intensive, nonresidentialservices such as home-based services and day treatment. The expressed purpose of creatingintensive, nonresidential service options has been to reduce the need for out-of-home and out-of-county placements. Despite noteworthy progress in building the array of services includedin the system, service gaps remain. There appears to be widespread agreement that threeservices in particular are critically needed.The first of these services is therapeutic foster care. At the time of the site visit, sometherapeutic foster care services were purchased, primarily by DHS, from several privateagencies. Many of these treatment homes were not within Stark County, and there was agreat deal of skepticism about the quality and intensity of the treatment services theyprovided. As a result, therapeutic foster care was not utilized to the extent possible as a lessrestrictive residential treatment resource for the Stark County system of care. At the timeof the site visit, the participating agencies were considering how the capacity to providetherapeutic foster care should be developed in Stark County and which agency should takethe lead role. Options under consideration included continuing to purchase therapeutic fostercare, but expanding such resources within the county and enhancing the quality of services,or selecting one or more agencies, such as DHS or the CASC, to develop therapeutic fostercare services for Stark County. Ultimately, the Cluster made the decision to approach aprivate provider of other residential services (groups homes and regular foster care) with thepossibility of developing therapeutic foster care services for youngsters served by the Cluster.The provider, Pathway, responded favorably and worked with the Cluster to develop plansfor therapeutic foster care services. Together, the Cluster and Pathway approached the Starkand Deuble Foundations for financial support and received $50,000 in grants for programdevelopment. A coordinator for the program has been hired, and recruitment and trainingof treatment parents is planned for the summer of 1992. The Cluster plans on purchasing26 therapeutic foster care services from Pathway on an individual case basis; access to thetherapeutic foster care beds will be restricted to the Cluster process.Respondents indicated that a second priority need for the county was for a crisis residentialresource for children. As noted, the Crisis Center had two crisis beds on its premises whichallowed for overnight support and observation. However, these beds were shared with theadult service system and were much in demand. In many crisis situations involving childrenand adolescents, therefore, there was no resource for a short-term residential placement forcrisis intervention and stabilization. The lack of such a resource resulted in the use ofhospitals and other settings, such as the Attention Center or DHS shelter, for crisisstabilization purposes. There was considerable agreement that the addition of a short-termcrisis residential program of some sort would provide a more appropriate and effectiveresource for youngsters.Similar to the progress achieved in addressing the need for therapeutic foster care, the community has made progress in filling this gap as well. A new crisis residential programoperated by the Crisis Center is slated to open in August 1992, and four beds in a separate area have been reserved for children and adolescents who require a short-term placement forcrisis intervention and stabilization purposes. In addition, the CASC has identified a cadreof on-call support persons who can be enlisted to provide support during a crisis in youngsters' homes or in other settings. Further, two providers (Mentor and Easter Seals)now have the capacity to provide short-term crisis respite services in therapeutic foster homesfor up to 90 days. Finally, the Cluster has decided to lease a two-bedroom apartment for use in crisis situations. The apartment will be staffed as needed with on-call support persons, and the CASC will provide professional staff to work with the children and their families.A third need mentioned by many respondents is services for sex offenders. The Stark Countysystem of care has been struggling to determine the types of services that would be bothsecure and effective in treating this growing population. The dual mission of such serviceswould be to protect the community while at the same time attempting to rehabilitate theyouthful offender. The system of care does include an outpatient program to work with sexoffenders, but this does not meet the needs of those youngsters who present some risk to the community and who require a more secure treatment environment. In response to this need,the Cluster organized a work group on sex offenders. The work group planned to consult with experts in the area of youthful sex offenders for assistance in conceptualizing anddesigning appropriate services for these youngsters.In addition to these priority system needs, respondents noted a number of other service gaps. These include:oExpanded capacity in all service components (e.g., outpatient services, home-basedservices, day treatment, and case management) to more adequately meet the needs.oTransition services for older adolescents including vocational services and independentliving services.oAdditional services in outlying areas. 27 1 I.\"14,-A. VII. SYSTEM LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS Context for Interagency CollaborationAs might be expected, the system of care in Stark County evolved from a history ofinteragency collaboration around the needs of children. More than 15 years prior to theexecutive order requiring clusters, the executives of the child-serving agencies in the countybegan meeting as a group. While these early efforts to coordinate services were not nearlyas extensive or systematic as they are today, the groundwork for collaborative efforts was inplace well before the state mandates. In addition to the attempts of the agency executivesto work together and support one another, there are several examples of interagencyendeavors related to services for children and adolescents. Included among these are thefollowing:oChild and Family Advocacy Advisory Committee - At the urging of the countyprosecutor, a multiagency coalition was formed in 1986 to improve both services andinteragency coordination for victims of sexual abuse. A major result of theinteragency effort was the development of the Child and Family Advocacy Centerwhich provides a range of therapeutic and support services to children who have beensexually abused. The coalition has continued to exist in the form of an advisorycommittee which meets periodically to guide the Center's services.oSex Abuse Task Force - This multiagency group meets weekly and coordinates theinvolvement of the various agencies in specific child abuse cases, with a primary focusof sexual abuse. Beyond its role in planning and coordinating the prosecution andtreatment of individual cases, the task force has had a significant impact at thesystem level. For example, a protocol for use in sexual abuse cases was developed,and the task force has clarified and reduced overlap of the roles of different agenciesin investigations.oDay Treatment Advisory Committee - This is a program committee of the CASC Boardof Directors and is comprised of parents, a physician, a child advocate, andrepresentatives of the Canton City Schools and other child-serving agencies. Thecommittee meets quarterly to review programmatic issues and make recommendationsregarding the operation and continued development of the Day Treatment Program.oSchool and Agency Advisory Council - Representatives of all of the school districts inStark County and the human service agencies comprise the School and AgencyAdvisory Council.This group meets three times per year and is chaired by theCASC's Coordinator of Consultation, Education, and Prevention. The primary purposeof this council is to provide information about new services and changes within thevarious agencies. The council fulfills a valuable educational function within thesystem of care by apprising schools and human service agencies on a regular basis ofwhat services are available and how to access services. 2811 I.1. Stark County Interagency Children's ClusterIn the context of this tradition of interagency collaboration to address services for children, the Stark County Interagency Children's Cluster was organized in 1984 at the time of the Governor's executive order. Comprised of the major child-serving agencies, the Cluster's initial mission was limited primarily to case review. A statement of purposes and objectives for the Cluster that was developed in 1985 clearly reflected this focus on individual cases of multineed youngsters. Stated functions included:oReview of specific individual cases referred by Cluster members,oIdentification of an agency to provide case management,oDevelopment of an individual written service plan,oOversight to ensure timely and coordinated service delivery, andoOngoing monitoring of cases brought to the Cluster.Since its inception, both the structure and mission of the Cluster have changed substantially. The membership of the Cluster has broadened to include not only the major child-serving systems but a wider range of agencies and providers serving children and families. Thediagram on the following page reflects the current membership of the Cluster. Concurrently, the mission of the Cluster has dearly evolved to focus on system level issues related to the development, financing, coordination, and evaluation of the system of care. Since 1989, a series of retreats with an outside facilitator have been vital in shaping the Cluster's development. The retreats have resulted in agreement among Cluster members on issues ranging from the vision and principles for the system of care to mechanisms for blended funding of services for multineed youngsters. Thus, it is the Stark County Interagency Children's Cluster that serves as the structure for system level coordination for the system of care.The movement of the Cluster toward a system focus has not negated its role in case review. To the contrary, the community has designed a three-tiered structure to enable both client- level and system-level coordination functions to be fulfilled. At the direct service level, the Creative Community Options process is used to bring together all service providers involved with a child and family to participate in strengths-based assessment and treatment planning process. For cases which require problem-solving at a higher level, the second tier is theACCORD (A Creative Community Options Review Decision). The ACCORD is a standing committee of middle-level managers from each of the major child-serving agencies and is considered to be a subcommittee of the Cluster. It reviews cases, problem solves, and monitors treatment for referred youngsters. If consensus on a particular case cannot be reached at the ACCORD level, the case may be referred to the Cluster for resolution. The ACCORD also is in a strategic position to identify service gaps and feed information about the functioning of the system of care to the Cluster. Both the Creative Community Options process and the ACCORD are described in greater detail in the following section, Client LevelCoordination Mechanisms.The third level of coordination is the Cluster itself, also referred to as the Administrative Cluster. It is this level that is comprised of the top executives of the participating agencies. Cluster meetings are held monthly, with responsibilities for chairing the Cluster rotating every six months. At the time of the site visit, the Executive Director of the Mental Health29 Stark County CollaborativeJob Training PartnershipStark County Health DepartmentOhio Rehabilitation ServicesStark County Prosecutor 30 Board was serving as chairperson of the Cluster. A Cluster meeting, hebi during the sitevisit began with a review of minutes. The second agenda item was presentation of new cases,however there were no new cases for Cluster consideration on that particular date. Thegroup proceeded to hear updates on cases previously considered. One of the cases discussedinvolved a 15-year-old male sex offender placed at Sagamore Hills. The youngster reportedlywas not benefitting from an intensive treatment program at Sagamore (the One-to-OneProgram) and was continuing to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior. Because theyoungster had been adjudicated for rape and had prior offenses, the group agreed that asecure treatment setting was indicated. However, no one at the meeting was aware of asecure setting which offers treatment for young se :ual offenders, and responsibility wasassigned to investigate potential treatment resources.The major portion of the Cluster meeting was devoted to consideration of system level issues.These included:oPlans for an Early Childhood Center - The group discussed plans for the creation ofan early childhood center which would combine a variety of programs and resourcesfor young children and their families. As envisioned, the center would house andintegrate services including day care for normal and handicapped children, earlychildhood classes provided by the schools, and classes for at-risk children sponsoredby the county. The Education Enhancement Partnership is continuing to work onimplementing this concept.oRehabilitative Services Commission Initiative - The Cluster discussed plans to writea grant through the education system to access funds offered by the RehabilitativeServices Commission. The group agreed that the grant application should be forinnovative uses of rehabilitation funds for Cluster children. While the initial amountof the grant would be small, the group saw this as an opportunity to make inroadswith the Rehabilitative Services Commission and to begin to provide vocationalservices to youngsters.The Cluster also discussed the possibility of inviting arepresentative of the Rehabilitative Services Commission to sit on the ACCORD anddetermine how the rehabilitation agency might contribute to the service plans ofindividual youngsters.Potential services might include tutoring, job coaching,preparation for employment, training, and work adjustment services. The county wassuccessful in obtaining this grant which was used to purchase job coaches andemployment services for three youngsters. In addition, the Rehabilitative ServicesCommission now participates on the ACCORD. oTask Force on Sexual Offenders - The Cluster discussed establishing a task force onthe needs of sexual offenders and debated the composition of such a task force. Thetwo primary approaches considered were to create a task force comprised of clinicalexperts in this area or to build the task force with decision makers who would focusmore on system issues.The Cluster decided on a task force of decision makersfocusing on system gaps and system coordination issues; the task force could bring inclinical experts on sex offenders as needed. Following the discussion, volunteers weretaken and the task force was formed. One action resulting from the task force wasthe issuance of requests for proposals from local providers to provide community-basedservices to three youth sex offenders who were in Sagamore Hills. As there was31 t.) limited interest among providers in serving these youngsters, the task force continuesto work to find viable approaches.oCluster Coordinator Position- The Cluster discussed the possibility of obtaining fundsto support a paid cluster coordinator position. Plans to approach the County Commissioners for partial funds for this purpose were finalized; additionalcontributions for this position could potentially come from the individual memberagencies. oTask Force on Organizational Structure - The Cluster established a task force toexplore potential legal structures to coordinate the system of care. The task force wasto be chaired by the Children's Coordinator of the Mental Health Board and wascharged with pursuing various organizational options and reporting back at asubsequent Cluster meeting. A 501(cX3) corporation, a council of governments (COG),and a division of an existing agency were among the options under consideration fora legal operating structure.At the time, it was felt that a more formalized interagency entity such as a corporation or a COG might be necessary in order toapply for grants, hire a cluster coordinator, or expend monies from a pooled source. A legal entity also might serve as the lead agency for creating new services, such as therapeutic foster care or services for sex offenders, and could operate joint services.At the time, a COG was the structure receiving the most serious consideration, andthe member agencies agreed to make appropriate inquiries as to whether they couldparticipate in a COG. oFiscal Strategy for Pooled Resources - A major issue discussed at the Cluster meeting was the proposal to blend agency resources to create a fund to be used for Clusterchildren. This issue had been examined at length during a retreat held in January1991, and agencies :.ad agreed to determine whether they could participate in suchan arrangement.Some agencies expressed concerns about the legality of suchnoncategorical funding, and there was also some concern about placing unrestrictedfunds at the discretion of the Cluster. At the time of the site visit, the Cluster was attempting to develop a formula which would specify the percentage of participationof the various agencies in a resource pool.It is interesting to note that the latter three issues discussed at this Cluster meeting cover critical issues that the Stark County Cluster has faced in recent years. The need for a cluster coordinator has been raised repeatedly and is based upon the contention that a full-time position is needed to coordinate the activities of the system of care. The Stark County Commissioners were approached for partial funding for such a position, and there was considerable discussion of individual agency contributions to further support a coordinator. Ultimately, the addition of a Children's Coordinator to the staff of the Mental Health Boarddiminished the urgency of hiring a cluster coordinator. The Children's Coordinator naturallybegan to assume many of these responsibilities and eventually was formally recognized as fulfilling the cluster coordinator's role. Funds were obtained from the State Level Clusterto support 50 percent of the Children's Coordinator's salary in recognition of the coordinatingfunctions she assumed for the local Cluster. 32 With respect to an organizational structure, the Cluster ultimately determined that it could function as a cluster and did not necessarily require an alternative legal structure in order to continue the development of the system of care. As a result, the Cluster has not pursued the formation of a nonprofit corporation or a COG but rather has continued to function and evolve in its current organizational form. Formation of a COG or another type of legal entity has not been ruled out for the future.Perhaps the most significant development in the evolution of the Cluster was the adoption of a formal agreement committing funds from four core agencies to the care of multineed and multisystem children and families. The agreement, signed in January 1992, blends $750,000 in funds from the DHS, the Mental Health Board, the MR/DD Board, and the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board. The agreement further stipulates that each core agency will pay a proportion of the cost of services provided to each multineed child basedupon pre- established percentages, and that other Cluster agencies may contribute on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the Clusterwas successful in implementing a fiscal strategy for pooled resources to support services for multineed youngsters. It is anticipated that additional agencies, such as the Canton City Schools and the Stark County Family Court, will contributeto the blended funds in fiscalyear 1993.The Cluster's priorities for 1992 include:oDevelopment of therapeutic foster care services. oDevelopment of a multisystem case management training program for case managers and supervisory personnel from all systems involving 20 to 24 hours of training over six to eight months.oDevelopment of a system forcase managers to rotate through multiple child-serving agencies (\"Walk a Mile in My Shoes\").oDevelopment of client tracking and client outcome monitoring tools to review youngsters served by the Cluster in order to determine if services are active and ongoing and if youngstersare being maintained in or moved to less restrictivesettings.oDevelopment of school-based mental health services by deploying outpatient staff into school settings to provide services.oDevelopment of aggressivecase finding to identify children in the child welfare system who are in need of mental health services. oDevelopment of a public/private partnership including Cluster agencies, private providers, and local foundations for the purpose of creating greater community ownership and awareness of the needs of children and families and developing strategies to address these needs.The functioning of the Stark County Interagency Cluster is considered to be highly effective. Respondents reported that the Cluster has made steady progress towarda more integrated approach and has steadily broken down the barriers between the various child-serving systems. One of the ways that progress is evident is that Cluster members spend much more time discussing what is needed as opposed to who will pay. The significant progress achieved by the Cluster has been attributed largely to the perception of children as Stark County children rather than children with a particular type of label.This joint ownership and shared responsibility for troubled children has created an atmosphere of cooperation. Despite33 remarkable progress in creating and coordinating a system of care, the Cluster hasencountered a number of troublesome barriers: oBalancing the mission of the system of care with the mission of individual agencies -Each Cluster agency must report back to its own board of directors. Agency boardstypically are fiscally conservative and may be reluctant to make changes in agencybudgets to accommodate Cluster needs and priorities. oDependence upon key individuals -Respondents indicated that the effectivefunctioning of the Cluster may be dependent, t9 some extent, on the participation ofkey individuals who have set the tone for collaboration and provided leadership. Ifthese or other Cluster representatives leave their jobs, a difficult process ofreeducation and reorientation of new individuals will be necessary. oCategorical funding - Categorical funding has been a barrier which has reportedlyhampered the Cluster's ability to use funds to address system gaps and priorities.The Cluster has had to seek creative ways of blending funds and accessing fundingsources in order to continue to develop the system of care in the desired directions.Differences in approach among agencies - Various agencies, by definition, havedifferent perceptions of problems and different approaches to address them. Forexample, some agencies may stress keeping children at home, while others may leanmore towards removing children in situations with perceived risk. Respondentsemphasized the necessity of dealing openly with these differences in perception orapproach in order to resolve disagreements and work together effectively. oReluctant or uninvolved agencies - As in any community, some agencies are less activeparticipants in the system of care. In addition, some agencies have not been involvedin Cluster activities.While the Canton City School system is an active Clusterparticipant, the other school districts in the county have been involved only in isolatedcases. Respondents indicated that efforts are needed to involve the other schoolsdistricts more systematically in the system of care. The strategy used to \"hook\"uninvolved agencies has generally been to demonstrate what they stand to gain byparticipating. For example, a local school district can be shown how much is spenton an out-of-district placement and that working with the Cluster potentially couldavert the need for some these placements. This may create a greater incentive formore active participation in the Cluster and system of care. CLIENT LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS The client level coordination function in the Stark County system of care is fulfilled by twoprimary approaches -- using specialized mental health case managers at the CASC andassigning a lead case manager from the most logical provider agency. The mental health casemanagement program at the CASC is staffed by 13 case managers, most at the bachelor'sdegree level, and two supervisors who are organized into two teams. Each case managercarries a caseload of 15 to 20 cases, although case managers reported that the ideal caseload 34 size should be 10 to 1.2. Case managers are available 24 hours a day during the work week,with a pager system used to contact case managers after working hours when necessary. Onweekends and holidays, one member of each team is on call to respond to crises. Casemanagers may submit a \"crisis plan\" for a particular family which advises on-call staff as tohow to handle a potential crisis.Considerable attention was given to defining the target population for mental health casemanagement services since it was clearly not possible to serve all youngsters in need withthe resources available. The target population was therefore defined as youngsters up to age18 who are seriously emotionally disturbed and: oAre hospitalized in a psychiatric setting as part of the public mental health systemoAre placed in a secure psychiatric setting through the public mental health systemoAre placed in a residential treatment facilityoAre placed in Cluster therapeutic foster careoAre placed in other therapeutic foster careoAre at serious risk of out-of-home placementoAre enrolled at the mental health Day Treatment Program at the Shipley CenteroScore below 50 on the Global Assessment ScaleoAre receiving more than eight units of counseling, psychotherapy, or crisisintervention services per monthSome youngsters may be eligible for mental health case management services, but if they are receiving case management services through another agency, might not have a mental healthcase manager from the CASC. While there often is a waiting list for mental health casemanagement services, an attempt is made to respond to emergent cases promptly. Theprogram currently services approximately 300 youngsters.The role of the mental health case managers includes the functions typically associated withcase management including: oAssessing the child's and family's strengths and needs,oPlanning with the family and other service providers to develop a service plan,oLinking and referring the child and family to needed services and resources,oHelping families to meet basic needs,oAdvocating for the child and family's point of view,oCoordinating services with schools and other agencies,oMonitoring the implementation of the service plan and progress, andoProviding support and crisis intervention.Case managers characterize their role as working with the child and family to assess strengths and needs and to explore resources to access treatment in the least restrictive, mostnormative setting possible.This characterization reflects the commitment of the casemanagement program to maximizing the use of community-based alternatives to hospitalization and other residential treatment placements. Additionally, case managers report that their activities are all directed toward \"empowerment\" of the child and family. 35 The focus of case management services moves beyond the referred child and involves workingwith the entire family. This often entails extensive work with other children within thefamily and with extended family members. Case management services are not interruptedwhen the child is placed in a hospital, group home, or other out-of-home setting. Rather, thecase manager continues to work closely with the child, the family, and the treatment setting.While case managers provide high levels of support and supportive counseling, they do notsee their role as providing \"therapy\" per se. Children and families requiring psychotherapyare referred to professional therapists at the CASC or in the private sector.Mental health case managers work closely with other child-serving agencies on a formal andinformal basis. Through service planning meetings, staff from other agencies participate inthe development, implementation, and monitoring of service plans. Frequent personal andphone contact is maintained with staff from other agencies to ensure that services are beingdelivered as planned, to coordinate work with families, and to adjust service plans andapproaches as needed. The personal relationships that develop between the case managersand staff from other agencies facilitate this process. While case managers do not necessarilyhave the authority to compel agencies to provide services, they appear to use thesealternative strategies effectively to maximize the cooperation and participation of otheragencies.Respondents indicated that some staff from other agencies, and even staff within the CASC,do not fully understand the role of the case manager and may have unreasonableexpectations. For example, some staff may perceive the case manager as a \"gofer\" or taxidriver rather than a coordinator of care who is probably the person most familiar with thefamily's strengths and needs. Case managers work closely with staff throughout the systemto clarify the role of the case manager within the system of care and to demonstrate thesignificance of this service.Case managers have access to flexible funds, $40,000 in fiscal year 1992, with plans toexpand the amount of flexible funds available for wraparound services in the future. Thesefunds can be accessed through specific purchase requisitions or through cash advances andcan be used to meet identified needs for a child and family. Flexible funds have been usedfor taxi fares, school supplies, scout memberships, music and karate lessons, camp, afterschool activities and classes, food, clothing, cleaning and household items, and repairs. Thefunds also can be used for utility bills and rent, with agreements frol.a clients for repayment.Cluster funds also can be accessed by case managers to purchase services and supports thatwould keep a child at home.A number of advantages to using a specialized mental health case management approachwere identified by respondents. Specialized mental health case managers developconsiderable expertise in working with children with emotional disorders and their familiesas well as in-depth knowledge of the services and resources available in the communityFurther, they become skilled at providing crisis intervention and community support tochildren and families and advocating on their behalf.A second approach to client level coordination used in Stark County involves assigning a leadcase manager to a child and family from the most logical, or most involved, provider agency.Typically, the most logical agency is determined by the child and family's primary area of36 need. Thus, a child with an emotional disorder may have a can manager through the CASCcase management program or may have a lead case manager from the DHS, MR/DD, JuvenileCourt, or another agency depending upon the circumstances. Respondents reported that thisapproach also can be effective. The use of multiagency service planning meetings andfrequent contact among involved agencies ensures that staff work together and services arecoordinated. The advantages to assigning a lead case manager from a service agency are thatthe case manager will most likely have in-depth knowledge of the child's primary area ofneed and of the resources available in that area. Potential problems may arise, however,from turf issues or from differing perspectives about service provision. If, for example, thelead case manager focuses on one area of need to the exclusion of others, then the family willnot receive a comprehensive service package. Respondents asserted that either approach tocase management can be effective if the entire system of care is committed to acomprehensive, client-centered, multisystem approach to service delivery.Service planning meetings involving representatives of multiple provider agencies are anessential element of client level coordination in the Stark County system of care. The firstlevel of community treatment planning is called a Creative Community Options (CCO)meeting. The CCO process was initiated by the Cluster in 1987 to promote interagencycoordination in service planning and delivery and to resolve obstacles to working withchildren and families. A CCO meeting may be called by the agency holding lead casemanagement responsibility for a child and family and typically is chaired by the casemanager; often a CASC mental health case manager chairs the CCO meeting. Workers areencouraged not to wait for a crisis but to call a CCO meeting any time that efforts are neededto provide creative, individualized services to help a child remain within the family orcommunity. Direct service level staff from all involved agencies participate in the CCOprocess, and the family, as well as the child in most cases, are included as full participants.The stated purpose of the CCO process is to examine creatively what might work for the childand family and to develop comprehensive service strategies including an array of treatment,education, recreation, and living arrangements which are specified in a written plan. TheCCO process involves reviewing the child's and family's history, strengths, and needs andthen proceeding to identify options for services and supports. The outcome of the CCOmeeting, which generally takes several hours, is an intensive, community-based service plan.The lead case manager is responsible for monitoring implementation of the plan; CCO groupscan be reconvened to address unresolved issues or changes in a child's or family's situation.In order to prepare families for participation in the CCO meeting, case managers take thetime to acquaint them with the process and what they might expect. Role playing may evenbe used as a strategy to help families feel more comfortable interacting with the serviceproviders and expressing their desires and needs.A CCO meeting which took place during the site visit was chaired by a case managersupervisor from the CASC. The group, which included the parents and adolescent, outlinedthe history, prepared a \"people map\" showing the significant others in the child's life, andoutlined strengths and problems, what works, and what doesn't work. Each of these topicswas summarized on newsprint and hung on the wall around the room. The group thenproceeded to brainstorm what the child needed. Among those needs identified were medication, a special education placement, respite care, crisis intervention, therapy, astructured behavioral program to earn privileges, to improve family interactions, and to37 receive help for fire setting. The next phase involved identifying options to meet these needsand resulted in a package of services including home-based services, individual therapy,respite care, medication through a psychiatrist, and special education. The case managerassumed responsibility for assisting the family to arrange for implementation of the serviceplan.In some case3, the CCO process is unable to resolve difficult and complex barriers to servinga child and family effectively. This may be a result of the lack of appropriate resources inthe community, inability to identify funding sources for services, or the failure of plannedservices to meet the needs of a particular child and family In these situations, a referral canbe made to the second level of community treatment planning, the ACCORD (A CreativeCommunity Options Review Decision). As noted, the ACCORD is a standing group comprisedof mid-level managers from each of the major child-serving systems. The lead case managerfor the child and family is responsible for completing a referral packet and presenting thecase to the ACCORD for review. The goals of the ACCORD are to reach consensus onfunding and to identify services to meet the family's needs. ACCORD members generallyhave the authority to commit their agency to providing services or financial support, butmight have to receive approval from their respective agency executives for a highly unusualservice or funding arrangement.A case considered by the ACCORD during the site visit involved a multineed family in whichthe mother and three adolescents all had severe mental or emotional disturbances andextensive histories of hospitalization. One youth in particular was continuing to experienceserious difficulties despite intensive home-based services, case management, homeinstruction, and other services. The ACCORD devised a plan that would provide a supportperson in the home on a full-time basis to support the mother and work with the adolescents.It was felt that an in-home aide was the only strategy not yet tried, and that this offered achance to avert the imminent placement of one of the youngsters at Sagamore Hills. Twopotential approaches for funding this service were identified, and a plan was createdincluding the in-home aide, home-based services, case management, home tutoring, andpossible placement in day treatment and vocational services. The meeting ended withresponsibility assigned for pursuing arrangements for funding and hiring the in-home aide.If a case cannot be resolved at the ACCORD level, then it can be presented to theAdministrative Cluster for further deliberation and problem solving. Confidentialityrequirements have not proven to be barriers at any level of community treatment planningand coordination. A common consent form was developed which allows the participatingagencies to share information at the meetings with representatives of the agencies specifiedon the form.Training for case managers is an issue receiving increasing prominence in Stark County.Kent State University offers a two-year associate degree program in case management at itsSalem campus. The program includes internship opportunities at the CASC, and two CASCcase managers have completed this program. In-service training also is provided for casemanagers, often involving consultants brought in to provide training on aspects of carecoordination. The need for additional training for case managers across systems becameevident to the Cluster, and two activities have been initiated. The first of these efforts is thedevelopment of a multisystem training program for case managers. The training program381 Cti will provide an opportunity for case managers to gain an understanding of the values andprinciples of case management in each system, the legal mandates of each system, and thesimilarities and differences among systems. It will also provide an opportunity to impart thecommon values and goals of the system of care to case managers system-wide. As a first stepin designing the training program, a questionnaire was sent to case managers in all child-serving agencies. The survey assessed the role and duties of case managers in each system,how lead case managers are assigned, how multiple case managers work together, how theCCO process is used, and issues that should be addressed in a joint training initiative.Information gathered by the survey was used to design a training program which will provide20 to 24 hours of training over a six to eight month period. The training program is to beginin September 1992 and will be offered to 250 persons over the course of a year in multiagencygroups.A second initiative sponsored by the Cluster is called \"Walk a Mile in My Shoes\" and involvesthe development of a rotation system for children's case managers. This project would allowcase managers to rotate through the major child-serving agencies, providing them with agreater understanding of the legal mandates, philosophy, and constraints of each agency.The rationale for this project is that first-hand experience of case managers in the various child-serving agencies would enhance interagency relationships and assist in developing a more fully integrated system of care. Additionally, this rotation system has potential to pavethe way for a centralized intake process for the entire system of care in the county. A grantapplication was submitted to the Ohio Department of Health to support planning for this case management rotation project. Despite the fact that this grant was not funded, the Clusterhas proceeded with planning the project. IX. SYSTEM OF CARE ACTIVITIES Family InvolvementA central element of the philosophy of the Stark County system of care involves working with children in the context of their families. In accordance with this focus on families, the system has made strides in involving families in all phases of planning and delivering services.First, parents are considered to be essential participants in planning and monitoring servicesfor their own children.This is accomplished by involving parents in the interagencyprocesses used to develop service plans For instance, parents play a central role in the CCOprocess. Some participating agencies initially expressed concern about discussing the child'sand family's history and other difficult issues with parents present. However, respondentsreported that the experience of parental participation in the service planning process quickly led to a recognition of the benefits of full involvement. The inclusion of parents as key participants and decision makers creates better engagement in the process and ownership of the resultant service plan. Parents are always invited to ACCORD meetings when theirchild's case is being considered and, in some cases, have attended Cluster meetings whentheir case is discussed.Children also are involved in the service planning process as appropriate, with no established age limits for such participation. 39 c In addition to involving families in decisions about their own child, the system of care hasattempted to involve parents in planning and policy making at the system level. Familymembers are on the CASC Board of Trustees, and the CASC Planning Committee has parentmembers. Parents participated in a recently completed strategic planning process for theCASC which involved reviewing and revising the agency's philosophy, mission, and objectives.When new programs are developed, such as the case management program, meetings areheld with parents to obtain their input and suggestions for the design and development ofthe program. The Mental Health Board has members whose children have been involved inthe system, although their children currently are adults.Through the CASC, support has been provided for parents to attend statewide or nationalmeetings related to family issues. Three parents were sent, along with several case managers, to a recent statewide meeting on case management. In addition to providingfinancial support for their attendance at the meeting, respite services were provided forchildren to enable the parents to leave home.A significant gap in Stark County is the lack of parent support or advocacy groups focusingon children with emotional disturbances. A parent group reportedly met for a brief periodof time but was unable to sustain over time due to a struggle to determine its focus.Respondents acknowledged the need for parent support groups and have identified twopotential opportunities to facilitate the development of such groups. One of the three Alliancefor the Mentally Ill (AMI) groups in Stark County appears interested in starting a subgroupof parents of children and adolescents. In addition, a core group of parents of youngsters inthe Day Treatment Program meet regularly and participate extensively in school-relatedactivities. Both of these possibilities present opportunities for stimulating the developmentof parent groups.One positive development is a grant received by the Canton City Schools for a parentmentoring program. The project allows parents of children with disabilities to work withother parents to provide them advocacy, support, and assistance in accessing resources andto increase their involvement in their child's school.Cultural CompetenceThe population in the City of Canton is 13 percent African American, and the CASC clientpopulation is nearly 20 percent African American. In order to enhance the culturalcompetence of the agency and its services, the CASC has implemented a number of strategies.One such strategy has involved attempting to increase the number of minority staff membersat the CASC. Since Stark County is not in or near a major urban area, nor is it near a majoruniversity, it has been difficult to recruit qualified minority professionals to work at theagency. Nevertheless, the CASC has had some success in recruiting minority staff in recentyears. When the Case Management Program was initiated, the agency devoted significanteffort to hiring a racially balanced staff to enhance responsiveness to the needs of thechildren and families to be served. Staff training for this and other CASC programs includes to topics related to cultural competence.In addition to staff recruitment, the CASC has reached out to the minority community bylocating services in areas that are easily accessible. For example, the agency opened an office40 at the Canton Urban League located in the southeast part of Canton and saw clients at thislocation for several years; an outreach office currently is located at the site of an alternativeschool which also is in the minority community. The Shipley Center, which houses the DayTreatment program, is located in a downtown area where there is a heavy concentration ofAfrican Americans. The CASC is in the process of renovating the Shipley Center andrelocating additional services to this facility.Another step taken by the CASC to enhance cultural competence was the establishment ofa task force comprised of interested staff. The group meets monthly and sponsors events toincrease cultural awareness. Examples of activities organized by the task force include aluncheon with ethnic dishes and a program on Martin Luther King Day. The commitmentof the CASC to increasing cultural competence was also demonstrated by the agency'sdevoting its 1991 annual retreat to the this topic.In addition to the steps taken by the CASC, the Mental Health Board has also initiatedactivities designed to increase cultural sensitivity and responsiveness. The Board hassponsored a forum for inner city p!:ncipals to discuss their concerns and the needs of theirstudents and has sponsored training opportunities on cultural competence for mental healthstaff in the county. Recently, the Mental Health Board hired a consultant to assist in aplanning process to meet the needs of a very small population of Native Americans whoreside in Stark County. This group of Native Americans is isolated and disenfranchised andhas significant service needs. The consultant was enlisted to help the Board to determinehow best to reach this group as well as to find potential resources for service provision.TransitionServices for youth in transition is an area in need of improvement in the system of care.Currently, transition plans and services for youngsters with emotional problems are handledon an individual case basis. Vocational programs are available through two vocationalschools in the county, and Goodwill accepts some adolescents in its supported work program.There is some focus on independent living skills in the Day Treatment Program, but littlesystematic training in independent living skills.The system has begun to address the needs in this area through some preliminary planningactivities. The Children's Coordinator for the Mental Health Board has met with the adultmental health centers to discuss system issues related to transition as well as specific casesof seriously emotionally disturbed adolescents who were turning 18. Based upon the availability of a small amount of funds from the Ohio Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitationand Department of Mental Health, the Children's Coordinator prepared a proposal to usethese funds to address transition issues. These funds were obtained and used to fund jobcoaches and other employment services for Cluster youngsters. Some consideration has beengiven to the idea of a case manager whose role would be to work with youth in transition.This is more of a possibility if the case management program expands.High Risk PopulationsUntil recently, a collaborative effort between the CASC and Canton City Health Departmentfocused on youngsters at risk for HIV infection and AIDS. The Health Department41 contracted with the CASC to provide youths with consultation and emergency supportrelative to HIV testing. Short-term crisis counseling was provided to adolescents to managethe stress of being tested for HIV infection. Risk management group counseling was providedas follow-up for youngsters testing negative; for those testing positive, the CASC offeredgroup therapy. The funding for these services was discontinued due to the lack of sufficientdemand. Support groups for persons with AIDS, which could include adolescents, remainavailable at the Crisis Center. In addition, the Mental Health Board is represented on a taskforce sponsored by the Canton City Health Department which assists in planning andoverseeing the community's response to the AIDS epidemic.There are no runaway shelters in Stark County and, until recently, little direct focus onhomeless children or adolescents. However, in 1992, a $91,000 grant was received from theOhio Department of Mental Health to serve emotionally disturbed children and adolescentswho are homeless and their families. Funds can be used to provide housing for these familiesfor up to one year.AdvocacyWhile there appear to be lots of effective advocacy efforts in Stark County, there are few advocacy activities specifically on behalf of troubled children and adolescents. There are three active Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AMI) groups in the county: Advocates for theMentally Ill of Alliance, Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Massillon, and Reason for Hope ofCanton. These groups are comprised primarily of family members who have a relative withmental illness as well as some mental health consumers, professionals, and other interestedparties. The groups have regularly scheduled meetings which allow participants to exchangeinformation and experiences and to provide mutual support. In addition, they are influentialadvocates for needed mental health services and supports.These AMI groups traditionally have focused on the needs of adults with mental illness, butare beginning to expand their perspective to include children. There may be potential forthese groups to reach out to the parents of youngsters with emotional disturbances and toadvocate for this group. The need for more organized and effective advocacy for children isrecognized. In particular, respondents noted the need for parents to become more organized as consumer advocates and to identify with a national organization or movement.One noteworthy advocacy effort for children was the Northeast Coalition for Children'sMental Health. This coalition was comprised of representatives or agencies, communityorganizations, citizens groups, and business groups from three counties -- Summit, Cuyahoga, and Stark. The Mental Health Board and the CASC were leaders in the coalition whichfocused on crisis situations such as the possible closure of a hospital which was considered an important part of the continuum of services for children in the area. Unfortunately, thecoalition has not been active during the past year.Respondents also characterized the Cluster, Mental Health Board, and the CASC as advocates for children. The CASC, for example, has sponsored meetings with legislators tofocus on children's issues. Despite the advocacy activities of these agencies, it is clear thatenhanced advocacy in the area of children's mental health is needed. 421 X. FINANCING The primary strategies used for financing the Stark County system of care involve funding of services through the mental health system, interagency funding of services for individual children, interagency funding of service components, and maximizing all potential funding sources for services. The Stark County Mental Health Board provides a substantial amountof funds to support services for children with emotional disturbances and their families. Approximately 25 percent of the Board's budget (or well over $2 million) goes to support children's programs at the CASC, the Crisis Center, and residential treatment centers. The funds flowing through the Mental Health Board to the service system include state general revenue, block grant funds, and a local community mental health board levy. Even thoughit was reported that the Stark County Mental Health Board devotes a larger portion of its budget to children's services than most Ohio mental health boards, there has been concerted effort to incrementally increase the proportion of funds spent on children and adolescents.Interagency funding of services for individual youngsters is handled through the Cluster. The Cluster considers cases of youngsters and their families with multiple and particularly challenging needs. At the time of the site visit, the funding of the service plan for each child and family was handled on an individual case basis.The process typically involved maximizing all potential funding sources for services and then relying on participating agencies to contribute either particular services or funds to purchase needed services depending upon the circumstances of the case.Contributions of funds from the various agencies typically has been applied to the support of residential placements. To implement individualized service plans which do not involve residential placements, agencies typically have contributed and assumed the cost of services. In one case, for example, a follow-along person in the schools was provided by the education system, DHS provided a foster placement, inpatient backup was provided by Timken Mercy Hospital, crisis services by the Crisis Center, and mental health services by the CASC.Rather than negotiating agency contributions for each individual case, the Cluster agencies felt that it would be preferable to devise a formula which would govern the participation of each agency in the funding of services for youngsters considered by the Cluster. In order to begin considering this prospect, a retreat held in January 1991 was devoted exclusively to the issue of financing. An early item on the retreat agenda involved reviewing data showing how much money had actually been contributed by each agency to support services for Cluster children in 1990. The major task of the retreat was to review a series of options for \"giving your fair share to the Cluster.\" Four major options for funding individual service plans for youngsters were considered, and, by the end of the retreat, consensus was reached on an approach for shared funding. The basic approach adopted at the retreat called for eachagency to agree to a standard formula to be used to fund services. This standard percentageof participation would be used for any case funded by the Cluster. The monies to be contributed would remain in each agency's budget, but would be money committed in advance to the Cluster up to a predetermined ceiling amount. At the conclusion of the retreat, each agency agreed to seek approval from its board for the recommended percentages ofparticipation. It also was decided to seek advice from the state auditor as to the legality of or any potential problems related to an agency's setting aside categorical funds to fundindividual service plans developed by the Cluster. The primary concern prompting this431t' consultation was that an agency might find itself in the position of spending its funds tosupport services for a child who might not be eligible for its services.The agreement reached during this retreat culminated in the signing of an interagencycontract in January 1992. The signing of the contract was considered a momentous event inthe evolution of the Stark County system of care since it formalized the shared responsibilityof the participating agencies in terms of service provision and financing of services forchildren. A number of state and local officials were present for the signing of the agreement,and extensive press coverage marked the significance of the event for the community. Theagreement specifies that the core agencies involved in the Cluster will set aside a total of$350,000 for the purpose of funding the service needs of appropriately determined childrenpresented to the Cluster during the first six months of 1992. The percentages of this amountto be contributed by the various agencies are: oStark County Department of Human Services 49%oStark County Mental Health Board 30%oStark County MR/DD Board 20%oAlcohol and Drug Abuse Services Board 1%The agreement further specified that each core agency would pay a proportionate share of theentire cost of services provided to each multineed child based upon the above percentages,with funding of services for a particular child and family to be determined by a vote of therepresentatives of the core agencies. Three votes in favor of funding a child were requiredin order to bind the core agencies to these financial obligations. Other member agenciesparticipating in the Cluster could consider contributing resources to support services on anindividual case basis. Thus, the school districts, health departments, Family Court, CASC,and Job Training Partnership might assist in funding services in appropriate cases. Thiswould result in proportionate reductions of the contributions of the four core agencies. Theagreement stated that the lead case manager identified for the child in question would beresponsible for pursuing all other appropriate sources of funds including parental support,insurance, Medicaid, Social Security, and Supplemental Security Income. Any costs ofservices recovered from these sources were to be reimbursed to all contributing agencies inproportion to their contributions.With the expiration of this agreement in June 1992, a new agreement has been developedwhich will become effective on July 1, 1992. Based upon the first six month's experience, thenew agreement changes the procedure for blending funds and financing services in order tostreamline and simplify the process. Under the new agreement, DHS is designated as thefiscal agent for the Cluster, and all participating agencies advance their funds to the DHS.DHS then pays all bills for services provided to Cluster children from the blended pool offunds. This new process eliminates the complicated process of each agency paying for eachindividual youngster based on the preestablished percentages. Any funds recovered fromother reimbursement sources revert directly to the Cluster blended fund. Under the newagreement, additional agencies are contributing to the blended funding pool. In addition, aprocess has been established to cover administrative costs of the Cluster; the ClusterCoordinator submits monthly bills for expenses including costs of retreats, telephone, postage,and clerical support, and DHS pays these expenses out of the blended funds. 44 Joint funding of service components or programs is another strategy used successfully tofinance services in Stark County. The Day Treatment Program, Child and Family AdvocacyCenter, TIES Program, Youth Sex Offender Program, and School-Based Mental HealthServices are examples of programs that have been jointly operated and funded by two or moreagencies.Respondents acknowledged that the community has been more successful atblending funds from multiple agencies on an individual case basis than on a programmaticlevel. A future goal of the Cluster is to increase opportunities for blended funding to createand operate additional services or programs for children and adolescents.As noted, attempts are being made in Stark County to maximize the use of all availablefunding streams to support services. This is being encouraged on an individual case level,with the case manager being responsible for pursuing all potential revenues. Similarly, attempts are underway at the system level to expand utilization of all possible financingsources.Medicaid, in particular, is a source of support for services which has beenunderutilized in the county. Mechanisms for expanding Medicaid reimbursements are beingexplored vigorously by the Cluster, specifically focusing on EPSDT as a vehicle for expandingboth eligibility and the range of reimbursable services and utilizing the 1915A option. Thisoption would allow identification of \"Cluster children\" as a target population as well asreimbursement for new services.Regarding problems related to financing, respondents indicated that, like most communities,there simply is not enough money to provide all the needed services and supports. The lackof sufficient funds is a problem that continues to plague the system and is not likely toimprove given the current fiscal crisis in Ohio. Rather, budget shortfalls at the state andlocal levels are forcing cuts in all human services, including services for children and families. XI. EVALUATION Participants in the Stark County system of care recognize the importance of evaluatingsystem outcomes and have initiated some evaluation activities. In 1989, the CASC hired aconsultant to propose methods for evaluating Cluster activities. The report generated by theconsultant discussed issues related to evaluation methods, designs, and potential indicatorsfor evaluating Cluster activities and outcomes for children and families served by the Cluster.A number of options for evaluation at the Cluster and client levels were presented in thereport as well as recommendations such as the creation of a database on children andfamilies served by the Cluster. Cluster retreats also have generated ideas for evaluating theeffectiveness of the evolving system of care.While these planning activities related to evaluation have occurred, progress in evaluatingthe system of care has been slow. The index used most frequently to demonstrate progress in Stark County is the dramatic reduction in out-of-county psychiatric placements that hasbeen achieved. As noted, there were 141 youngsters in out-of-county placements in 1976.The number of youngsters in out-of-county placements fell to 55 by 1985, a reduction whichis attributed to the development of a broader array of community-based services coupled withan explicit commitment by the child-serving agencies to serve children in the community.By 1991, out-of-county placements were reduced to only 15, representing a decline of nearly A45 90 percent from the 1976 rate. A similarly striking decline in the utilization of the statehospital for Stark County youngsters also has been achieved. In fact, the average bed daysutilized at Sagamore Hills fell from seven in 1989 to 1.5 in 1992.In order to track out-of-county placements more systematically, a multiagency monthlyreporting system has been developed. This monthly report is submitted to the Cluster byeach of the major child-serving agencies and specifies the number of youngsters in each typeof out-of-home placement within the county and out of the county. The reporting form coversthe range of potential out-of-home placements including inpatient psychiatric, inpatientsubstance abuse, residential treatment, group home, shelter care, therapeutic foster care,regular foster care, and detention settings. The reporting system is expected to result inaccurate and timely information about the utilization of out-of-home placements by all thechild-serving agencies and will be useful in system assessment and planning activities.The use of out-of-county placements as an indicator of effectiveness for the system of care isconsistent with the goals and values of the system. In fact, there appears to be considerableagreement as to some of the measures that should be used to assess the effectiveness of thesystem of care. These include: oReduction in hospitalization, andoImproved quality of services.Another focus of evaluation efforts at the system level has involved evaluating the CCOprocess. A questionnaire assessing the CCO process was developed and administered toparticipants of CCO meetings that were held over a 12-month period of time; 36 surveys werereturned. The questionnaire asked for perceptions of the purpose of the meeting and forfeedback about each of the major sections of the CCO meeting. Questionnaire respondentsalso were asked to state if the plan developed for the child and family was satisfactory andif the CCO process was of value and to make recommendations for its improvement. Thevast majority of respondents thought that the plans developed were acceptable and judgedthe process to be of value. Interestingly, parents gave the most positive feedback, makingcomments like: \"Thank you for and \"I can't believethat this many people wanted to help us.\" Some professionals, however, indicated discomfortwith having the parents there. Regarding suggestions for improvement, reducing or limitingthe amount of time the CCO meetings take was the most frequent recommendation. Inresponse, case managers have been asked to prepare the history section ahead of time andto do additional advance preparation in order to save time at CCO meetings.Another activity under consideration in Stark County is the development of a multiagencymanagement information system. This tracking system would provide a mechanism forsharing information on active, multiagency youngsters in a more reliable and systematicfashion. Several agencies went as far as to submit a joint grant application for a shared datasystem, but the grant was not funded. The Cluster submitted a proposal to the State LevelCluster and Governor's office asking to be established as a pilot county to test the feasibilityof a multiagency data system. While the Cluster has not established this as a currentpriority, there remains interest in pursuing this possibility in the future.46-.A t,l/ In addition to these system-wide evaluation activities, there have been some evaluationactivities related to individual service components. These activities are undertaken annuallyby the CASC, with the results summarized in the CASC's annual quality assurance report.The process used by the CASC involves monitoring one or two key indicators for eachprogram. Further evaluation is undertaken if the monitoring activity suggests some problemwith the quality or outcome of care. The conclusions are then used to change or improve theprogram in some way and to improve the monitoring process.For the Intensive Home-Based Services program, the monitoring activity focuses onmaintenance of children in the least restrictive, most normative environment. The indicatorused to assess this aspect of care is removal from the living situation to a more restrictive,less normative setting such as a hospital, detention center, or foster home. A threshold wasestablished specifying that no more than 15 percent of clients served should be placed in amore restrictive or less normal environment. The 1990 report indicates that the programexceeded this threshold with a removal rate of 33 percent. This result triggered furtherevaluation and efforts to determine why the placement rate during 1989 was higher thanpredicted. The report explains this result by noting that the program has a reunificationfocus and serves youngsters returning from Sagamore Hills and other inpatient psychiatricsettings. A literature review and survey of several similar programs found that similarfamily reunification programs serving similar populations tend to have lower \"success\" ratesthan programs with a primary placement-prevention focus. Thus, the threshold might havebeen inappropriate.Additionally, these data reflected the first year of the program'soperation during which many operational problems were encountered. The follow-up planincluded reviewing the monitoring activity and possibly changing the threshold as well ascontinuing to gather data related to successful family reunification. Additional measures,such as client/family functioning scales, may be considered in order to assess more fully theeffectiveness of the program. The threshold for 1991 was, in fact, raised to 40 percent. The1991 report indicated that only 13 percent of the youngsters served by the Intensive Home-Based Services program were placed in more restrictive settings during that year, a findingwell within the established goal and threshold.For Day Treatment the indicators used for monitoring purposes include frequency of utilizingseclusion, temporary or longer-term admissions to more restrictive placements, andplacement in a more restricti,re environment upon discharge from Day Treatment. For allprograms and services of the CASC, several indicators are used to gauge effectiveness -- bedday utilization at Sagamore Hills, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and client satisfaction.Thus, without a major commitment of resources, the CASC has implemented a monitoringsystem which relies upon key measures and which signals the need for further evaluation.It is important to note that the information gathered through this monitoring process clearlyis used as a basis for resolving problems and improving care.A somewhat more elaborate system for tracking client outcomes has been recently createdfor the Case Management Program. For each youngster receiving case management services,the CASC monitors: 47 oEntitlement Programs - Whether appropriate entitlement programs have beenreceivedoStable Housing - Whether the child has had stable housing (living with the samefamily or treatment setting) in the community for one year or moreoCommunity Tenure - Whether the child has had no psychiatric hospitalizations for oneyear or moreoSchool Tenure - Whether the child has remained in school for one year or moreoRestrictiveness of Setting - Whether the child has moved into a more or less restrictivesetting in school or housing areaso508K Submission - Whether the 508K was submitted in the current fiscal yearAnother new development in the area of evaluation is a case review process whereby thestatus of each youngster and family served by the Cluster will be assessed on a regular basis.The review process involves an interview with the child and with the providers to determineprogress, the appropriateness and responsiveness of services, and problems that should beaddressed at the Cluster level. Members of the ACCORD are responsible for conducting thecase review procedure. XII. MAJOR STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES Through interviews with key informants representing a wide variety of constituenciesinvolved in the Stark County system of care, a number of factors that are critical to thesuccess of the system were identified. The major strengths of the Stark County systeminclude the following: oLeadership - One of the principal strengths of the Stark County system lies in itsleadership. The involvement and commitment of the executives of the child-servingagencies in the community have provided the impetus and continuing support forsystem of care development over time. The Cluster has provided a forum for agencyexecutives to remain closely involved in decision making about both systemdevelopment and individual youngsters. Respondents emphasized that the close directparticipation of agency executives in planning and overseeing the system of care hasbeen essential for sustained progress. Thus, the leadership provided by a core groupof agency executives, coupled with their long-standing commitment to system of caredevelopment, has been crucial to the success of system development efforts in StarkCounty.Respondents noted that the stability of the key players in the Stark County systemof care may also contribute to its success. Many of the leaders have served in theStark County system for many years; they may have served in different capacities andbeen involved in different aspects of planning and decision making for the system.This \"tapestry\" of players or recycling of individuals on various task forces,committees, and the like has created a sense of continuity and history in thecommunity. The personal relationships that have developed among these key leadersin the system also have proven to be an asset. Respondents described a group of 48 people who get along well, who ittteract effectively, and who have developed highlevels of trust based upon long wading working and personal relationships. oShared Responsibility and Vision - A strength that became apparent during thesite visit is the sense of shared responsibility and mission that pervades the StarkCounty system of care. Respondents from the various agencies expressed a sense ofcollective ownership of the target population, indicating that participants havesucceeded in bridging some turf barriers and in embracing the belief that children andfamilies have multiple needs which cannot be met by individual agencies in isolation.Participants appear to regard the Cluster as \"greater than the sum of its parts\" andgenuinely believe that they will be more effective if they accept joint responsibility forStark County children and families and work together to build a comprehensiveservice system.Similarly, the philosophy of the system of care in the county appears to be well-ingrained and shared among the various participating agencies. The basic elementsof the system philosophy began to be articulated nearly 20 years ago, resulting in awidely accepted vision and goals for the system of care. The concepts of interagencycollaboration, serving children within the home and community, and family focusappear to be accepted both by agency executives as well as most providers. Thisshared responsibility for multineed youngsters and their families and the sharedvision and goals for a system of care have provided a firm base for systemdevelopment. oProactive Attitude - Respondents emphasized that Stark County has not receiveda great deal of special or extra funding to support their system development efforts.Nevertheless, the sheer determination to create an effective system of care hasenabled the community to proceed without many extra grants or support. Thecommunity has been described as \"the little engine that could,\" moving ahead andtaking action with few resources and in the face of formidable barriers. Much of theprogress in Stark County is attributed to a proactive attitude which moves the systemahead in spite of scarce resources or disappointments such as unsuccessful grantapplications. Participants expressed the attitude of doing \"whatever it takes\" or \"justdoing it\" rather than waiting for grants or other opportunities. The Cluster tends tofocus on what is possible rather than on constraints or what is not possible. Thus, animportant strength in Stark County is a proactive and positive attitude whichemphasizes what can be accomplished and propels the community to take action toaddress identified problems. oCooperative Approach to Problem Solving - A coopera' 3 approach among theparticipating agencies was identified as an important strent,ch in Stark County. Asnoted, the belief that the various child-serving agencies will be more effectivecollectively and the joint sense of responsibility for troubled children are evident inthe community's efforts.Beyond this, however, is a willingness to confront andresolve problems openly and in good faith. When the inevitable disagreements amongagencies arise, participants do not leave the table, but rather are committed toworking them out.Further, participants appear committed to working with\"reluctant\" agencies over time, providing encouragement meaningful opportunities for 1 (-t.49 them to become more involved. Often the retreat process has successfully been usedas a forum for discussing and resolving disagreements among system participants. oService Implementation - The creation and gradual expansion of an array ofservices within the community is a major strength of the system of care. The CASCestablished the goal of developing a comprehensive continuum of care early in itshistory, and over time has built the capacity to provide services including daytreatment, intensive home-based services, emergency in-home services, services for sexoffenders, case management, and individualized wraparound services. The ability totranslate plans into actual service capacity is an essential aspect of system buildingand is an aspect in which Stark County has realized particular success. oSize of Community - Several respondents postulated that the size of the communitymay be an asset that has facilitated the community's system building efforts. Thecommunity is not so small that it is bereft of services and resources, nor is it so largeas to be unmanageable. Rather, Stark County is a moderately sized community whichhas a respectable array of services and resources and in which human servicepersonnel tend to know one another. Respondents speculated that larger metropolitanareas may face additional challenges in creating multiagency systems of care. Themultiplicityof agencies and personnel may result in disorganization andfragmentation. From an organizational standpoint, it may be necessary to breaklarger metropolitan areas down into more manageable service areas in order tomaximize the probability of developing a cohesive, coordinated system of care witheffective services and interagency relationships. Thus, the size of Stark County maybe a factor that has facilitated system development.While the Stark County system embodies a number of noteworthy strengths, it also faces anumber of challenges which must be overcome in order to ensure continued development ofthe system of care. These include: oFunding - Most communities report that financing presents the most significantbarrier to system of care development. In Stark County, respondents related that, infact, the lack of adequate funding presents a formidable challenge to the child-servingagencies in their attempt to create a comprehensive community-based system of care.Insufficient funding to create the needed service capacities has slowed progress ashavetheconstraintspresented by inflexible,categoricalfunding streams.Respondents indicated that financing streams have not yet caught up with thechanges in philosophy and approach used in state-of-the art community-based systemsof care. While the Cluster has used creative approaches to blend funds and fundindividualized service plans for children and families, additional funding opportunitiesand creative solutions will, be needed to continue system development. The currentfiscal crisis in the State of Ohio may only serve to compound the challenge of locatingand creating financing sources for the system of care. oHuman Resource Needs - The need for qualified personnel to provide serviceswithin the system of care represents another critical challenge for Stark County.Agencies have found it difficult to recruit specialists in children's mental healthservices, particularly those who are adequately trained, and prepared, to work in50 nontraditional programs such as home-based services and case management. Thisis due partially to the limited pool of mental health professionals specializing inchildren's services as well as to the inadequate training currently provided by mostcolleges and professional schools.The community has taken some steps to address human resource needs for the systemof care. The Children's Coordinator of the Mental Health Board approached a facultymember in the Center for Family Studies at the University of Akron to discuss theneed for trained professional to provide home-based services. Their discussionsresulted in the preparation of a grant application for the development of a trainingprogram in this area. The grant ultimately was funded by the Ohio Department ofMental Health, and an interdisciplinary training program was developed whichprovides graduate level training for home-based therapists. Another step taken toaddress human resource requirements was the design and implementation of apsychology internship program at the CASC. The internship program, which isapproved by the American Psychological Association, provides a diverse set ofexperiences to interns, enabling them to develop expertise in community-based serviceapproaches. The interns augment the staff in the various CASC programs, and someare expec\"...ed to remain working in the system of care in some capacity followingcompletion of their education. Despite these activities, the need for adequate numbersof trained staff remains a challenge for the Stark County system as well as for othercommunities seeking to develop systems of care. oEducating Line Staff - The system of care philosophy, though clearly articulated andaccepted at higher levels, does not always \"trickle down\" to line workers. Thus, acontinual challenge for the community is to ensure that line workers in all child-serving agencies are well-versed in, and accept, the system of care philosophy andvalues including the collaborative interagency relationships and approach. Staffturnover at all agencies compels the process of educating line staff to be ongoing andalso compels managers to continually model and reinforce the philosophy andcollaborative attitudes. Managers emphasize that a system cannot function when aphilosophy is accepted only at administrative levels and there is merely hope that itwill filter down. Rather, conscious attempts must be made to sell the ideas at alllevels of the system until they become ingrained in the system.A difficult challenge has been to change the attitudes and approaches of staff trainedin more traditional service delivery approaches. For example, outpatient services atthe CASC have used an office-based approach, typically relying on weekly 50-minutecounseling sessions.In many communities, resistance is encountered when anattempt is made to shift to more intensive and flexible approaches. Educationalstrategies, coupled with first-hand experience with new approaches, are needed inStark County for continued change in both attitudes and priorities as the system ofcare develops. oService Gaps - Filling service gaps represents yet another challenge for the StarkCounty system of care. While there has been remarkable progress in developing aservice array in the community, respondents agreed that several types of services aresorely needed -- therapeutic foster care, crisis residential services, and services for sex51 '4A offenders. The Cluster is addressing each of these gaps and attempting to developboth strategies and resources to support the development of these services.A related, and perhaps more arduous, challenge is to increase the capacity of existingservices to more adequately meet the need in Stark County. As noted, wait lists arecommon at the CASC, and nearly all programs do not have the resources to serve allyoungsters who are eligible and in need of services. This has proven to be troublingand frustrating for the participating agencies seeking services for youngsters as wellas for the CASC managers and staff. Impending cuts in funding for mental healthand other human service funding may further exacerbate this situation, and, given thecurrent economic climate, there is little hope for major expansion in either funding orservice capacity. Thus, as the system evolves attention will be needed both to createmissing service components as well as to increase the capacity of existing services.One strategy being implemented to partially address this problem involves offeringa brief consultation service during intake. If a family situation appears to bedeteriorating, intake staff can provide one to two sessions of face-to-face consultationeither in the office or home. The purposes of such consultation include identifyingcommunity resources that can be accessed quickly and providing some crisisintervention and support. The consultation is seen as a problem-focused, directive,short-term intervention to offer some s'. ecific resources and suggestions to the familyand to assist in appropriately prioritizing children and families for the CASC waitinglist. No fees are charged to either clients or third parties for this consultation service. oFamily Support and Advocacy Groups - Stark County has succeeded in involvingparents in the system of care in mazy ways. Parents are involved in planning andmonitoring services for their own children, and parents are participants in planningand policy making at the system level through a variety of advisory entities andactivities. A significant gap, however, is the lack of parent support and advocacygroups in the county which focus on children with emotional disturbances. The needfor increased opportunities for mutual support among parents as well as the need forparent advocacy is acknowledged. However, little progress has been achieved in thisarea to date. An important challenge for the future development of the Stark Countysystem is to stimulate and facilitate the development of parent groups which mayultimately fulfill the functions of both parent support and parent advocacy. oInvolvement of All Agencies - In creating a coordinated system of care, mostcommunities encounter one or more agencies which are reluctant to participate fullyin interagency entities and activities. Care must be taken to ensure that thoseagencies which appear less committed to the collaborative efforts do not impedeprogress. In Stark County, as elsewhere, continual efforts are required to involve allchild-serving agencies, even those which may be less enthusiastic participants.One challenge in Stark County is presented by the fact that local school districts havenot been closely involved in the Cluster. The Special Education Director of theCanton City Schools has been an active and dedicated Cluster participant and hasserved as a liaison with the other 16 local school districts in the county. While thisapproach has been effective, the lack of involvement of the local districts may52t aggravate some of the relationship problems with the education system. For example,staff noted that it often is difficult to arrange for appropriate educational placementsfor youngsters with emotional problems and that some local districts resist testingchildren and paying for special education and supportive services. The moreperipheral involvement of these districts provides fewer opportunities to explore andresolve such intersystem issues. While it may not he feasible to have each localdistrict involved in the Cluster, there may be more systematic and creativeopportunities to induce closer working relationships with all of the local educationagencies. oCommunity Education - Another challenge for the system of care is to bettereducate the community about the needs of troubled children and their families andabout the work of the Cluster. Respondents indicated that while Stark County isrecognized for its progress in creating a system of care, the community knows littleabout either the progress achieved or the work that remains to be done. Publicawareness and education are needed to create a broad base of support for the systemof care as well as to generate future financial support for services. Local tax leviesremain an important source of financing for several of the child-serving systems, and,therefore, the future of Stark County's system of care may rest squarely in the handsof its citizens.While these complex challenges remain, Stark County has made substantial and impressiveprogress toward creating a community-based system of care which includes a broad array ofservices and mechanisms for interagency coordination at both the system and client levels.Respondents noted that their progress was considerably enhanced through periodic retreatsfor all participating agencies with an outside facilitator. The retreats have provided agencyexecutives an opportunity to escape from their demanding schedules and from the inevitabledaily crises which consume their attention and energy. Retreats have offered blocks of timefor planning, problem solving, and reaching agreement on key aspects of the system of careincluding its vision and goals, operating procedures, and financing strategies. The use of askilled facilitator has assisted the group in remaining focused on the critical issues and ondeveloping and following through with agreed-upon action steps. Stark County participantsasserted that the use of retreats and a facilitator could be highly significant and effectivetools in the developmental process of a system of care in any community. 53 Children's Cluster:*Stark County Interagency Vision StatementWe visualize:\"A unified system that energizes all services around each child's needs so they can realize their maxi-mum potential. This system provides positive alternatives within the community so that the child willhave the opportunity to build on his/her strengths. This system effectively supports positive familyfunctioning and nurtures children in a socially, emotionally and educationally sound environment whichpersists into adult life.\"The Driving Principles for the System of Our VisionIdentify and accept without exception all those who are in need through a proper andappropriate assessment.Child centered and individualized service with a family focus.Develop an aggressive program that wraps services around the child's/family's needs andprovides whatever services are needed. (Whatever it takes!)The community is part of the solution and not the problem.Everyone has the right to life, liberty and happiness.Parents of the youth are involved as partners in the definition of the issues as well as thesolutions.Have the least restrictive, community-based services.Have community awareness of various systems that provide services to children.The focus is on prevention and the child's and family's strengths, rather than pathology.Everyone has self-worth, and change can occur.The system of care will accept every child no matter what his or her disability with a \"noeject, no reject\" from the services philosophy.

CCO meetings are not used to discuss the issue of money, of who or what systemwill pay, any issues of blame for parents or blame between systems. It is strongly felt thatsuch negative discussions prevent creative solutions to problems. The purpose of the CCOmeeting is to develop an array of treatment, education, recreation, and living arrangementswritten into a plan which will work for the child.

CASSP Technical Assistance CenterCenter for Child Health & Mental Health PolicyGeorgetown University Child Development CenterFunded by the National Institute of Mental HealthChild and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP)July 1992 c)4, 4- s;.: INTRODUCTION This case study was developed through a project conducted by the Child and AdolescentService System Program (CASSP) Technical Assistance Center at Georgetown University.It is part of a descriptive study of local systems of care which was initiated in 1990 andfunded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Child and Adolescent ServiceSystem Program. The project has involved identifying and studying communities which havemade substantial progress toward developing comprehensive, coordinated, community-basedsystems of care for children and adolescents who are severely emotionally disturbed and theirfamilies. Individual case studies of each local system of care are the products of this effortand are intended as technical assistance resources.Systems of care for troubled children and adolescents have been of great interest over the lastseveral years. In 1982, Knitzer estimated in her seminal study, Unclaimed Children, thatof the three million children with serious emotional disturbances, two-thirds were receivingno treatment whatsoever and countless others were receiving inappropriately restrictive carebecause of the lack of community-based service alternatives. In 1986, Saxe conducted a studyfor the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress which confirmedKnitzer's findings and stated that \"Mental health problems are a source of suffering forchildren, difficulties for their families, and great loss for society. Though such problems aresometimes tragic, an even greater tragedy may be that we currently know more about howto prevent and treat children's mental health problems than is reflected in the careavailable.\"In response to these problems and to the growing number of calls for change, the NationalInstitute of Mental Health launched the Child and Adolescent Service System Program(CASSP) in 1984 to assist states and communities in developing community-based systemsof care for this underserved population. Through grants and technical assistance activities,CASSP has supported the development of interagency efforts to improve the services providedto the most troubled children and youth and their families. To provide a conceptualframework for system of care development, CASSP supported the publishing of AAystemofCare for Severely Emotionally Disturbed Children & Youth by Stroul and Friedman in 1986.This monograph has been called a blueprint for action in the child mental health field, andit describes the various service options required by these youngsters and the need for servicesacross all of the relevant child-serving agencies. From these components, Stroul andFriedman proposed a design for a \"system of care\" encompassing both the full range ofservices and the mechanisms required for the assurance of their appropriate delivery.Currently, there is widespread agreement that community-based systems of care foryoungsters who are severely emotionally disturbed and their families are needed, and thedevelopment of these systems has become a national goal.Despite the calls for such systems of care, until recently there were few, if any, examples oflocal systems of care which combined an array of community-based services with otheressential elements including interagency collaboration and case management. Today, thereis what might be described as an explosion of activity related to system of care development.The activities of CASSP, which have now involved every state, have played a crucial role instimulating system development at state and local levels. Increased attention to children's mental health by advocacy groups also has had a major impact. Further, system building hasbeen advanced significantly by initiatives such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation'sMental Health Services Program for Youth, which has provided funds for the developmentof systems of care in selected local areas, and extensive system development initiatives in anumber of states. As a result, many communities now have evolving systems of care whichcan be studied and described. Descriptions of the system building approach and experienceof these communities are designed to assist other communities which are attempting todevelop such systems.Potential sites for inclusion in this study were identified through a process of consultationwith key informants including individuals at national and state levels who have extensiveknowledge of developments in the children's mental health field and in the development oflocal systems of care in particular. Through these initial discussions, approximately 20communities were identified. These localities were characterized as having made significantprogress toward the development of community-based systems of care consistent with thephilosophy and principles which have been promoted by CASSP and which are displayed onthe following page. Accordingly, an attempt was made to locate local systems which arefamily focused, emphasize treatment in the least restrictive environment, involve multipleagencies, individualize services, and so forth. Similarly, an attempt was made to locatesystems which have moved beyond the more traditional outpatient, inpatient, and residentialtreatment services and have begun to develop a more complete and balanced array ofnonresidential and residential services including home-based services, day treatment, crisisservices, therapeutic foster care, respite care, case management and others.The second phase of the selection process involved extensive telephone interviews with arepresentative from each site to obtain detailed information about the array of servicesavailable in the community, the nature and functioning of the system level coordinationmechanisms, and the nature and functioning of the client level coordination or casemanagement mechanisms. In addition, information was collected about any special systemactivities related to such issues as financing the system, evaluating the system, involvingfamilies in planning and delivering services, and enhancing the cultural competence of thesystem of care. A chart was prepared for each potential site summarizing the service array,system level coordination mechanisms, and client level coordination mechanisms.Selection of sites for further study was accomplished with the assistance of an advisorycommittee and was based on the following set of criteria: 1.Must have a range of services in place (home-based services, crisis services,therapeutic foster care, and others).2.Must have interagency coordination mechanisms in place.3.Must have client level coordination mechanisms in place, e.g., case management.4.ist be a sufficiently well-developed local system to be able to serve as a usefulexample to the field and to receive national attention. ii CORE VALUES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.The system of care should be child-centered and family-focused, with the needs of thechild and family dictating the types and mix of services provided.2.The system of care should be community-based, with the locus of services as well asmanagement and decision-making responsibility resting at the community level. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.Emotionally disturbed children should have access to a comprehensive array ofservices that address the child's physical, emotional, social, and educational needs.2.Emotionally disturbed children should receive individualized services in accordancewith the unique needs and potentials of each child and guided by an individualizedservice plan.3.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services within the least restrictive,most normative environment that is clinically appropriate.4.The families and surrogate families of emotionally disturbed children should be fullparticipants in all aspects of the planning and delivery of services. 5.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services that are integrated, withlinkages between child-caring agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning,developing and coordinating services. 6.Emotionally disturbed children should be provided with case management or similarroechanisms to ensure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated andtherapeutic manner and that they can move through the system of services inaccordance with their changing needs. 7.Early identification and intervention for children with emotional problems should bepromoted by the system of care in order to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes.8.Emotionally disturbed children should be ensured smooth transitions to the adultservice system as they reach maturity. 9.The rights of emotionally disturbed children should be protected, and effectiveadvocacy efforts for emotionally disturbed children and youth should be promoted. 10.Emotionally disturbed children should receive culturally competent services which aresensitive and responsive to cultural differences and special needs and are providedwithout regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, physical disability, or othercharacteristics.iii0'' -4.., ti, 3 5.Should have some noteworthy activities in one or more areas including familyinvolvement, cultural competence, transition, high-risk children and adolescents,financing, and evaluation.An initial group of five communities was selected for site visits by the project team. The sitevisits generally involved spending three to four days in each community engaged in a varietyof activities designed to provide insight into the functioning of the system of care. Theseactivities included interviews with a number of individuals and groups including key systemmanagers, senior management representatives of the major child-serving agencies (mentalhealth, child welfare, education, and juvenile justice), case managers, youngsters, parents,and advocates.Additionally, the schedules included visits to three or more servicecomponents in the system of care where activities were observed and discussions held withprogram managers, staff, and, in some cases, clients. An important aspect of the site visitswas observing the functioning of interagency entities. Site visitors attended meetings ofinteragency entities focusing on system-level coordination as well as meetings of interagencyteams organized for the purpose of creating individualized service plans for specificyoungsters and their families. The site visits provided a wealth of information about eachsystem of care -- its developmental milestones, strengths, and obstacles yet to be overcome.The sample of communities studied yield valuable insights into the process of buildingsystems of care.Due to an enormous increase in system development activities incommunities across the nation, there currently are many more noteworthy examples of localsystems of care.It should be emphasized that none of the communities selected for studyhave fully developed systems of care, and all are struggling to overcome financial and otherobstacles to system development. Rather, they are communities which have succeeded inputting some basic building blocks into place and have demonstrated progress towardachieving system development goals. The resulting case studies are intended to serve astechnical assistance resources for other states and communities as they approach thechallenge of developing local systems of care for youngsters with severe emotionaldisturbances and their families REFERENCES Knitzer, J.

Ventura County's population of 670,000 has nearly doubled in the last twodecades; it is also highly mobile. The county is geographically rural, but most ofits population lives in four cities: Ventura and Oxnard (225,000 collectively) onthe west end, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks (230,000 collectively) to the east.The remaining population is scattered in numerous smaller communities andrural areas across the county.The county's diverse geography encompasses deserts, mountains, and beaches.Large tracts of land are still devoted to agriculture, but extensive newdevelopment of commercial centers, industry, and residences encroach on theneighboring fields of lush produce. Tourism has also developed along thecoastline, which overlooks the Channel Islands. Further inland, the county isringed by mountains, the Santa Monica Mountains to the south and the ruggedSan Raphael Mountains to the north.Oil and agriculture are the chief economic bases. Ventura County ranks amongthe highest in oil production in California. It is also a manufacturing area for oil-related tools. The county is a major grower of citrus fruit, vegetables, andflowers as well as a center for raising poultry.Ventura's population reflects some of California's diversity: 66 percent of thepopulation is Caucasian, 27 percent Latino, 5 percent Asian American, and 2percent African American. Less than one percent of the population is NativeAmerican, although the original inhabitants of the area were the ChumashIndians.While Ventura's medium household income of $45,612 is high, many of VenturaCounty's family incomes are at or fall below the poverty level. This is especiallytrue for minority families.Forty percent of Latino families, seven percent ofAfrican Americans and five percent of the Asian families meet this povertystandard.In mental health, as in many other arenas, California has been a leader. It wasone of the first states to decentralize public services for people with mental illnesswhen it passed the Short-Doyle Act in 1957, turning over responsibility for mentalhealth services to its 58 counties. Legislation passed in the 1980s (AB 3920, AB 377 and AB 3777) has strengthened the county role in mental health by providingincentives to counties to serve mental health clients in community-basedalternatives rather than state hospitals. In California, county governments arestrong and exert a high degree of local autonomy over services and decisionmaking. In 1992, California initiated a policy called realignment which transfersresources for health, social services, mental health, alcohol and drug abuse from the general state fund to a local trust fund. This funding mechanism willprovide counties with a greater degree of budget control and stability. Based on aformula, counties will receive funds generated from vehicle registration fees andfrom sales tax revenues. These funds can be used as local match for federalfunds.In Ventura, the following public-sector, child-serving agencies and the VenturaCounty Board of Supervisors are key players in the system of care.Mental Health: Ventura County Mental Health Department, Division of theHealth Care AgencyChild Welfare: Children's Services Department of the Ventura County PublicSocial Services AgencyEducation: Office of Ventura County Superintendent of Schools and the VenturaCounty Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA)Juvenile Justice: Ventura County Corrections Services Agency (CSA)Health: Department of Public Health, Child Health and Disability PreventionProgramBoard of Supervisors:An elected body of five supervisors that develops andimplements policy for the county.The Ventura County Mental Health Department is divided into four sections:children, adults, seniors, and acute care. A 12-member management team,made up of senior administrative support staff and the chiefs of each of thesesections, manages the operations of the Department. A mental health advisoryboard provides policy guidance to the Department. 11 BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF SYSTEM OF CARE DEVELOPMENT The history of the Ventura County system of care for children and adolescentswho are severely emotionally disturbed has been an interesting process anddemonstrates the importance of leadership at the community level, the buildingof coalitions, the \"marketing\" and timeliness of an idea, and support at the statelevel. As is so often the case, it is individuals with vision and strong leadershipabilities who have been the catalyst to producing systems change. In Ventura,the combined forces of a member of the local Board of Supervisors, who is aspecial educator, and a social worker in the Mental Health Department (now theagency's director) provided the vision and brought together the necessaryelements and support to achieve major systems change. According to the agency 24..4, 0 director, the development of Ventura's system of care for children occurred intwo phases -- from 1980 to 1984 and from 1984 to the present. The first phaseconsisted of the building blocks which led to the passage of legislationestablishing the Ventura County Children's Mental Health ServicesDemonstration Project.In the early 1980s, there was little support for children within the county MentalHealth Department. The community mental health center was a traditionalcenter, primarily serving \"whomever arrived at the door first.\" Various providers and community leaders realized that this approach was no longerviable and that a broader system of support was needed, particularly for thosechildren who were the most troubled. Too many of these youth were being sentout of county because of a lack of options in Ventura. During this time, a numberof critical factors coalesced to facilitate change and create a new agenda forserving children with severe emotional disturbance. These factors included staffchanges in the county mental health office including the arrival of the currentDirector of Mental Health (who initially was hired as a case manager); theelection to the Board of County Supervisors of a new supervisor who wasinterested in and committed to youth; an activist judge in the community; andsupport at the state level for a new direction because of rising state hospital costs.The state was particularly concerned about the increased utilization of statehospitals for youth, since it was costing $70,000 per year per child for a stay at thestate hospital. As a result, there was a mutual interest at both the state andlocal level in exploring alternatives.With state funding, the county Mental Health Department hired three casemanagers to work with those youth from Ventura County who were in statehospitals. The state mental health agency also agreed to exchange five county-designated state hospital beds for $200,000 of flexible money to provide care toyouth within the county. With those funds, the county developed a 16-bedpsychosocial reeducation program to serve as an alternative to the state hospital.At this time, 14 Ventura County youth were hospitalized at Camarillo StateHospital, costing the state a total of one million dollars. The case managersgathered extensive information on each youth and determined that nine could beserved in the community.These nine were transferred to the reeducationprogram.Based on this experience, the county mental health program concluded that agatekeeping system was needed to prevent unnecessary hospitalization anddivert youth to community placements. The staff person mentioned above whoeventually became the Director of the county Mental Health Department wasassigned to review all Ventura youth referred to, or admitted to, the statehospital. Through this admissions review process, the county gained a muchbetter understanding of the needs of youth who were being referred to statehospitals. During the period of 1982 to 1984, the state hospital census for VenturaCounty was reduced from an average census of 12 to 14 youth to 1 to 2 with noreadmissions. With an investment of $200,000 to establish the county-basedreeducation program, overall costs for hospitalization were reduced from $1million to $240,000. Another interesting side effect also occurred. Because a 3 number of the youth being referred to the state hospital were under thejurisdiction of Child Welfare, the mental health staff person assigned to reviewhospital admissions began to develop a relationship with the child welfare agencystaff. The cooperation that developed provided the foundation for the building oftrust between the two agencies.The county also learned a number of lessons from this experiment: thecommunity could serve children who are seriously emotionally disturbed; theseless restrictive services were beneficial to the child and could result in costavoidance; and the combination of benefitting children by serving them close tohome and, at the same time, saving money was a powerful marketing tool toconvince policymakers and providers that a new direction needed to be taken.During this same time period that efforts were being made to divert youth fromthe state hospital, one of the local county supervisors who had a background inspecial education was also providing leadership for reform of children's services.For a year, under her direction, the Juvenile Court judges and the agency headsof Mental Health, Probation, Social Services, the schools, and the privatenonprofit sector held regular brown bag lunches with resource experts to discussissues related to children -- what services existed in the county, the gaps inservices, the issues and problems of the different child-serving agencies, thedifferences in language and terminology used by those agencies and themandates that directed them, and who were the multiproblemed youth thesystem was failing. These lunches led to the development of the InteragencyJuvenile Justice Council and the Interagency Case Management Council.The second phase in the historical development of Ventura's system of careactually began July 1, 1985, with the implementation of a critical piece oflegislation, AB 3920, the Ventura County Children's Mental Health ServicesDemonstration Project, now referred to as the Ventura Planning Model. Thispioneering legislation, enacted in 1984, integrated the legislative intent ofnumerous other federal and state statutes addressing public mental healthservices for children as shown on the chart on the following page. AB 3920 cameabout through an unorthodox alliance between those interested in costcontainment and advocates for the improved quality of children's services. Thelegislation established a two-year demonstration project and directed Ventura todevelop a model for a comprehensive, coordinated children's mental healthsystem that could be replicated in other counties in California. The legislationwas quite comprehensive in scope, and it specified interagency planning forchildren experiencing emotional disturbances that involved all publicly-fundedagencies serving children; statutory and regulatory changes that would facilitateinteragency cooperation; interagency protocols and agreements; appropriateservices for difficult-to-place children, emphasizing services to children in theirhomes or in the least restrictive setting consistent with effecdve service delivery;and research to determine treatment effectiveness and cost-benefit. The stateappropriated $1.5 million for the first year to serve, in the community, thoseyouth who would be at risk of out-of-home placements. In effect, these dollarswere an exchange for serving youth in the county rather than paying for statehospital beds or unnecessary residential placement.4 2,;0 AB 377 Legislative Background L PL94-142, 1975 (Federal Law).

At the end of the demonstrationperiod, the governor signed a bill granting a three-year extension. With strongsupport from a broad-based coalition, AB 377 (known as the ReplicationLegislation) was enacted in 1987 to create a permanent structure for the Venturachildren's system and to extend the Ventura Planning Model to other counties.In response to a request for proposal, three additional counties were selected toreplicate the Ventura County Children's Mental Health Services DemonstrationProject: San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Riverside. In 1988, legislation was passed(AB 3777) to expand the Ventura model to serving adults.At the state level, the legislation creating the local Ventura County system of carealso requires the state Department of Mental Health to establish an advisorycommittee comprised of representatives from the state Departments ofEducation, Social Services, Mental Health, and the Youth Authority;representatives from the Conference of Local Mental Health Directors, CaliforniaCouncil oh Mental Health, County Welfare Directors Association, ChiefProbation Officers Association, School Administrators Association; and arepresentative of the service providers from the private sectors. The function ofthe group is to advise and assist the state in the development of a coordinated,comprehensive service system of care. III. PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS The philosophical underpinnings for the Ventura Planning Model, determinedin the initial developmental phase, were built into the enabling legislation andremain in statute. In the discussions that occurred between service providers,agency heads, and the community's political leadership, certain points ofagreement and principles emerged. These tenets are: 1) that it is in the public'sbest interest to enable a high risk child to remain in his or her home or to betreated in the local community, and 2) that if a child must be removed from thehome, local treatment prevents costly and restrictive residential and hospitalplacement.The premise on which the Ventura model is based is that acommunity-based, interagency system of mental health care which targets themost disturbed children will provide the greatest benefit to children, theirfamilies, and the community at the lowest cost to the public sector. By legislativestatute, the Ventura County Demonstration Project was to demonstrate \"costavoidance\" through the development of alternative in-county services.The five essential elements of the Ventura Planning Model derive from thisfoundation.They are also considered to be generic principles, rather thanspecific program examples or models, that are applicable to other communitiesorganizing systems of care. The elements also respond to the legislative mandatethat Ventura establish a system that can be replicated in other sites. These elements, specifically delineated in the legislation, include: 6 oA clearly defined set of targeted populations that include those youth whoare at greatest risk ofout-of-home placement and for whom the publicsector already has legal and fiscal responsibility; oMeasurable goals that are committed to the preservation of family unityfind locally -based treatment; oThe development of viable partnerships at the policy, planning, and servicelevel between public sector agencies, between the public and privatesectors, and between agencies and families; oThe development of collaborative program services and standards that adhere to the service philosophy of family preservation, familyreunification, and least restrictive environment -- developing service planstailored to an individual child and family and having available acontinuum of service options and settings that cross agency boundaries; oThe development of a mechanism and process for system evaluation thatmeasures client outcome and costs over time and across programs andensures system accountability.Client outcome objectives for the Ventura Planning Model are to enable youthwho are severely emotionally disturbed to remain or be reunified with theirfamilies, to attend and progress in public schools, and to not commit crimes.Program development and evaluation are geared to the achievement of theseprimary objectives. IV. TARGh i hi) POPULATIONSDetermining the targeted populations for Ventura's system of care has beencritical to the success of the program, but the very nature of defining a targetpopulation and narrowing the scope of those to be served creates controversy aswell. As noted, definition of the population is one of five essential elements of theVentura model. There are a number of important reasons for identifying thepopulation to be served. These are to ensure public agency accountability, toachieve multiagency support, to focus limited public dollars on those most inneed, and to enable program development to be appropriately tailored to thepopulation to be served.One of the first concerns was developing a definition that would be acceptable tothe multiple agencies essential to the system -- Child Welfare, Education,Juvenile Justice, and Mental Health. The first three agencies all have mandatesspecifying the populations that they have a responsibility to serve. Since MentalHealth does not have a similar mandate, these other agencies wanted to ensurethat the population targeted for the service system would include the youth these 7 agencies are required to serve. The consensus was that the priority populationsto be served by Ventura's system would include the following: oThose emotionally/behaviorally disordered court dependents whosehistories include neglect, physical and/or sexual abuse, multiple fosterhome placements, residential treatment, and psychiatric hospitalization; oThose emotionally/behaviorally disordered court wards for whom thepublic sector has legal responsibility as a result of delinquent behavior andconsequent court order who are at risk of out-of-home placement, i.e.,residential placement, psychiatric hospitalization, and/or incarceration; oThose emotionally/behaviorally disordered special education pupils who require mental health services in order to benefit from their IndividualEducation Plan (IEP); andoThose emotionally/behaviorally disordered children who are not part of aformal agency other than Mental Health and are at risk of out-of-homeplacement into state hospitals or residential treatment.The diagram on the next page depicts those groups targeted in the Venturamodel. The system's target populations are those in the shaded areas. Each ofthese target groups includes those at risk of entering that group. The numbersare projections based on the actual annual treatment caseloads for each group in Ventura County. Of the 1,700 youth designated as the target population at risk,670 are served in the system at any point in time. A total of 1,400 receive serviceseach year. Less than one percent of the children under 18 in Ventura County areincluded in the target population.While it is often desirable for policy makers to target groups for fiscal reasons, itbecomes difficult for clinicians to use those broad classifications in determiningwho of the many needy children they see should be given priority in receivingservice.Thus, since the establishment of its initial definition of the targetpopulation, a special task force struggled for over two years to define specifictarget population criteria that can be used in daily practice. Descriptions of thetarget populations and criteria for including youth are shown on pages 10 and 11.The Mental Health Department has adopted the criteria and redirected allprogram staff and resources to serve this population of severely disturbed and high-risk clients. Ventura has also implemented a target review process andprogressively discharged all nontarget clients, subject to clinical review forappropriateness. A survey of current clients indicates that more than 95 percentcurrently meet the target population criteria.This narrowing of the population to be served by the Mental Health Departmenthas raised concerns by some sectors about the elimination of early interventionactivities that could prevent youth who are at lower risk from becoming moreseverely disturbed.If services are not available to youth at earlier, criticaljunctures, critics argue, their situation may become worse, increasing thelikelihood that they will become members of the target population.

RiskChildren at greatest risk with a mental disorder should receive priority for limited tax supported localmental health services.A Governor and Legislators concerned about the future have an interest in redirecting the lives of children atgreatest risk of becoming dysfunctional adults. Studies of today's incarcerated, homeless, chronicallyunemployed, and institutionalized adults reveal childhood and school histories of severe family conflict andbreakdown, physical and sexual abuse, delinquent behavior, and school failure and dropout. In these historiesparents and teachers report unpredictable, impulsive, aggressive or destructive behavior, or depressed,withdrawn, isolated, and strange behaviors.. These patterns are frequently manifestations of severe childhoodmental disorders though few of these dysfunctional adults received any appropriate mental health treatment aschildren.Early and premature separation from the family is a critical and usually irreversible event in their lives aschildren. Bouncing between divorced parents, multiple foster home placements, residential treatmentplacements, psychiatric hospitals, state hospitals, and incarceration in juvenile justice facilities were frequentlypart of the downward whirlpool cycle for these adults. Separation from family both reflects clinical severity andadds risk to the tenuous and damaged child's hope for the future. Even necessary separation adds risks forthese children's chances to regain a place in their family, school and community.2. Legal ResponsibilityMentally disordered children with existing public agency legal responsibility should receive priority forlimited tax supported local mental health services.When government by the action of a Superior Court Judge or other Court Officer for protection or due todelinquent behavior takes legal and/or physical custody of a child from a parent,it assumes an awesome andheavy legal responsibility for that child. When a court ward or dependent has an identified mental disorder theJudge has a legal responsibility and obligation to provide appropriate mental health assessment and treatment.Under Federal Law PL-94-142, handicapped students have a right to receive an appropriate education at nocost to their parents. As part of an appropriate education special education pupils are guaranteed mental healthservices \"related\" to their education as part of their individualized education plan. This law clearly establishes alegal responsibility and obligation to provide mental health services in these instances.3. Fiscal LiabilityMentally disordered children who for lack of appropriate mental health services pose the greatestfinancial liability to the public should receive priority for the limited tax supported local mental health services.Public agency programs, including Special Education, Child Protective Services, Juvenile Justice and MentalHealth provide a continuum of services in graduated levels of restrictiveness and cost. Untreated,seriouslyemotionally disturbed children fail at less restrictive levels of service and \"graduate\" to more restrictive andexpensive levels. Foster home failures, special education class changes and failure, and probation violations,lead eventually to residential treatment placements, local and state hospital admissions, or incarceration. Taxsupported residential placements range from $25,000 to $75,000 per year, Medicaid and State psychiatrichospitals from $100,000 to $200,000 per year and incarceration about $25,000 per year.A system of less expensive local mental health services targeted to children separated or at imminent risk ofseparation with the goal of family maintenance or reunification can offset a major portion of the cost by reducingthe number of children and length of stay in 24-hour facilities. 102 :3 u- Ventura Planning Model Target PopulationsMENTALLY DISORDERED CHILDREN & YOUTHMust Have (I, II & Ill)OR (I, II & IV) OR V:I.DiagnosisDSM III-R Axis I or II diagnosis, except a primary diagnosis of PsychoactiveSubstance Use Disorder, Developmental Disorder, or V Code.

Draft Revised March 13, 1992 agreeing that this is a problem, Department leadership believes that since publicresources are not sufficient to serve everyone, resources must be targeted to thosemost in need. The definition and criteria developed are intended to guide thatdecision-making and triaging process. The rationale is that fewer people will beserved better.This strategy also can be applied successfully to developingsystems of services for other populations. Targeting the high end of the spectrumin cost and utilization may also provide justification for additional resources tosupport prevention and early intervention activities. V. ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM System ManagementVentura County has taken a unique approach to developing a system of care.The key to understanding the Ventura system is understanding the role theMental Health Department plays and its position vis a vis the other child-servingagencies. The basic concept is that mental health services are integrated into theservice systems of the major child-serving public agencies -- Juvenile Justice, Special Education, and Child Welfare. Mental health services go to where thechild is. This has not only proven to be better for children and families, but alsohas created a change in how each of the agencies carries out its work. Agenciesnow function differently even when Mental Health is not directly involved with achild.The architects of the Ventura model believed that a service system for youth mustinvolve all the major child-serving agencies and must provide an array of services that will enable youth, when appropriate, to remain in the county and intheir homes. At the same time, there was the recognition that the state has legalmandates for different youth, and the agencies charged to carry out these mandates are often limited by specific eligibility criteria, laws and regulationsdictating their responsibility to the target population. Across the country, thesemandates, while a protection to youth, have also served as barriers to developing more integrated, comprehensive service systems. The Ventura approach dealswith the realities of different agency mandates and eligibility policies.In the Demonstration Project (AB 3920), the Mental Health Department uses its fiscal and staff resources to provide the service components that would enableyouth to be served in the county in the least restrictive setting. By integratingmental health services into each system, there is less need to refer a youth to a state hospital or residential treatment center to obtain needed mental healthservices. The \"intensity\" of the service provided in the community can serve as an alternative to more restrictive placements. In Ventura, the method of interagency integration varies by service system. Roles and relationships are delineated in interagency agreements. Mental Health serves as the system's core and provides specialized services to each system -- Juvenile Justice, Child Welfare, and Special Education. These services are described in more detail below. 12 41In addition to interagency agreements which spell out joint administrative,fiscal, and service responsibilities, the Ventura County system of care is linkedthrough several key interagency coordinating mechanisms as shown in thediagram on the next page.The Interagency Juvenile Justice Council is apolicymaking body made up of all the public agency directors and the judges.The chair of the Council is the presiding judge of the Juvenile Court.TheInteragency Case Management Council is the vehicle for case resolution and theidentification of service system gaps and problems. The Case Management Council consists of agency representatives who have the authority to commitresources for each public service agency.Role of Participating Agencies oMental Health: Ventura County Mental Health Department, a Division ofthe Health Care AgencyAs indicated in the section on the developmental background of Ventura'ssystem, the Mental Health Department has undergone some significant changes in the decade of the 1980s. Initially the Department was organized under a director and reporting to him were three regionalmanagers. There was also a separate children's division that included nine outpatient therapists.The Demonstration Project, when it wasstarted, was a separate initiative with its own budget, staff, and projectdirector who reported to the Director of Mental Health. As theDemonstration Project evolved, it took on a life of its own and in some waysoverwhelmed the Department.In 1987, the project's status as a\"demonstration\" ceased.Since that time several major reorganizationalchanges have occurred within the Department. The former director of theDemonstration Project is now the Director of Mental Health for the county.The staff and programs of the previous Demonstration Project are fullyintegrated into the Department, and the outpatient children's services areconverting their mission to serving the target population. One of foursections within the Mental Health Department is now devoted to children.The Children's Section includes a Chief of Children's Services andsupervisors for Case Management, Special Education, Child ProtectiveServices, Juvenile Justice, and Outpatient Services. Staff also include amedical director and research psychologist.The Mental Health Department served as a catalyst in the development ofthe system of care and works in concert with the other child-servingagencies. As indicated above, roles and responsibilities are delineated ininteragency agreements. Interagency mechanisms exist for planningpurposes and for problem resolution. However, to understand how the system functions as a whole, it is useful to examine how Mental Healthrelates to and works with each agency individually. It is also important tocontrast the situation before and after the Demonstration Project. Theserelationships are explicated in the discussions of each of the keyparticipant agencies in the system of care. 15- the Ventura system of care, mental health staff work in settings withinEducation, Child Welfare, and Juvenile Justice. The Mental Health Department provides an intensive outpatient service and a clinically-oriented case management unit that serves as a \"broker\" to the system.Mental health staff serve as a liaison to each of the three major systemsand supervise the mental health clinical staff working in that setting.oJuvenile Justice: Ventura County Corrections Services Agency (CSA)In Ventura County there are two full-time judges for youth, dealingrespectively with delinquency cases and dependency cases. By countypolicy, judges normally rotate every two years. The Corrections ServicesAgency (CSA) operates the existing programs for youth within the juvenilejustice system. A number of these programs are conducted through theinteragency efforts of Mental Health and the Ventura CountySuperintendent of Schools.The three local institutions consist of theClifton Tatum- Center, which is the Juvenile Hall, an for pre-and post-dispositional medium facility; and the JuvenileWork Release Program, a 24-bed minimum security facility. Wards of thecourt are also sometimes ordered into \"Suitable Placement\" whichencompasses the following: residential treatment centers (out-of-county),group homes out-of-county), small family homes (in-county), and foster homes (in-county). The funding for all of the \"Suitable Placement\"services is through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).Wards of the court may also be ordered home on probation and assigned todeputy probation officers located in three main field service sites in thecounty.Approximately 2,000 youth go through the juvenile justice systemannually, with CSA providing an array of services ranging inrestrictiveness from delinquency prevention and youth services, informalprobation, formal probation, removal of youth from their homes tocommitments for a small percentage of youth to the California YouthAuthority. Although mental health services might be appropriate for avast majority of these youths, resources have been concentrated to serve thehighest risk youth, those who have the most serious delinquency historiesand also the most serious mental health problems. The cornerstone of theDemonstration Project, and still the largest program in the juvenile justicesystem, is the Colston Youth Center. Youth are committed there for four-to six-month periods. The program is operated on an interagency basiswith CSA, Mental Health, and the Superintendent of Schools. Mental health services are also provided at the Clifton Tatum Center, but these arelimited to suicide risk assessment, crisis intervention, and brieftherapeutic interactions.The limited mental health resources in thecounty have been designed to be placed in treatment settings where thehighest impact is likely to be felt. 15 Since the Demonstration Project, there have been several new additions tothe services within the juvenile justice system. One of these is the VisionsInteragency Program (VIP), a three-day-a-week day treatment schoolserving wards and dependents of the court. This is also operated on aninteragency basis with CSA, Mental Health, the Superintendent of Schools,and Children's Protective Services. In addition, the Forensic AdolescentProgram (FAP) provides long-term (approximately 18 months) outpatientservices to juvenile sex offenders. The youth might be committed for someamount of time to the Colston Youth Center, a local group home setting, orhome on probation in order to receive the individual, group, and familytherapy services provided by FAP. The FAP mental health staff alsoprovide evaluations to the court regarding the amenability of youth tojuvenile sex offender treatment.Currently there is one mental health supervisor for the juvenile justicesystem, five full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health staff at Colston, oneFTE providing aftercare services to Colston residents, approximately oneFTE providing services at Clifton Tatum Center, two FTEs at VIP, twoFTEs at FAP and three case managers. The system of care for mentallydisordered juvenile offenders is outlined in the diagram on the next pagewith bullet points designating the mental health services provided. oChild Welfare: Children's Service Department of Ventura County PublicSocial Services AgencyMental Health plays multiple roles in the child welfare/protective servicesystem as shown on the diagram on page 18. The \"Shomair\" team is thecenterpiece for the mental health component within the child welfaresystem. Shomair is the Hebrew word for guardian, mer:ning one whoprotects and watches over others.Shomair staff provide major services to children and youth who have beenphysically or sexually abused, neglected or abandoned, and who have beenremoved or are at risk of removal from their homes by the court. TheShomair team interfaces with three different facets of the Child WelfareDivision; Children's Protective Services (CPS) staff, foster families, and thechildren placed in foster care or temporary shelter care. Shomair staff consist of six mental health professionals, all of whom have developedgreat expertise in the child welfare system. The mental health staff havean office at CPS, are highly visible and available to child welfare staff, and are fully integrated into the child dependency process. Specifically, the Shomair team is involved in assessment and treatment planning, in theenriched foster care program, in collaborative foster parent recruitmentand training programs, and in the placement screening committeeprocess.All children entering shelter care (temporary foster protective custody) areassessed by the Shomair staff within 72 hours. In Ventura about 35 youthsper month come into shelter care. Assessment includes evaluation of the 16 JUVENILEHALL(Predis-position)CRISISINTERVENTIONSUICIDEASSESSMENTJuvenile Corrections developed by Dr Daniel Jordan, Systems Evaluation, Ventura County Mental Health.0 4.) charts developed by Dr Daniel Jordan, Systems Evaluation, Ventura County Mental Health. t 24: child for suicidality and depression, identification of placement andtreatment needs, crisis intervention, and provision of consultation andrecommendations to the shelter parents. This information is provided tothe CPS court worker prior to the initial dependency and jurisdictionalcourt hearings.The Shomair staff provide intensive services to about 28 children inenriched foster care. The Shomair therapist becomes the therapist/casemanager for the child andfor the entire foster family. Mental health staffcoordinate their efforts with the CPS social worker, the biological family,and school and day-care staff. They also provide follow-up care for sixmonths after the child returns home. One Shomair staff person isdedicated to working collaboratively with CPS personnel in the recruitmentof foster parents.Specialized training and support groups for fosterparents within the Shomair program are offered by this individual.In addition, mental health and child welfare staff share responsibilities indecision making in a weekly placement/screening committee.Thiscommittee, which is comprised of Shomair staff, senior CPS staff, andother appropriate agency personnel, reviews all requests for changes to amore intensive placement(e.g. to enriched foster care, a group home,residential treatment, or hospitalization). A unique placement andtreatment plan is developed for each child presented to the committee.Most children returning to less restrictive care are also presented to thecommittee for suitability and appropriate treatment/living plans when thechild reenters the community.oEducation:Office of Ventura County Superintendent of Schools and theVentura County Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA)Ventura County has 20 local school districts and one county school districtfor special populations. Each school district has its own superintendent, special education unit, and school board; the 21 superintendents fromthese school districts form a policy-making board. Each region has a coordinator for special education services who reports to this boardthrough a special education coordinating body. All the special education units are coordinated under the Special Education Local Plan Area(SELPA). There are a total of 117,000 pupils in Ventura County, and 12,000are in special education.According to school standards, 293 of thesestudents are designated seriously emotionally disturbed, but according tomental health staff, the number who are seriously emotionally disturbedmore closely approximates 500 based upon 1986 estimates.California has a unique piece of legislation, AB 3632 (Chapter 26.5), that addresses the problem of mental health versus educational and localservices' fiscal responsibility for special education students who requiremental health services as part of their Individualized Education Plan (IEP)or out-of-home placement.According to this legislation, students identified as requiring special education are also entitled to appropriate 192 mental health services, if necessary for the student to benefit from the IEP.This legislation requires that local mental health agencies provide casemanagement for children who receive residential services.Since the Demonstration Project, the relationship between Mental Healthand Special Education has changed, and, as with other key child-servingsystems, Mental Health now plays a critical collaborative role. Before theDemonstration Project, therapists in the mental health system did notknow how many or which youth served in outpatient services weredesignated as special education students. Now Mental Health is fullyintegrated into the special education process. Entry into the mental health/special education system, outlined in the diagram on the followingpage, requires assessment by both agencies. The mental health professional who conducts the assessment becomes part of the student'sIEP planning team. Through the Demonstration Project, a number ofservice options -- from least restrictive first choice service options to morerestrictive second choices -- have been developed combining staff and fundsof Mental Health and Sp6dal Education. Under the first choice, localalternative programs, youth can remain in their local schools receivingsupportive mental health services that are part of the Ventura system(such as outpatient, intensive outpatient, and in-home services) inconjunction with special education programs (such as day classes andresource specialists). Two local day treatment programs for high schooland elementary students (the Phoenix School and Elementary Program)have been established and are costaffed by Mental Health and SpecialEducation.Enhanced special day classes on regular school campuseshave also been established and are staffed by both mental healthprofessionals and special education teachers. Only those students who have exhausted all local, less restrictive options are referred to residentialprograms. These youth are placed by the mental health case managerwho works through the IEP process with the school district and family.On an administrative level, mental health management staff workcooperatively with special education managers and attend SELPAmeetings (comprised of all special education directors) for informationexchange, education, problem resolution, and service planning.oPrivate SectorOne of the essential elements of the Ventura County system is interagencycollaboration between the public and private sectors. This collaboration isaccomplished through a number of private/public sector boards, the recently established countywide Children's Commission, the ResourceDevelopment Project, and service contracts with private nonprofitagencies, particularly Interface, a private not-for-profit umbrella agencyoffering multiple child-serving programs.One of the unique components of the Ventura Planning Model is theResource Development Project, which operates a bank of goods and 20 DUEPROCESSSpecial Flow charts developed by Dr Daniel Jordan, Systems Evaluation, Ventura County Mental Health. sk i services donated to assist youth. Services include private counseling, psychological evaluations, dental services, dance lessons, and tutoring.Goods include clothing, recreational equipment, and school supplies.Their value is worth approximately $1 million. The Resource DevelopmentProject is operated and staffed by Interface, with initial start-up costs to getthe project underway supported by the United Way. A resource list ofavailable goods and services is sent to agencies monthly. Agencies, in turn, make requests for specific youth through a standardized intake form,and a match is made. More than 400 children have been served to datethrough this exchange. VL SYSTEM OF CARE COMPONENTSThrough the various targeted populations and resultant interagencypartnerships, Ventura County Mental Health's \"system of care\" is organized bythree sub-systems of care and two service modalities. The three sub-systemsinclude: Juvenile Justice, Child Welfare, and Special Education. The servicemodes that cover all of the systems are the outpatient program and casemanagement. As noted, within each sub-system is an array of services. Thechart on the next page outlines this array of services across the sub-systems.In addition to the system of core services provided in conjunction with MentalHealth, there are other services and programs offered by the major public child-serving agencies. Although Mental Health is not directly involved in all servicedelivery, the CASSP principles are evident in each agency. This section focuseson those services with which Mental Health is involved.PreventionWhile the Ventura County system focuses on the most high-risk youth, it hasundertaken a primary prevention program for young children. The Primary Intervention Program (PIP) is a school-based program modeled after the highlysuccessful and well-researched Primary Mental Health Project in Rochester,New York. It is designed to help student settle into the school environment byassisting young children (grades kiralergarten through third) who areexperiencing difficulties in peer relationships, are shy, are overly active in theclassroom, or have learning problems. The program's goals are to help childrenget a good start in school by fostering healthy self-concepts, developing socialskills, and bringing school work up to potential to prevent the need for moreextensive specialized help in the future.Once a child is accepted into the program, after screening and referral, a trainedand supervised child guidance assistant dedicates 30 minutes once a week for 12to 15 weeks to work with the child individually in a specially designed andequipped playroom. The Primary Intervention Program is funded for three yearsthrough the Mental Health Primary Prevention Fund, a fund made possible byconfiscated drug monies. It is a cooperative effort between the Ventura Countyr- -22A.!3 .ti; VENTURA COUNTY MENTAL HEALTHCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENT PROGRAMArray of Services Flexible dollars can be used across programs.

I. I Mental Health Department, the state Department of Mental Health, and theschool districts. Currently, there are four school districts and a total of 12 schoolsinvolved in the program serving 576 children. It is anticipated that in 1992-93,the program will be expanded to additional schools and another school districtresulting in approximately 672 children being served in Ventura County.Intensive Short-Term InterventionoProject Genesis is a home-based crisis service which is operated byInterface, a local, nonprofit social service agency, through a contractualarrangement with the Ventura County Mental Health Department. This intensive intervention program intervenes with families in which theemotional and behavioral problems exhibited by one or more of the childrenhave escalated into an acute crisis and out-of-home placement isimminent.Services are delivered primarily in the family's home over the course of sixweeks. In addition to the average of 12 to 15 hours per week of contact,each family is provided 24-hour emergency on-call services from theprogram and a two-week transition process into ongoing care.Theprogram, in existence since 1986, has been providing services to over 50 families each year. Referrals are restricted to acute crises where out-of-home placement is the only available option, and the intervention iscoordinated by the children's mental health supervisor in each of the child-serving sub-systems.Initial contact with the family is made by theprogram within 24 hours. oClifton Tatum Center (CTC) - Mental health services at Juvenile Hallcomprise six-day-a-week coverage for crisis intervention and suicide riskassessment.Each youth entering Juvenile Hall is assessed by thecorrections services staff as well as the medical staff, and these writtenassessments are reviewed by Mental Health. At that time, mental healthissues are identified and followed up by mental health staff. Youth on suicide status are seen daily by Mental Health. Staff may also refer youthto Mental Health, and youth themselves can request to see mental healthstaff.Mental health staff provide ongoing consultation and informaltraining to corrections services as well as to school staff at the CliftonTatum Center. Although there is no in-depth therapy for youth at CTC,due to their vulnerability at the time of incarceration and the excessivestress of incarceration, there is a great need for ongoing evaluation andsupport for some of the youth during their stay at Juvenile Hall.Outpatient ServicesoThe Options Program - Outpatient services are provided solely by theMental Health Department and are organized on a regional basis. Duringthe evolution of the Ventura Planning Model, the outpatient service systemof the Department has been dramatically changed. The hallmark of Ventura's outpatient delivery system is its integration with the other 244.r service systems and its focus on the target populations. As indicated in the diagrams on pages 17, 18, and 21, outpatient services are one of thetreatment components of the Juvenile Justice, Child Welfare, and SpecialEducation sub-systems of care. In addition, the Options Program is the primary source of entry and emergency contact for the community atlarge.Using the Ventura County functional assessment criteria shown on page11, the outpatient service staff, through a combined system of phone andin-person screening, assess the client's situation. A triage committee thendecides whether to accept the client or refer elsewhere. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of those screened are referred to other agencies orpractitioners for service. If the client is accepted for service, services could include individual and family treatment in an office setting or in theyouth's home, parent consultations, and consultation and collaborationwith other agency staff.Despite these changes in doing business, outpatient services in Venturaremain in transition. Staff struggle with turning away clients who could benefit from service but who do not meet the criteria for the targetpopulation. The number of families who are accepted for service and theextent of their needs still outstrip capacity. Administrative and service staff are grappling with multiple dilemmas: how to balance the need forincreased intervention against whether to serve more families at a lessintense rate; the optimal length and intensity for intervention; and whattypes of intervention are most effective. oForensic Adolescent Program (FAP) - The FAP program was originallyimplemented through grant funding from the state Office of CriminalJustice Planning and was designed to provide juvenile sex offendertreatment on an outpatient basis. After the three-year grant funding expired, Ventura County Mental Health incorporated the two FTEpositions into the children's mental health program. This programprovides specialized, primarily community-based treatment to adolescentson probation for \"hands on\" sex offenses. There are approximately 30 to 35 clients in the program at a time receiving treatment services, ususally for12 to 18 months. Individual, group, and family therapy are provided on aweekly basis, and the therapy approach has a strong cognitive behavioraland psychoeducational emphasis. The FAP staff also provide evaluationsto the court concerning clients' amenability to treatment, risk, andplacement needs. Not all of those youth enter the FAP program, althougha high percentage do.The mental health staff work closely with theprobation officers assigned to the individual youth.Day TreatmentoThe Phoenix Program - The Phoenix School and Phoenix ElementaryProgram are the joint Mental Health/Special Education day treatmentprograms in operation in the county. The administrative authority for the 25r,r0 1J program derives from the Superintendent of Schools and the Director ofMental Health. A record system that meets the regulatory requirements ofSpecial Education and the quality assurance standards of Mental Healthhas been established. This system has also successfully dealt with theissue of confidentiality. Phoenix School is co-administered by a principaland a mental health supervisor. A child must be identified through theP.L. 94-142process and have an IEP to qualify for the program. In addition, other classroom and school-based alternatives must be triedbefore a placement can be made in day treatment. Referrals can emanatefrom any district in the county. A mental health case manager coordinates placement and available services to meet client needs. A totalof 24 children are served at a time.The Phoenix program, which is based on an adaptive skills acquisitionphilosophy, is intensive and time-limited to one year. Each class is limitedto eight students. Education and mental health staff provide a combinedprogram of special education and treatment designed to meet theindividualized goals established for that student in the IEP. Regular teammeetings ensure a coordinated approach. Mental Health may provideindividual, group, and family therapy, crisis intervention, support, andlinkage with other services and agencies in the community. Staff meetwith families at least twice a month either at the home or at school.During the summer months an extended school program is also offered.One of the goals of day treatment is reintegration and transition back to thestudent's neighborhood school. At six months, Phoenix staff meet withstaff in the child's school district to examine the range of options for thestudent and to work out a transition plan. Three months prior to the year'scompletion, a youth may \"transition\" back to his or her school for a partialday, either to a special education or regular class. A resource specialistworks with the teacher to provide training and assistance with thereintegration.Mental Health may also stay involved with the youththrough the case management and outpatient service modalities.oEnhanced Special Day Class - These special classrooms on neighborhood school campuses offer special education and mental health services forapproximately 72 children who are seriously emotionally disturbed.Interventions for youth in these classes include the services of apsychiatric social worker, a consulting psychiatrist, and case manager;family meetings and agency liaison are also provided. In addition to thespecial education curriculum, the mental health dimension includes fourcomponents: direct therapeutic intervention (i.e. individual, group, andfamily therapy); consultation to the classroom teacher; collaborationbetween mental health, special education and regular education staff; andcoordination with other agencies. Youth assigned to these classes can participate in school activities and are often mainstreamed into regularclasses when appropriate. 26t_:t oVIP Day Care - The Visions Interagency Program (VIP) is a special schooldeveloped by the Corrections Services Agency, Children's ProtectiveServices, county schools, and Mental Health to fill a gap in the continuumof care for high-risk youth. The school operates three days a week and alsoprovides assistance with job training and job hunting. Staff from all fouragencies working at VIP are on site and available to both court dependentsand wards on a regular basis. These students attend school, have groupand individual therapy, and are involved in an independent living skillscurriculum as well as a number of recreational and community activities.There are up to 16 students on site, and students generally are in theprogram for approximately two semesters. Follow-up and ongoing mentalhealth services are provided to students upon graduation. The goal is tohelp the youth and their families stabilize so that the least restrictiveplacement can be maintained. The majority of wards at VIP come fromthe Colston Youth Center, although other youth on probation may also bereferred.Foster Care Homes and Crisis ShelterThe child welfare system includes a range of foster care options for youth incustody or undergoing evaluation. Three types of foster care homes are used inthe system: shelter (temporary protective custody), regular foster care for youthin the custody of the state, and enriched foster care. Shomair staff provide amental health component to this system. In Ventura County, an average of 35youth are referred into the shelter program per month; 325 are in fosterplacement; and an average of 28 are in enriched foster homes. oCrisis Intervention Homes - Emergency shelter care is provided for thoseyouth who have been referred to Protective Services for custody. The focusof the crisis intervention shelter care is on stabilization and assessment.Every child taken into custody is seen by a mental health worker within 72hours. The foster care parents, mental health worker, and child welfareworker act as a team to provide support, comfort, and counseling to theyouth, while at the same time assessing the child and family situation inorder to develop recommendations for the custody hearing and for futuretreatment planning. A shelter foster family may have three to four youthin the home at any one time. The length of stay in shelter care is a maximum of 30 days. For three days every six weeks, respite is providedfor the shelter parents. oMcAvoy House - In early 1989, because of a severe shortage of shelterhomes to adequately serve the number of children taken into protectivecustody, a six-bed crisis care home, McAvoy House, was established. Thishome, jointly funded by Interface and the Ventura County Children'sProject, provides a structured therapeutic environment, a setting forobservation and evaluation, and respite for children in crisis in their ownhomes, in enriched foster care, or in group homes. 1127rr-1 oEnriched Foster Care - Ventura County's enriched foster care program,also referred to as Shomair, is often called therapeutic foster care in othercommunities. The Shomair homes are part of the network of foster homesin Ventura's child welfare system, but added support is provided by mentalhealth professionals to the foster parents and child in each home. Intandem with child protective service staff, seven MSW Shomair workers (asupervisor and six therapists), all with child welfare knowledge, workwith approximately 25 foster families and the children placed with thosefamilies.Each worker has a range of four to ten cases. This staff alsoprovide the evaluation and support to the youth in shelter care and conductapproximately 35 assessments per month. A Shomair worker may becalled in to work with a child in regular foster care who is having specialdifficulty.In these cases, the Shomair worker might provide the extrasupport a child needs or recommend other treatment options.In enriched foster care, the social worker's role is \"to stick with the child\"throughout placement and to provide six months of follow-up care andsupport when the child returns to his or her family. The Shomair workervisits the foster family and child weekly to provide consultation andsupport to the foster parents, who are considered to be the child's primarytherapists. Staff are also available to families 24 hours a day on an on-callbasis.One Shomair staff person has been dedicated to recruitment,orientation, and in-depth training of foster parents. In addition, traineesupport groups for foster parents are held. Shomair foster parents receivea higher rate of pay ($702 per month) than regular foster parents, whoreceive $485 a month, to compensate for the more intensive work with thechild.oYouth Crisis Services and Cool Homes - In addition to the other foster care resources, Ventura County has both crisis intervention and emergencyshelter care for youth that are neither child welfare dependents norjuvenile court wards.Interface, through joint state and local funding,provides the Youth Crisis and Cool Home Programs as part of the county'ssafety net for children and families experiencing crisis and requiringalternative emergency shelter services.Transitional ResidentialShort-term, community-based residential care is provided to youth through themajor child-serving systems. These transitional residential programs includeColston Youth Center for youth in the custody of the Juvenile Court and SantaRosa Treatment Home.oColston Youth Center is a 45-bed, medium security, residential facility,offering a program that balances issues of treatment and security needs.A telephone screening is conducted with the investigating probationofficer, and information regarding the suitability of a youth for Colston isincorporated into the court report. Colston serves youth ages 13 to 17 whohave a lengthy delinquency history as well as a number of mental health 28 problems, family problems, child abuse, substance abuse, depression,and/or anxiety disorders. Youth are committed to Colston for 120-, 150-, or180-day periods. Each :.-)uth is assigned to an interagency treatment teamwhich consists of a social worker, a teacher, corrections services officers, apsychologist, and a probation officer. The psychologist and the probationofficer serve on all three treatment teams. Each team has primaryresponsibilityfordeveloping and implementing each youth'sindividualized treatment plan. Twice-a-week meetings of the treatmentteam help to ensure a team consensus decision-making procedure.The treatment approach is eclectic, and includes behavior modification viaa point and level system, group and family therapy, some individualizedtherapy, peer counseling, and a positive peer culture environment.Colston staff feel it is essential to have families involved, and every otherweek, families participate in family therapy sessions either individually orin a multifamily group. A high percentage of youth in the program have substance abuse problems; while no substance abuse treatment services are provided, members from Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Cocaine Anonymous come in weekly offering threesupport groups for residents. Residents may also gain access to outside support groups during their Colston stay. The general issues that all interagency staff at Colston emphasize with the residents are skillbuilding, particularly in effective communication skills, victim awareness,empathy building, community service, anger management, peer pressure,impulse control, and responsibility and accountability for their actions.The county's Juvenile Court judge views Colston as a \"transformedjuvenile correction facility,\" a preferred alternative to committing youth tothe California Youth Authority and a way to involve families.One full-time staff member is responsible for most of the aftercare forColston residents.Six weeks prior to a youth's release, an aftercaremeeting is held to develop a plan for the youth's post-release care. Theaftercare mental health staff work with the youth, the family, the school,and probation officer to ensure that the plan is carried out. If not assignedto the aftercare case manager, youth and their families may return toColston to continue services with the Colston social worker or may bereferred to the Options Program or other private therapists in thecommunity. Youth might also transition to the VIP program to receivemental health services there.oThe Santa Rosa Treatment Home, operated by Parents and Friends ofMentally Ill Children (PAFMIC) under contract with the Mental HealthDepartment, is a four-bed intensive treatment, socialization, andrehabilitation transitional residential group home serving four severelyemotionally disturbed youth, ages 6 to 18. Using a parent-teaching model,the primary goals of the program are to provide a placement alternative toadmission to the state hospital; provide a transitional program for youthexiting the state hospital, private psychiatric hospitals, and other morerestrictive residential treatment programs; pursue family reunification 29.1,-;) whenever possible by involving family members in family therapy; provideongoing family-oriented treatment planning, socialization, and rehabilitative activities; and discharge clients to a lesser level of care(foster home, family or relatives). The home is staffed by two full-time live-in parents, a one-half time social worker, and a six-hour-per-week childpsychiatrist.The children placed in the home attend public school(regular education, special education or the Department's daytreatment/special education program) and spend every other week withtheir biological family.Long-term ResidentialLong-term residential care is provided in group homes that are funded throughAid for Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care (AFDC-FC). These homes are located both in and out of the county. In California, there is tremendous concern about the alarming cost of group home placements.According to a recently published report, Ten Reasons to Invest in the Families ofCalifornia, in 1988-89, 11,100 youth were in group home placements inCalifornia, costing a total of $728 million or an annual cost per child of $31,000.Group home facilities vary considerably from those that are relatively small insize (4 to 10 beds) to those with over 100 beds. A group home facility is defined bythe Department of Social Services as \"a nonsecure, privately operated residentialhome of any capacity, including a private child care institution, that providesservices in a group setting to children in need of care and supervision, and whichis licensed as a community care facility by the department\". Through FiscalYear 1990, group homes were classified according to four models: oFamily - These homes are primarily designed to provide socialization forchildren who do not display age-appropriate social and relationship skills.Little or no psychiatric or psychological services are provided. oPsychiatric - These group homes are primarily designed to treat childrenwith diagnosed psychiatric problems. Full-time staff provide directpsychiatric services to all children in the facility.oPsychological - These are intended to treat underlying emotional andpsychological problems of children and families and to address behavioralissues. Part-time staff provide direct psychological services to children. oSocial - These homes treat children exhibiting social/behavioral problemswho do not evidence marked emotional problems. Part-time staff providedirect psychological services to some children in the home.According to the report cited above, statewide, approximately 70 percent of theyouth in group homes are placed because of parental neglect, incapacity, orabsence. The remainder are placed because of sexual or physical abuse. In 1987,70 percent of children placed in group homes resided in the homes categorized aseither psychiatric or psychological; but according to estimates, only 10 percent of 30 all children in group homes in California actually received services from localdepartments of mental health.Inpatient Care (Acct'', and Long-term)Inpatient care is seen as a last resort placement.The Ventura system isdesigned to provide a range of less restrictive options and has no adequate acutepsychiatric hospital for children and adolescents. When acute hospitalization isneeded for children, they must be placed in an adult inpatient unit with one-to-one supervision or into twocontracted beds at private psychiatric hospitals.These beds and their availability are managed by one of the children's servicessupervisors. For long-term placements, Ventura has placement slots (6 beds) atCamarillo State Hospital.Specialized ServicesThe purpose of the Community-Based Residential Alternatives (CBRA) programis to provide seriously emotionally disturbed youth and their families with flexibledollars or staff resources for wraparound services that will enable youth toremain in their communities and attend school. A case manager is integral toprogram planning andcoordinates the flexible services. Support services caninclude: respite care, enhanced supervision, behavior specialists, recreationaltherapy, a special friend, and peer support. If, for example, it is determined thata child in a therapeuticfoster home requires greater supervision than ispresently being provided, CBRA provides the mechanism for obtaining theadditional funding needed for the supervision, thereby maintaining the child inthe setting. Were this mechanism not available, the child might be moved to a=le restrictive and expensive setting. VIL SYSTEM LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS BackgroundFormal and informal mechanisms for coordination and collaboration exist at thepolicy, service planning, treatment, and case planning levels. This commitmentto collaboration originated with top leadership, but mechanisms currently are inplace at multiple levels. The structures for planning and problem resolution thathave been created, and the trust that eventually has developed from working together, have been critical elements to the system's effectiveness and continuation. The Ventura Children's Project began as a collaborative effortemanating from a member the Board of Supervisors, a juvenile judge, and theDirector of Child Mental Health making a commitment to improve services to themost disturbed children in the county. The member of the Board of Supervisors,an elected official, had the sanction and the clout to pull together the executives of the key child-serving agencies for regular meetings. These meetings, whichbegan as brown bag lunches in the office of the Supervisor, launched the 31 formation of the Interagency Juvenile Justice Council and the Interagency CaseManagement Council.System Level CoordinationoInteragency Juvenile Justice Council - This Council is the policy-makingbody of the Ventura County children's system. Its chair is the presidingjudge of the Juvenile Court, and its members represent the highest level ofpublic leadership in the county dealing with children and their families.The members include:the County Counselor, Public Defender, DistrictAttorney, Sheriff, Chief Administrative Officer of the Juvenile Court,Director of Probation, member of the Board of Supervisors, Superintendentof Schools, and Directors of Child Welfare and Rental- Health. No substitutes can serve on the Council or be sent to meetings. The Councilhas been meeting regularly since 1984; in the beginning, meetings wereheld monthly.Over the years, the focus of the Council has evolved. Early on, the emphasis was on learning about cach other's agencies and issues,building trust, and developing a system mentality. Through that process,problems and service gaps were identified. At this level, decisions could bemade and resources committed to address both agency and systemicissues.Currently, the Council still serves as a vehicle for identifyingproblems, developing interagency solutions, and working through agencyconflicts.Decision making is based on a foundation of trust and jointownership. The Council reviews all agency budgets and provides unifiedsupport to the county's youth programs. Council involvement is on both astate and local level -- interceding in state legislative and administrativeissues as well as planning and service delivery issues within thecommunity. For example, the Juvenile Justice Council played a role inadvocating to maintain the state funding formulas for foster homes, inshortening the calendar for juvenile court processing, and in creating theResource Development Project to involve the private sector and expand theresources available to county youth and families. The success of the Council can be attributed to a number of factors: the involvement of bothelected officials and agency directors; leadership committed to making theprocess work; the policy prohibiting the sending of delegates; andconsistent and regular meetings. As a result, the Council has the sanction and leverage it needs to be effective.oChildren's Commission - A countywide Children's Commission iscurrently under development. The Commission, which expands the interagency focus beyond the targeted populations to all children in thecounty, will provide a forum for involving public and private agencies atthe county and city level.oInteragency Case Management Council - The Interagency CaseManagement Council was created to enable interagency planning for thosecases that are especially difficult, i.e., where there may be a lack of 32 appropriate resources in the community or the youth may fall between thejurisdictional cracks of different agencies. The Council provides a forumfor interagency representatives to engage in problem solving around acase. Initially, the Council met every two weeks. Currently, meetings areless frequent because of improved communications between the agenciesand the availability of a wider array of services; if necessary, the Councilcan be convened in emergency situations. The agency representatives onthe Council are middle managers who have the authority to commitresources for their agency, a critical factor in the ability of the Council to function effectively.The Council membership also includes theCoordinator of Case Management. At meetings, different cases are presented, and, additionally, there may be follow-up to previouslypresented cases. Issues might include discussion of service options for anespecially troubled youth, resolution regarding which agency should havefiscal responsibility for services to a child, mediation of conflicts overagencies' legal mandates for a child, and review of cases for out-of-countyand out-of-state placements. All members of the Council are active in caseplanning and problem resolution. Every six months, the Interagency CaseManagement Council reports to the Juvenile Justice Council to identifysystem problems that must be addressed. oAgency Screening and Placement Committees - Within Child Welfare andJuvenile Justice, there are interagency processes designed to review casesand treatment plans.This review is a prerequisite for more intensiveplacement changes.The Placement Screening Committee within Children's Protective Servicesincludes Shomair staff, senior staff of CPS, group home specialists, andother key agency representatives in the child's Ile. The committee reviewsdifficult cases to determine appropriate placements. Any youth in thecustody of CPS who are being considered for Shomair enriched foster care,case management, a group home, or any more restrictive serviceplacement must be reviewed by this committee. This review is mandatory.In California, legislation (SB 14) requires that children who aredependents of the state be served in the community if at all possible; theChildren's Protective Services Agency is appointed as the guardian adlitem to implement each child's service plan.Juvenile Justice's screening process reviews children who are pendingcourt adjudication and provides recommendations to the Juvenile Courtjudge for final disposition. Mental health staff, the school principal for thecourt, and the probation officer participate in the process.Joint Services and Joint EvaluationAs noted, Ventura County has a range of services that are administered, funded,and delivered jointly by multiple agencies. These include, among others, theservices at Colston Youth Center, the Shomair team's involvement in Children'sProtective Services providing crisis intervention and enriched foster care, the 33 Phoenix School day treatment programs, and the enhanced special day classes.Additionally, the Ventura sub-systems collaborate in cross-system data collectionand evaluation. Joint evaluation activities are discussed in greater detail in asubsequent section. VIM CLIENT LEVEL COORDINATION MECHANISMS In the early 1980s, case management was one of the first activities provided by theVentura Mental Health Department to reduce and further prevent state hospitalplacement of adolescents.Currently, case management is provided by MentalHealth to youth in each of the major public child-serving agencies that are part ofthe Ventura system, as shown on the chart on the following page. While otherservice components of the Ventura Children's Project (such as Shomair, Colstonand Phoenix) may only serve youth designated as the legal responsibility of aparticular agency, the children's case managers cut across all agencies.However, not all youth in the Ventura system have a case manager. The targetpopulation for case management services includes all child welfare youth whoare receiving any service considered to be above the level of foster care (for example, enriched foster care or group homes); youth in the juvenile justicesystem who are group home candidates or have recently been discharged fromColston; youth in special education who have been referred to day treatment or anout-of-home placement; or other at-risk youth in outpatient intensive care,Genesis, crisis shelter care, the Santa Rosa Treatment Home, group homes,private psychiatric hospitals, or Camarillo State Hospital. Referrals can comefrom any agency.Court dependents and wards being considered for placement are evaluated by therespective screening and placement committees of Children's Protective Servicesor Probation. These committees assess the child's needs and make recommen- dations for services and/or placement. Case Management is an integral partnerin this process. For school referrals for assessment for day treatment or out-of-home placement, the case manager by law becomes a member of the expandedIEP team. Every child placed is assigned both a case manager and a workerfrom Special Education, Children's Protective Services, or Probation. Staff of thelatter two agencies must be involved if they have legal custody of the youth.Interagency agreements delineate both the separate and shared responsibilitiesof each of these staff.While there are some overlapping responsibilities,according to Ventura staff, duplication of services is not a problem for thefollowing reasons: \"First, the case manager brings special expertise in mentalhealth assessment, treatment, and resources. Second, since these children andfamilies often pose extremely difficult and multifaceted problems, having twoprofessionals collaborate can be extremely helpful to clients and staff.\"The case management staff consists of a coordinator, eight MSWs, and two RNs.An average caseload is 1:25, which some case managers believe is too high. Thisratio includes those cases that are active as well as those for which the casemanager is primarily providing follow-up services. 34el(:410 InterventionProject Flow charts developed by Dr Daniel Jordan, Systems Evaluation, Ventura County Mental Health. 4.,REFERRAL-OUT RESOURCES24 HOUR CARECAMARILLO STATE COUNTY M. H. CRISIS TEAM*VENTURA M. H. EMERGENCY TEAMSPROJECT GENESISSOCIAL/COMMUNITY AGENCYINTERAGENCY CASE MANAGEMENTCOUNCIL= Resources Added by theDemonstration Project Effective December 1, 1991, the children's case management team wasreorganized into three distinct, specialized subteams in order to provide betterservices to the youth in the team's caseload and to maximize interagencycoordination and collaboration with regard to the development andimplementation of the interagency service plan for each client. Historically, eachchildren's case manager had a mixed caseload comprised of children andadolescents at risk for, or already in out-of-home placement, as a result of seriousemotional disturbance and/or of court ordered placements by the dependencycourt (Child Welfare), the Juvenile Court, or the IEP team of a local schooldistrict. However, as caseloads continued to rise, it became essential that each ofthe case managers be knowledgeable about the complex regulations, policies, andprocedures of the other agencies involved with the youngsters. It became increasingly apparent that the needs of the children and their families, as wellas the needs of the other agencies, would be better served by developing small,specialized, \"expert\" teams, housed together, who would have a specializedcaseload of only child welfare, juvenile court, and special education cases. In addition to promoting the development and maintenance of specializedknowledge and expertise internally, the agencies would benefit by having asmall, knowledgeable mini-team of case managers to work with collaboratively.Joint staff meetings have begun involving these specialized case managementteams and staff of the respective agencies.The case management model in Ventura includes assessment, planning,linkage, brokering, monitoring, and advocacy. The provision of direct clinicalservice is not part of the case manager's role except in those rare cases where thecase manager is the only care provider involved. The case manager is responsible frir coordinating all the services and providers involved in a youth'slife. The case manager's relationship to and role vis a vis other agency staff, asmentioned above, is delineated in the interagency agreements negotiated betweenMental Health and the major child-serving systems. The case manager developsa plan, which is trodated every six months, with other appropriate agency staffand the family. Case management services are reimbursed through Medicaid.The case manager meets with the youth and the primary therapist at leastmonthly, sometimes bimonthly, and has regular contact with other agencypersonnel involved with the youth and family. An informal, on-call, backuparrangement enables the case manager to be available when needed in a crisissituation. The case manager is \"the constant\" in the child's and family's life -- staying with the youth as long as that youth is in the system.One of the paramount goals of the case management team is to keep the child inthe least restrictive setting.In the Ventura system, this goal is expected to achieve two outcomes: to benefit the child and family and to control the resources spent on deep-end placements. Case Management does play a gatekeeping rolein reviewing the appropriateness of moving a child to a \"more restrictive\" level ofservice.Case Management also monitors \"the big picture\" by tracking thenumber of youth in various placements and some of the more int,:nsive service modalities. The unit maintains a data base on placements and costs, and issuesmonthly reports providing this information.In addition to the weekly, client-centered, interagency staff meetings of which the specialized case management teams are a part, the entire 10-member casemanagement team meets monthly for three hours for in-service training and toreview and discuss problem cases, new policies and procedures, and systemwidestatistical information.According to the Coordinator of Case Management, in order to be effective, casemanagers must have experience and credibility in a range of settings; strong clinical skills, particularly in crisis intervention; a sense of humor; and good interpersonal skills. In Ventura, the salary range for case managers is $29,000to $39,200. IX. SYSTEM OF CARE ACTIVITIES Family InvolvementThe philosophy of the Ventura system of care is grounded in working to keep child,en at home with their families if at all possible. One of the stated \"fiveessem.ial characteristics\" of the Ventura system is the development of servicescommitted to family preservation and reunification. The Ventura system is alsodriven by a legislative mandate that states, \"Clients and families should directlyparticipate in making decisions about services and resources that affect theirlives.\"The service system is designed, therefore, to support this concept offamily- and child-centered care. Home-based services, case management, andthe other community-based programs are intended to work with and supportfamilies.Additionally, all of Ventura County's treatment requires parentalapproval in writing of both the assessment results and the actual treatmentplan's goals and objectives. Parents can appeal if differences between them anda therapist cannot be resolved.Each of the sub-systems within the Ventura system has developed mechanismsfor involving families in planning, treatment and parent support. In all the sub-systems, staff will make home visits. In Special Education, families are involvedin the IEP process and with any of the special programs serving the youth. Forexample, in the Phoenix Day School, staff meet with the student's family twice amonth, either at the school or in the home. Parents provide the school with adaily report of the child's functioning at home.In the juvenile justice system, when the youth is screened, the judge determinesthe involvement of the family. For youth in Colston, approximately 80 percent ofthe families participate in a variety of activities. Families are provided with anorientation when youth enter the program. Typically, parents and the youth participate in joint treatment sessions; the focus of treatment is often inreconciling family issues. In some cases, individualized treatment for a family 37ctip.,,xs. member is provided. There are also multifamily groups involving approximatelysix families meeting weekly. Evening hours are available to accommodate theneeds of parents.In the child welfare system, contact is encouraged between the natural and fosterparents.Shomair staff work closely with all parties and facilitate theinvolvement of parents. Reunification with natural families is the goal. If that isnot appropriate, Shomair staff help to facilitate permanency planning andplacement for the child.Cultural CompetenceVentura is committed to developing a service system that is responsive to andrespectful of different cultural groups in the community. While Ventura Countyis predominantly white, it does have a culturally diverse population -- 65.9percent Caucasian, 26.5 percent Latino, 4.9 percent Asian American, 2.2 percentAfrican American, and 0.5 percent Native American. In three of Ventura's tencities, Latinos comprise almost 60 percent of the population. This \"minority\"population in Ventura County and in the state as a whole is growing, and it isestimated that by the year 2010, 55 percent of California's population will beLatino, Asian, and African American.The Ventura County Mental Health Department recognized that to better servethis population, the agency and the system would have to undergo majorinstitutional changes. This process does not occur quickly or without resistance,but Ventura is struggling to make these changes and working on multiple frontsto do so.In 1990, the Mental Health Department hired a Minority ServicesCoordinator to work with administrators and staff to develop and implement amaster plan so that the agency and the services it provides to clients would bemore culturally competent. The Coordinator brings to this position a wide rangeof experience in education, community organization, administration, andworking with minority populations. This position involves playing a variety ofroles including staffing committees, organizing training activities, and involvingall levels of the agency in making cultural competence a priority.In 1991, a cultural competence master plan was developed which addresses fourkey areas: policy and administration, human resource development, services toclients and families, and research and evaluation. For each of these areas, objectives, activities, resources, staff responsibilities, timelines, and monitoringprocedures are delineated.oPolicy and Administration - The objectives in this area include thefollowing:Develop a mission statement which includes culturalcompetence.Develop a cultural competence master plan. 38 Develop and maintain communication with managers andsupervisors to implement objectives.Identify revenues for implementation.Develop a policy statement and performance expectations fororganizations that subcontract with Mental Health.A number of vehicles have been established and activities undertaken toaccomplish these objectives.The Minority Services Coordinator is a member of the management team which meets weekly for four hours toreview and approve agency plans. For change to take place, a commitmentis needed at the administrative level to incorporate cultural competence inthe agency's mission, policies, and procedures.The Minority Services Coordinator also chairs the Minority Services StaffCommittee. This committee is comprised of Department employees fromdifferent sections representing a variety of job classifications. A number of subcommittees have been created, although not all are currently active.The subcommittees include:Recruitment and retention,Education and training,Evaluation,Children (an interagency subcommittee), andCommunity relations and outreach.Of these subcommittees, the outreach committee is the most active. Thiscommittee has developed recommendations and strategies for improvingoutreach that consider the needs and preferences of different culturalgroups. The work of this subcommittee will play an important role in implementing some of the objectives in the master plan related to servingclients and families.Ventura County Mental Health also has established a Minority AdvisoryPlanning Subcommittee of its Mental Health Advisory Board, the body thatprovides community input to the Department. Those members of the Advisory Board who are members of ethnic minority groups comprise theMinority Advisory Subcommittee. This group has played an active role inthe overall reform of the adult system in Ventura.oHuman Resource Development and Staff Training - A number of objectiveshave been developed to enhance human resource development and stafftraining as part of the Mental Health Department's cultural competenceplan:Establish interpreter training for mental health staff.Create a mental health cultural competence resource list.Develop cultural competence certificate training.Establish a recruitment coordinator.Develop a minority staff retention program. 39% Conduct orientation and training in cultural competence forcurrent and new staff.Develop a mentor program.To date, the major emphasis in this area has centered on training, whichhas been designed as a three-tiered process. These levels include an introduction to cultural competence for management, supervisory, andline staff; cultural competence training workshops on specific topics suchas family systems, acculturation, the dynamics of difference, and mental illness within specific ethnic and cultural communities; and developmentof ethnic specialty teams, focusing on the major ethnic groups in VenturaCounty, that will serve as in-house experts.In January 1991, an initial four-day educational program was targeted atprogram managers and supervisors on what it means to be culturallycompetent. The management and supervisory staffs each met separatelyto brainstorm around obstacles to becoming culturally competent and toestablish objectives for overcoming these obstacles. A draft of the culturalcompetence master plan was developed through this meeting. Trainingsessions have also been conducted for line staff focusing on cultural self-assessment, cross-cultural communication (working with interpreters),and cross-cultural issues in counseling. Future training activities will include a program for the interagency staff involved with children'sservices and an orientation for all new employees. An introductory cultural competence handbook has also been developed. In addition to these in-house activities, Ventura County has a grant with the state toprovide cultural competence training to three other counties. The objectiveis to assist these three counties in developing their own culturalcompetence master plans.Other strategies in the recruitment and training area include thefollowing:An educational incentive training program ($24,000 annualbudget);Job announcements seeking applicants who are bilingual andhave experience working in multicultural settings; andDifferential pay for staff with bilingual skills.Efforts under development include:Establishing liaison with schools of social work and other relevanteducational programs to recruit new graduates (eight of 20students in the Ventura County University of SouthernCalifornia MSW program are ethnic minorities);Developing internships for trainees in the various disciplines;Identifying mentors to guide new staff; andInvolving staff in intensive language development programs. \" 440 AO 1 1 oServices for Clients and Families - The priority in this area has been onimproving outreach and informing the public about mental health servicesand how to access them. Different strategies for outreach and for ensuringthat services are more culturally competent have been developed for theadult and child populations served by the Department. oResearch and Evaluation - Efforts in this area mainly focus on developinga client data base with information on client ethnicity, diagnosis by ethnicity, years in the United States, and bilingual status. In addition, ethnicity of staff across divisions and classifications is tracked andmonitored. The Department's Chief of Systems Evaluation is currentlydeveloping methods to examine differential outcomes across ethnicgroups. Questions to be addressed include, for example: Are children of different ethnic backgrounds admitted to other agencies in less than anequitable distribution? Are there differential outcomes within each of theagencies across ethnic categories? Are different amounts of service givenchildren according to their ethnicity? Do the resulting outcomes vary byethnic category? Methods are being developed to compare ethnic categoryof staff with those of the clients. The Chief of Systems Evaluation and theMinority Service Coordinator are also jointly developing a methodology forassessing an agency's level of cultural competence and for planning howto improve cultural performance, based on a synthesis of the VenturaPlanning Model's five key areas and the principles of cultural competence.AdvocacyAdvocacy is an important strategy used by Ventura to focus attention on thetarget population and on system development. Ventura has effectively used amultifaceted approach to advocacy. Parent groups, the Department's AdvisoryBoard, and all the interagency mechanisms play a role in advocacy. The Juvenile Justice Council, because of its composition of agency directors, amember of the Board of Supervisors, and judges, is actively involved in advocating at the state level for adequate funding and state support of programactivities.Because the Ventura system was originally implemented as a demonstrationproject, administrative staff, key officials, and community leaders have beenhighly visible at the state level in advocating for a continued commitment to thisapproach for serving children with mental disorders. Data documenting costand client outcome information have been a critical tool in this advocacy strategy.The expansion of the Ventura concept to other counties in the state and to theadult service delivery system is a measure of the success of the Venturachildren's mental health advocacy effort. Continued funding support, despite major deficits in the California budget, represent another benchmark of success. 41\"' X. FINANCING Ventura County's system of care began with a two-year demonstration grant of$1.5 million in state funds to develop and test the costs and benefits of acomprehensive system for the delivery of mental health services to children,youth, and their families. These funds were added to existing Mental HealthDepartment funds, and the total amount was then used to reorganize servicesinto a comprehensive system of care.In addition, all Ventura County system of care programs that involve anotheragency are jointly funded and staffed. The county has leveraged dollars from other agencies using mental health dollars as an incentive to develop programsfor common target populations, including emotionally disturbed court wards anddependents, severely emotionally disturbed children in Special Education, andabused and neglected children in Social Services. These jointly-funded programsprovide community-based treatment alternatives to state hospital and grouphome placements. The assumption is that funds expended for state hospital bedsand out-of-county placement in group homes are put to better use when spent forcommunity-based services designed to keep the child in school, in the home or infoster care.The Colston Intensive Residential Program serves as an example of a jointly-funded, interagency program. This 45-bed intensive treatment program for youth adjudicated through the juvenile justice system is a local alternative to out-of-county placement. The total program budget is $1,101,500 supported by fundsfrom several agencies:$550,000 from Corrections Services,$225,000 from the County Schools ($100,000 from existing fundsand $125,000 from reallocated local funds),$326,500 from Mental Health.Financing for the Ventura County system of care is complex, involving multipleagencies and funding sources. In Fiscal Year 1991-92, mental health expenditures for children's services programs exceeded $5.7 million. The 1,991-92Childrgniagr, shown on the following page,provides a detailed summary of how these dollars are allocated to services, thenumber of full-time equivalent staff or beds, the number of clients served, and thesource of revenue. Serving a target population of approximately 1,900 childrenand adolescents, Ventura County Mental Health spends slightly more than$3,000 per child per year.A breakdown is not available of the amount of dollars every agency that is part ofthe Ventura system spends on services to children and adolescents who areseriously emotionally disturbed. However, the chart on page 44 provides the total1990-91 operating expenses for the major agencies in the Ventura County systemof care. if42 1991-92CHILDREN'S SERVICE PROGRAM & FISCAL OVERVIEWVentura County Mental Health Name LocationRevenue*FTE/BedsClientsServedMH Funds Comments TaxIGran j MedlCal Oct grant from Sch.

The revenue for children's programs has increased significantly in the last year because of the growing number of programs that are eligible forMedi Cal reimbursement. The day treatment programs have applied for Medi Calcertification and are expected to further increase revenue during fiscal year 1992-93.As noted, in 1992, California initiated a policy called realignment whichtransfers resources for health, social services, mental health, alcohol and drugabuse from the general state fund to a local trust fund. This funding mechanism is expected to provide counties with a greater degree of budget control andstability. Based on a formula, counties will receive funds generated from vehicleregistration fees and from sales tax revenues. These funds can be used as localmatch for federal funds.Recently, Ventura County's public agencies have formed a consortium to developinteragency fiscal strategies to maximize federal resources through moreeffective use of existing state and county dollars. Managers and fiscal agents from Mental Health, Social Services, Corrections, the schools, and the countyadministrative office participate in the consortium. Ventura has also beenselected by a consortium of private foundations as a site for creating interagencystrategies for increasing federal financial participation. XI. EVALUATION The legislation establishing the Ventura County Demonstration Project and AB377, the enabling legislation to continue Ventura's model system and expand it tothree replication sites, called for an evaluation of system results that willdemonstrate achievement of benefits in terms of treatment goals and costavoidance outcomes. The evaluation standards in AB 377 were negotiatedbetween Ventura staff and legislative staff. As a result of this legislative mandate, Ventura is one of the few local systems of care in the country that hascollected systemwide data and tracked costs and outcomes. The emphasis of theVentura evaluation is not based on individual service components or individualclient outcomes but rather on aggregated systemic changes.The mental health agency is responsible for collecting data from each agency andmaintaining a centralized data base. Youth are grouped and tracked accordingto the target population in each sub-system such as youth in Juvenile Justice orin Special Education. Systemwide data are collected on a monthly basis on thenumber of youth receiving a particular service and/or in placement. Follow-updata tracking target population youth over time are also collected. While it ispossible within the Ventura data collection and tracking system to track anindividuai youth's experience across agencies, this is not done primarily becauseof cost and time constraints. The focus is on systemwide indicators of success:costs to the public sector, recidivism of juvenile offenders, public school 45 SITEAnnualized Third Party Revenue Recap for FY 1991-92(Based on revenues collected through April, 1992)Ventura County Mental Health FeesInsuranceMedi-CalTotalCollectedCollectedCollectedCollectedVantura$3,397$856$265,285$269,5384=.CYNOxnard$2,297$7,872$193,994$204,163Simi$1,361$2,447$50,544$54,352T.O.$3,464$0$62,110$65,574S.

These data and findings are an important internal managementtool used for programmatic decision making and for justifying the reallocation ofresources. The data have also been essential to the political survival of theVentura system of care.AB 377 requires that, in Ventura and the other three replication sites, the total estimated \"cost avoidance\" in five categories exceeds 50 percent of thedemonstration project costs. The five categories specified are: 1) group homecosts paid by Aid to Families with Dependent Children - Foster Care (AFDC-FC); 2) children and adolescent state hospital programs; 3) nonpublic schoolresidential placement costs; 4) juvenile justice reincarcerations; and 5) othershort- and long-term savings in public funds resulting from the DemonstrationProject.These cost avoidance figures are based on estimates of what the countywould have spent if youth were placed in these various out-of-home, out-of-county, restrictive placements. Thus, through the use of such alternatives ashome-based treatment, day treatment, case management, and therapeutic fostercare, the cost of more expensive placements were \"avoided\". Cost avoidanceestimates are also based on reductions in utilization of certain placements andservices.Utilization figures are monitored over time and are compared withstate utilization data.The original goal of this project was to reduce the level of expenditure in eachcategory of expense. Now that the system has become fairly stable, the goal hasshifted to maintenance of lower expenditure levels. This is a complicated task,since efforts to maintain reduced costs compete with a burgeoning populationand inflationary pressures that drive up expenses such as group home costs. Anew evaluation report by Jordan and Ichinose, to be published in 1992, describesthis maintenance evaluation and updates the outcome measures.Cost avoidance outcomes for the original project, which was intended to reducecosts, are shown on the chart on the following page. The percentages are basedon the ratio between the estimated cost avoided and the total project costs.The Ventura Project met the treatment goals required by AB 377 as summarizedin the discussion that follows:oA 47 percent reduction in out-of-county court ordered placements ofjuvenile justice wards and social service dependents. The number of out-of-county court ordered placements of those youth in the custody ofJuvenile Justice and Social Services actually declined 47 percent,exceeding the 20 percent goal. The monthly average was 77 youth duringthe first quarter of the project, September 1985, and 41 during the quarterending June 1980.oA statistically significant reduction in the rate of recidivism of juvenileoffenders participating in the Ventura Demonstration Project. A total of183 juvenile offenders with a mental disorder have participated in theColston program. As of September 1987, 81 had been reincarcerated for at 47 Cost Avoidance Outcomes: AB 377 Required the TotalCost Avoidance to Exceed 50 Percent of Project Costs Group home costs paid by Aid to Families withCostsAvoidedPercent ofProjected Costs(81.528.265) Dependent Children-Foster Care (AFDC-Pa $410,77526.9%Child and adolescent state hospital programs. $415,71827.2%Non-public school residential placement costs. $109,2297.2%Juvenile justice reincarcerations. $160,02010.5%Other short- and long-term savings in publicfunds resulting from the Demonstration Pro-ject: AB 3632 Placement Cost Avoidance. $ 78,1305.1% Total Short-& Long-Term Cost Avoidance $1,173,87276.9% 48 least one day which, according to Ventura officials, is a reduction of 56percent. The total number of incarcerations across all offenders was 372 prior to admission to Colston and 178 post discharge, a 52 percentreduction.Finally, the difference in the total days of incarcerationdecreased from 7,632 to 5,346, a 30 percent decline. All three indices exceedthe required 20 percent reduction. oA 68 percent reduction in the rate of state hospitalization of youth from thebaseline fiscal year 1980-811eveL In 1980-81, Ventura had an average dailycensus (ADC) in the Camarillo State Hospital of 8.9 children and adolescents. During a seven-year period, the ADC has been 2.8 youth,representing a 68 percent reduction. The AB 377 reduction goal is 25percent. Data from 1985 to 1988 show an increase in the ADC, but project staff believe this is related to the rapid population growth in VenturaCounty. In 1980, when Ventura's population was 529,000, the ADC was4.7. By 1988 the population had grown to 637,000; the ADC that year, whencorrected for population growth, was 3.9, 56 percent below the 1980-81baseline.oA 21 percent reduction in out-of-county nonpublic school residentialplacements of special education pupils. This reduction exceeds the AB 377goal of 10 percent.oForty (85 percent) children at imminent risk of placement who have beenserved by the intensive in-home crisis treatment program have remainedat home at least six months. This exceeds the goal of keeping at least 50percent of the children home for six months. oSignificant gains in school attendance and academic performance of youthtreated at the Phoenix School. Attendance in the Phoenix School wastracked from January 1986 to June 1988. Out of a possible 6,451 days ofattendance, pupils attended 5,710 or 88.5 percent. The students' attendance rate prior to their participation at Phoenix is not available, but55 percent of the pupils had histories of truancy and nearly all hadattendance problems. All pupils entering and leaving the Phoenix Schoolreceive an academic evaluation using the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery. Based on chronological ages, the students should beat an average grade level of 9.6 years at entry to Phoenix. They had actuallyachieved an average grade equivalent of 6.3 years, 3.3 years behind theirpeers of a similar age. These youth had been gaining an average of .66 academic years for every actual school year. After one year at Phoenix,these students reached a grade equivalent of 7.9 academic years, a gain of1.6 academic years and a 242 percent increase in the rate of academicprogress over the students' previous gain per calendar year.Project staff also believe that a case can be made for long-term cost savings andbenefits if youth can stay out of the welfare, criminal justice, or psychiatrichospital systems and become productive members of society. Stabilizing and 49et.'1-el maintaining youth in their community provide hope for the future lives of thesevulnerable youth.Research is being conducted on the Ventura County Project and the threereplication sites -- San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Riverside Counties -- by theInstitute for Mental Health Services Research and the Department of Psychiatryat the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Three interrelated childservices research projects studying multiple dimensions of the implementationof California's model system of care are underway. These research projectsrepresent a collaborative effort between public agencies and an academicinstitution and are funded by federal, state, and private foundation resources.The California Department of Mental Health is funding a five-year study, knownas the California AB 377 Evaluation Project, which since 1989 has been collecting and analyzing data from the four sites. The National Institute of Mental Healthis also funding the UCSF Institute to conduct a longitudinal study of clinicalincidence and prevalence of mental disorder, service utilization, and costoutcomes within two of the AB 377 counties, San Mateo and Santa Cruz,comparing findings with a control county, San Francisco. The third studyinvolves an evaluation of the Family Mosaic Program in San Francisco, one ofthe sites of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Mental Health ServicesProgram for Youth.The project goals for the AB 377 evaluation include assisting the CaliforniaDepartment of Mental Health in the establishment of performance criteria,assisting the counties in data collection efforts, monitoring programperformance, and collecting and integrating data from multiple state and countysources. Data collected and analyzed come from secondary sources provided bycounty and state agencies. Although individual client data are included in thesedata sets, no individual data are directly collected by the research team.According to UCSF researchers, the available data sets contain excellent cost andservice utilization variables but include only the most basic individual outcomedata.In response to the legislative mandate, the AB 377 Evaluation Projectcollects data on four system of care performance criteria: ensuring that thetarget population is being served as intended; reducing the reliance on restrictivelevels of care especially state hospitals and group homes; reducing the likelihoodof rearrests for youth in the target population in the juvenile justice system; and,improving educational performance of the target population in school settings.In the Ventura Mental Health Department, efforts are underway to develop aclient outcome evaluation system. An instrument called the \"Personal Profile\"has been developed as part of Ventura's state-funded adult and seniorsdemonstration project.Evaluation staff have designed a computerized datasystem measuring basic areas of a client's life. The concept of this approach isbeing expanded to the children's service system. Once in place, the children's\"Personal Profile\" will provide ongoing, trend information in such areas asliving arrangements, school performance, and health status.Data and Bindings from these multifaceted studies should provide valuableinformation on a number of significant dimensions related to the system of care 502`. .; approach. Few other states and communities have put as many of the criticalelements together to undertake such a systematic evaluation -- the collaborationbetween the public and academic sectors, the expertise of the research staff, the systemic measures, the data collection mechanisms, the cross-systemscollaboration, and the funding support for such research. XIL MAJOR STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES Major StrengthsThe Ventura project has served as a leader and forerunner for the developmentof local systems of care for children and adolescents who are severely emotionallydisturbed. When many national experts in the children's services field weremerely talking about the need for a new approach to serving troubled childrenand families in this country -- an approach that would involve interagencycoordination and collaboration, a comprehensive array of services, andcommunity-based care -- Ventura was working to operationalize these concepts.The country has learned a great deal from the Ventura experience. A number ofinitiatives, including CASSP and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's MentalHealth Services Program for Youth, have looked to Ventura for guidance in thedevelopment of local systems of care. States and communities across the countryhave studied the Ventura Planning Model in their own efforts to develop systemsthat are appropriate to their environments.The Ventura experience is not only about creating a system of care; it is aboutcreating systems change. Ventura staff have tremendous knowledge about whatit takes to change systems and to implement a system of care. They have hadover eight years of experience in building trust, testing assumptions, andrestructuring institutions. They have been successful, because the strengthsVentura has developed dovetail well with the crucial elements necessary forsystems change. These critical elements include the following:oLeadership - The importance of leadership cannot be underestimated.Ventura has demonstrated an understanding of the value of obtaining andfostering multiple sources of leadership to develop a power base of support.Much of the credit for Ventura's success is due to the vision, leadership,and skill of the current Director of the Ventura Mental HealthDepartment, who has been involved with Ventura Mental Health since theearly 1980s.However, he could not have been successful in creatingsystems change without strong support from other key leaders -- inVentura County, this meant the Board of Supervisors and the judges.Individuals from both these arenas were willing to take risks and bringothers together to explore ways to serve youth differently. Leadership andsupport at the state level, in the legislature and the California Departmentof Mental Health, were also essential to make the necessary legislative andadministrative changes to enable the state and county to move in newdirections. 51 In addition to leadership at the top levels, strong leadership at the agencylevel is also critical to implementing a good idea. Ventura has worked toencourage and sustain leadership at this level as well. When the former Director of the Children's Demonstration Project took over the director'sposition of the Mental Health Department, a key staff member, who hadbeen involved in the early stages of Ventura's development, assumed theleadership of the children's system, continuing to provide able directionand continuity in carrying out the mission. Other agency staff inmanagement positions have also provided stability, competent leadership,and vision.oVision and Clarity of Goals - The Ventura project has had a strongphilosophical underpinning and vision from the outset. The message isclearly stated; it is consistent; and it makes sense. The core value forVentura is that a community-based, interagency system of mental healthcare which targets the most disturbed children will provide the greatestbenefit to children, their families, and the community at the lowest cost tothe public sector. This mission statement and the essential elements of theVentura model drive all the activities of the system and, over time, havepermeated all levels. While there have been some pressures to broaden thepopulation or focus less on costs, Ventura has remained steadfast to itsgoals. oPlanning - The leaders of Ventura understand planning and are highlyskilled strategic planners. They believe in and have operationalized aplanning model to achieve goals for mental health care reform. ThisPlanning Model includes defining a vision, targeting the populations to beserved, determining the outcomes to be achieved, establishing what mentalhealth services are needed to enable the target population to achieve theseoutcomes, determining what resources are necessary to provide theseservices, forming coalitions to garner these resources, and collecting datafor evaluation, system accountability, and marketing purposes. Venturahas been consistent in its dedication to implementing these strategies.oMeaningful Collaboration - From the outset the Ventura mental healthstaff was committed to working with other child-serving agencies. Mentalhealth staff physically go to or work in these agencies and become part ofthe environment and culture of these service systems. Staff of Mental Health, Special Education, Child Welfare and Juvenile Justice worktogether as teammates. Not only do they collaborate around clients, butthey share discussions at the water fountain or over lunch. There are goodlines of communication and a high degree of mutual respect and trust.There are also numerous mechanisms at multiple levels that provide aforum for discussion and problem solving -- the Interagency JuvenileJustice Council, the Case Management Council, and the variousinteragency screening committees. A number of individuals mentionedthat as a result of this experience with interagency collaboration, \"The 52 whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.\" Staff admit they couldnever return to the old way of doing business oDedicated Staff - The Ventura project has changed how mental health staffprovide treatment, and, for the most part, staff have demonstrated awillingness to make changes. They are believers in the vision. Theyunderstand system issues and are committed to collaboration. They aresecure in their talents andabilities and are comfortable with theuncertainty that change often brings. oService Array - By leveraging resources, reallocating dollars, and blending funds across agencies, Ventura has been able to expand the servicecontinuum to include an array of community-based services including home-based services, case management, therapeutic foster care, daytreatment, and specialized services through the Resource Development Project and CBRA. Having this range of treatment alternatives enablesthe system to be responsive to youth and families and makes the system\"work\" for agencies trying to obtain services for clients. oLegislative Mandate - One of the strengths of the Ventura system is itsstatutory sanction.Many of the critical elements of the system --articulating the vision, defining the target population, requiringinteragency agreements, and requiring the measurement of outcomes --are established in law. This mandate gives Ventura the political and legalclout to implement its system of care and institutionalizes the concept of aninteragency, community-based system of care. oEvaluation Capability and Successful Outcomes - Because Ventura wasstarted as a demonstration project and mandated to document costavoidance and successful outcomes, it has set up an evaluation andtracking system which enables the mental health agency to collect dataand report progress in achieving objectives. From the outset, Ventura hashad a capable, competent research staff to establish and implement thisevaluation system.This system for tracking system accountability andclient outcomes has been enormously valuable in documenting systemicimpacts and in justifying this approach to service organization anddelivery. Ventura leadership believes that the data showing cost savingsand client benefits are the reason for the system's survival in difficulteconomic times.Without this evidence, a new wave of legislators andpolitical leadership might easily have terminated the project in search ofdifferent solutions.Instead, the Ventura system has become a model forthe state and has been expanded to include the adult mental health servicesystem.Ventura leadership maintains that outcome data are aprerequisite for any system, for future decision making, and for politicaland financial survival.oCultural Competence - Ventura has made a major commitment toimproving cultural competence, developing a master plan, hiring staff towork with the county in implementing this plan, conducting specialized 530 tr- training of staff, and undertaking numerous other activities to improveservices to minority groups.While many activities spelled out in the master plan are just being initiated, Ventura is on the cutting edge in thisarea and is taking a leadership role.oTarget Population- While Ventura has received its share of criticism forstrictly liniiting the population it services, system leaders are convincedthat having a clear definition of who is to he served with limited publicdollars and establishing criteria for assessment are absolutely essential tothe success of a system of care. The target population dictates the servicesto be developed and the outcome goals to be achieved.Continuing ChallengesWhile Ventura has made major progress in developing a system of care and hasachieved many milestones of success, it continues to face challenges andproblems. oContinued Funding Support - California, like many states, is experiencing major deficits. Budgets for services are being cut back and agencies arehaving to serve an increasing population in need with diminishingresources.oResistance to Change- As noted, the Ventura staff, for the most part, haveembraced change and are ardent supporters of reforming the system. Butopposition to change exists. Revamping the outpatient service to serve onlythe targeted populations and to provide treatment that is radically differentfrom a traditional community mental health center approach has been a struggle. The process is still underway, and staff are still learning how toreorganize and reconceptualize outpatient services to fit in the new system.oService Development- The continued development of community-basedservices and the determination of which services are most needed to fill thegaps represent a continuing challenge. Different parts of the system viewthe gaps and the needs from varying perspectives. Child welfare personnel see the need for more foster homes; the judges and probationofficers are concerned about crowding in juvenile facilities. Other servicegaps include a lack of crisis intervention, substance abuse services, andprevention and early intervention. Certain services such as home-based and case management could be expander .1 there were more adequate resources.oFamily Involvement- How to meaningfully involve families and respectthe decision making of families around appropriate care for their children is an ongoing struggle for Ventura, as it is in other communities. Thereare situations in which Ventura's system's goals to serve a youth close tohome with community-based services and supports may conflict with theparents' assessment of what is best for the child. In these cases, Ventura staff work with families to review treatment options, taking into 54 consideration parents' concerns. Ultimately, it is the parents' decision. Also different sub-systems relate to families in different ways. Forexample, there are occasional conflicts between Shomair workers,protective services staff, and foster care parents in decisions to reunify achild with natural parents.However, because of the level of trustestablished and effective lines of communication, these differencestypically can be worked through. Ventura could also benefit from increased parent involvement on the interagency bodies and in thedevelopment of support groups. oSystems Issues - Even given Ventura's efforts to break down systembarriers through interagency agreements, joint funding and decisionmaking, and policy level negotiations, bureaucracies do not always work inthe most expeditious ways. Legal mandates, court delays, burdensomepaperwork, turnover of the Juvenile Court judges, and barriers to usingMedicaid for incarcerated youth all represent problems brought up by staffof the various agencies in Ventura.These are problems confronting many communities trying to establishcommunity-based systems of care. Because Ventura has been a leader in undertaking systems reform, this county will continue to be in the spotlight to seehow it addresses these complex issues, thereby serving as a guide to others.40xi' I. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES Leadership and staff of Ventura County have played an active role in providingtechnical assistance to multiple constituencies and have generously shared theirknowledge and experience in developing a community-based system of care.Staff have presented at numerous national meetings and conferences; conductedsite visits for a wide range of officials including federal, state, and localadministrators, providers, and foundations; and provided consultation to statesand communities upon request. Ventura has also developed a wealth of materials summarizing and describing various aspects of their system. Staff work closely with other California counties and with the state to assist inreplication of the Ventura model. (j55 BIBLIOGRAPHY Attkisson, C.C., Dresser, K.L., & Rosenblatt, A.

The project has involved identifying and studying communities which havemade substantial progress toward developing comprehensive, coordinated, community-basedsystems of care for children and adolescents who are severely emotionally disturbed and theirfamilies. Individual case studies of each local system of care are the products of this effortand are intended as technical assistance resources.Systems of care for troubled children and adolescents have been of great interest over the lastseveral years. In 1982, Knitzer estimated in her seminal study, Unclaimed Children, thatof the three million children with serious emotional disturbances, two-thirds were receivingno treatment whatsoever and countless others were receiving inappropriately restrictive carebecause of the lack of community-based service alternatives. In 1986, Saxe conducted a studyfor the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress which confirmedKnitzer's findings and stated that \"Mental health problems are a source of suffering forchildren, difficulties for their families, and great loss for society. Though such problems aresometimes tragic, an even greater tragedy may be that we currently know more about howto prevent and treat children's mental health problems than is reflected in the careavailable.\"In response to these problems and to the growing number of calls for change, the NationalInstitute of Mental Health launched the Child and Adolescent Service System Program(CASSP) in 1984 to assist states and communities in developing community-based systemsof care for this underserved population. Through grants and technical assistance activities,CASSP has supported the development of interagency efforts to improve the services providedto the most troubled children and youth and their families. To provide a conceptualframework for system of care development, CASSP supported the publishing of A System ofCare for Severely Emotionally Disturbed Children & Youth by Stroul and Friedman in 1986.This monograph has been called a blueprint for action in the child mental health field, andit describes the various service options required by these youngsters and the need for servicesacross all of the relevant child-serving agencies. From these components, Stroul andFriedman proposed a 'design for a \"system of care\" encompassing both the full range ofservices and the mechanisms required for the assurance of their appropriate delivery.Currently, there is widespread agreement that community-based systems of care foryoungsters who are severely emotionally disturbed and their families are needed, and thedevelopment of these systems has become a national goal.Despite the calls for such systems of care, until recently there were few, if any, examples oflocal systems of care which combined an array of community-based services with otheressential elements including interagency collaboration and case management. Today, thereis what might be described as an explosion of activity related to system of care development.The activities of CASSP, which have now involved every state, have played a crucial role instimulating system development at state and local levels. Increased attention to children's '-' ' mental health by advocacy groups also has had a major impact. Further, system building hasbeen advanced significantly by initiatives such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation'sMental Health Services Program for Youth, which has provided funds for the developmentof systems of care in selected local areas, and extensive system development initiatives in anumber of states. As a result, many communities now have evolving systems of care whichcan be studied and described. Descriptions of the system building approach and experienceof these communities are designed to assist other communities which are attempting todevelop such systems.Potential sites for inclusion in this study were identified through a process of consultationwith key informants including individuals at national and state levels who have extensiveknowledge of developments in the children's mental health field and in the development oflocal systems of care in particular. Through these initial discussions, approximately 20communities were identified. These localities were characterized as having made significantprogress toward the development of community-based systems of care consistent with thephilosophy and principles which have been promoted by CASSP and which are displayed onthe following page. Accordingly, an attempt was made to locate local systems which arefamily focused, emphasize treatment in the least restrictive environment, involve multipleagencies, individualize services, and so forth. Similarly, an attempt was made to locatesystems which have moved beyond the more traditional outpatient, inpatient, and residentialtreatment services and have begun to develop a more complete and balanced array ofnonresidential and residential services including home-based services, day treatment, crisisservices, therapeutic foster care, respite care, case management and others.The second phase of the selection process involved extensive telephone interviews with arepresentative from each site to obtain detailed information about the array of servicesavailable in the community, the nature and functioning of the system level coordinationmechanisms, and the nature and functioning of the client level coordination or casemanagement mechanisms. In addition, information was collected about any special systemactivities related to such issues as financing the system, evaluating the system, involvingfamilies in planning and delivering services, and enhancing the cultural competence of thesystem of care. A chart was prepared for each potential site summarizing the service array,system level coordination mechanisms, and client level coordination mechanisms.Selection of sites for further study was accomplished with the assistance of an advisorycommittee and was based on the following set of criteria: 1.Must have a range of services in place (home-based services, crisis services,therapeutic foster care, and others).2.Must have interagency coordination mechanisms in place.3.Must have client level coordination mechanisms in place, e.g., case management.4.Must be a sufficiently well-developed local system to be able to serve as a usefulexample to the field and to receive national attention. iiI CORE VALUES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.The system of care should be child-centered and family-focused, with the needs of thechild and family dictating the types and mix of services provided.2.The system of care should be community-based, with the locus of services as well asmanagement and decision-making responsibility resting at the community level. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE SYSTEM OF CARE 1.Emotionally disturbed children should have access to a comprehensive array ofservices that address the child's physical, emotional, social, and educational needs.2.Emotionally disturbed children should receive individualized services in accordancewith the unique needs and potentials of each child and guided by an individualizedservice plan.3.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services within the least restrictive,most normative environment that is clinically appropriate.4.The families and surrogate families of emotionally disturbed children should be fullparticipants in all aspects of the planning and delivery of services.5.Emotionally disturbed children should receive services that are integrated, withlinkages between child-caring agencies and programs and mechanisms for planning,developing and coordinating services.6.Emotionally disturbed children should be provided with case management or similar mechanisms to ensure that multiple services are delivered in a coordinated andtherapeutic manner and that they can move through the system of services inaccordance with their changing needs.7.Early identification and intervention for children with emotional problems should bepromoted by the system of care in order to enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes.8.Emotionally disturbed children should be ensured smooth transitions to the adultservice system as they reach maturity.9.The rights of emotionally disturbed children should be protected, and effectiveadvocacy efforts for emotionally disturbed children and youth should be promoted.10.Emotionally disturbed children should receive culturally competent services which are sensitive and responsive to cultural differences and special needs and are provided without regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, physical disability, or other characteristics.iii 5.Should have some noteworthy activities in one or more areas including familyinvolvement, cultural competence, transition, high-risk children and adolescents,financing, and evaluation.An initial group of five communities was selected for site visits by the project team. The sitevisits generally involved spending three to four days in each community engaged in a varietyof activities designed to provide insight into the functioning of the system of care. Theseactivities included interviews with a number of individuals and groups including key systemmanagers, senior management representatives of the major child-serving agencies (mentalhealth, child welfare, education, and juvenile justice), case managers, youngsters, parents,and advocates.Additionally, the schedules included visits to three or more servicecomponents in the system of care where activities were observed and discussions held withprogram managers, staff, and, in some cases, clients. An important aspect of the site visitswas observing the functioning of interagency entities. Site visitors attended meetings ofinteragency entities focusing on system-level coordination as well as meetings of interagencyteams organized for the purpose of creating individualized service plans for specificyoungsters and their families. The site visits provided a wealth of information about eachsystem of care -- its developmental milestones, strengths, and obstacles yet to be overcome.The sample of communities studied yield valuable insights into the process of buildingsystems of care.Due to an enormous increase in system development activities incommunities across the nation, there currently are many more noteworthy examples of localsystems of care.It should be emphasized that none of the communities selected for studyhave fully developed systems of care, and all are struggling to overcome financial and otherobstacles to system development. Rather, they are communities which have succeeded inputting some basic building blocks into place and have demonstrated progress towardachieving system development goals. The resulting case studies are intended to serve astechnical assistance resources for other states and communities as they approach thechallenge of developing local systems of care for youngsters with severe emotionaldisturbances and their families.

OVERVIEW OF THE PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS Since the landmark publication of Unclaimed Children (Knitter, 1982) by the Children'sDefense Fund, considerable effort has been made to improve services for children andadolescents with serious emotional or mental disorders and their families. Through thefederal government's establishment of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program(CASSP) in 1984, there has been a substantial increase in the awareness and understandingof the needs of these children and families. CASSP was created by Congress with theunderstanding that: 1) the current service system was fragmented; 2) children who neededto be served were being =red for in all sectors of the service system including mental health,child welfare, special education, and juvenile justice; and 3) the children with the most severeproblems were being served under the aegis of a single public agency while their serviceneeds actually spanned several systems (Lourie & Katz-Leavy, 1992). The goal of CASSPwas to improve the way in which children and adolescents with or at risk of developingserious emotional or mental disorders and their families were offered multiagency services.Stroul & Friedman (1986, 1988) presented a conceptual framework for a \"system of care,\"encompassing the full range of services and the mechanisms required for the assurance oftheir appropriate delivery. In this monograph, the first core value was that a \"system of caremust be child-centered, with the needs of the child and family dictating the types and mixof services provided.\" The importance of tailoring services to the specific needs of the childand family was further emphasized in one of the 10 guiding principles for the system of carewhich stated that \"children should receive individualized services in accordance with theunique needs and potentials of each child, and guided by an individualized service plan.\"Thus, the concept of individualizing services was very much a part of the original \"system ofcare\" philosophy. While the concept of individualizing services has been widely accepted asa basic premise for systems of care, the actual power and potential of this approach has beendeveloped during the past eight years, beyond anything imagined in 1986.It should be noted that, even before 1986, certain aspects of individualizing service planningwere being implemented by practitioners. 'Within particular service components, be itoutpatient therapy, day treatment, or therapeutic foster care, for example, many clinicianshave always tailored the service to meet the needs of each child and family\" (Friedman,1988). Additionally, the push to expand the range of community-based services within thesystem of care was based on the recognition that more options needed to be available toadequately meet the unique needs of different children and families. Home-based services,day treatment, therapeutic foster care, crisis services, respite care, and others are among theservices that communities are adding to their systems of care. Intensive case managementis one service that is increasingly being utilized to individualize services. Intensive casemanagers with small caseloads work to customize services for each youngster and have \"theindependence, the knowledge, and the creativity to insure that an individualized plan isdeveloped and implemented\" (Friedman, 1988). 1 k U Another evolving aspect of individualizing services has been the provision of funds or staffresources in a flexible manner that permit\" case managers to \"wrap services around\" theneeds of children and families rather than require them to fit into existing programs(Friedman, 1988). The term \"wraparound\" was coined in North Carolina (Behar, 1985), andthe approach has rapidly expanded to numerous states and communities throughout thecountry. This approach permits a case manager, treatment team, or service program to addnew services, both traditional and nontraditional, specifically designed for individualyoungsters and/or families to enable them to achieve the goals specified in a customizedservice plan.The approach is most successful when applied in a flexible and creativemanner. Although a similar type of individualized service approach has been successfullyapplied in the developmental disabilities field as part of deinstitutionalization efforts, it isrelatively new in the field of children's mental health.In order to clarify these new developments, and to consider their relationship to the conceptand philosophy of a community-based system of care, it is proposed that \"individualizedservices\" be viewed as both a philosophy and a process. As a philosophy, individualizedservices are based on six underlying values: focusing on an individual child and family;providing services in the most normalized environment; establishing a partnership withfamilies; using a strengths-based, ecological orientation; ensuring cultural competence; andproviding unconditional care. As a process, individualized services are based on four keystrategies or approaches: interagency collaboration, case management/care coordination,wraparound services, and flexibility of funding and services.Philosophy and ValuesThe philosophy and values underlying individualized services are very similar to thephilosophy for a system of care described by Stroul and Friedman (1986), which specifies thatsystems of care should emphasize the provision of services that are comprehensive,individualized, coordinated, provided in the least restrictive environment, involve families asfull partners, and culturally competent. Many communities currently are basing theirdeveloping systems of care on these values and principles. Within this overall value system,the individualized care approach emphasizes six major underlying values: oFocus on an Individual Child and Family - The first underlying value is thatindividualized services, as the designation suggests, are applied to one child andfamily at a time.This approach allows the creation of a service plan which isdesigned specifically to address the unique needs and strengths of each child andfamily. Tannen (1991) described the approach as highly child and family centered,with the goal of empowering each child and family so that they can effectively managetheir lives. Burchard and Clark (1990) stated that individualized care involves a\"total commitment\" to serve each child and family on an individual basis and toprovide services for as long as there is a need. Thus, rather than only focusing ongroups of youngsters within the confines of a specific agency or program, the focus inthe individualized care approach is on meeting the needs of one child and family ata time.oServices Within the Most Normalized Environment - A second value emphasizesproviding services within the most normative environment. All activities and services2 in the individualized care approach are geared toward enabling youngsters to remainin the least restrictive, most normalized environment and to live as normal a life aspossible. The first option, always considered most preferable, is to enable the childto remain within his or her own family. If this is not possible, all efforts are made toenable the youngster to remain in the community in a family or family-like setting.Therapeutic foster homes often are the treatment environment of choice for youngsterswho cannot reside with their own families or supported independent living for olderadolescents. This value is based upon the strong beliefs that youngsters should residewith their families or in family settings and that intensive treatment services caneffectively be provided within these normative environments. VanDenBerg (1991)defined normalization as supporting lifestyles as similar as possible to the youngster'speers and emphasized that services and resulting lifestyles should be as culturally,ethnically, and age appropriate as possible. oPartnership with Families - Inherent in the individualized care approach is thenotion of creating a partnership with families. Since the entire process depends uponaddressing the child and family's needs in a holistic manner, it would be impossibleto plan and implement individualized services without a close collaborativerelationship with the family. Individualized services are dependent upon parentinvolvement during all phases of services delivery, including participating on theinteragency service planning/treatment team, developing the individualized serviceplan, and monitoring and evaluating progress. As noted by Tannen (1991), the childand parents are included in every phase of individualized services and they are alwayslistened to and treated with respect by professionals. oStrengths-Based, Ecological Orientation - Using a strengths-based, ecologicalorientation represents another underlying value of individualized care. A thoroughassessment of the child and family's strengths, needs, and desires forms a basis forthe development of an individualized intervention plan. While traditional assessments tend to emphasize pathology and service needs, assessments furindividualized care emphasize the child's and family's assets as well as their deficits.As stated by Olson, Whitbeck, and Robinson (1991), the strengths-based orientationallows the child and family to be seen as individuals with unique talents, skills, andlife histories as well as having specific unmet needs. This orientation recognizes thefact that even the most troubled youngsters and stressed families have strengths,assets, and coping skills that can be built upon when creating an interventionapproach. Further, the strengths-based assessment is not limited narrowly to theental health domain, but takes an ecological approach to consider the child andfamily across all environments and life domains, including residential, family, social,educational, vocational, medical, psychological, legal, safety, and others. Thisstrengths-based, ecological perspective not only drives the assessment, but becomesthe key factor in the development of the individualized service plan for the child andfamily. oCultural Competence - Cultural competence is the fifth underlying value ofindividualized services. The need for culturally competent services was recognized asthe system of care concept was developed; one of the guiding principles specifies thatchildren should receive culturally competent services which are sensitive and 3 responsive to cultural differences and special needs. While there has been discussionof the need for culturally competent services (Cross, Bazron, Dennis, & Isaacs, 1989;Isaacs & Benjamin, 1991), progress in this area has been slow. Individualizedservices, focusing on one child and family at a time, are uniquely able to take culturaland ethnic factors into consideration as the service plan is developed. VanDenBerg(1991) emphasized the importance of ensuring that services are culturally, ethnically,and age appropriate. The application of this value in planning and implementingservices is facilitated by the strengths-based, ecological assessment, which allows theinteragency service planning team to learn about the child's environment prior toplanning and delivering services. The incorporation of cultural competency into thisassessment of strengths, needs, and design of the service plan means that efforts aremade to learn about cultural and ethnic issues which impact on the child and familyand to understand and respect their values. The value further implies that providerswork closely with referral agencies to ensure that children of color are appropriatelyidentified and referred for cervices. oUnconditional Care - The final value of individualized care is that of unconditionalcare. This value has two primary components -- an inclusive intake policy and apolicy preventing punitive discharge. An inclusive intake policy specifies that noyoungsters may be rejected or found ineligible for individualized services on the basisof the severity of their presenting problems. Thus, youngsters are eligible for servicesno matter how serious, complex, or difficult the problems. The second aspect ofunconditional care holds that, once a youngster is found eligible for services, a long-term commitment is made to the child and family, and the providers do not give upon the child no matter what the child may do to jeopardize that commitment.Adherence to the value of \"no punitive discharge\" means that no youth is dropped,discharged, or ejected from services due to challenging or disturbed behaviors or otherneeds. Rather, the commitment of unconditional care obligates the providers to do\"whatever it takes\" to ensure that the youth receives clinically appropriate serviceswithin the least restrictive setting. Providers reconfigure services to meet crises andchanging needs rather than dismissing youngsters or referring them elsewhere.Burchard (1988) noted that the commitment to unconditional care breaks the cycleof rejection that so many troubled youth experience.The origins of this value can be traced to Browndale, an agency which was foundedin the 1960s in Canada and which provided group home services based upon thephilosophy of unconditional care (Dennis, 1992). Kaleidoscope, founded in Illinois in1973, adopted this philosophy of unconditional care, further defining it to mean both\"no reject\" and \"no eject\" from services. Kaleidoscope's founders and staff were determined to stick with the youngster no matter where he or she ended up. If theyouth ended up in juvenile corrections or in jail, they would follow the youth there,and they would be there to offer support when the youth was released. This underlying value became a critical factor in hiring staff; a conscious effort was madeto select only providers who believed in this kind of commitment and couldaccommodate to the flexibility such a commitment required. Unconditional care hasbecome a cornerstone of individualized services and is a basic tenet of mostindividualized care efforts. 4INV In describing the Alaska Youth Initiative, Dowrick (1988) wrote \"the reap reason thatthis works, the real key, is because someone takes the responsibility; someone stopsthe buck. There must be somebody who is in the position to say, 'Yes, we will takecare of these children, no matter what they do. If they try to kill themselves, try tokill each other, if they are sexually promiscuous, destroy things, set fire to buildings,assault one another, or generally drive people up the wall, we will take care of themnonetheless. One person will take responsibility' We will not say, 'This person hasa learning disorder, therefore, we can't deal with him.This person has mentalretardation, that's not our population. This person is sixteen, she's too old. Thisperson has a criminal record, that's for juvenile justice, and so on.' We won't pass thischild around anymore. We will take care of this child.\"Several illustrations of the underlying philosophy and principles of individualized serviceswere presented by the Director of Kaleidoscope in Chicago at the First National WraparoundConference held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Dennis, 1992). He first described the case of\"Allen,\" a youth presenting serious and complex problems for whom Kaleidoscope successfullyprovided care using an individualized approach.Allen was a young 16-year-old juvenile who had been rejected from several residentialtreatment centers. He was now being rejected from a correctional setting where he wasconsidered too difficult to handle after tearing a door off an isolation cell. Everyone thoughtthat he was incorrigible. Yet no matter where he was placed, no matter how far from hishome and neighborhood, it was noted that his mother faithfully visited him twice a month.Based upon the strength of this apparent relationship, Kaleidoscope designed anindividualized service plan for Allen.Despite the fact that she was extremely devoted to this son, Allen's mother was adamantlyopposed to his return home; in fact, her state caseworker also counseled her not to let Allencome home. Undaunted by Allen's mother's resistance, Dennis prevailed upon her sense ofhospitality to let him come in and play \"a little game.\" This game was: \"If he could wave hismagic wand, what would it take for Allen to be able to come home?\" If she would just do thisfor 10 minutes, then Dennis would leave and not return. Eager to get rid of this uninvitedvisitor, Allen's mother agreed to participate.With each wave of the wand, Allen's mother came up with another condition for her son'sreturn:oSomeone to come to their home and get Allen up for school;oSomeone to be with Allen in school to help him control his temper;oA therapist who wouldn't be afraid or give up on Allen even if it meant having acompanion sit in on each session to help control Allen's violent outbursts;oSomeone to give her a few fr' -z hours of time each day when she came home fromwork; andoA 24-hour crisis plan for evening, weekends, and holidays to ensure her safety whenAllen became agitated.Allen returned home the following week, but this time his mother had the support servicesshe had helped to design. There were still crises, but they were anticipated, and everyone 5 3 had agreed in advance how they would be handled. Ultimately, Allen was able to move intotransitional community housing and participate in a supported work program.This vignette illustrates a number of the underlying values of individualized services --focusing on the needs of one child and family, providing services in the most normalenvironment (the child's home), forming a meaningful partnership with families, and buildingan intervention plan using a strengths-based orientation. The Kaleidoscope staff knew thata major strength in this family was Allen's mother's love for him, but also knew that sheneeded meaningful support services if she was going to be able to cope with him. A programof support services was tailored to meet Allen's individual leds and those of his mother. Itwas designed around the strengths of both the youngster and his family, and it enabled himto return to his home and community.Dennis also presented an important illustration of the need for another value ofindividualized services -- the incorporation of cultural competency into the assessment ofstrengths and needs and into the design of the service plan. Nancy, a six-year-old NativeAmerican girl, had recently moved into a new school away from her traditional tribal home.She was found regularly stealing from her schoolmates. Her teacher and the administratorsof the school, wbo really cared for Nancy but had no knowledge of Native American customs,felt that she was becoming more and more depressed as the stealing continued. Theyrecommended that she be placed in a residential treatment center. However, in a lastattempt to understand Nancy, a Native American who is an expert in the area of culturalcompetence was enlisted as a consultant. He immediately knew that Nancy did notunderstand the concept of individual ownership. In her culture, material possessionsbelonged to everyone under a belief in shared ownership among her tribe -- children playedwith a toy at one house and left it at the next. This, of course, did not necessarily rule outthe possibility of depression. It does, however, point out the importance of understanding thevalues and customs of the people and the need to constantly question our own assumptionsand consult others who possess the necessary knowledge when in question.In another reference to cultural competence, Dennis pointed out the pitfalls of removingchildren from their own communities and natural support systems and underscored the needto take the time to learn about another's culture. To illustrate this point, he described a tallAfrican American young man who had spent the first 14 years of his life living in CabriniGreen, considered the most depressed and dangerous housing project in America. He wasnow returning to his birth community after spending the last three years in a residentialtreatment center far removed from his natural surroundings. When Dennis asked what hisfavorite sports were (expecting him to reply basketball due to his height), he responded thatthey were fencing and polo. These were the sports he had been exposed to in the very well-meaning residential treatment center, but they were not skills which would be useful to himin an urban environment. In addition, he had no community skills, no street smarts. He hadlost all contact with his family and friends and had lost his community support system.ProcessAs noted, individualized care can be viewed as both a philosophy and a process. The processof individualizing services includes four major features: interagency collaboration, casemanagement/care coordination, wraparound services including an array of traditional and 63 nontraditional services, and flexibility of funding and services. It should be noted that theseprocesses which characterize individualized services are the same processes which shouldcharacterize an effective, community-based system of care (Stroul & Friedman, 1986). Theindividualized care approach has further developed these processes and shown how they canbe systematically applied to meet the needs of each child and family.oInteragency Collaboration - Interagency collaboration, the first of these features,appears to be an indispensable aspect of providing individualized care. In a recentnationwide survey of 15 different programs based on the individualized servicesapproach, MacFarquhar and Dowrick (in press) asked the question, \"What singlefactor contributes most to the success of your program?\" The largest percentage ofrespondents (42 percent) indicated that an interagency team was the most importantfactor in the program's success. Of the programs surveyed, 93 percent used aninteragency collaboration approach, based upon the use of some form of interagencyservice planning/treatment team. Programs using a team approach reported thatdecisions about service delivery were made as a team. Several communities workedon a two-tiered team approach. A youth-specific team was responsible for serviceplanning and implementation, and a higher-level interagency team of some typereviewed more complex cases, approved unusual service or funding arrangements, andfocused on system-level issues related to servicedelivery and interagencyrelationships. In addition, many states utilize a state-level interagency team to focuson broad system and policy issues related to service delivery and, in some situations,to review and resolve cases which cannot be resolved at the local level. It is theinteragency youth-specific team that has been adopted almost universally byindividualized service programs across the country.The team approach appears to be helpful in a number of different ways. Morecomplete information is obtained about the child and family since contributions aremade by all involved parties, not just one or two agencies. Greater resources maybecome available by combining the staff and services of multiple agencies, and theworkload and responsibility for time-consuming and complex cases are shared amongmultiple agencies.Further, the creativity and energy of the group process areharnessed in planning for the child. A time-limited case conference format may beutilized to maximize utilization of staff time and to keep committee members focused.The benefits of using an interagency team were noted by Friedman (1988) when hewrote that, \"First, by convening a team of individuals who are knowledgeable aboutthe child, including parents where possible, the likelihood of having a completeunderstanding of the child is enhanced. Second, since the individuals on the teammay all be involved in implementing the service plan, the meeting is useful inproviding all with an opportunity to give input and in gaining everybody's support forthe plan.Third, the process of creative treatment planning can be facilitated byhaving a group of individuals with different perspectives rather than just one or twopeople.\" In addition, Burchard and Clark (1990) wrote, \"Having an interdisciplinarycare team allows for tracking services across agencies and makes individualized careeasier to implement. It promotes shared cwnership and makes it less likely that anindividual or an agency will act without consensus. Communication is a criticalfunction of the interagency team.\" An additional benefit is that team participantsmay begin to think more broadly about the functioning of the system of care in a community and often may initiate system improvements based upon their interactionsrelative to the needs of individual youngsters. Further, as team members becomemore familiar and comfortable with the process of individualized services, they oftenbring these concepts back to their own agencies and begin to apply them to otherpopulations, for example, to other youngsters in the juvenile justice system who maynot have severe emotional disturbances (Hernandez, 1992). In LaGrange County,Illinois, the education system has taken the initiative to implement individualizedservices with interdisciplinary teams and flexible funds to keep youngsters in thecommunity. oCase Management/Care Coordination - In all systems of care, some form of casemanagement or care coordination plays a critical role in planning, orchestrating,monitoring, coordinating, and adjusting services. Behar (1991) proposed that clinicalcase management is the \"key to systemic success\" in a complex system of services byvirtue of providing consistent advocates for the client and family and by coordinatingand monitoring all services throughout the course of treatment. Behar (1985) alsostated that \"Case management, in its most positive sense, has emerged as: (a) theelement of planning and coordination that has combined the workings of all agenciesconcerned with the child, (b) the energizing factor that has propelled the service planinto the reality of service delivery, and (c) the case advocacy strength that hassustained a commitment to each child and an optimism about each child's capacity tochange.\" For individualized services, case management plays an especially crucialrole.The case management/care coordination function has been described by a number ofdifferent terms. Young (1987) put forth a model of therapeutic case advocacy anddescribed its usefulness in creating \"an individualized system of care\" for each childwith an emotional handicap and his or her family. North Carolina describes aprogram of clinical case management (Behar, 1991), and the Alaska Youth Initiativerefers to an individualized services coordinator, also sometimes referred to as a youth-specific services coordinator, a family assistance coordinator, or a local coordinator.The Vermont New Directions Program, which is supported through a grant from theRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, refers to this concept as therapeutic casemanagement.While there is a diversity of terms to describe this function, it is clear, nevertheless,that some form of intensive case management plays an integral part in mostindividualized services for children with serious emotional or mental disorders andtheir families. In a number of sites, the case manager is responsible for conductingthe ecological assessment and for bringing this preliminary work to the first meetingof the interagency team. In most cases, the case manager performs a facilitative rolewithin the interagency team throughout the process of developing an individualizedplan of services for a specific child and family. The case manager is then responsiblefor ensuring that the plan is implemented and that appropriate coordination acrossagencies occurs. The case manager also makes sure that mechanisms are in place toensure frequent communication and to identify the need for changes in the plan if itis not meeting all of the life domain needs of the child or family, preferably beforecrises occur. 80 oWraparound Services - Individualized services draw upon all available resourcesfor children and families -- formal and informal, traditional and nontraditional. Theprocess of individualizing care incorporates the concept of wraparound services as anintegral feature. Behar (1986) outlined a rationale for setting aside \"flexible\" dollarsto pay for nontraditional services which often are needed to help troubled youthremain in the community and participate in traditional service programs. gais anexample, wraparound funds could be used to pay for respite services to give stressedparents a break, to allow a youth to pay apartment-related expenses, to enroll inrecreational activities, and to purchase otherwise unavailable items and servicesimportant to maintain a specific child in his family or surrogate family in thecommunity. The concept of wraparound services currently is applied more broadly toconnote the creative combination of all types of services, resources, and supportswhich are needed by a youngster and family.The International Initiative on the Development, Training, and Evaluation ofWraparound Services (1992) defines wraparound services as interventions which are\"developed and/or approved by an interdisciplinary services team, are community-based and unconditional, are centered on the strengths of the child and family, andinclude the delivery of coordinated, highly individualized services in three or more lifedomain areas of a child and family.\" As described by Burchard (1988), the underlyingfoundation of wraparound services \"is to identify those children that are the mostseverely emotionally disturbed and wrap services around them to facilitate theiradjustment in the mainstream.\" A thorough, ecological assessment, completed by thecase manager and interagency team, is used as the basis for identifying strengths andneeds and for developing an individualized service plan which addresses all lifedomains and which includes both existing services and other services and supportsdevised in response to specific needs.MacFarquhar and Dowrick (in press) reported that all programs responding to theirsurvey had the flexibility to design services and supports beyond traditional mentalhealth programs. They provided some examples of wraparound services purchasedwith flexible dollars including hiring foster parents with an apartment on theirproperty which would allow a youth to move back and forth between foster care andindependent living as necessary and buying an auto part needed for repairs to providetransportation to therapy for a youth and family. Other examples consisted ofproviding a paid friend to supervise a youth in the community in order to promotesocialization; providing a hotel room with supervised staff until appropriate placementas available after discharge from a psychiatric hospital; and purchasing a washingmachine for a family whose child had enuresis. Programs across the country haveused flexible dollars to wrap services around the child and family in areas includingfamily support and sustenance, therapeutic services, school-related services, medicalservices, crisis services, independent living services, interpersonal and recreationalskill development, vocational services, and reinforcers. The types of services andsupports that can be provided to a child and family through this approach areconstrained only by the limits of the creativity of the case manager and participantsof the interagency service planning/treatment team. 9 Thus, in addition to capitalizing upon and utilizing existing services and programswithin the community's system of care as appropriate, individualized service plans areenriched by the addition of wraparound services which are used to ensure that theindividualized service plan is able to appropriately address all of the child's lifedomains. It is the creative combination of services and supports of all types for a childand family which characterizes the individualized service approach and whichenriches a system of care, tremendously increasing its capacity to help troubledchildren. oFlexibility of Funding and Services - The fourth essential feature of the processof individualizing services is flexibility--flexible funding and flexible care.Individualized services cannot be provided without flexible funds which can be usedto purchase or create the services specified in the individualized intervention plan.The concept of flexible funding requires that the money for purchasing the servicesfollow the child in that it is available to serve the child regardless of the program thechild is in. \"In terms of logistics this is the linchpin of individualized care. In orderto provide care that is unconditional, child-and-family centered and flexible, it isessential that money is attached to the child for the purchase of services and not toa program for the delivery of services\" (Burchard & Clarke, 1990).According to MacFarquhar and Dowrick (in press), this change in the way funding isconceptualized reflects a primary principle of individualized care. Monies are attachedto each child to develop services and supports, and funding of services can be shiftedas the treatment plan changes. Although flexible funding is considered anindispensable feature of individualized care, a substantial proportion of the programsincluded in MacFarquhar and Dowrick's survey (25 percent) indicated that fundingis the most significant problem they face. The reported problems lie in acquiringadequate funding to provide individualized care as well as in the ability to use fundsin a flexible manner Many states and communities currently are experimenting witha variety of approaches to flexible funding. Strategies include creating a pool ofblended funds from the various child-serving agencies which can be accessed by casemanagers and/or interagency teams to pay for in -ividualized intervention plans.Additionally, an increasing number of service programs across the country (such ashome-based service, day treatment, therapeutic foster care, and other programs.) arebudgeting various amounts of flexible funds to purchase wraparound services andsupports for participating youngsters and families.Not only should funds be flexible, but services themselves must be flexible under anindividualized care approach. \"Flexible care requires services which can arrive whenneeded and then be increased and decreased in intensity, based on the needs of thechild and family\" (Burchard & Clark, 1990). Children with serious emotional ormental disorders move in and out of programs on a frequent basis and their needs canfluctuate markedly on a weekly or even daily basis. If services are tl be tailored totheir needs, it is critical that the case manager have the resources and the authorityto respond in a timely and flexible manner. Flexible care is based on the ability tochange the service plan as frequently as necessary. In the individualized approach,if the child and family's needs are not being met, the service plan is changed ratherthan expelling or rejecting the child. Implicit in the commitment to provide flexible100: services is a commitment to do whatever it takes to meet the needs of the child andfamily over the long-term.The Alaska Youth Initiative has developed a strategy to ensure flexibility of servicedelivery involving a weekly assessment by case managers of how well the individualchild's and family's needs are being met. The program has developed a ProactiveClient Tracking System (PCTS), which consists of a weekly subjective assessment ofa child's adjustment by each adult team member and relevant service providers. Ifit appears that the child's needs are not being met, the case manager can immediatelyconvene the interagency treatment team to readjust the individualized service plan.If a shift in the plan needs to be made before the team is able to meet, expenditurescan be changed with an authorizing signature of any two team members. Thisprocedure provides a systematic way to prevent or at least reduce the frequency ofunanticipated crises, to rationally plan for needed changes in services, and also torespond quickly when crises do occur. Such flexible response mechanisms are builtinto most individualized service programs. II. OPERATIONALIZING INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICES In order to implement individualized services, decisions must be made in a number of keyareas including: how to define the target population; how to organize and utilize interagencyservice planning teams; how to fulfill the case management/care coordination function; howto conduct assessments, plan, and provide services; and how to finance individualizedservices. Each of these issues is discussed below.Defining the Target PopulationThe individualized service approach has been used extensively by many states andcommunities as a mechanism for facilitating the return of children from out-of-stateresidential treatment settings. During the mid to late 1980s, several states launched initiatives to bring youngsters home from such out-of-state placements, relying uponintensive, individualized services in the community as the alternative. For example, 39youngsters were returned home from out-of-state facilities through the Alaska YouthInitiative (AYI); individualized services were used in Arkansas to return 47 youths from out-of-state placements. Reportedly, neither state has placed additional youngsters in out-of-state facilities in subsequent years. A number of additional states have, or are currently inthe process of, utilizing the individualized service approach to return children who have beenreceiving treatment in out-of-state settings.As the potential of individualized care has become more apparent, many states andcommunities have begun to expand its use to a broader population than children in out-of-state residential care.Based upon a review of eligibility criteria across a range ofcommunities, it appears that such criteria typically require that candidates for individualizedservices have a serious emotional or behavioral disturbance, functional impairment, andmultiagency involvement. Two additional criteria appear to be most salient in definingcandidates for individualized care: 110 oYoungsters placed in, or at risk for, placement in out-of-community residentialtreatment settings, andoYoungsters with complex and difficult problems whose needs are not being met withinthe framework of the existing service system.Virginia, for example, specifies that a child may receive interagency individualized servicesif the child has emotional and behavioral problems and currently is in or at imminent riskof entering purchased residential care. Another eligibility criterion specifies that services fora child must be unavailable, inaccessible, or beyond normal agency services or routinecollaborative processes across agencies. Similarly, AYI guidelines indicate that referral forAYI services should be based upon the caseworker's assessment that the generic servicesystem in the youth's community has been exhausted, and as a result, the youth is judgedto be at high risk for a placement outside of the community or out of state. In Washington,intensive community support projects, which use an individualized service approach, focuson the most visible cross-system children who have few options and are most likely to beremoved from their homes and communities.West Virginia also targets youngsters who are referred for, or at imminent risk for, out-of-home placement and whose service needs are so complex and unique that they cannot be metthrough the typical referral process. The Vermont New Directions Program has designatedfour target groups to be phased in for services in order of priority: 1) children and adolescentsalready in out-of-state placement; 2) children and adolescents at risk of, or already in, out-of-home placements within the state; 3) children requiring multiple services who have beenreferred to the local or state interagency team to resolve problems; and 4) finally, all otherchildren with serious emotional disturbances requiring multiple services.These criteria suggest that individualized services are being provided to those youngstersconsidered the most difficult to serve. This observation is confirmed by data collected byMacFarquhar and Dowrick (in press) indicating that programs were serving youngsters withmultiple and severe problems which have a profound impact on their lives, and whoseprognosis is for long-term care and services. In the programs they surveyed, 71 percent ofthe youngsters being served were receiving special education, and 64 percent were in statecustody. Further, across programs the youngsters had an average of four prior psychiatrichospitalizations, some extremely long-term, and an average of seven failed residentialplacements.Despite the high level of maladjustment among this client population, therespondent programs reported that these youth were successfully served with individualizedservices and that only a small percentage of youngsters were considered \"too risky\" to servein the community. Tannen (1991) also noted that, in Vermont, some of the most difficultchildren have made remarkable progress through individualized care.While states and communities have tended to target a subset of youngsters with emotionaldisorders for individualized care, it is important to note that all youngsters could benefit frommore individually tailored service approaches. A goal for many systems of care is to increasethe population of youngsters targeted for individualized services as well as to ensure that allservice programs within the system of care are provided in a more flexible, individualizedfashion. 12 Using Interagency Service Planning/Treatment TeamsAs noted, Mac Farquhar and Dowrick (in press) found that interagency collaboration was thefactor most frequently chosen by respondents as leading to the success of individualizedservices. In fact, 93 percent of the programs surveyed used an interagency team approachto providing services. This interagency team approach most often involves the creation of ateam, which is specific to each youth and family and which is composed of the persons mostinvolved and influential in the child's life. This team typically is organized by the casemanager and includes the parents and the youngsters themselves, depending upon their agesand maturity levels. VanDenBerg (in press) specified that the team should include, at aminimum:oThe parent and/or surrogate parent (i.e., foster parent, therapeutic foster parent, orguardian);oIf the child is in custody, the appropriate representative of the state (social worker orprobation officer);oA lead teacher and/or vocational counselor;oIf the child is in mental health treatment or should be in mental health treatment,the appropriate therapist or counselor;oA case manager or services coordinator (a person who is responsible for ensuring thatthe services are coordinated and accountable);oAn advocate of the child and/or parent;oAny other person influential in the child's or parent's life who may be instrumentalin developing effective services, such as a neighbor, a physician, a relative, or a friend;andoThe child, unless to do so would be detrimental to the development of the child.The group may be expanded to include other professionals who are serving the child or whowill potentially receive the child in a program. Such teams have been given a wide range oflabels including service network, individual support team, interagency treatment team, coreservices team, family assessment and planning team, family service planning team,community support team, creative community options team, and others. Despite the widerange of labels, the role of the interagency service planning/treatment team is remarkablyconsistent across states and communities. With the case manager playing a facilitativeleadership role, the team meets and works together over time to develop and implement acomprehensive, individualized service plan for the youngster and family. The plan developedby the interagency team generally is holistic and addresses all of the child's life domainsThe team meets as needed to monitor progress and to reconfigure the service plan andapproaches based upon the child's changing needs. The team may meet more frequentlyduring early phases of service delivery as the plan is being developed; subgroups may meetat times to resolve emerging problems. Thus, the emphasis for interagency serviceplanning/treatment teams is on reaching consensus among the various participants on thecomplement of services and supports needed by the child and family and on working togetherto design, provide, monitor, and revise the package of individualized services and supportsas changing needs dictate.In some communities, an interagency team with a standing membership is used as the focalpoint for planning and implementing individualized services. This standing team may be 13 ^rte comprised of a core group of regular members who are supplemented by persons involvedwith the particular youngster under consideration at the time. Florida's family serviceplanning teams, mandated statewide, are examples of standing interagency groups which aresupplemented with individuals specific to the youth under consideration for purposes ofdeveloping and implementing an individualized service plan.An alternative approach adopted by an increasing number of communities involves organizinga multitiered system of interagency collaboration which separates client-level functions fromsystem-level functions in the community's system of care. Washington State, for example,uses an interagency coordinating mechanism (ICM) comprised of administrators of each ofthe child-serving systems to provide system-level coordination. For each child, an individualsupport team is constituted to develop and adjust individualized \"tailored\" services (Olson,Whitbeck, & Robinson, 1991).In Vermont, child-specific interagency treatment teams are used to develop individualizedplans for children.If funding, program, or policy problems impede the design orimplementation of the plan, the case is referred to the second level -- the local interagencyteam. Vermont's local interagency teams are responsible for individual case review as wellas system-level issues such as improving local services, addressing and resolving policy andfunding barriers, and improving interagency collaboration. On the rare occasion that casescannot be resolved at this level, the State Interagency Team may be enlisted in problemsolving.In Stark County, Ohio, a three-tiered system has been created for individualized caseplanning and review. A \"creative community options\" team is organized for each individualyoungster and family to assess strengths and needs and develop an individualized serviceplan. The stated purpose of the creative community options group is to creatively examinewhat might work for the child and family and to develop comprehensive, individualizedservice strategies. The case manager is responsible for monitoring implementation of theplan, and the group can be reconvened to address unresolved issues or changes in the childor family's situations. If the creative community options group is unable to resolve difficultand complex barriers to serving a child and family effectively, a referral can be made to thesecond level of interagency service planning, the ACCORD (A Creative Community OptionsReview Decision).The ACCORD is a standing committee of mid-level managers whorepresent each of the major child-serving systems and who are empowered by their agenciesto make decisions and commit resources to support creative individualized services. Caseswhich still cannot be resolved at the ACCORD level can be referred to the Stark CountyInteragency Cluster, a group comprised of executives of the child-serving agencies with theprimary purpose of system-level planning and coordination (Stroul, 1992). Like Vermont,cases which cannot be resolved at the community level may be referred to the State LevelInterdepartmental Cluster. The experience of a number of states and communities indicatesthat both child-specific interagency service planning teams and interagency entities focusingon system-level issues appear to be essential elements of effective systems of care.The inclusion of the parents as full participants on the interagency team is essential forindividualized service approaches. Unless precautions are taken, most parents find attendinga service planning meeting with numerous professionals to be an intimidating experience.Steps can be taken to help parents feel more at ease at an interagency team meeting and to 3.4 make their participation a positive experience. In several Florida communities, a parentvolunteer who has previously attended interagency meetings contacts the parents prior to ascheduled meeting. The volunteer briefs the parents on the interagency process, explainswhat is expected of them, and answers questions. Other strategies involve sending writtenmaterials to parents prior to interagency team meetings and using the case manager to briefand prepare the parents.In West Virginia, a videotape describing the interagency caseconference procedure is being prepared as a briefing tool for parents. Involvement of parentsin the interagency service planning process iscriticalfor the development andimplementation of a successful individualized care plan, although team members may showsome initial resistance.In most instances, initial anxiety and resistance to parentalinvolvement is reduced once individuals have participated in a few meetings involvingparents.In order to enhance the efficiency of the service planning process, some communities havedeveloped specific formats or time frames to guide the activities of the interagency team. InLeon County, Florida, for example, approximately 20 minutes are devoted to presentationsfrom the primary caseworker, staff, and family; 40 minutes are then devoted to identifyingkey issues and developing an individualized interagency plan. In Stark County, Ohio, theCreative Community Options team outlines the history, prepares a people map, identifiesstrengths and problems, what works, what doesn't work, what the child needs, and optionsto meet needs. Without some structure, a service planning meeting may become a lengthyand less productive process. All client and family information diE.7.1ssed or distributed atinteragency team meetings is considered confidential. Typically, a single release form is usedto obtain the consent of the parents for the exchange of information among the specificagencies involved on the interagency team.Using Case Management/Care CoordinationWeil and Karls (1985) define case management as a set of logical steps and a process ofinteraction within a service network which assure that a client receives an array of servicesin a supportive, effective, efficient, and cost-effective manner. The role of case managers/carecoordinators includes a range of functions (planning, accessing, linking, advocating,monitoring, supporting, coordinating, brokering, educating, and others) which serve tointegrate and maintain a network of services and supports for each child and family. Anindividualized service approach requires a much more proactive and creative carecoordination role than may be associated with a typical case manager. In fact, a moreintensive form of case management, performed by highly skilled case managers, is requiredbased upon the challenges presented by the youngsters served and the complexity anduniqueness of their intervention plans. In addition, the individualized care approach needsone individual to function as the coordinator of the interagency service planning/treatmentteam; that individual most frequently is the case manager.In describing therapeutic case management in Vermont, Santarcangelo (1990) indicated thatthe therapeutic case manager carries out all the usual functions of a case manager, but twoadditional functions have been added: 1) brainstorming with the treatment team to developinterventions and creative strategies to overcome obstacles, and designing services when noneare available through existing programs; and 2) providing, with the local interagency team,ongoing education and public awareness efforts directed towards parents and members of the 15o community on the integration of children with serious emotional or mental disorders into thecommunity.It should be noted that the term \"therapeutic\" in \"therapeutic case management\" does notmean that the case manager is providing treatment per se. In attempting to construct andimplement individualized services for the child and family, the therapeutic or clinical casemanager seeks to modify environments. According to Young (1987), therapy or mental healthtreatment is one possible modification of a child's environment. What is therapeutic abouttherapeutic case advocacy or management \"is the recalibration of expectations, instruction,support, and reward in each sector of the child's environment encompassed by the system ofcare. These changes make the child's interaction with it more manageable; and that isintrinsically therapeutic.\"Thus, while many providers of intensive case managementservices are clinically trained mental health professionals, they typically are not the primary\"treatment\" providerother professionals are utilized when therapy is included in theintervention plan. Stroul and Friedman (1986) emphasized that the requirements for casemanagement for children with serious problems and multiple needs are extensive and beyondthe capability of clinicians who are also the primary treatment agent. They further statedthat case managers who are not the primary treatment agent are in a position to moreindependently review progress and advocate on behalf of children and families. While theygenerally are not the primary treatment providers, case managers within the individualizedcare approach do provide high levels of support for the child and family as well as crisisintervention.Case management for individualized care requires small caseloads because of the complexityof functions the case manager must perform. Vermont has reported that different phases oftherapeutic case management require different levels of services as the child and family movethrough the process. The initial intake and treatment planning phases are usually the mostintensive; services then generally stabilize somewhat as services and support are wrappedaround the child and family in response to their needs. After a maintenance ph ase, the childand family finally make the transition into an inactive status. Santarcangelo (1990) reportsthat passage through these phases normally takes at least two to three years. The size ofthe caseload for therapeutic case managers would, therefore, depend on how many childrenwere in the intensive phases and could range from a caseload of five to no more than 12children and their families. In West Virginia, caseloads for case managers range from eightto 10.A number of advantages have been identified in regard to using specialized case managersfor individualized care. Specialized case managers can carry small caseloads and provideintensive services without the competing priorities resulting from normal agencyresponsibilities. Further, the case managers become experienced at working with youngsterswith difficult and complex problems and skilled at managing individualized interventionplans and handling crises. In addition, they develop intimate knowledge of the resourcesavailable in the community for children and families (such as a bank of behavioral aides whocan be called upon to provide support in homes, schools, and other settings) and become adeptat assisting families to access these resources. 16 Providing Individualized ServicesSince individualized services are based on the specific needs of the child and family, it followsthat the process begins with an assessment and treatment planning phase. Rather thanseeking a \"slot\" for the child in any available program, the approach involves assessing thestrengths and needs of the child and family and building a program of services around them.The interagency service planning/treatment team, with leadership provided by the casemanager, typically plays a central role in the assessment and planning process. Review ofexisting records, evaluations, and history is an important source of information for theassessment as well as information provided by the parents, child, professionals, and other keypersons in the child's life.Burchard and Clark (1990) discuss the ecological nature of the assessment conducted for thepurposes of providing individualized care. Instead of the traditional emphasis on personalitycharacteristics and child deficits, they contend that \"individualized care requires a shift toa more comprehensive, multilevel approach to assessment which examines the social ecologyof behavior and attempts to understand youngsters by assessing the total environment inwhich they function.\" Burchard and Clark propose four levels of assessment: analysis of thechild and family's strengths; assessment of the broader social environment in which the childand family live; assessment of service needs and available community resources; andassessment, on an ongoing basis, of progress and needs. According to their framework,assessment represents a means to formulate and design specific, individualized treatmentplans which better meet the needs of the child and family.As noted, assessment and planning for individualized services use a strengths-basedorientation which carefully considers and draws upon the assets of the child and family aswell as their needs. Refraining how the child and family are viewed may be helpful whenidentifying family strengths. For example, a child who is hyperactive may also be thoughtof as having a high energy level and/or an exuberant, outgoing personrility, characteristicswhich may be valued more in the adult work world than they are in the classroom. Otherexamples of family strengths include a mother who visits her child regularly in each of hisplacements; a youth who is \"street smart;\" a child who achieves a successful placement in aspecial education class; a child's budding skills in areas ranging from cooking to computers;or grandparents or other relatives who are interested in helping the family.According to VanDenBerg (in press), needs should be defined in positive terms and mightinclude a child's needs to express him or herself in an art form or the need to continue toexcel in school as well as the need for remedial action, such as the parent's need to findemployment or the child's need to stop hurting other children by learning appropriateinteraction skills. The assessment and planning process for individualized care involvesexamining needs across all life domains. These include: 1) residential (a place to live); 2)family or surrogate family; 3) social (friends and contact with other people); 4) educationaland/or vocational; 5) medical; 6) psychological/emotional; 7) legal (especially for children withjuvenile justice needs); 8) safety (the need to be safe); and other specific life domain areassuch as cultural/ethnic needs or community needs. VanDenBerg emphasizes that in anindividualized approach, the first qu-stion asked is: \"What does this youth need so that heor she can get better?\"The team then proceeds to construct a plan based upon theidentification of strengths and needs in all life domains. An essential aspect of the 17 assessment and planning process is to ascertain the child and family's own perspectives abouttheir needs and what services and support they desire (Tannen, 1991). Friedman (1988)summarized the importance of a strengths-based, ecological assessment when he stated thatonly a thorough assessment, including ecologically-oriented information that focuses not onlyon the child's problems but on strengths and interests, will enable a decision-making teamto move away from a \"placement\" orientation and towards a \"planning\" orientation and todevelop an individualized intervention plan.Developing an individualized service plan involves creative thinking from the case managerand interagency team in order to address identified needs. Individualized services typicallydraw upon all of the resources that the community may offer -- including services which mayexist within the community's system of care as well as a limitless range of creative,nontraditional approaches which may be designed to address specific needs. As stated byMac Farquhar and Dowrick (in press), the individualized assistance approach builds servicesaround the needs of each child and family, attempting to tailor services to each youngster andadding new or innovative services where necessary. The term \"wraparound\" services isderived from the notion of surrounding the child and family with a full network of servicesand supports, in accordance with their wishes. Tannen (1991) emphasized that one of themajor benefits of individualized services is that they do not require youngsters to conform toestablished institutional or programmatic rules, but rather respond to the changing needsand growth of the child.The interagency team may determine that a particular program (such as home-basedservices, day treatment, or therapeutic foster care) is available in the community and can beaccessed to address some of the identified needs for the child and family. Beyond the existingservices within the system of care, the team may identify needs for which less traditionalsolutions are required. Flexible funds, with few if any categorical restrictions, may be usedto provide wraparound services which typically are not provided by community agencies. Forexample, a behavioral aide may be hired to assist at home and school to prevent the out-of-home placement of the child. A family's utility bill may be paid so that the family can bekept intact; a car may be repaired so that the mother can continue to work and get her childto needed resources. Wraparound services and supports have been provided in a wide rangeof areas including (Zeigler-Dendy, 1992): oFamily Support and Sustenance - Providing emergency assistance for the child, payingfor utilities, paying for repair of a car engine, paying for a telephone, paying forparticipation in Weight Watchers, etc. oTherapeutic Services - Providing individual/family/group counseling, substance abuseservices, a bilingual therapist, a therapist of color, respite care in or out of home, etc. oSchool-Related Services - Providing school consultation, an academic coach, utilizingbehavioral aides or classroom companions at school, paying for school insurance forclassroom companion, buying a chemistry set for Christmas, etc. oMedical Services - Providing a needed medical evaluation, providing medical or dentalcare, paying for a tatoo removal, teaching sex education, teaching birth control,teaching medication management, etc. 183,, oCrisis Services - Hiring a family member or friend to provide crisis support, utilizinga behavioral aide in the child's home or in therapeutic foster home, teaching crisismanagement skills, etc. oIndependent Living Services - Helping to locateand rent an apartment, assistingyoungster to obtain Supplemental Security Income (SSI), hiring a professionalroommate/mentor, providing a weekly allowance, teaching money management andbudgeting, providing driving lessons, teaching meal preparation, teaching parentingskills, teaching housekeeping skills, purchasing a mobile home for a fire setter andproviding 24 hour staff, etc. oInterpersonal and Recreational Skill Development - Hiring a friend or finding a \"bigbrother,\" teaching social skills and problem solving skills, purchasing a membershipin an exercise gym, a YMCA membership, horseback riding lessons, art or musiclessons, summer camp registration, class trip, fishing license, bicycle, etc.oVocational Services - Providing job training, teaching good work skills, providing a jobcoach, finding an apprenticeship, providing a mentor at the apprenticeship or otherprogram, paying someone to hire the youth for a job, conducting a vocational skillsassessment, etc.oAdditional Reinforcers - Purchasing reinforcers including items such as a radio, make-up, clothing, punching bag, skate board, trips, dates or activities, photographs for teenmagazine, etc.Tannen (1991) warned that setbacks and crises are likely to occur during the course ofimplementing an individualized care plan. To prepare for this eventuality, the plan mustinclude agreed-upon approaches for handling crises. The inherent flexibility of individualizedservice approaches allows support to youngsters and caregivers to be quickly increased ordecreased in response to changing needs. For example, an aide may be brought into thehome or classroom during a crisis or particularly difficult period. Further, based upon theunderlying value of unconditional care, individualized services are provided to children andfamilies for as long as they are needed, regardless of youngsters' behavior or the challengesand complexities presented by their needs.Financing Individualized ServicesAs noted, the availability of flexible funds to implement imaginative and resourcefulintervention plans is a critical element of individualized care. While expenditures of flexiblefunds may appear unusual, it is this ability that allows a package of services and supportsto be tailored to the specific needs of the child and family. Olson, Whitbeck, and Robinson(1991) stressed that funding which is not preallocated to existing component services allowsteams the freedom to create and implement a tailored program that can be responsive to theunique and changing needs of the child.While creating flexible funding mechanisms is particularly challenging, Tannen (1991)emphasized that in order to provide creative, individualized services, expenditures cannot beexpected to fit into current agency line item categories. In fact, categorical funding 193(4, restrictions present a major barrier to the delivery of individualized services. Most state andfederal funds have categorical restrictions which limit the ways in which the funds may bespent. For example, some state legislatures or agencies establish categorical funding streamswhich may be spent only on specific types of services, such as residential treatment; fundscannot be spent on services to prevent removing a child from his or her home. Flexible funds,with few if any categorical restrictions, are available in a limited (but steadily increasing)number of states and communities.Several states have initiated policy changes at the state level which have eliminated somecategorical funding restrictions and paved the way for the creation of flexible funds forindividualized care.In West Virginia, for example, child welfare officials eliminatedcategorical funding restrictions by developing a policy which allows expenditure of residentialfunds for the development of services in the local community. If a child is placed in aresidential treatment facility at a cost of $75,000, the local interagency committee can spendup to that amount for delivery of individualized services in the local community. State policycurrently is being formulated regarding the utilization of any uncommitted funds returnedto the state. Areas of the state which have maintained low out-of-home placement rates willbe given priority to access these funds. Additionally, a community may apply for fundingfrom this \"savings pool\" to develop a new service or to fund an individualized service plan fora child for whom no other source of funding is available. In Iowa, an initiative todecategorize the funding for services to youngsters and families in order to provide moreindividualized and responsive care has been implemented in four counties. These types ofpolicy changes represent clear shifts in incentives for local areas to serve youngsters withinthe community and to use individualized service approaches.In addition to redirecting funds from residential or out-of-state care to community-based,individualized care, a number of states and communities are creating pools of blended fundsfrom the various child-serving agencies as a mechanism to provide flexible funding. A legalagreement signed by the child-serving agencies in Stark County, alio blends $700,000 a yearfrom multiple agencies which is used to fund individualized senine plans for multineedyoungsters and their families.In some states and communities, legislators and administrators remain suspicious of flexiblefunding approaches. The fear that funds will be squandered and personnel will not be heldaccountable forms the basis for this attitude. Accountability mechanisms built into flexiblefunding procedures help to alleviate these concerns. Although reliable and systematicaccountability procedures are essential, guidelines for administering flexible funds should bekept as simple as possible. Cumbersome admini-trative procedures hamper the ability ofcase managers to implement individualized care plans and to adjust services and supportspromptly in response to changing needs. Additionally, rapid access to flexible funds iscritical. When a family is in crisis, funds may be needed immediately to prevent escalationof the crisis and removal of the child from the home.While flexible funds have been called the \"linchpin\" of individualized care, many states havedeveloped a wide array of Medicaid-billable services which allow for the provision ofinnovative and nontraditional services and supports. Recent revisions to the MedicaidEPSDT (Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment) program offer one mechanismfor expanding services to children with serious emotional problems, allowing for Medicaid20 reimbursement of all service needs identified during EPSDT screening. The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation demonstration site in Pennsylvania developed a range of services forwhich Medicaid reimbursement can be provided under the EPSDT program including servicessuch as after-school programs, prevocational rehabilitation, weekend and holiday therapeuticservices, mobile crisis services, short-term intensive staff supports, in-home treatment, on-siteschool and work treatment services, and others. A detailed individualized service plan iscreated which forms the basis for service delivery and Medicaid reimbursement.Research on the cost-effectiveness of individualized services is needed. Reports from variousstates and communities indicate that, apparently, intensive, individualized services are lesscostly than institutional alternatives. Dowrick (1988) reported that the costs of out-of-stateplacements for youngsters in the Alaska Youth Initiative averaged $72,000 per year; thesame children were cared for in state at an average cost of $47,000 per year. Burchard andClark (1990) stated that in addition to the savings, it is believed that better services arebeing provided through the initiative. They contend that the cost-effectiveness ofindividualized care in the Alaska Youth Initiative, and other situations in which children arereturned from residential placements, is demonstrated by using each child and his or her owncontrol and showing that youngsters display good adjustment through less costly and lessrestrictive services. They acknowledge, however, that it is more difficult to demonstrate cost-effectiveness in situations in which individualized care is used to prevent residentialtreatment placement rather than to return youngsters from placements. In many cases,youngsters who have not as yet been placed in residential treatment are receiving fewservices prior to the initiation of individualized care, and as a result, costs increase asindividualized service plans are implemented. Comparison groups are needed to demonstratecost-effectiveness across broader client populations. While sufficient research to substantiatecost-effectiveness has not yet been completed, it appears that the individualized careapproach potentially can effectively serve some of the most difficult-to-serve youngsters atcosts which compare favorably to most residential treatment or hospital settings. III. IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES The Alaska Youth Initiative is a prime example of a systematic approach for utilizingindividualized services to meeting the needs of children and adolescents with severeemotional disturbances. The Alaska Youth Initiative is described below to demonstrate theapplication of the principles and process of individualized services. The individualizedservices implemented in Vermont also are described to amplify the use of this approach inother settings and to demonstrate how individualized services can be integrated withincomprehensive, community-based systems of care.Alaska Youth InitiativeAlaska is a unique service delivery environment from many standpoints: iti geographicalmass is equal to 20 percent of the combined area of the other 49 states and is over twice thesize of the next largest state. When superimposed over the contiguous 48 states, the breadthof Alaska reaches from coast to coast and in height from Mexico to Canada. Many of thecommunities are accessible only by air. Alaska also has one of the smallest state populations21 and a population density which is one-fifth of that in the next more populous state. However,it is similar to many rural states as most of the population is concentrated in a few centers.Most of the state's resources are available only in the one large city, Anchorage. The secondlargest city, Fairbanks, is eight hours away from Anchorage by car and an hour by air. Thethird largest city, Juneau, is land-locked and is two hours by air from either Anchorage orSeattle, Washington. Within this context of difficult geography, low population density, anda dearth of services even in the most populous centers, the care of children and adolescentswith severe emotional disturbance has traditionally been difficult. As a result, manyyoungsters were sent to out-of-state facilities for care. In addition, many children were caredfor in the major in-state centers far from their home communities, the equivalent to beingout of state.The Alaska Youth Initiative (AYI) is a collaborative program of the state-level mental health,social services, and special education agencies. It is housed in the Alaska Division of MentalHealth and Developmental Disabilities and currently is funded by special allocations fromthe mental health, child welfare, and special education budgets. An Interdepartmental Team(IDT) made up of representatives from each of the collaborating agencies manages theprogram and makes policy level decisions; the IDT also determines eligibility for the program.AYI is run by a state-level coordinator hired by Division of Mental Health and DevelopmentalDisabilities and uses local coordinators, primarily in hub communities, who are responsiblefor coordinating services for individual youngsters. Currently, there are 12 local coordinatorsin key locations around the state.The original target population for AYI was composed of emotionally disturbed youth placedout of state.In 1985, this population numbered close to 40, at an average cost of over$70,000 per child. Shortly after its inception, the program was put under some pressure toexpand its population to include emotionally disturbed youth who were at high risk forplacement.Today the broad target population for AYI is \"children and youth who areseverely emotionally disturbed and/or severely mentally ill.\" This population is thenprioritized by a number of factors which include being at risk for out-of-state placement andhaving exhausted the local service system.More specifically, the criteria for inclusion in the AYI population are:1)The youth has multiple and enduring needs which are generally going unmet2)An inability of the local service system to adequately serve the youth in spite ofcollaborative attempts.3)As a result of the above twe, conditions, the youth is now at risk for being sent out ofstate (or out of region) to an unduly restrictive placement.Referrals are generated by local interagency teams who feel that a youth fits the AYI criteria.A local referring team must, at minimum, include representatives from the school district andmental health arena, and, in custody cases, the child welfare agency. The Alaska PsychiatricInstitute, the state hospital, can make direct referrals to AYI but is encouraged to utilize abroader team when possible. 22III0 Information about the youth is reviewed by the IDT which determines the acceptance forservices under AYI. Eligibility is determined through a majority vote of the IDT members.If a youth is not accepted, the IDT may suggest other community, or even out-of-community,options judged to be more appropriate. There is a rarely used process through which thedirectors of the involved state agencies may hear appeals of decisions made relative to AYIeligibility.Upon acceptance, the case is assigned by the State AYI Coordinator to a well-trained localAYI coordinator whose first job is the creation of a core services team. This team, which ismost often an extension of the referring team, is the group that will work together with theyouth and his or her family to create the most appropriate service package. To create theteam, the coordinator identifies those community individuals who have been influential inthe youth's life.Of prime importance on these teams are parents who act as both keyinformants and resources; the youth also is included when his or her age and maturity makeit appropriate. The team also includes mental health professionals who have worked withthe youth and family, as well as attorneys, relatives, case workers, and teachers. Otherparticipants could be ministers, youth or recreation workers, or friends. The local AYIcoordinator chairs the core services team; the State AYI Coordinator is available to providesupport, guidance, and technical assistance as needed.The team first conducts an assessment of the strengths and needs of the youth and his or herfamily. Since AYI constructs an individualized approach, the assessment becomes a vitalexercise around which the entire treatment plan is created. Unlike traditional mental healthassessments that primarily focus on psychopathology, AYI assessments explore a full rangeof basic needs.These include residential, family, social/recreational, psychological,educational, vocational, medical, and legal needs. By examining a full range of needs, theassessment discovers areas in which the youth and family have assets to build on as well asfinding liability areas that need to be supported. The team uses personal information fromthe participants as well as available tests and reports to make determinations in each ofthese need areas. An attempt is made to determine needs through a discussion processwithout regard to which interventions will be necessary; in this way the team is less likelyto determine need on the basis of which services are available and more likely to develop amore objective view. AYI has tried to use more formal needs assessment tools, but none hasproven useful within this setting.The assessment feeds directly into the process of service planning; in many instances theprocesses become intertwined. Service planning involves the development of a treatmentplan which is based on a major premise of AYI -- that care is unconditional. Once the IDTaccepts the youth, both the local AYI coordinator and the local core services team accept thatthere is the a no-reject policy and that they must come up with a workable service plan forthe youth and family. They also understand that there is a no-eject policy, so they must staywith the youth and family adjusting the service plan for as long as necessary. This policy ismade workable by the flexibility which is given to the local team to create an innovativeservice approach. The team also understands that many of the youngsters who are acceptedby AYI are there because traditional service options and placements have failed and that theymust do something different if the youth is to succeed. They also know that these are themost troubled youth and that it will be difficult to help them to succeed. 230) A ,..1) The service plan for each youngster served by AYI is unique. The core services teambrainstorms to fill any gaps that the youth and family have in meeting those needs identifiedthrough the assessment process. Since the funding for each youth is entirely flexible, anycommunity resource can be used and paid for regardless of its usual funding sources and itsprice. Stories of extremely unusual uses of resources by AYI abound; they include buying\"friends,\" placement with a fisherman for a youth who wanted to be a fisherman, andpurchasing a snowmobile.While the team may choose to use existing services in thecommunity, certain necessary services often are not available, and when they are, they maynot exactly meet the individualized needs of the youth. However, most treatment plansinclude some traditional services such as therapy, special education classes, day treatment,and family support. An individualized education program (IEP) is introduced as part of thetreatment plan when appropriate.In 1988, 20 percent of AYI youth were placed in their original homes. When placement athome is not possible, alternatives are used. The most flexible, and therefore most commonlyused, placement is therapeutic foster care, called family treatment homes by AYI. Fortypercent of the youngsters served by AYI were placed in these homes in 1988. While thereis no formal therapeutic foster care program, the principles of this form of intervention areused. Foster parents are chosen based on their unique qualities to fit with the needs of theyouth and are given ongoing support and training by the local AYI coordinator. For example,the fisherman, mentioned above, was used as a \"foster parent\". Other forms of residentialcare have included teaching family homes which offer therapeutic group living within astructured family setting (16 percent) and more traditional group homes and other residentialprograms (11 percent), wher. these more formal programs meet the needs of the youth andcan be flexible enough to accept the principles of AYI. Older youth may be placed insupervised apartments and other independent living situations (11 percent). When AYIyouth are hospitalized or enter other more restrictive settings, it is assumed that these willbe short-term, that the treatment team staff will remain involved, and that the youth willreturn to the community and/or less restrictive care as soon as possible. AYI hasdemonstrated that it is possible to provide extremely intensive intervention in normativeenvironments.AYI relies heavily on the use of aides to work with youth in their families, alternativeplacements, regular school or special education programs, and recreation settings. Theseaides tend to be individuals with a minimum of training but with a good sense of how to dealwith youth and how to help control them when they are out of control. The aides haveflexible schedules; at times they may be needed full-time, in shifts, or on call. The aides offerthe extra support needed by a family, foster family or program in order to be able to keep theyouth. With the judicious use of aides, almost any community setting can be as supportiveas an intensive residential placement.Because the cities and regions in Alaska are so different, the types of treatment plans andthe modes of service delivery vary considerably across the state. For example, Anchorage hasmany services available enabling AYI staff to play a more coordinating role, with servicesbeing delivered by community resources. Bethel, on the other hand, is a small communitywith many fewer service resources, necessitating that AYI staff provide more direct servicesto children and their families. 24tia) Once the core services team has developed a way of reasonably meeting the needs of theyouth, the cost of the total plan is determined and projected on an annual basis.Thecompleted plan, specifying roles and responsibilities, and the associated budget are thentransmitted to the State AYI Coordinator for review. Modifications, if required, arenegotiated between the state and local coordinators. The plan is then presented to the IDTfor final approval. When approved, the plan is returned to the local team for implementation.The interventions are monitored by the local AYI coordinator who also sends progress reportsand evaluation data to the State AYI Coordinator on a monthly basis. The core services teammeets as necessary to monitor and modify the service plan; progress is regularly reviewed ona quarterly basis.Transition between services and placements is seen as an important part of the interventionwithin AYI. The local AYI coordinator who is working with the youth is responsible formaking sure that there are links between programs, and that before and after the youthmakes a move, the youth will have a chance to experience the new service delivery settingand will be able to give up connection with the old setting in a way that is appropriate forthat youth. If a youth is hospitalized or placed in a residential center, the coordinator isresponsible for continuing to work with the youth and the staff during the placement and forplanning and implementing with the staff a smooth transition back to community services.When a youth is doing well enough to be discharged from AYI, there is equal concern abouttransition, and the local AYI coordinator and core services team assume the responsibilityfor making the shift out of AYI smooth and appropriate to the youth's needs.Financing of the treatment plan is a major aspect of AYI. The concept of individualizedservices requires flexible funding, which is best created through the pooling of funds fromvarious sources to meet the needs represented in individual treatment plans. Originally, thefunds for AYI came directly from those monies used by the child welfare and specialeducation agencies to support youngsters in residential placements. These funds were pooledand placed under the control of the IDT. During the first years of the program, there wasa legislative appropriation of mental health funds to support the growth of AYI. Currently,the three major agencies (mental health, child welfare, and special education) pool moniesto support youngsters to be served under AYI. The core services teams each develop serviceplans for the specific youngsters for whom they have responsibility and request funding fromthe IDT. The IDT in turn, gives the local coordinator the funds to activate the treatmentplan. The core services team can use those funds in any way that makes sense within thetreatment plan and can appeal for more funds if the treatment plan changes in a way thatwould require higher costs.Flexible funding, while theoretically pleasing, can be a bureaucratic nightmare. Therefore,AYI was constructed so that, even though extremely flexible in the use of funds, it would beextremely thorough in the tracking of funds. Such easily available amounts of money whichoften are used for institutionally unnatural things (such as a snowmobile) must be accountedfor in a very precise way. Every expenditure must be related to the treatment plan and bewell justified within that plan. In this way, extraordinary expenses can be successfullydefended. An AYI Project Assistant, who reports to the State AYI Coordinator, is responsiblefor monitoring and tracking expenditures for accountability purposes. In addition to 25 '%-\" monitoring budgets and expenditures for each youngster served, the assistant works closelywith state fiscal staff.Along with accountability, such a new and innovative approach as AYI requires a well-doneevaluation in order to prove its efficacy. Initially, the program developed a system for thestatewide monitoring of client outcome data that the IDT felt were vital to the success of theprogram and adequately reflected the goals. These measures include: oNumber of days in an inpatient psychiatric or locked juvenile detention settingoAmount of drug and alcohol use or possessionoIncidence of runaway episodesoNumber of days in schooloAmount of assaultive behavioroAmount of property damageoNumber of police incident reportsoDegree of voluntary medication complianceOther tracked events were: oNumber of suicide attemptsoNumber of days in the communityoAmount of time in the family or a family-like setting and the amount of parentalinvolvementoNumber of placementsThese are easily measurable events that are directly related to the goals of AYI; each of theseoutcomes has a written definition.A number of features or strategies have proven to be vital aspects of AYI: oWorking with the Most Troubled Youth - AYI was conceptualized and designedto offer the level of service needed by the most troubled children and youth at a levelequivalent to the services offered in most hospitals and intensive residential treatmentcenters. Therefore, in order to adequately test the approach, the program had toactually work with those children and youth who were considered the most difficultto serve. In fact, as the program began, this aspect was tested, as AYI was presentedwith two youngsters whose behavior was so disturbed that they were being ejectedfrom their out-of-state placements. Struggling with the application of individualizedcare principles to a difficult-to-serve population helped to define the process andprocedures necessary to use this approach successfully. If the approach had been\"tested\" on less troubled youngsters, it would have been difficult to later adapt themodel to the toughest youth. oUsing Failure as a Learning Experience - When one works with the most troubledyouth, it stands to reason that occasionally a treatment plan will fail. AYI was conceived and implemented with this understanding. Further, when a program isbuilt on the principle of unconditional care, each of these failures becomes, ofnecessity, a learning experience through which staff reflect on what they did wrong,26 41. what incorrect assumptions were made, and how to proceed from the point of failuretoward a successful intervention. In many traditional programs, failure most oftenleads to referral to a new program which begins working with the youth out of thecontext of the prior failures. As a result, new programs often repeat the unsuccessfulpatterns of the old, and lead to inevitable failure. This creates a pattern of a seriesof failed service attempts, a pattern which may continue until the youth isinstitutionalized or until he or she ages out of the system. With a wraparound servicedelivery approach, the lessons of failed placements or other unsuccessful interventionsare used in the development of the next steps. As a result, the number of failedinterventions appears to decrease for youth in AYI. oEstablishing a Strong Political Base - Individualized, wraparound services are anew modality, and as such are not generally accepted as the \"usual\" care. While newservices typically are placed under increased scrutiny, the probability of intensescrutiny is even greater when a program focuses on the most troubled youth andexpects occasional failure. Often, any degree of failure dooms a new service politically,even if the target population is a difficult one. AYI was able to grow in spite of thisrisk because the developers understood these political realities and created a strongbase of support among key politicians and policy makers who believed in the conceptsof the program and its anticipated outcomes and who understood the risk and growthopportunities presented by occasional failure. This political base was essential inhelping Ail move through its initial stages, and was useful in getting full funding ofthe project. oProviding Unconditional Care and Strengths/Needs-Based Assessments - Thebasic tenets of unconditional care also are major features of AYI. Having a no-reject/no eject policy forces the program to plan services in a way that gives providersa realistic chance of keeping the unconditional care promise. Assessments of bothstrengths and needs across the full range of basic life domains enhance the likelihoodof meeting the child and family's needs and of building on their unique strengths,thereby providing effective care. This type of assessment recognizes assets as well asliabilities; identified strengths are then used by the team in creating a balancedintervention plan. oFlexible Funding - In order create interventions that meet the unique needs of anyyouth and family, there must be funding sources that allow for their support. Ingeneral, traditional funding sources are extremely narrow in their focus; theyencourage the exclusive funding of program components within a system of care.Within AYI, funding of treatment plans comes from pooled monies that have norestrictions, other than to meet the needs as stated in the treatment plan.Wraparound service technologies require this type of flexible funds in addition tofunding for formal service programs. Alaska provides flexible funds through specialallocations from each of the involved agencies. oAccountability - In order for funding to be flexible, and often to purchase extremelynontraditional services, AYI requires that each dollar spent be accounted for and berelated directly to a treatment plan. The program refers to a \"paper trail\" which mustfollow every dollar spent for an AYI youth. In this way, unusual expenditures of27 funds for rent, buying friends, or special items such as a snowmobile can be justifiedto even the most skeptical observer as part of the intervention.oEvaluation - Innovation breeds skepticism, and the developers of AYI feel that theonly way to overcome that skepticism is to ensure that solid evaluation results supportthe program. Based on the outcome measures previously described, the program hasbeen shown to be effective in meeting its goals relating to both returning youth to thestate and community, but also to decreasing the troubled behaviors that the youthexhibit. The success demonstrated by evaluation has served to silence the detractorsof this innovative approach.It was reported that the philosophy and process used by AYI is beginning to be applied morebroadly in Alaska (Frichette, 1992). As a result of their experience with individualizedservices provided through AYI, community mental health centers and other child-servingagencies are beginning to adopt the philosophy and process of individualized care in theircommunities. This process has been advanced by new Medicaid and EPSDT regulations inAlaska which require the use of interagency teams and individualized approaches foryoungsters with serious emotional disturbances. In addition to the spread of theindividualized approach among more traditional agencies in the state, villages ranging in sizefrom 300 to 4,000 residents with few, if any, formal services are learning to use personal andcommunity resources to support youngsters and keep them in the community. Education andtraining regarding interagency collaboration and providing wraparound services have helpedto promote both acceptance and experimentation with the individualized care approachbeyond the confines of the services and funds provided through AYI.The Vermont ExperienceThe Vermont approach, while built on the same basic principles of individualized care as AYI,differs in several respects and presents an alternative model. From a demographic andgeographic point of view, with the exception of size and the presence of Alaska's large nativeAlaskan population, Vermont does not differ significantly from Alaska. Vermont is anextremely rural state, it has no large urban center, and its largest city has a population ofless than 40,000. Vermont has a system of community mental health centers that covers thestate; however, as in many localities, the centers' ability to serve children and adolescentshas historically been limited.Vermont's wraparound service capacity is centered on the concept of therapeutic casemanagement. Vermont has created a continuum of care for a broad population of childrenand adolescents with severe emotional disturbance. The therapeutic case managementprogram is one service within that continuum, available for the most needy members of thetarget population as determined by a local committee. The most troubled and most at-riskchildren and youth are offered individualized, intensive services coordinated and directed bya therapeutic case manager along with a treatment team. This model places greateremphasis on the role of the case manager who coordinates local component services than doesAYI which focuses more heavily on the local treatment team for coordination and for whichappropriate local services often are not available. In Vermont, case management/wraparoundservices are delivered in the context of a total system of care which offers a broad continuumof services to be used by any individual in need, including, when appropriate, those who are28 eligible for individualized services. This approach contrasts with AYI which has notemphasized the development of a full system of care in all areas of the state.Vermont has used its Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) to create alocal capacity to respond to children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance andtheir families. Following a five-year federal CASSP grant, the state created and passedlegislation that codifies the system of care for children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbance. This mandate created a state definition of the population that is to be used onan interagency basis. In addition, two state-level structures were created to oversee servicesto the target population. The first of these is a Governor's Advisory Board made up of fiveparents, five advocates, and five professionals who are responsible for making broad policyrecommendations to the heads of the major child-serving agencies including thecommissioners of education, mental health and mental retardation, and social rehabilitationservices. The second is a State Interagency Team, which functions to: 1) implement statepolicy for children and adolescents with severe emotional problems, 2) resolve local problemsin meeting the needs of the target population, and 3) monitor the state's wraparound serviceprograms. This team consists of representatives of the state agencies mentioned above anda parent of the child who is experiencing severe emotional problems.The primary mandate in the legislation is to create a statewide system of local interagencyteams (LITs), one in each of the state's 12 social service districts. These teams are made upof local agency and parent representatives and are responsible for working together to deliverservices to multineed, cross-agency youth. Local treatment teams, created to develop anindividualized services plan for each youngster, can refer children and adolescents and theirfamilies to the LIT for help in resolving problems of access to adequate service delivery. Forthose children and adolescents who meet the state definition, the LIT works with localtreatment teams to develop individualized service plans. Children and adolescents who areat the highest level of risk for removal from their home or community, or who are already inout-of-state placements, can be accepted by the LIT into the individualized service programwhich focuses on the provision of therapeutic case management and related wraparoundservices.At the same time, the state has been implementing an initiative that will ultimately extendthe full continuum of services of the system of care into all areas of the state. These servicesinclude intensive home-based services, therapeutic foster care, community-based residentialalternatives, crisis stabilization, parent support groups, respite care, and special educationprograms, in addition to the therapeutic case management. The network of communitymental health centers has been the focal point for the development of these service capacities.In 1989, Vermont applied for and received a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(RWJ) Mental Health Services Program for Youth in order to help support the developmentof the full continuum of services and the wraparound capability. This grant, called NewDirections, is directed toward implementing this statewide comprehensive community-basedsystem of care through the support of interagency collaboration, development of new servicecapacities, and the restructuring of the financing mechanisms for the funding of the system.The children and families receiving individualized services in the Vermont system aredescribed by the state officials as those children and adolescents who have the most severe29 emotional disturbances and the most challenging family circumstances, which place them athigh risk for removal from their homes and communities (the formal definition is very similarto the AYI definition). By the second year of the Vermont project, 176 children and youthmeeting the definition of the target population had been served in some of the services withinthe system of care, and 29 had been offered individualized services through the therapeuticcase management part of the program.While AYI initially focused on those children placed out-of-state and later dealt with youthat risk, Vermont started with a broader population. The program evolved from ProjectWraparound which was created with a mandate to prevent out-of-home placement; returningchildren from out of state was a secondary aspect of the mission. While this differencebetween the AYI and Vermont approaches may seem merely semantic, it should be noted thatpreventing placement and returning from a long-term placement require very differentapproaches, and that the shift from one to the other is not always a simple process. Further,it is easier to demonstrate the savings for a youth returned home from an expensiveplacement than to prove that high-cost wraparound treatment actually prevented aplacement, especially if other youth are still being placed out of home and state.The process for delivering individualized services in Vermont is very similar to that used inAYI. Children and adolescents are referred to the therapeutic case management program bythe LIT. When a child is accepted, a case manager is assigned and proceeds to review therecords and meet the family and other individuals who impact on the child. The next stepis the development of a treatment team, the composition of which is identical to the AYI coreservices team. The team's first duty is the development of a service plan. This plan is basedon a thorough assessment across a broad range of life dimensions. While these assessmentdimensions are similar to AYI's, the categories have subtle differences. They include residential,therapeutic/behavioral,educational/vocational,social/recreational,medical/psychiatric, safety/crisis plan, legal, and other. The process for conducting thisassessment appears virtually identical to AYI's, and a similar strengths-based orientation isused to balance the identification of problems and needs.Once the service plan is developed, the therapeutic case manager assumes a special role. InVermont's plan for implementation of therapeutic case management (Santarcangelo, 1990),the role of the therapeutic case manager is described as using natural supports in thecommunity and/or organizing services provided by agencies. \"The therapeutic case manageracts as the person accountable for coordinating and ensuring appropriate and timely servicesfor children/adolescents and their families. They are responsible for brokering services forindividuals, and advocating on the child's behalf across service systems. Therapeutic casemanagers ensure that adequate service plans are developed and implemented and provideongoing review of the child's progress and program outcomes.\"Many of these roles are handled by the local AYI coordinator in Alaska. In Vermont, theyare handled by specific workers with both a master's degree in a human service field and aminimum of two year's experience with children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbance. With case loads of four to 12, the therapeutic: case manager spends an averageof seven to ten hours a week with each family performing three basic functions: advocacy,coordination, and education. In addition, the therapeutic case manager also is involved inassessment, planning, linking, monitoring, and evaluation.30 Unlike Alaska where many communities do not have an array of services, individualized careplans in Vermont more than likely include component services that are part of the continuumof care. Wraparound services work in these settings to help support both families and serviceproviders to be able to meet the child's or adolescent's need in a community-based setting,including the home. Eighty percent of those in the program live in therapeutic foster careor in supervised independent living, and the other 20 percent are at home or in othernormalized home settings.An important aspect of the Vermont program is the special focus on crisis stabilization andrespite. This emphasis is based on the recognition that a child or adolescent who has anemotional disorder will, at some time, have a crisis. At the beginning of the treatmentplanning process, the types of crises which are most likely to occur are anticipated, and aplan to respond is developed in advance. The RWJ grant is being used, in part, to supportthe development of crisis stabilization programs provided by the community mental healthcenters. Similarly, both the child and family's need for respite is anticipated, and respiteplans are developed that allow the parent and/or child to have a break. It should be notedthat the statewide availability of respite services has been enhanced by the fact that Vermonthas received two successive respite care grants from the U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services specifically to meet the needs of children and adolescents with severeemotional disturbances and their families.Unlike AYI which has pooled funds to support the individualized services for eligible youth,Vermont has struggled to create a funding package, utilizing existing federal and statefunding streams, that meets the needs of each of the youngsters involved. For those childrenand adolescents who qualify for medical assistance, usually by being a ward of the state, thisfunding has been aided by Vermont's history involving the flexible use of Medicaid funds.For children and adolescents in state care, the primary source of funds are Medicaid clinicand rehabilitative services and Title IV-E. Using a Medicaid Home and Community-BasedWaiver, these federal funds can be used to fund most of the services in any child's treatmentplan and are used to support children in their families' custody as well as those youngstersin state custody. The costs of residential services can be offset with Title IV-E monies. Thestate match for these funds comes from reallocation of state mental health, child welfare,and education monies previously spent on other placements along with funds from the RWJgrant. While this works well for the children and adolescents in state custody or otherwiseeligible for public funds, funding of individualized treatment plans for non-public fund eligibleyouth remains problematic. Further, the Medicaid waiver can serve a maximum of 116children per year by federal mandate. To expand services to additional children, the stateis attempting to recapture more of the monies previously spent on expensive out-of-stateplacements and to develop a fund from private and federal sources.For each child and adolescent, an individualized funding plan must be developed, jugglingall of the possible sources. While this process appears cumbersome, it makes the best useof existing financing opportunities and the program is not beholden to a politically controlledappropriation as in AYI. The state is attempting to develop a less complex funding scheme,utilizing all available funding sources.As in AYI, the Vermont approach requires the availability of flexible funds as a major vehiclefor providing individualized services. In AYI, all of the funding is flexible, and flexible funds 31 t)6 for nontraditional services are taken from the same pool of funds. In Vermont, special stepshave to be taken to create a pool of flexible funds for nontraditional services that cannot besupported by any other funding source. The agencies involved in the effort have workedtogether to create a fund of flexible dollars to pay for those services that are not covered byany agency's funding patterns.Vermont and Alaska have worked together on the concept of proactive client tracking. AYIuses a proactive client tracking format in which the team decides which behaviors andoutcomes key informants will periodically report on. In contrast, Vermom uses astandardized format where a series of indicators (both positive and negative) are tracked bythe primary caretaker on a daily basis using a computer input form. Each of these behaviorsis clearly defined and the reporter notes if that indicator has been present at any time thatday. They This process is used to monitor individual children and youth, as well as to establish aframework for understanding how the approach as a whole is working.Vermont has been involved in the design of new methodologies for the study of individualizedservices approaches. While still under development, the methodology has a four-componentevaluation system evolving in collaboration with the University of Vermont. The fourcomponents include the : oDaily Adjustment Component, which is the daily proactive client tracking datadescribed above; oBiannual Adjustment Component, which is performed every six months using theChild, Teacher, and Youth Self-Report Checklists designed by Achenbach andEdelbrock (1983); oServ. ce Tracking Component, which provides weekly information regarding theservices provided to the child or adolescent; and, oConsumer Satisfaction Component, which includes client satisfaction questionnairesfor children, adolescents, and parents to be used every six months. 32 Each of these evaluation factors will be used to follow the progress of each individual,youngster, and when aggregated, to follow the progress of the entire individualized careeffort.A number of vital features distinguish the Vermont approach. Similar to AYI, the Vermontapproach is based on the premises of unconditional care, ecological assessment, use of flexiblefunds, and evaluation. The Vermont approach demonstrates several other factors whichcontribute to its success: oCrisis Anticipation and Management - The program operates with theunderstanding that children and adolescents with severe disturbances are likely toexperience periodic crises. In many traditional service systems, crises lead to failedplacements and program plans. Each Vermont intervention plan anticipates the typesof crises that an individual child or adolescent may experience and develops a planspecifying how the treatment team and the family will respond. In this way, themany adverse effects of crises can be minimized and the commitment to unconditionalcare is operationalized in a very practical way. For this reason, Vermont is developingcrisis stabilization programs across the state. oLegislation - Vermont has used legislation to codify the manner in which the systemof care for children and adolescents with severe emotional disturbance will be viewedand developed. This legislation has had the effect of taking ideas that have beendeveloped and tested and making them the state standard. State agencies havedeveloped programs consistent with the philosophy of individualized care. This hasresulted from the state's long-standing commitment to interagency collaboration aswell as its commitment to a set of principles for a system of care which stressesindividualized, child-centered, and family-focused service delivery. Thus, theprinciples of individualizing services are being spread and practiced across the wholesystem. oSystem of Care - The Vermont approach relies on the presence of a strong systemof care that provides several vital components in each service area of the state. Theseinclude intensive home-based services, therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization,special education, parent support groups, respite care, supervised independent living,community residential services, and therapeutic case management. All of theseservices are used as part of individualized service plans. oUse of Current Funding Mechanisms - Since Vermont has no mechanism forpoling monies to be used flexibly to fund individualized service plans, most of theservices must be funded through existing state and federal funding streams. Whilethis may be easier in Vermont because the state has learned to use Medicaid ininnovative ways through its Home and Community-Based Waiver, sophistication isstill required for the successful application and blending of all appropriate andavailable funding mechanisms. Vermont has chosen this approach rather thanstruggle with the creation of a large interagency pool of funds as has AYI. Ultimately,application of existing mechanisms can lead to the restructuring of those mechanismsto better meet the needs of the system of care. Further, the use of current funding 33 streams links the wraparound program to the rest of the service system, making iteasier to apply individualized service concepts across the entire system of care. IV. EVALUATION OF INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICES Because individualized services are viewed as a new modality, it is essential to evaluate thisapproach in order to substantiate its effectiveness. Evaluative data can potentiallystrengthen the political base of support for these services as well as help to understand thebenefits of this approach for the child, family, and community. Engel and Lubrecht (1992)surveyed 24 individualized care programs across the nation and found that all were engagedin studying their programs in some way, most using multiple measures. Most prominentamong the areas of study were: 1) cost comparison analysis, 2) placement prevention data,3) intervention efficacy (often through client tracking), 4) family satisfaction, and 5)interagency collaboration.As with the services, the evaluation of outcome is often individualized to fit with the needsof the child and family. For example, AY1's proactive tracking system periodically asks keyinformants to comment on the progress of the client using those factors identified in theclient's assessment and reflected in the treatment plan. Vermont's client tracking system,described above, includes the formal tracking of standardized behaviors on a daily basis.These specific tracking mechanisms are useful in evaluating the individual progress of eachchild or adolescent as well as the overall success of the program.In addition, more standardized evaluation tools are used to track the progress of youngstersreceiving individualized care. Tools such as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), along withaccompanying Teacher and Youth Self-Report Checklists (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983), areused to track progress and to assess how clients are behaving against national norms.Vermont uses these tools every six months to track each child and adolescent's \"adjustment.\"Client satisfaction, from the perspective of both the youth and family, is an importantmeasure of how well a system of care is achieving its goals, particularly for a system of carewhich is designed to meet individual needs. Vermont is developing a consumer satisfactionquestionnaire which will be administered every six months to parents, children, andadolescents. Other programs have developed their own process for measuring how well theservice system is meeting the perceived needs of the client and family.Since each intervention plan used in a wraparound program is unique, the service packagefor each child or adolescent and family consists of a different array of services. In order toattempt to understand the relationship between the array of services offered and the eventualoutcomes for the child or adolescent, it is vital that the exact services that are delivered beclosely tracked. This becomes an extremely complex task with individualized services for tworeasons. First, within this concept of service delivery, the definition of what comprises aservice is extremely broad. This is exemplified by situations in which having a friend isconsidered a service, or the provision of an aide is equal to psychotherapy in treatment planimportance. Secondly, the service army changes frequently in accordance with the changingneeds of the child or adolescent.34 rs: ri-. . Several approaches have been used to relate services to outcome. First, the level of serviceshas been quantified in terms of the relative degree of restrictiveness. The most notableexample of this is the Restrictiveness of Living Environments Scale (ROLES) developed byHawkins and colleagues (1992). In this scale, each type of setting receives a restrictivenessscore, with living at home being the least restrictive and hospitalization or locked institutionbeing the highest. These scores can be compared to behavioral outcomes and/or used asoutcome measures themselves. A second approach to service tracking is exemplified byCare Track, a data system developed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Mental HealthServices Program for Youth, which systematically follows the array of services related to atreatment plan, the specific goals of that service, the number of service units delivered, andthe progress toward the specific goal. While a complex computer program is still in its finalstages of development and testing, Care Track has the potential to be a powerful tool in theunderstanding of how individual services within an array of services relate to the progressthat the recipient demonstrates.At the University of Vermont, Burchard and his colleagues have been developing a researchapproach to evaluating services, including individualized care. Building from the success oftheir proactive client tracking concepts, they have developed a scheme for tracking childrenand adolescents through their life histories in a number of domains which include residential,behavioral, services, life events, family, services, and costs. This approach, called amultiaxial timeline, combines many of the aspects of the evaluation of individualized services.The University of Vermont team is currently working on developing the multiaxial timelineinto a clinical and evaluation tool rather than a research instrument.Few evaluation results on individualized services have been published to date, primarilybecause most individualized service efforts have been in existence for relatively short periodsof time.Evaluation data from programs that have been operating the longest areencouraging. VanDenBerg (in press) reports that, after its first five years of operation, AYIwas extremely successful in meeting its two major program goals. The first of these was tolimit further inappropriate out-of-state placements. This goal was achieved; since 1986, onlytwo youths have been sent out of state for treatment out of the 117 youngsters served by AYI.Both of these youths were so placed in the first two years of AYI and have since beenreturned to Alaska. The second goal was to return youth who were already in out-of-statefacilities. This goal also has been achieved; as of 1991, only one youngster remained in anout-of-state placement, and no youth who was returned to Alaska through AYI has had toreturn to an out-of-state placement.In 1990, the state and local AYI coordinators were asked to assign ratings to all AYI youthwho had been served for at least six months (a total of 81 youngsters). The rating processwas intended to obtain a global measure of the perceived successfulness of the individualizedservices approach for each youngster. Ratings indicated that 67 percent of the cases wereperceived as having a successful outcome; 15 percent of the cases were rated as having hada mixed outcome; and 18 percent were considered to have had a poor or unknown outcome.The need for more objective measures to corroborate these perceptions was acknowledged(Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, 1991).As noted, AYI developed a set of indicators to be used to measure the progress of individualyoungsters. Based upon these data, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services35 r*.'t.) (1989) reported that there were substantial increases in: the amount of time youngsters spentwith their families, school attendance, parental involvement, and voluntary medicationcompliance. Sizable decreases were noted in: alcohol and drug possession, runaway episodes,assaultive behavior, property damage, contacts with the police, and suicide attempts.Data from Vermont are available on the first 29 children to receive individualized carethrough therapeutic case management services (Santarcangelo, 1992). For these youngsters,who ranged in age from 8 to 19, reductions were found in the restrictiveness of their livingenvironments. On a modified version of the Restrictiveness of Living Environments Scale(Hawkins, Almeida, Fabry, & Reitz, 1992), the level of restrictiveness was reduced from amean score of 4.8 to 3.9 on a scale ranging from 1 to 9.8. The percentages of youngsters invarious types of placements shifted as well, with shifts from 31 percent to zero in correctionalor residential treatment settings and accompanying increases in placement in therapeuticfoster care (17 percent to 35 percent) and in natural homes (3 percent to 10 percent). Trendsfrom tracking the daily occurrence of troubled behavior suggest decreases in negativebehaviors including: physical aggression, property damage, sexual assault, suicide attempts,and fire setting. While the results are encouraging, the small number of cases compromisesthe statistical significance of these data. Larger sample sizes will be achieved over time inVermont and elsewhere and will, hopefully, lead to results with higher levels of confidence.Further, the many ongoing evaluations of individualized care across the nation should yieldresults in the near future. V. MAJOR STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES Major StrengthsThe strengths of individualized care are inherent in the underlying values of focusing on eachindividual child and family, providing services in the most normalized environment, workingin close partnership with families, using a strengths-based, ecological orientation, providingculturally competent services, and offering unconditional care based upon a no-reject, no-ejectphilosophy. These values are congruent with, and partially derived from, the values for anoverall system of care and represent a clear philosophy about the way in which servicesshould be delivered to all children and families. In fact, a major strength of the individualizedcare approach is that its underlying values are consistent with the established values andprinciples for a system of care which have been widely accepted and adopted in many statesand communities throughout the United States (Stroul & Friedman, 1986). Individualizedservices provide an opportunity to put the system of care philosophy directly into practice foryoungsters and their families. In addition, a number of other strengths have made the useof this type of labor-intensive service approach advantageous to communities: oEnhanced Outcomes - The more broad-based, ecological assessments used inindividualized service approaches lead to the development of intervention plans thathave a greater chance of success. It is a reasonable assumption that treatmenteffectiveness will be enhanced when services are tailored to the unique needs of thechild and family. In the long run, enhanced outcomes benefit not only the child and 36 kJ family, but also will benefit the community which is more likely to regain the childand family as productive members. oConsistency of Care - The individualized care approach allows for supports to beprovided not only to families but within all types of settings. This means that nomatter where children and adolescents receive care (home, school or elsewhere), thelikelihood for success is increased. When crises both large and small occur, extraservices can be wrapped around both the youth and the service provider, offering thelevel of support needed to maintain the youngster in the community. Since mostcrises are short-lived, the need for more intensive support diminishes rapidly and theyouth and care provider return to a more stable status quo. Where wraparoundservices are not available, even minor, short-term crises can cause a placement to failand bring about the resultant use of a more restrictive placement. Individualized careapproaches, with the flexibility to add services and supports as needed, allow multipleplacements to be averted, saving restrictive settings for use by youngsters who trulyneed them. Thus, individualized services can help to keep youngsters within theirown homes or within alternative home-like settings on a more consistent basis,minimizing placement in more restrictive settings. oMore Responsive Interagency Systems of Care - The use of individualizedservices by communities for the most troubled and expensive children and adolescentshas the potential for setting a tone for how services should be offered to everyone. Ascommunities learn the advantages of the interagency coordination and collaborationthat is required for this type of intervention, they hopefully can begin to understandthe utility of a collaborative approach for meeting the needs of all children andadolescents and their families. While the commitment to meet the full range ofindividual needs of all children and adolescents who appear for services has thepotential of adding a major strain on the capacity of service systems, the advantagesin preventing troubling outcomes and more expensive future service needs may, overtime, become obvious. Thus, the values, philosophy, and collaborative approach usedto provide individualized care to the most challenging youngsters may begin topermeate the entire system of care, resulting in improved services for all youngstersand families.Beyond the advantages to children and families from interagency coordination incommunities, there also is a major advantage to the agencies which function with anew degree of cooperation. Most of the line workers in these agencies have clientswith cross-agency needs. As they struggle to help children and families, these workersencounter significant barriers to obtaining needed services. Interagency structurescreated to deliver improved services for children and adolescents with severeemotional disturbance have, in a number of states and communities, grown toencompass services to all troubled children and families, spreading the benefits ofinteragency collaboration and the principles of individualized services to the entirecommunity. 37 Major ChallengesIn spite of the benefits that have resulted from the implementation of individualized serviceprinciples and processes, serious challenges exist to their general acceptance as well as totheir application. Several of the major challenges are discussed below. oBalance of Component Versus Individualized Services - The development ofcommunity-based systems of care for children and adolescents with severe emotionaldisturbances and their families is now a broadly accepted national goal, and manycommunities are achieving progress toward the creation of such systems. A systemof care must include an array of services as well as mechanisms for interagencycoordination both at the system level and at the client level. This infrastructure fora system of care is critical as a community prepares to provide services which arecommunity based, child centered, family focused, and coordinated. Within the contextof a system of care, a remaining challenge is allocating resources between programcomponents and flexible resources for nontraditional services and supports. Friedman(1988) wrote, \"Given the importance of individualizing services, and the newdevelopments that appear to take the individualized approach to a greater level thanhas traditionally been the case, what are the implications for a model of a system ofcare? First, it is important to recognize that the need for a wide range of services isstill present. Second, however, the new developments suggest that there needs to bea balance within a system of care between the resources that go to specific programsand services and those that go specifically for the mechanisms that maximizeindividualization.\"Friedman (1988) further noted that historically, most of the resources in the children'smental health field have gone toward the support of particular programs or services,or toward the purchase of slots in programs. Over the past decade, the range ofprogram options has expanded, and resources have been used to fund new community-based service alternatives such as home-based services, crisis services, day treatment,and therapeutic foster care. However, funding for family support services such asrespite care and other social services has been particularly difficult to obtain for thispopulation.Likewise, the operational services described by Stroul and Friedman(1986) including case management, self-help and support groups, advocacy,transportation, and transitional services have been sorely lacking for children withserious emotional or mental disorders and their families. Flexible funding forwraparound services has been conspicuously absent in most systems of care.In 1988, Friedman asserted that the next step in the evolution of systems of care maywell be determining a better balance between funds that are flexible and those thatare precommitted to existing programs or slots. However, this has not been an easytask. It has been suggested that the nature of the community (urban versus rural)may be a factor in determining the most appropriate mix of established programs andflexible funds for individualized care. In more highly populated areas, there may besufficient demand for services to warrant the allocation of substantial resources forprograms such as day treatment, home-based services, crisis services, therapeuticfoster care, and other system components. In rural areas, where the demand may beinsufficient to sustain a large number of programs, it may be appropriate to rely more38 heavily on individualized services based upon flexible funding while maintaining amore minimal infrastructure of established service components. It is important torecognize, however, that individualized services have been successfully implementedin highly urban environments as well as in extremely rural and remote settings.Whatever the environment, determining an appropriate balance between componentservices and the mechanisms which support flexibility and responsiveness inindividualizing services remains a major challenge to systems of care. oFinancing Individualized Services - Creating viable mechanisms for financingindividualized services is one of the major challenges for the future. VanDenBerg (inpress) noted that budgeting procedures for flexible funding can be cumbersome andeven prohibitive and that it is much easier, administratively, to provide grant fundsfor a residential program than to plan individually for each child. The Vermont NewDirections Program (DeCarolis, 1992), in its Final Phase Proposal to the Robert WoodJohnson Foundation, identified the need for coordinated interagency policies tosupport a streamlined process for funding individualized wraparound approaches toservice delivery as a major priority. The proposal states that: \"In order toaccommodate a flexible funding system within the rigid accounting practices of variousdepartments and agencies, an extremely complex system has been developed toprocess individualized budgets and payments. While the present system works, it isextremely cumbersome and time-consuming for all involved, including businessmanagers at the state and local levels of all agencies, therapeutic case managers, andNew Directions Project staff. Issues such as cash flow problems and labor-intensivemanual tracking of expenditures must also be resolved.\" Vermont has recentlyconvened an interagency committee to develop recommendations for streamlining thisprocess.Thus, the challenge includes designing workable procedures for flexible funding thatprovide appropriate safeguards, fiscal management, and accountability procedures, butare not overly cumbersome for providers. Additionally, increasing the level of fundsavailable for individualized care is essential as well as changing policies to increaseincentives for providing individualized services to the most troubled youngsters in oursystems of care. oLimited Access to Individualized Care - It is clear that having a range of servicesin place within the community can provide a supportive environmental context inwhich to implement individualized approaches. It also should be noted that theindividualized approach has been very successful in a number of extremely rural areaswith few formalized services available, such as Alaska, Idaho, and West Virginia.However, because of the labor intensity of this approach, it is unlikely that it couldever be made available to all of the child--.)n and youth with emotional or mentaldisorders who might benefit from it. To date, those states and communitiesimplementing individualized services based on the philosophy and principles outlinedabove, have had to limit access to those youngsters who are the most seriouslydisturbed, who have the most complex functional problems, and who are usually inout-of-state residential care or at risk of being placed in residential care -- a subsetof the total population of youngsters with severe emotional disturbances. 39 In fact, Mac Farquhar and Dowrick (in press) report that of the 15 programs surveyed,the majority were serving fewer than 20 youngsters using an individualized assistanceapproach. The range of number of youth served was five to 165, with a median of six.While it is probable that these programs could serve greater numbers of youngstersif increased flexible dollars were to be made available, there is in all likelihood a pointbeyond which the programs would lose their ability to truly know each child andfamily in the intimate and collaborative manner that now operates among the pioneerprograms. oTraining - One of the largest remaining challenges to implementing individualizedservices is the challenge of reeducating and changing the attitudes of providers. Thiswas first noted by Burchard & Clarke (1990) and confirmed by MacFarquhar &Dowrick (in press).For the most part, currently operating professional trainingprograms, even at the finest universities, are steeped in extremely traditionalapproaches to mental health service delivery. Graduates have little or no exposureto innovative, community-based services, let alone a radical departure such asindividualized services.A treatment philosophy of individualizing services forchildren and families, providing unconditional care, doing whatever it takes to supporta child and family, treating families with respect, and treating families as partnersin the process of developing a service plan is still foreign to many line workers. Thisphilosophy has not been universally adopted by staff in child-serving agencies, nor hasit been incorporated into the curriculum at most universities.When asked the question, \"What is the response of the providers in your communityto a 'wraparound' approach versus the traditional component care?\", over half theprograms in MacFarquhar and Dowrick's study (in press) reported that providers wereskeptical until they saw it actually work. Once they saw and experienced it, mostproviders became convinced and supportive of the individualized care approach.Olson, Whitbeck, and Robinson (1991) reported that even when given permission anda vehicle to provide individualized care, providers often become \"stuck\" by limitingtheir thinking to program components; they suggest that changing the focus of theservicesystem totheindividualized approach requires a paradigm shift.MacFarquhar & Dowrick characterized the response of providers to the individualizedapproach as a developmental process: \"Although maay providers support the notiononce they have seen it work, many still see funding attached to services andcategories, a viewpoint that reflects a misunderstanding of one of the major tenets ofan individualized assistance approach.\"Thus, as is true with the whole range of new community-based services and servicedelivery approaches for children and adolescents with serious emotional or mentaldisorders and their families, an accompanying human resource development strategyneeds to be developed for individualized care. This strategy must address the needsof a heretofore unserved population, and it must be prepared to address the needs ofthis population in all of the life domains. Recruitment and training of professionalstaff as well as aides and support personnel to provide individualized services requireparticular attention and may be both costly and time consuming. Further, staffsupport and quality control present additional challenges for the individualized careapproach in which services are dispersed in the community. Mechanisms for40 monitoring staff and clients must be built into the process of individualizing servicesto ensure the delivery of quality care.The Future of Individualized Services in Systems of CareIn the past, service systems had limited ability to meet individual needs. As recently as1982, Knitzer reported that only a handful of states were even beginning to meet their serviceresponsibility toward children with mental health needs. Further, Knitzer found that ifstates were developing new services, they were focusing on traditional residential care ratherthan more cost-effective, community-based alternatives. Flexible funding was unheard of,and service programs often were bound by rigid eligibility criteria, which often excluded themost-in-need, and set formulas for delivering services to all youngsters. Youngsters who didnot succeed within existing program models typically were rejected and/or referred on to yetanother program. The advent of the system of care concept, explicated by Stroul andFriedman (1986), brought with it a new conceptualization of services for children. Thesystem of care was presented not as a mere network of service, but rather as a philosophyabout the way services should be delivered to troubled children and their families. Thevalues and principles underlying the system of care emphasize child- and family-centeredservices, individualized services. services provided within the least restrictive environment,parent involvement in all phases of service delivery, cultural competence, interagencycollaboration, and case management. Systems of care serving children and adolescents havedeveloped significantly since 1986. Many of these evolving systems have been built on thesevalues and principles, abandoning the less responsive, inflexible, institutionally basedapproaches of the past. One of the first comprehensive, community-based systems of care tobe developed was in Ventura County, California, and much has been learned from theVentura experience about building systems of care based upon this philosophy (Jordan &Hernandez, 1990).The compatibility of individualized services with the state-of-the-art concept and philosophyof a system of care is apparent in two major trends. First, many states and communitieshave incorporated individualized service approaches into their systems of care, particularlyfor the most difficult-to-serve, at-risk youngsters. These approaches, while reserved for arelatively small percentage of the target population, are receiving increasing resources andattention. They are being used to return youngsters from out-of-state and in-state residentialplacements as well as to prevent such placements; evidence regarding the cost-effectivenessof individualized care approaches in meeting these goals is mounting.Second, the principles and processes which characterize individualized services areincreasingly being applied to service programs or \"components\" within systems of care. Forexample, VanDenBerg (1989) describes the modification of \"categorical\" programs inFairbanks to allow for the provision of unconditional care and wraparound services. As aresult of added flexible funds and some program modifications, existing service programs inFairbanks have been able to provide individualized services and reduce their rate of referralfor inpatient hospitalization to the lowest in the state. Another example of a componentprogram which has a history of individualizing service interventions is home-based services.Home-based service programs, both short- and long-term models, provide highly flexibleinterventions which are tailored creatively to the needs of each client family. Most home-based programs are committed to doing whatever it takes to assist a child and family, and41 many have flexible funds that can be used to purchase nontraditional services and supports(Stroul, 1988). Through the integration of individualized services principles and processes,the effectiveness of service programs is enhanced. Thus, the concept of individualized care,with its values and processes, is rapidly spreading throughout modern systems of care bothin its \"pure form\" and as an enhancement or enrichment of existing component programs.It is evident that individualized services and systems of care are mutually dependent at bothconceptual and practical levels. Burchard and Clark (1990) noted that a complete system ofcare continues to be necessary to provide component services, but that an individualizedapproach can greatly enhance the system's cost-effectiveness. Similarly, Duchnowski andFriedman (1990) emphasized that modern systems of care should incorporate the philosophyand process of individualized services. They stated that within the context of acomprehensive system of care, \"the flexibility and creativity to ensure that an individualizedtreatment program is developed for each youth and his or her family is now consideredimperative.\"The ultimate goal for systems of care is that all interventions, in whatever organization orprogrammatic form, be guided by the concept and values of individualized services. Theprocess of assessing needs in an ecological, holistic manner, tailoring services to meet specificneeds, involving families, using interagency strategies, and providing unconditional careshould not be limited to the services provided to the most complex and challengingyoungsters. Rather, this approach should permeate the entire system of care in a community-- a goal which is consistent with, and established by, the current system of care philosophy.The high level of interest and rapid growth in individualized services is apparent in theresults of the MacFarquhar and Dowrick survey (in press); more than half of the programsstudied were initiated within the past three years revealing a significant trend towardincreasing this type of approach nationally. One of the most difficult challenges to be facedby systems of care as they evolve throughout the 1990s may well be to achieve a viablebalance between programmatic service components and individualized care approaches.Burchard and Clark (1990) suggest that the future of individualized care will be determinedby further research and development. However, they note that the approaches developed todate have been encouraging and suggest vast potential to improve services and systems ofcare for troubled children and their families. 42 REFERENCES Achenbach, T.M., & Edelbrock, C.
