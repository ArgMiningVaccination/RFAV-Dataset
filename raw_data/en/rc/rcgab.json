The UCLA prostate brachytherapy program may consist of 1 -2 implant procedures performed in the brachytherapy suite or operating room with up to 3 treatments administered with each implant. The number of treatments you will receive depends upon whether you are receiving HDR brachytherapy alone (Monotherapy) or a combination of HDR brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy (Combi ned therapy). External beam radiation therapy is often referred to as \"EBRT\" and usually begins 2 weeks after completion of brachytherapy. EBRT typically continues for a period of 4- 5 weeks. If you are to have EBRT, your physician or physician assistant (PA) will coordinate with an EBRT doctor in your area so that you may receive this part of the treatment closer to home or work. Before the procedure MEDICAL/CARDIAC CLEARANCE PRIOR TO PROCEDURE You will n eed to have medical and/or cardiac clearance prior to your pre -treatment visit. You will need an EKG, chest xray, labs and/or additional tests such as an echocardiogram or stress test. [ Recommen ded tests by our anesthesia department]. If you are on blood thinners such as Warfarin (Coumadin), your clear ance must include instructions on holding your medications and whether you require a Lovenox bridge while you are off blood thi nners. If you are from out of town, you will also need medical clearance complete d prior to your pre -treatment appointment. PRE-TREATMENT VISIT During the pre -treatment visit, you will meet with a member of the medical staff, review and sign [p rocedur e consent forms ] and have an opportunity to ask questions related to your scheduled procedure. You will also be given prescriptions for post -op medications. We encourage you to fill these prescriptions prior to your scheduled procedure. ONE (1) WEEK BEFORE PROCEDURE One week prior to your procedure, you will need to stop taking aspirin, medications that contain aspirin, NSAIDs or herbal remedies as these medications may cause bleeding. 3 | Page ONE (1) DAY BEFORE PROCEDURE The day before your procedure, you will need to complete a diet and bowel prep. You may have a light breakfast Begin a clear liquid diet at 12pm (noon) - see table below Self-administer a Fleet enema at 6pm (available over -the-counter at your pharmacy) You are to have nothing by mouth after 12am (midnight) Examples of liquids qualifying as \"clear\": Food/Beverage Drink Soups Clear broth or bouillon Packaged vegetable, chicken, or beef broth Sweets Gelatin, such as Jell -O\u00ae Flavored ices Hard candies Beverages Clear fruit juices, such as white cranberry, white grape, apple Soda, such as 7- Up\u00ae, Sprite\u00ae, ginger ale, seltzer, Gatorade\u00ae Tea A nurse from Brachytherapy or the Surgery center will call you one business day before your procedure. He/she will tell you what time you should arrive at the hospital for your procedure (usually 1 hour before scheduled time). They may ask you a few pre- operative questions. ** If you r procedure is scheduled in the main operating room (OR ) in Ronald Reagan UCLA, you will need to call (310) 267- 8899 between 2- 4pm one business day prior to surgery to confirm admission time. 4 | Page The day of your procedure Proceed to the venue location listed on your surgery schedule letter. UCLA Radiat ion Oncology Brachytherapy 200 UCLA Medical Plaza, Suite B265 Los Angeles, CA 90095 Phone: (310) 825- 9775 UCLA Ambulatory Surgery Center 200 UCLA Medical Plaza, Suite 660 Los Angeles, CA 90095 Phone: (310) 794- 1085 UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center 757 Westwood Plaza Los Angeles, CA 90095 Phone: (310) 825- 9111 Things to remember: Bring your home medications in its original bottle. Bring your CPAP machine (if applicable) . Bring light reading material or an Ipad/ipod, if you choose. However, someone will need to hold these items for you when you go into procedure. You may be provided a small locker. If you wear contacts, wear your glasses instead. Remember to bring a case for them. Wear loose -fitting/comfortable clothing (i.e. sweat pants). Leave valuables such as credit ca rds, jewelry, or your checkbook at home. Before you are taken into the procedure room, you will need to remove your hearing aids, dentures, prosthetic device(s), etc. Please bring a case for them, if you have one. If you do not have one, one will be made available for you. UPON ARRIVAL Tell us who you are For safety reasons, you will be asked to verify your name and birth date many times. Patients with the same or similar names may be having procedure on the same day. After you have checked in at the front desk, have a seat in the main waiting area and one of our nurses will be out to meet you shortly. Get dressed for your procedure You will be asked to change into a hospital gown and nonskid socks. Please limit bringing personal items as storage loc ker space is very limited. You will not be allowed to wear personal clothing (including undergarments) into surgery. 5 | Page Prepare for your procedure Once you are dressed, we will have you recline in a gurney in our pre -operative area. Your nurse will ask you a series of questions about your medical/surgical history, any medication allergies, the medications you took the morning of surgery (if applicable), as well as other questions pertinent to the procedure. Your nurse will also explain what to expect once y ou wake up from anesthesia until the time you are discharged. Your nurse or the anesthesiologist will place an intravenous (IV) line into a vein, usually in your arm or hand. The IV line will be used to give you fluids and anesthesia (medication to make you sleep) during your procedure. You will be taken to the procedure room on a gurney. The staff will help you onto the operating bed. Compression boots will be placed on your lower legs. These gently inflate and deflate to help the circulation in your le gs. DURING YOUR PROCEDURE Your radiation oncologist and/or fellow/resident/PA will work together during your procedure. While you are under anesthesia, certain procedures may be performed to evaluate your anatomy in order to ensure the best possible placement of the implant. These may include a digital rectal examination, cystoscopy (looking in the bladder with a small, flexible camera), proctosigmoidoscopy (looking in the rectum with a small lens) and transrectal ultrasound (assessing the prostate with an ultrasound probe in the rectum). Following the exam, a Foley catheter will be placed. A Foley catheter is a soft rubber tube that is inserted into the bladder through the urethra to continuously drain the urine into a bag. Most patients have the Foley catheter removed before they return home, though occasionally a catheter must remain in pl ace for a longer period of time if the patient has difficulties urinating without it. Next, several small plastic hollow implant tubes called \"flexi -guides\" will be implanted . These flexi - guides are what give our team direct access to the prostate gland, allowing for the delivery of radiation internally directly into the tumor site. An ultrasound or CT will be used to guide the procedure and ensure proper placement. AFTER YOUR PROCEDURE Once the implant is complete, you will remain in recovery until the effects from anesthesia have resolved, usually about one hour. You will have a Foley catheter in your bladder to monitor the amount of urine you are making. You will also have compression boots on your lower legs to help your circulation. You may be given a PCA or \"Patient Controlled Analgesia\" pump, which administers pain medication as needed when you press a button. In this case, you control when pain medicine is given, though the pump is programmed with strict limits to prevent unintentional overdosing. Your nurse will teach you how to correctly use your pump, and no one but you or your nurse will be allowed to give you medication from this pump. Your nurse will also likely give you small doses of other forms of medication, which will help keep you comfortable and minimize side effects from any one medication or the PCA pump. 6 | Page Following recovery, you will be taken to the CT (Computed Tomography) scanner for a \"CT simulation\". You will meet your Brachytherapists at this time and will undergo a series of scans. This scan takes approximately one hour to complete. There will likely be small adjustments made to the implant during this time to fine -tune the exact position of your implant in the prostate. The results of the CT scan are sent to our specialized Phys ics/Dosimetry department, who begin creating your customized treatment plan. The creation of this plan takes on average from 2 -3 hours. A nurse will monitor you during this time and help you reposition in bed and keep you comfortable. Your nurse can help y ou reposition yourself either on your side or on your back with your legs on pillows. You do not need to be completely still at all times, just mindful of the implant when changing position, and only change position when a nurse is present to monitor the i mplant. You will be given a low -residue diet (no fresh fruits or vegetables) and encouraged to drink fluids. We suggest you bring along a book to read, crossword puzzles or other portable electronics to keep yourself occupied. Family members should check in at the front desk upon arrival should they want to visit the patient. The nurse will be notified and will bring the family to visit when allowed. Once the treatment plan is complete, you will be transferred into the treatment booth where your radiation therapist will connect the flexi -guides to the HDR afterloader (or \"robot\"). After this, you will be alone in the room for about 20 -30 minutes while the radiation treatment is being given. You will be continuously monitored throughout this time by video camera and will be able to communicate with the radiation therapist via sound system. We ask that you remain as still as possible during the treatment to prevent dislodging the flexi -guides. HDR Treatment Depending on your physician's recommendation, you may receive anywhere between one (1) to three (3) HDR brachytherapy treatments while you are in the hospital. Treatments are done in the Department of Radiation Oncology Brachytherapy Suite. You will not see or feel the radiation. You may hear the machine humming but you will not feel any pain or discomfort. After the treatment is done, the radiation source is moved back into the storage machine. Once the treatment is complete, there is no residual radiation and you will not be \"radioactive\". The radiation therapist will come back and disconnect the cables. If your treatment requires an overnight stay, you will then be taken back to your room, and your treatment will continue the following day. After your last treatment, the implant is removed from your perineum. This is done easily in the brachytherapy suite. Your foley catheter and IV will also be removed. Once you are able to do the following, you will be discharged home: 1. Have a stable vital signs (i.e. blood pressure, heart rate, etc) 2. Pain is controlled 3. Ambulate safely 4. Urinate after foley catheter removal 7 | Page Expected discharge times: Discharge times are discussed on an individual basis once plan of care is confirmed, typically at your pre- treatment appointment . Our team will keep you posted during your admission. (Estimated discharge times) If you have 1 treatment per implant, discharge time is around 5pm on the same day. If you have 2 treatments per implant, discharge time is before 12pm on the following day. If you have 3 treatments per implant, discharge time is around 5pm on the following day. Please keep in mind that your discharge is dependent on various factors and these times are approximate.
