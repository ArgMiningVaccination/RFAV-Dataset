This movement grew out of theProtestant Reformation in the early 16th century. Following years of Bible study, a small group of young scholars concluded that the Reformation leaders,including Martin Luther and Ulrich Zwingli, were notradical enough in their use of Scripture to criticizechurch practices. While the Anabaptist critique included questions about the mass, the use of images,and the morality of church officials, the argumentquickly centered on the role of baptism. On the basisof passages such as Matthew 28:19-20, these youngradicals argued that baptism was solely for believingadults, since infants and small children cannot under-stand the teaching about salvation or repent andpromise to live lives of costly obedience to Christ. 1 The movement's first adult baptisms took place in January 1525, in Z\u00a8 urich, Switzerland. This new movement was immediately declared illegal through-out Europe and its adherents were denounced as\"Anabaptists\"\u2014that is, re-baptizers. The movement was declared illegal, largely because the radicals'insistence on adult baptism and voluntary member-ship in the church was rightly seen as a threat to thesocial fabric of Europe. A central symbol in the cen-turies-old link between church and state, infant bap-tism conferred both church membership and citizen-The Anabaptist Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions By Joseph J.

By insisting on adult baptism, the Ana- baptists were denying the state's authority inmatters of the church and were pulling apart thereligious and political threads of Europe's socialfabric. Within months of the first \"re-baptism,\" the Anabaptists were fleeing for their lives. Drivenby persecution and missionary zeal, Anabaptismspread to many areas of Europe. Thousands ofAnabaptists were imprisoned, tortured, burned,drowned, and even dismembered by bothProtestant and Catholic authorities. Many sto- ries of this harsh persecution and the witness of the early Anabaptists are found in the more than1,100 pages of the Martyrs Mirror \u2014until recent- ly, the book most frequently found (except forthe Bible) in Mennonite homes. The Anabaptists emphasized the authority of Scripture and salvation by grace through faith inChrist. However, they understood theseemphases differently than both the CatholicChurch and the Protestant reformers. 2For instance, the Anabaptists did not entrust theinterpretation of Scripture to individuals orscholars or the church hierarchy. Instead, theScriptures were to be read by all believers whohad received the Holy Spirit, their meaning wasto be discerned in the context of the believingcommunity, and every interpretation was to betested against the Gospels' stories of Christ's lifeand words. The Anabaptists also differed fromthe reformers by asserting that to accept God'sforgiveness in faith was to set out on the way ofdiscipleship\u2014a journey, enabled by the HolySpirit, of following Christ in every aspect of life,including simplicity, accountability withinChristian community, and love of enemy.Combined with the insistence on voluntary bap-tism, these commitments led the Anabaptists toclaim that the true church would be a visiblechurch. Distinct from the state and separate from the evils of the world, the true church is tobe visible through the transformed lives of its members and their commitment to mutual sup-port and accountability. Mennonites, the largest group of Anabaptists,get their name from Menno Simons, a gifted Dutch Catholic priest who joined the Anabaptistmovement in 1536. The Brethren, the nextlargest group, derive from a combination ofRadical Pietist and Anabaptist influences.Beginning in early 18th century Germany, the Brethren fled to North America almost immedi-ately, seeking religious liberty and economicopportunity. The Amish, the next largest group,take their name from Jacob Ammann, a SwissAnabaptist leader who separated from otherAnabaptist groups in 1693. In an attempt atreform within the Anabaptist movement,Ammann advocated stricter policies of churchdiscipline and simple living. Amish communi-ties are usually more geographically and sociallyisolated than their Mennonite siblings. TheHutterites, numbering only around 7,000 adultsin the United States, take their name from JakobHutter, who was tortured and burned alive in1536. 3The Hutterites go beyond mutual aid to a formal community of goods. Although as geo-graphically separate as the Amish, the Hutterites actively engage the broader society in matters ofspirituality and peacemaking. Contemporary Anabaptist groups have a congregational polity. The center of authorityrests largely with the member congregations.However, depending on the Anabaptist group, aregional district or conference may exercise sig-nificant authority, often through the role ofbishops or elders. The Amish do not haveorganizations at the denominational level. WithMennonite and Brethren communities, thedenominational organizations exercise little con-trol over individual congregations. Instead,these organizations enable congregations andconferences to speak with one voice on mattersdeemed important and to collaborate in areas ofmission, education, publication, mutual aid, andservice. Because denominational resolutionsand pronouncements arise from a denomination- wide process of collaborative discernment, theyrepresent the broader community's evenwhile remaining non-binding on individual con-gregations. 2From an Anabaptist perspective, notions of health and illness must be placed in a largertheological context that includes the churchcommunity and its witness to the Kingdom of God, the pervasive power of sin, and Christian stewardship . One instance of situating health within this larger theological framework is thissentence from the Mennonite Church's VisionStatement (adopted 1995): \"God calls us to befollowers of Jesus Christ and, by the power ofthe Holy Spirit, to grow as communities ofgrace, joy, and peace, so that God's healing and hope flow through us to the world.\" This largertheological context is likewise evident when theMennonite Brethren confess, \"We believe thatGod is at work to accomplish deliverance and healing, redemption and restoration in a worlddominated by sin.\" 4 For Anabaptists, health and healing are par- tial manifestations of God's redeeming Kingdom,which broke into the world in Christ and will becomplete at Christ's return. Health and healingare therefore signs of God's redeeming love.However, by framing issues of health in a king-dom context, Anabaptists insist that health cannever be understood in a singularly physicalsense. Moreover, understandings of health mustbe ordered by kingdom priorities and realized in the context of restored relationships. Thus, onewho is physically well is actually unhealthy ifshe is not at peace with God or the church orlives a life of selfishness. Conversely, one who isapproaching death is largely healthy if she lovesGod, is cared for by the church, and has lived a life of justice and mercy. 5 The centrality of the kingdom for understand- ing health is captured by Erland Waltner, formerPresident of Mennonite Health Association, when he describes the search for physical, spiri-tual, and emotional well-being \"as fitness forkingdom life and service.\" 6For people whose life together should witness to God's kingdom,physical health cannot become an idol soughtfor its own sake; nor should health be soughtprimarily to avoid suffering or to maximize ouryears on earth. Instead, health is valued pre-cisely because it allows us to love God and serve our neighbor as a witness to God's inbreakingkingdom. For Anabaptists, the church community is central to the connection between kingdom andhealth. The church is \"a sign of the kingdom ofGod.\" As a distinct, recognizable body, \"the church is called to witness to the reign of Christ by embodying Jesus' way in its own life and pat-terning itself after the reign of God.\" Believingthat Christ is already Lord (although unrecog-nized by the world), and empowered by the HolySpirit, the church strives to pattern its currentlife \"after our life together in the age to come.\"Thus, every aspect of the church's life\u2014from its internal life of fellowship and mutual aid to itsexternal life of proclamation and relief work\u2014isto show \"the world a sample of life under thelordship of Christ.\" 7 This emphasis on the church as a sign of the kingdom helps explain why Anabaptists cannottalk about health and illness without talkingabout restored relationships. From anAnabaptist perspective, the salvation that Godoffers, the kingdom that God is bringing, simul-taneously involves being \"reconciled with Godand brought into the reconciling community ofGod's people.\" 8Thus, the most fundamental notion of health concerns well-being in our rela-tionships with God and others, especially fellowbelievers in the church. All other aspects of health (physical, psychological, economic, etc.)derive their orientation from this basic focus onrestored relationships. 9 The emphasis on the church as a sign of the kingdom also helps to explain the Anabaptistinsistence on mutual aid and bearing eachother's burdens\u2014practices that are directly relat-ed to issues of health and illness. Since thechurch is \"a visible body of Christ mirroring the kingdom of heaven . . . love and corporate careof assumed to be anorm of redeemed behavior.\" 10Anabaptist groups accept the reciprocal responsibility of members within the community to care for eachother's emotional, social, spiritual, material, and 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERphysical needs. At one level, such mutual care implies eco- nomic interdependence and security. TheAmish farmer knows that if he gets sick, fellowchurch members will plow his fields and help pay the hospital bills. Similarly, an urbanMennonite who lacks health insurance can sharethe cost of insurance with the local congregationand denominational institutions. At another level, mutual care means that one is not alone in illness and suffering. Remainingpresent with the sick is a shared responsibility ofthe entire believing community, not just theresponsibility of pastors and deacons or elders.This responsibility is expressed in ways ranging from sitting at the bedside to providing mealsfor the sick individual's family. At still another level, mutual care means that \"in all complex ethical decisions regarding lifeand death, we seek to offer . . . support andcounsel in the context of the Christian commu-nity.\" 11Anabaptist groups insist that hard deci- sions, including serious medical decisions,belong in the context of the prayerful communi- ty. Individuals need not, indeed should not,make such decisions in isolation. They shouldinstead seek the wisdom of the church commu-nity, usually in the form of a small group.Anabaptists insist, moreover, that such commu-nal moral discernment consider the repercus-sions for the church community of any proposedcourse of action. As health and healing are manifestations of God's coming kingdom, suffering and illness are manifestations of sin and its consequences.Although Anabaptists emphasize the ability ofbelievers in community to live faithful and obe- dient lives, most Anabaptist groups have a deepsense of sin's corrupting power. Anabaptists rec-ognize that personal sin can be the cause of suf-fering and illness. Such illness can become anopportunity to repent of one's sins and learn torest secure in God's forgiveness. 12However, Anabaptist groups seldom attribute illness orsuffering to personal sin. 13Instead, Anabaptists have a systemic or cosmic sense of sin and itsrelationship to suffering: \"Through sin, the pow- ers of domination, division, destruction, anddeath have been unleashed in humanity and allof creation.\" Indeed, \"governments, militaryforces, economic systems, educational or reli-gious institutions, family systems, and structures determined by class, race, gender, or nationalityare susceptible to [the] demonic spirits\"unleashed by sin. 14Given this systemic under- standing of sin, Anabaptists readily assume aconnection between suffering and sin withoutthereby assuming the individual sufferer's culpa-bility. Because Anabaptists frame this broad sense of sin within a focus on the kingdom, they arefree to \"recognize and be grateful for whateverways God's healing comes to us,\" whetherthrough prayer and anointing with oil, throughexorcism, or through physicians and therapists. 15 Whatever the mechanism, true healing is a gift of God and a sign that sin's hold on the world isnot final. Precisely because Anabaptists see sinas a real power enslaving humanity and corrupt-ing creation, they see true healing as a real man-ifestation of God's redeeming Kingdom. This sense of sin as a power in the world also explains the meaning that Anabaptists find insuffering. Suffering that is a result of disciple-ship, especially \"suffering for the right withoutretaliation,\" is seen \"as sharing in the sufferingsof Jesus.\" 16Suffering that comes because we refuse to repay evil for evil is for Anabaptists apart of discipleship and, therefore, a participa-tion in Christ. So, too, suffering that derivesindirectly from discipleship\u2014for example, illnessthat comes from a life of solidarity with the pooror sustaining an untimely pregnancy\u2014is seen byAnabaptists as participating in Christ's redemp-tive suffering. 17Such discipleship-based suffer- ing is meaningful as suffering for the kingdomand as a participation in Christ's overcoming ofsin's power in the world. The many forms ofsuffering that do not derive from discipleshipare seen as signs of sin's continuing power inthe world and a reminder that we await the fullrealization of the Kingdom. In all cases of suf- 4 THEANABAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHEPARKRIDGE CENTERfering, Anabaptists strive to trust the sufficiency of God's grace and the love of the believingcommunity. The other theological element that must be mentioned here is Christian stewardship. \"Webelieve that everything belongs to God, who calls us as the church to live as faithful stewardsof all that God has entrusted to us.\" 18 Anabaptists have a strong tradition of steward-ship, including stewardship of our physical, psy-chological, and emotional health. An under- standing of stewardship, rather than a preoccu-pation with personal sin, explains whyAnabaptist groups exhibit lower levels of smok-ing and excessive drinking than the broaderpopulation. Over the last several decades, anunderstanding of \"whole-life stewardship\" ledmost Anabaptist groups to develop congrega-tional and denominational programs promotinglifestyles consistent with health and wellness. 19An emphasis on stewardship also explains why Anabaptists sometimes reject costly therapyand life-sustaining treatment even when theindividual or community can afford them or thetreatment would be covered by insurance. Suchtreatments can be rejected as \"poor steward-ship\"\u2014that is, the misappropriation or misuse ofGod's resources. Thus, the Mennonite Church General Assembly in 1993 affirmed the \"call on both our health care professionals and members to exercise greater restraint and stewardship inthe utilization of healthcare resources.\" Withthe same rationale, the Mennonite Church pub-licly affirmed the idea of a national healthcaresystem that would limit the range of medicalservices that people supportive, emer-gency services.\" 20 5THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP Based on their commitments to communityand reconciled relationships, Anabaptists emphasize individual autonomy far less than iscommon in contemporary American medicine.Thus, Anabaptists frequently involve family, pas- tors, church elders, and other church membersin their decision-making. This involvement canbe so extensive that clinicians deem it a viola- tion of the patient's autonomy or confidentiality.While it is possible for fellow church members to exercise undue pressure on the patient, thecaregivers are more likely witnessing thepatient's faith commitments at work through theinclusion of the community's wisdom and inter-ests in the decision-making process. Anabaptist commitments to nonviolence and freedom of conscience also affect the patient-caregiver relationship. These commitmentsimply, for instance, that Anabaptist healthcareprofessionals must respect choices by individualsthat conflict with their own moral commitments.Such professionals must not violate the patient's or client's conscience or emotional well-being byattempting to impose their own convictions.Conversely, those professionals need not partici-pate in procedures that are contrary to theirmoral convictions, including, for example, abor-tion. When support for decisions not to partici-pate is lacking in broader society, Anabaptisthealthcare professionals should anticipatereceiving moral and economic support in thecongregation and denomination. 21 CLINICAL I SSUES Informed consent, truth-telling, and confidentiality Anabaptist convictions about nonviolence, truth- telling, humans as created in the image of God,and the importance of voluntary commitments 22 provide the foundation for a strong support ofTHEANABAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONScomplete candor and confidentiality in the health worker-patient relationship. Advance directives and proxies Anabaptist groups encourage the use in tandem of both living wills and proxies. Anabaptistgroups view advance directives not as an instru- ment of autonomy, but as an opportunity toexpress Christian faith. For example, in 1993the Mennonite Church General Assembly assert-ed: \"We commit ourselves to completing advance directives (e.g., living wills and proxies)as an affirmation of our beliefs about life anddeath and as a symbol of our commitment tostewardship and justice.\" 23The merits of advance directives include protecting the fami-ly's emotional and financial well-being, witness-ing to belief in the resurrection, and freeingresources for the health care of others. 24 6FAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATION Anabaptist groups greatly value family life, but they are clear that \"in the kingdom of God our family ties take second place to obey- ing the will of God.\" In addition, the \"commu-nity of faith which emerges through belief inJesus Christ is family for believers.\" 25Marriage and biological family thus involve penultimatecommitments. Marriage and biological familyfind their proper orientation and place when setwithin the more fundamental commitment toserve God through the church, the family offaith. This focus on the faith community as afamily explains why many Anabaptist groupsemphasize that \"singleness is honored equallywith marriage, sometimes even preferred.\"Since one already has a family in the church,singleness is an option that may offer \"uniqueopportunities to advance the kingdom of God.\" 26 Anabaptists believe that marriage is \"to be a covenant between one man and one woman forlife.\" This covenant \"is meant for sexual intima-cy, companionship, and the birth and nurture ofchildren.\" 27Most Anabaptists view the marriage relationship as one of mutuality and equality,where inequality and subordination are manifes-tations of 28However, some Amish and conservative Mennonite groups havea more hierarchical view of the family, with thehusband/father exercising clear authority overthe wife and children. While all people need relational and emotion-al intimacy, \"sexual intimacy rightfully takes place only within marriage.\" 29This understand- ing precludes premarital, extramarital, andhomosexual sex. Within the marriage context,however, sexual intimacy is seen as a good giftfrom God meant \"for pleasure and closenessand for procreation.\" 30 Given these understandings of marriage and sexual intimacy, the vast majority of Anabaptistsconsistently reject homosexual genital activity,including sexual activity between same-sex part-ners in a committed relationship, as sinful.Despite the majority support for this position,the question of how to regard homosexual rela-tionships has been the most contentious issue ofthe last several decades within Anabaptist com-munities. There are strong dissenting voices,including the Brethren/Mennonite Council forLesbian and Gay Concerns, which has publisheda newsletter-style periodical ( Dialogue ) for 23 years. There are also congregations that havebeen placed under district discipline for their acceptance of same-sex partnerships. Yet, inJuly 2001, the largest Anabaptist group reaf-firmed the teaching position of previous church\"statements describing homosexual, extramaritaland premarital sexual activity as sin.\" 31 This rejection of homosexual sexual activity is not meant to be a \"rejection of those . . . witha different sexual orientation\" or a \"lack ofcompassion for their struggle to find a place insociety and in the church.\"32Indeed, sympathy with this struggle led the Mennonite CentralCommittee in 1998 to endorse a letter sent byvarious Protestant church agencies to congres-sional representatives urging rejection of a billthat would legalize discrimination against feder-al employees on the basis of sexual orientation. 33 All Anabaptist groups view children as \"a gift from God.\"34Consequently, \"children are to be loved, disciplined, taught, and respected in thehome and in the church.\" 35Children are also taught to honor their parents. Anabaptists donot baptize babies, but they do offer child dedi-cations, at which parents vow \"to provide theirchildren with a Christian home\" and the church family commits itself to share in that responsi-bility. 36 While maintaining that \"sexual purity, believ- ers marrying believers, lifetime marriages, lovingfamilies, and fulfilling singleness\" arenormative, 37Anabaptists also recognize that \"some in the church experience divorce, abuse,sexual misconduct, and other problems thatmake marriage and family life burdensome andeven impossible.\" In these situations, thechurch strives, however imperfectly, to be a \"reconciling and forgiving community [that]offers healing and new beginnings.\" 38 CLINICAL IS SUES AND PROCEDURES Contraception Most Anabaptist groups readily accept the use of various contraceptive methods. In 1961 aMennonite statement on parenthood includesthe assertion that \"we do not regard as evil thereasonable spacing of children through methodsapproved by Christian physicians.\" 39By 19 74, a study book on abortion for the GeneralConference Mennonite Church mentions oralcontraceptives, mechanical barriers, spermicides,and the rhythm method as appropriate methodsfor preventing pregnancy. 40 The main rationales for accepting contracep- tion are stewardship and preventing the unwant-ed pregnancies that often lead to abortion. Regarding the former rationale, a 1985Mennonite study book says that \"our under-standing of Christian stewardship envelops allareas of our lives, including that of family plan-ning.\" 41The context of this statement suggests concern for Christian stewardship of both familyfinances and the earth's ecosystem. 42 Regarding the latter rationale, a 1980 Mennonite statement on abortion says that\"where children are not wanted, proper contra-ception should be used to prevent pregnancy.We believe that many abortions could be pre- vented if persons would take responsibility forsexual behavior.\" 43While wanting to maintain the importance of chastity outside of marriageand faithfulness within marriage, mostAnabaptists would advocate the use of contra-ception for anyone who is sexually active anddoes not wish to become pregnant. 44 The Amish constitute a probable exception to this affirmation of contraceptive methods.Amish communities distrust the world's valuesand are very cautious in their appropriation ofnew technology\u2014recognizing that new technolo-gy frequently has unforeseen negative conse- quences for community life. When this appre-hension is combined with the great value thatAmish place on children and large families, it islikely that many Amish communities will frownon contraception. Sterilization A 1974 study for the General ConferenceMennonite Church includes sterilization as anacceptable means of pregnancy prevention. This study recommends vasectomy as the prefer- able form of sterilization. 45Vasectomies are common among married Anabaptist men whohave children. New reproductive technologies Anabaptist groups offer a cautious acceptance of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The acceptancecomes from the high value placed on childrenwithin families. The cautiousness relates to 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHEANABAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSquestions of stewardship\u2014whether pursuing this course is the best use of time and money\u2014andfears that IVF is too closely associated with prac-tices that diminish human dignity, such as ware-housing fertilized eggs and using selective abor-tion to reduce risk in cases of multiplegestation. 46 There is a debate among Anabaptists as to whether artificial insemination by donor (AID)is sometimes acceptable. AID was affirmed as apossible blessing for infertile couples in aMennonite study document. This judgment hasbeen challenged on grounds that it gives inade- quate attention to the negative consequences fora broad range of familial, marital, societal, andpsychological considerations. 47 While there are no official statements, it is clear that Anabaptists reject the use of surrogatemothers. Besides questions of stewardship, thisrejection is based on several interrelated con-cerns: introducing a third party into the mar-riage relationship; unnecessarily breaking the bond formed between mother and child during pregnancy; using another's body to achieve ourends, and turning children into commodities. 48 Disease treatment of pregnant mothers There are no official statements on this topic. Abortion While there are differences of opinion within the Anabaptist churches about when abortionsmight be justified, numerous church-wide dis-cussions and official statements over severaldecades show remarkable uniformity in theirapproach to this question. 49First, the vast majority of intentional abortions, especiallythose used as a mechanism of family planningor contraception, are viewed as wrong, repre-senting sinful acts that are not pleasing to God.In explaining this view, Anabaptist churches donot appeal to rights language or to argumentsabout the personhood of the human fetus.Instead, the explanations are theological: life isa gift from God, and that gift deserves respect.We (including the unborn) have incalculablevalue simply because we are loved by God. Given their communal orientation, Anabaptists also affirm the contribution thatchildren make to the community. Therefore they ask about the long-term ramifications forcommunity life when the unborn are not valuedhighly. Anabaptists insist that we recognize thatdecisions to terminate pregnancy affect theentire church community directly or indirectly. Second, despite the firm opposition to abor- tion, there is a near-universal rejection of effortsto promote legislative initiatives that would pro-hibit abortion. The commitment to nonviolence,a strong sense of the church-state distinction,and the expectation (expressed in adult baptism)that Christian moral convictions will differ fromthose of the larger society, make Anabaptistsready to abandon legislative control of the largerculture. Third, there is a recognition of the multiple, complex social conditions that contribute tounwanted pregnancies and the resort to abortion.Consequently, Anabaptists focus on alternativesto abortion and on programs that address theunderlying causes. This focus includes elementssuch as promoting adoption and responsible sex-ual behavior. It also includes programs to assistunmarried pregnant women, single mothers, andfamilies with children with disabilities. Overall,there is a commitment to work toward a societythat values women and children, childbearingand child rearing, family life, and mutualitybetween women and men. Fourth, the communal emphasis means that in those rare situations of genuine conflictbetween mother and unborn child, prayerful dis- cernment should be sought within the context ofthe believing community, usually in a smallgroup setting. This communal emphasis also means a commitment to stand with those endur-ing difficult pregnancies and to share in theresponsibility of raising the children. Finally, there are repeated reminders against judgmental attitudes toward those with differentconvictions and repeated calls to show care forthose who have had abortions. 8THEPARKRIDGE CENTERCare of severely handicapped newborns There are no official statements regarding neonatal intensive care for severely handicappednewborns. The high regard for all children, thevalues of stewardship and communal discern-ment, and belief in the resurrection would play arole in these decisions. Within Anabaptist circles there is, however, a tradition of caring for children with moderate tovery severe disabilities. There is also a quantity of literature that addresses parental struggles,recounts efforts at community support, anddescribes what people gain in love, self-knowl-edge, and knowledge of God while learning tocare for these children. One such resource isthe quarterly publication, Dialogue on Disabilities , now in its twenty-second year. 50 9There are no official statements regarding genetic research and its ramifications. Anabaptist groups are just beginning seriousconversations about how the church shouldrespond to the various developments in genetictechnology. However, it is clear that Anabaptistgroups would reject germ line efforts at \"enhancement\" and are concerned about theways in which the use of genetic technology mayexacerbate problems of racial or gender discrim-ination and the economic disparities betweenrich and poor. 51 CLINICAL I SSUES Genetic testing and counseling Most Anabaptist groups would support \"genetic counseling where genetic diseases are possible.\"52Sex selection All Anabaptist groups would agree with thisstatement: \"We believe that prenatal screeningtechniques should be permitted only for diag-nosing the most serious genetic problems andcertainly not for the determination of sex orother genetic characteristics.\" 53 Selective abortion The tradition's strong opposition to abortion and the great value placed on fetal life rule outselective abortion except in the most extremecases, i.e., when the mother's life is endangeredor when it is impossible to carry all the fetusesto term. In such cases, the mother/familyshould be surrounded by the church communityfor discernment and support. Gene therapy There are no official positions on gene therapy.GENETICSTHEANABAPTIST TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSThere is among Anabaptists a certain ambiva- lence regarding organ and tissue transplan- tation. The procedures themselves are notviewed as problematic, and the Anabaptistemphases on loving service to neighbor andmutual aid would seem to argue for extensivechurch promotion of organ donation. 54Indeed, many Anabaptists do sign organ donation cards.However, among many Anabaptists, the highcost and limited availability of transplants are\"viewed as symbolic of the excess and individu-alism in health care which thwarts every attemptto provide basic care and equality in the healthcare system.\" 55As a result of this ambivalence, Anabaptist churches do not actively promote ordiscourage organ donation and, in consultationwith their communities, some Anabaptists will decline to be placed on recipient lists. CLINICAL I SSUES Use of fetal tissue There are no official statements on this issue. However, the tradition's high regard for fetallife, along with concerns about encouragingfuture abortions, means that Anabaptist groupswould reject harvesting of tissue or organs fromaborted fetuses for use in transplantation orresearch. 56 10ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION MENTAL HEALTH Anabaptist groups, especially the Mennonite churches, have an extensive tradition of offering care and services to those sufferingfrom mental illness. During World War II, thou-sands of conscientious objectors (the majorityfrom Anabaptist traditions) were assigned totwo- to four-year service terms in state mentalhospitals and training schools for the mentallyretarded through Civilian Public Service (CPS).The conditions in the state hospitals were deplorable. By sharing their observations withthe public, in part through a 1946 issue of Life magazine, the CPS men helped effect reform inthese institutions. More important, these menhelped establish change through the quality oftheir service\u2014by working hard and showing gen-uine care and interest in the patients. The CPSmen also engaged in educational efforts to helpthem better prepare for their work in these hos-pitals. Out of this direct involvement with mental illness, Mennonites began to develop \"a visionof what might be done with rightly motivated psychiatric aides and mental health profession-als.\" 57This vision led to the establishment of the Mennonite Mental Health Services, variousother mental health programs, and severalchurch-related psychiatric hospitals. Currently, of the few church-related psychi- atric hospitals in North America, over half ofthem are affiliated with the Mennonite church.Like other such hospitals, these institutions use a variety of therapeutic strategies and strivefor a high level of professional competency.They also strive to respect individuals as children of God and to offer, but not impose, the resources of faith and community. Servicesare provided to all faith groups. At the congre-gational level, there are repeated reminderswithin the Mennonite churches of the need tobe welcoming communities that offer emotional and economic support for people struggling with emotional and mental illness. 58There are no official church statements regarding the issues surrounding medical experimentation and research. 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERMEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCH For Anabaptists, death is not the greatest evil, nor one to be avoided at all costs. While dif- fering on whether there is an afterlife thatbegins immediately after death, Anabaptists agree that \"since Christ destroyed the power ofdeath . . . believers need not be afraid of death,the last enemy.\" 59Anabaptists look forward to God's final victory over the powers of evil and sin, to the resurrection of the dead, and to thekingdom come in full. In Anabaptist communities, death is an occa- sion for community support of the bereaved.Members gather around the family, supportthem, and offer their services. When thedeceased has died well, often the gathering isnot only an occasion to mourn the loss of aloved one but also a time to celebrate the well-lived life of a fellow believer. CLINICAL I SSUES Suicide, assisted suicide, and active euthanasia Anabaptists believe that \"God values human life highly.\" Moreover, life is a gift and a trust thatis not at our disposal. Anabaptists thereforereject \"procedures to God's sovereignty.\" 60These procedures violate the sanctity of life and usurpGod's role in determining the time of our death. Suffering and pain are an inevitable part of life in a broken world. Thus, rather than seek-ing to determine the time of their own deaths,Anabaptists seek God's \"grace to suffer with dignity.\" 61In times pain and suffering, Anabaptists will gratefully accept palliative careas a sign of grace and accept the community's efforts to share in the suffering and pain. Forgoing life-sustaining treatment Because they believe in the resurrection and do not view death as the last word or the worst evil,Anabaptists see it as often appropriate to stop pro-cedures or forgo treatments that simply impede aninevitable, natural death. To some, this positionwill appear to contradict Anabaptist convictionsregarding euthanasia and suicide. However, forAnabaptists there remains an important distinctionbetween aiming at death and allowing people to die. 62The former implicitly rejects God's rule over our lives; the latter accepts God's timing for ourdeaths. Because the application of such distinc-tions is often quite difficult in practice, Anabaptiststrust that \"these kinds of decisions are best madein community\u2014with the individual, the family, thephysician, and a praying church family cooperat-ing and seeking a wise decision.\" 63 Last rites, burial, and mourning traditions Anabaptist groups do not have \"last rites.\" Thefuneral and burial services include the liturgicalelements of singing, scripture reading, prayer, andsermons. Anabaptist services tend to be muchless formal than most Protestant or Catholic litur-gies. Anabaptist funeral and mourning traditions usually include significant story sharing by thefamily and church community.

Ibid., 153. The reference to \"active suicide\" is meant to distinguish the active aiming at death in suicide orassisted suicide from appropriate cases of allowing todie by removing life-sustaining technology. In suchcases the likelihood of death is recognized, but deathis not directly sought. Most Anabaptist groups recog-nize that numerous factors may play a part in an indi-vidual's decision to commit suicide. For example, sui-cide may be the tragic result of mental illness, andthus grow out of the fallen conditions of creation.Sometimes suicide is an act of fear or despair that mayalso reflect the community's failure to surround theindividual with appropriate comfort care and support.At other times, suicide is an act of hubris wherebyhumans claim the divine prerogative of determiningthe timing of life and death. By contrast, allowingsomeone to die by removing life-sustaining technology(sometimes mistakenly referred to as passive suicide)is often a humble acknowledgement of God's timingand of human limitations in the face of death. 61.

Increasingly,healthcare workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ- ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated by authorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, they should be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
