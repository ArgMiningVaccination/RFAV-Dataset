Methods: Analysis of individual-level web browsing data linked with survey responses from representative samples of Americans collected between October 2016 and February 2019. Results: We estimate that approximately 84% of Americans visit a vaccine-related webpage eachyear. Encounterswithvaccine-skepticalcontentarelessfrequent;theymakeuponly7.5% ofvaccine-relatedpageviewsandareencounteredbyonly18.5%ofpeopleannually. However, these pages are more likely to be published by untrustworthy sources. Moreover, skeptical content exposure is more common among people with less favorable vaccine attitudes. Fi- nally, usage of online intermediaries is frequently linked to vaccine-related information expo- sure. Googleuseisdierentiallyassociatedwithsubsequentexposuretonon-skepticalcontent, whereasexposuretovaccine-skepticalwebpagesisassociatedwithusageofwebmailand,toa lesser extent, Facebook. Conclusions: Online exposure to vaccine-skeptical content is relatively rare, but vigilance is required given the potential for exposure among vulnerable audiences.

Many scholars identify the internet and social media as important vectors for the spread of information questioning the safety and eectiveness of vaccines, citing webpages (e.g., Zimmerman et al. 2005; Kata 2010; Elkin, Pullon and Stubbe 2020), and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter (e.g., Betsch etal.2012;Chakrabortyetal.2017;Homanetal.2019;Jamisonetal.2020;Shahetal.2019)as keyplatformsforitsdissemination. Exposuretothistypeofdubiouscontentmayworsenpeople's attitudes toward vaccines and dicult to refute (e.g., Betsch et al. 2010; Jolley and Douglas 2014; Dunn et al. 2015; Nyhan et al. 2014) \u2014 an especially important risk to understand in the context of expected future vaccines during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Analysesthathavebeenconductedtodateoverwhelminglyfocusonthesupplyofonline(mis)information about vaccines or the eects of exposure to that information. By comparison, relatively little is known about the vaccine information people actually consume online and its relationship to both their attitudes toward the topic and the communication formats and platforms that they use. To eectively address the problem of vaccine hesitancy, it is essential to learn what vaccine- related information people actually see online and the means by which they are exposed to it. To do so, we conduct the most systematic measurement to date of vaccine-related information expo- sure online in the United States, analyzing survey and linked online behavioral data from seven largenationallyrepresentativesamplescollectedfromlate2016toearly2019. Thesedataallowus to measure how much vaccine information is consumed online, what proportion of it is skeptical toward vaccines, and to examine how these consumption patterns relate to both people's attitudes toward vaccines and their social media usage. Ouranalysesconsiderthreespecicconcernsaboutvaccineinformationonline. First,weeval- uate the quantity and type of vaccine-related information people consume online to identify how much of it is skeptical about the safety and ecacy of vaccines. Second, we consider the rela- tionship between people's attitudes or beliefs toward vaccines and the information they consume online. Many observers fear that people with strong views or misinformed beliefs will become trappedin\"echochambers\"oflike-mindedsourcesonline(Sunstein2001). Thoughbehavioralev- idencesuggeststhesefearsareoverstated(Guess2020;Guess,NyhanandReifler2020;Guessetal. 2018), little is known about the extent of selective exposure to online information about vaccines. Finally, we consider the role of social media platforms, search engines, and email in exposure to vaccine-related webpages and the extent to which their use is associated with the consumption of vaccine-skeptical information. 1Methods We analyze the contents and correlates of people's online exposure to vaccine-related information usingsurveyresponseslinkedwithindividual-levelbehavioraldatadetailingthewebsitesthatpeo- ple visit. Our data come from seven nationally representative surveys we conducted among U.S. adults between October 2016 and February 2019 via the survey company YouGov. The data in- cludedsurveyresponsesaswellaswebbrowsingbehaviordatafromtheperiodaroundthesurvey, which was collected from participants with their informed consent. We analyze responses to the surveys for which corresponding behavioral data is available. Wealsoanalyzetherelationshipbetweenbehavioraldataandvaccineattitudesamongthesubset of respondents for whom prior survey measures of vaccine attitudes are available. The attitude data uses the mean response (adjusted for direction) to a ten-question battery adapted from Freed etal.(2010)(seeOnlineAppendixAforwording). Thesedatawerecollectedbyoneoftheauthors (redacted)fromasubsetofrespondentsinseparatesurveysconductedfromOctober2-30,2014and July 30-September 28, 2015. Mean responses are calculated by respondent and include responses to both scales where available; \"don't know\" responses are treated as missing. The behavioral data we observe consists of a stream of URLs visited by respondents on their desktop and laptop computers during the period around each of the national surveys. These data comefromYouGovsurveypanelistswho,inadditiontoparticipatinginsurveys,haveconsentedto alsoprovidebehavioraldataforadditionalincentives. Thesedataarelinkedbythevendortothese respondents' survey data and provided to researchers for an additional fee. The data provided by the vendor to the researchers is anonymized. Weidentifyvaccine-relatedinformationfromvisitedURLsusingkeywordlteringandhuman coding(seetheOnlineAppendixforamoredetaileddescription). First,weattemptedtoscrape(i.e., extract)thetextoftheURLsthatrespondentsvisitedduringtheperiodsinwhichweobservetheir onlinebehavior. (Pagesthatwerenotavailablewerelikelyeitherexpiredlinksorqueryresultsthat Among the 74% of unique URLs whose text could be successfully scraped, we then identied all pages visited by respondents in which words with the stem \"vacc\" appeared three or more times in the text (a total of 3,508 unique URLs). Finally, we coded each of these pages for whether the information it provided about vaccines is skeptical about their safety and ecacy or not, which we refer to below as the documents identied by the keyword ltering process. 2Following Guess, Nyhan and Reifler (2020), we then combine the URL exposure data and set of coded vaccine URLs to create two outcome measures for each survey respondent using the be- havioraldataassociatedwiththeirsurveyresponse. First,wecalculatebinaryindicatorsofwhether they visited one or more vaccine-skeptical webpages and/or more non-skeptical webpages duringtheperiodaroundthesurvey.

Finally,weassessthequalityoftheseweb- pagesusingthelistofuntrustworthywebsitescompiledbyGrinbergetal.(2019)andtheprevalence of.govand.edudomains. We use these data to better understand the process by which people encounter online content about vaccines. Though it is not possible to measure on-platform behavior directly, we estimate the prevalence of visits to prominent social media, email, and search websites immediately prior to visiting a vaccine-related webpage (i.e., if those sites were visited in the prior 30 seconds and were among the three preceding URLs). We follow an analogous approach to measure platform use immediately after a visit. We supplement this analysis by measuring visits to the Facebook pagesof prominentanti-vaccinegroups,an importantpotentialsourceof vaccineskepticism(e.g., Chiou and Tucker 2018). We construct a list of 22 of the most important anti-vaccine Facebook groups based on reporting by journalists and an analysis of anti-vaccine advertisers on Facebook (Broderick 2019; We estimate linear regression models using ordinary least squares, pooling data across waves (i.e.,combiningresponsesfrommultiplesurveys).

In addition,weincludepanelxedeectstoaccountforanytime-specicdierencesbetweensurvey waves. Finally, we apply survey weights constructed by YouGov so that the characteristics of our sample resemble those of the U.S. population to the maximum extent possible. (Corresponding modelswithoutsurveyweightsarereportedintheOnlineAppendix;generalizedlinearmodelsare not estimated due to perfect separation in logistic regression models. Replication data and code will be made available online upon publication of this article.) Results Respondent characteristics We analyze behavior data from 7,320 unique individuals who participated in one or more of the YouGov surveys we conducted between October 2016 and February 2019. These individuals rep- 3resent7,320ofthe12,017uniqueindividualsinoursurveydataandprovided13,494ofthe19,308 observed responses. We observe an average of 26.6 days of behavioral data per respondent among those for whom web trac data is available. Table 1 provides specic elding dates, sample sizes, and demographic characteristics of the participants for whom behavioral data is available and compares them to the full set of survey respondents. In general, the set of respondents for whom behavioral data are available is virtually indistinguishable from the total pool of survey respondents on observable demographic measures such as sex, education, race, parental status, party, and age.

Partisan statistics do not include respondents who report leaning toward one party. Vaccine attitudes data include only responses for which corresponding online behavior data is also available. We also measure prior vaccine attitudes for 1,250 respondents for whom such measures are available. Forthismeasure,thesamplemeanis3.88ona1-5scalewhere5indicatesthemostpos- itive view of vaccines. For presentational purposes, we categorize into three whatfavorable\")hasameanof4;andthelowesttercile(whichwecall\"leastfavorable\")hasamean of2.95. Thepointsofdivisionbetweenthegroupsare3.61and4.37,whichrepresentapproximately the 33thand 67thpercentiles of the vaccine attitudes distribution. Prevalence and content of online vaccine information exposure Our data indicate that 12.6% of respondents were exposed to at least one vaccine-related webpage during the period for which behavioral data is available. Assuming that exposure rate is uniform over time and respondents, it is equivalent to an annualized rate of 84% given the mean number of days of behavioral data we observe per response (26.59; see Online Appendix A for details on 4how we calculate this quantity). In other words, at the rate of exposure found in our data, we expectthatmostAmericansareexposedtoatleastonevaccine-relatedwebpageperyear. However, exposure rates vary dramatically between vaccine-skeptical content and other types of vaccine- related information. We nd that just 1.48% of respondents visited a vaccine-skeptical webpage during the periods when behavioral data was being recorded, which is equivalent to an annualized rate of 18.5% given the mean number of days of behavioral data we observe. Bycontrast,thefrequencyofexposuretonon-skepticalcontentismuchhigher\u2014approximately 11.76%ofrespondentsvisitedawebpagethatwasnotclassiedasskepticalwhenbehavioraldata wasbeingrecorded,whichisequivalenttoanannualizedrateof82%. Thevolumeofconsumption of webpages related to vaccines is similarly skewed toward non-skeptical content. In total, 92.5% of the related pages that respondents viewed were not skeptical about vaccine safety or ecacy. Visits to vaccine-related webpages are not common; the distribution is instead heavily skewed due to high levels of exposure among a small subset of respondents. In the period of observation, the99thpercentileofexposuretovaccine-skepticalcontentforanindividualrespondentisonepage andthemaximumis72pages. Similarly,the 95thpercentileofobservedexposuretonon-skeptical vaccine content is 3 pages, the 99thpercentile is 10 pages, and the maximum is 249 pages. Whichsiteswithvaccine-relatedcontentarepeoplevisiting? Table2liststhetopnon-vaccine- skeptical (left column) and vaccine-skeptical (right column) web domains in our data. Wikipedia dominates the non-skeptical list with 230 visits total from our sample, followed by the Centers for DiseaseControl's CDC.gov with64visits. Alsoprominentonthelistaretrustworthymedicalsites (MayoClinic,WebMD),mainstreamnewssources( New York Times ,Axios,NationalPublicRadio), and Petco, which is a source of information about pet vaccines. The vaccine-skeptical sources appear to be a combination of sites purporting to oer news and information about natural health (e.g., Mercola), blogging platforms where anyone can post (e.g., Wordpress), and untrustworthy newswebsites(e.g.,YourNewsWire),thoughtheyalsoincludegeneralsiteswithnewsandopinion (e.g., azcentral.com). To more systematically characterize the dierences in informational quality between vaccine- skeptical and non-skeptical content, we measure the dierence in the prevalence of websites that Grinberg et al. (2019) identify as untrustworthy among the vaccine-related webpages that Ameri- cans visit. In total, we nd that 21.5% of pageviews of vaccine-skeptical content come from sites thathavebeenspecicallyidentiedasunreliablecomparedtoonly0.2%amongthenon-skeptical content. Similarly, 12.4% of pageviews of non-skeptical content went to .govor.edudomains (where informational quality is likely higher on average) compared to 0.8% for skeptical content. 5Table 2: Top domains cdc.gov 64 collective-evolution.com 20 azcentral.com 3 healthline.com 16 democracynow.org 3 Relationship between vaccine attitudes and information exposure Dopeopleseekoutvaccineinformationthatisconsistentwiththeirattitudestowardvaccines?

However, the dierence is more stark for visits to non-skeptical vaccine content \u2014 nearly 19% of respondents with the most favorable attitudes toward vaccines were ex- posed to one or more vaccine-related webpages that were not skeptical about the safety or ecacy of vaccines compared to just 8% of respondents with the least favorable attitudes. In other words, people with more favorable attitudes toward vaccines were relatively more likely to be exposed to lessskepticalinformationaboutthetopic,whichcouldbetheresultofpeoplewithmorefavorable attitudesseekingpro-attitudinalinformation,peoplewithlessfavorableattitudesavoidingcounter- attitudinal information, or some combination of the two (our data do not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities).

Originators of online vaccine information Followingpriorresearchonnewsintermediariesandincidentalexposure,weexplorethepathways by which people arrive at vaccine-related information online. Given concerns about the role of social media and especially Facebook in spreading vaccine skepticism and misinformation, one possibleapproachistoconsidertheassociationbetweenFacebookusageandexposuretovaccine- skeptical information. In the Online Appendix, we show that Facebook usage is associated with greater exposure to vaccine-skeptical websites conditional on basic demographic and online be- haviorcovariates. However,thiscorrelationalapproachcannotruleoutthepossibilitythatvaccine skepticism encourages greater Facebook use or that the relationship is an artifact of confounding by unobservables. 7Table 3: Correlates of exposure to All models include panel xed eects.

(We provide an equivalent gure including Bing and Twitter in the Online Appendix.) The left panel of Figure 2 shows that Google appears to play an outsize role in promoting ex- posure to non-skeptical content. Visits to Google immediately preceded 11.2% of visits to non- skeptical webpages related to vaccines compared with 6.3% of vaccine-skeptical webpages and 3.1% of unrelated content. (The most frequent search terms we observe and their frequency are listed in the Online Appendix.) By contrast, we observe suggestive evidence of greater use of webmail sites such as Gmail immediately prior to visits to vaccine-skeptical webpages. In total, approximately 7.9% of vaccine-skeptical webpages were immediately preceded by visits to web- 9mailsitescomparedto3.8%ofnon-skepticalwebpages(and9.9%ofunrelatedwebpages). Finally, we observe only modest evidence that Facebook use is associated with visits to vaccine-skeptical content. Specically, 5.1% of visits to vaccine-skeptical webpages were immediately preceded by visitstoFacebookcomparedto2.8%ofnon-skepticalwebpages(and3.5%ofunrelatedwebpages). TherightpanelofFigure2presentsaparallelanalysisofvisitstoFacebook,Google,andweb- mail after exposure to vaccine-related webpages. We nd that Google use is greatly diminished immediatelyafterexposuretonon-skepticalwebpagescomparedtoimmediatelybefore(4.9%com- pared to 11.2%), suggesting that it predominantly acts as a gateway to non-skeptical content. Pat- terns of Facebook and webmail use are more similar before and after exposure, suggesting that respondents may switch back and forth between these sites and specic pages. We buttress the evidence above by analyzing visits to the Facebook pages of prominent anti- vaccinegroupsandgroupsthatpublishanti-vaccineadsonFacebook(seetheOnlineAppendixfor the list of groups). Though we cannot observe the contents of respondents' news feeds, we only observe 11 respondents out of 13,494 visiting a page associated with one of these groups in their desktop or laptop web browser (i.e., loading a URL in which the group name or its Facebook ID appearsintheURLofapublicpageorpublicpostbythegroup). Onlyonerespondentinourdata visited more than three such pages from anti-vaccine Facebook groups. Discussion Ouranalysisofmorethan134millionpageviewsbyourparticipantsshowsthatvisitstowebpages that are skeptical of the safety and ecacy of vaccines are relatively uncommon. We estimate that only 18.5% of Americans visit one or more vaccine-skeptical webpages per year at an annualized rate. These skeptical webpages are more likely to be published by untrustworthy websites. More- over, exposure rates are higher among people with the least favorable attitudes toward vaccines. Among this group, more than 18% of pageviews go to skeptical webpages compared to only 2% amongpeoplewiththemostfavorableattitudes. Finally,weanalyzetherolesofsocialmedia,email, andsearchenginesinpromotingexposuretovaccine-relatedinformation. Ourresultsindicatethat Google is an especially important gateway to non-skeptical vaccine content and that exposure to vaccine-skepticalcontentappearsdierentiallyassociatedwithwebmailuseand,toalesserextent, Facebook use. These results indicate that both prior attitudes and online information sources play an important role in the online information that Americans consume about vaccines, providing an importantpre-COVIDbaselinefortheamountandtypeofvaccineinformationthatpeopleconsume online. Nonetheless, we face important limitations in our data that should be noted. First, we cannot observerespondentactivitybefore,after,orbetweenthedatacollectionperiodsforourstudies. Sec- 10ond, it is not possible for us to directly observe respondent exposure to information on Facebook or Twitter or on mobile devices. Mobile web tracking data is limited to domains only, preventing us from replicating our article-level coding procedure for those devices. In addition, mobile data is typically only available for a small share of tracking samples (Guess, Nyhan and Reifler 2020).

Fourth,welackdataonourrespondents'oineinformationexposureorsocialconnections,which may dier from what they consume online. Finally, our data do not extend to the COVID-19 pan- demic;futureresearchshouldexamineonlineinformationconsumptiononceavaccineforthenovel coronavirus vaccine is approved and widespread vaccination campaigns begin. We also acknowledge potential limitations in our analytical approach. We relied on a keyword searchandmanualcodingprocedurethatisfeasibleonadatasetwithmillionsofobservationsand that allows us to achieve high face validity and intercoder reliability. However, this approach does not allow us to reliably measure every brief, subtle, or context-specic reference to vaccines. Despitethoselimitations,ourresultsidentifyunfullledopportunitiesforplatformstopromote accurate information about vaccines. Incidental exposure to non-skeptical information about vac- cines currently appears to be quite rare; many visits to non-skeptical pages appear to originate ei- therfromGooglesearchesforvaccine-relatedinformationorpurposefulvisitstospecicwebsites. Platforms could better promote incidental exposure to accurate information (e.g., via Facebook's COVID-19 Information Center or Google's COVID-19 information dashboard). We must also re- mainvigilantinmonitoringthequalityofvaccine-relatedinformationontheonlineplatformsthat now shape Americans' information diets, especially as COVID-19 vaccine candidates approach regulatory approval.

First,webpageHTMLislteredthroughthe boilerpipeR packageinR.Specically,the command DefaultExtractor is used to extract text. 2. Text is converted to individual words by splitting the string apart at spaces using strsplit(x, '[[:space:]]', perl = TRUE) . 3. Using regular expressions, we count the number of times \"anti-vax\" and \"vaccin\" appear in the text with the greplcommand. Case is ignored. The search term \"vaccin\" allows for a variety of matches, including, e.g., \"Vaccination\", \"anti-vaccine\", \"vaccines\", etc. 4. A webpage is considered relevant for inclusion if it contains at least three vaccine-related keywords.Vaccine content coding protocol Weuseabinaryclassicationprocedureforthetextofeachwebpageparticipantsvisitedinwhich at least three vaccine-related keywords were included. Specically, each text is coded as being negative/skeptical toward vaccines or not. Coding as negative/skeptical Weusetheterms\"negative\"and\"skeptical\"ratherthan\"anti-vaccine\"becausetheybettercapture thefullsetofmessagestowhichpeoplearelikelytobeexposedthatcouldpotentiallyharmpublic condence in vaccines. \"Anti-vaccine\" implies a straightforward possibly total opposition to vaccination,whichisarareviewpointthatisnotcommonlyexpressedinpubliccommunication. By contrast,skepticalornegativemessagescouldunderminefaithinapprovedvaccineseveniftheydo notreflectanexplicitlyanti-vaccineviewpoint. Ifanarticleisskewedtowardsnegativeinformation and portrays vaccines as unnecessary or dangerous for the average person, or otherwise questions vaccine schedules, it should be coded as negative/skeptical. For instance, a message that acknowl- edgesthepotentialbenetsofvaccinesbutheavilyemphasizestheriskscouldpromoteskepticism and vaccine hesitancy despite not being \"anti-vaccine\" as such. This category should also include messages that promote conspiracy theories about government agencies or vaccine manufacturers ormessagesthatemphasizeineectiveness(evenifthearguedcostisminimal). Commonvaccine- skeptical claims include: people or animals are \"over-vaccinated\" or vaccinated too early; natural immunity is preferable to vaccination; chemicals or other ingredients in vaccines are dangerous (e.g., cause autism or death); vaccines are simply ineective and unnecessary; vaccines are used for population control or part of some other nefarious plot. Coding as NOT negative/skeptical By contrast, we expect that the majority of vaccine-related content that participants encountered willbeeitherneutralorsupportiveofvaccinesandvaccination,reflectingthescienticandpolicy consensus that the vaccines available to the public are largely safe and eective, albeit imperfect. These articles should be coded as NOT negative/skeptical. Similarly, if vaccines are mentioned uncritically (if not positively) in passing or are characterized as being a medical necessity with some potential downsides, the page should be coded as NOT negative/skeptical as it is at least neutral. (We do not have a \"mixed\" category; a message must be coded as being, on balance, negative/skeptical toward vaccines or not.) Many of these non-skeptical pages will simply contain information about vaccines in passing, possibly as part of a medical page (e.g., vaccine histories, school or travel requirements, or recommendations while taking certain medications) or animal- related page (e.g., adoption information). Others may be news articles documenting, e.g., falling rates of vaccination, or scientic articles about a particular vaccine. Still other pages may include straightforward endorsements that urge readers to get vaccinations. Complications and specic cases 1. Occasionally,apagewillcontainargumentsfrombothpro-andanti-vaccineadvocates(e.g., inaforumorcommentsection). Unlesstheoverallorientationofthepageisclearlypositive,these balanced or mixed formats should be coded as negative/skeptical given the prevalence of anti-vaccine viewpoints relative to the scientic and policy consensus. 2. Notethatthecodingrulesabovedonotapplydirectlytosimpledescriptionsofpositions;de- scribingapersonorentity'spositionasanti-vaccineisdierentfromputtingforthaposition that is anti-vaccine. It is therefore important to consider the speaker of the message as well as its contents. 3. Itmaybediculttodecidehowtocodeseeminglyneutralcontent. Ifthepageportraysvac- cinesaspotentiallydangerousornotmedicallynecessary(i.e.,anagnosticpositionregarding vaccination),thepageshouldbecodedasnegative/skeptical. Ifneutralsimplymeansnoting that there are rare complications and that not all vaccines are 100% eective (a more scien- ticanddispassionateviewthatreflectsthescienticandpolicyconsensus),thepageshould be coded as NOT vaccine skeptical. Similarly, if the page seems neutral because it lacks a recommendation\u2014e.g., simply mentioning vaccines in passing without a position being stated\u2014it should be coded as NOT vaccine skeptical. 4. It is important to flag an approach that is frequently used by anti-vaccine messages: cherry- picking. In some cases, the medical community acknowledges that a particular vaccine has severesideeects. Ifthearticlefocusesonthedanger,however,itcouldbeconsideredscare- mongering and could potentially fuel fears of other vaccines. As such, even medically ac- curate content may be coded as negative/skeptical toward vaccines depending on how it is portrayed. Considerationoftoneiskey;readingthepassagessurroundingtheactualmention carefully may be required to properly understand the context of the message. 5. It is critical to emphasize that this coding procedure does not consider the accuracy of the informationinthearticles,whichisdiculttoverifyforthousandsofarticles. (Giventhesci- entic and policy consensus, we expect misinformation to be more common in anti-vaccine content, but some pro-vaccine articles will include false claims and some anti-vaccine arti- cles will contain accurate information that leaves a misleading impression or is taken out of context.) 6. It may be dicult to infer tone for certain messages. For example, a piece might be satiri- cal. If anti-vaccine advocates are the subject of the joke, it should be coded as NOT neg- ative/skeptical. If pro-vaccine advocates are being satirized, it should be coded as nega- tive/skeptical. 7. Decidinghowtocodearticlesthatdescribethepositionofanti-vaccineadvocatesorindivid- uals who express skepticism about the necessity of complete vaccination can be especially dicult. If the page is, e.g., a Wikipedia article stating a person's position, it should gen- erally be coded as NOT negative/skeptical. However, if the article is more in the style of a news article, it should be coded as negative/skeptical if it shares a skeptical view without descriptionsof vaccineskeptics shouldbe codedas NOT negative/skepticalas theyare usually accompanied by the dominant view that vaccination is good.) 8.

Iftherelevanttexthintsatskepticismregardingvaccines(e.g.,bypositing aconnectionbetweenthemandsomedisease),thepageshouldbecodedasvaccine-skeptical. 10. If a page emphasizes the importance of individual and/or parental choice in getting vacci- nated (i.e., treating it as an individual choice as opposed to recommending essentially full vaccination, which is necessary for eective herd immunity), it should be coded as vaccine- skeptical, even if it does not directly condemn vaccines wholesale. An argument need not be put forth about vaccines being dangerous necessarily. The individual liberty argument itself may serve as a cover for anti-vaccine skepticism, and at at any rate promotes vaccine hesitancy. 11.

Thesemessagesoftenexpress deeper skepticism toward the scientic method or related institutions (e.g., government, pharma- ceutical companies, academia, etc.). We provide four examples below.
