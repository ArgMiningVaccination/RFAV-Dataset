[Integrative health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative-health) is a holistic perspective on health and wellness that combines and coordinates the use of multiple approaches, including [complementary modalities](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/integrative-health) as well as conventional medicine. Complementary health approaches, such as those [taught](http://muih.edu/academics/) at MUIH and offered in its [clinic](http://ncc.muih.edu), provide individuals and communities with access to high-quality, high-impact, and affordable healthcare. These approaches respect and value ancient traditions from cultures around the world, with a deeper understanding gained through contemporary science and research. They emphasize the importance of a healthy body, mind, and spirit, and empower individuals with tools to impact their own health and wellness. We asked members of the MUIH community how they will nurture their body, mind, and spirit on World Health Day, and here's what some of them said.
