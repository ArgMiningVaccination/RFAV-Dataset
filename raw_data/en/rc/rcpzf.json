Treatment of obesity using common commercial drugs shows low rate of success, hence natural products may provide better or more efficient therapeutic approach. Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) (Clusiaceae) peel extract contains xanthones and it is potentially used as alternative medicine for obesity. This research was done to determine the anti-obesity characteristics of Mangosteen Peel Extract (MPE) and its xanthones \u00ce\u00b1-Mangostin (AM) and \u00ce\u00b3-Mangostin (GM) on 3T3L1 cell line. Anti-obesity effects of MPE and xanthones were investigated using differentiated-3T3L1 preadipocyte cells. Inhibitory activity of the extract and compounds on the production of Triglyceride (TG), Cholesterol (CHOL), Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, and lipid droplets were examined. MPE and its compound were capable to inhibit the production of TG, CHOL, G6PDH, lipid droplets. MPE 50 \u00ce\u00bcg/mL and GM 75 \u00ce\u00bcM were the most active to lower TG 57.95% and 59.72%, CHOL 33.33% and 31.68%, G6PDH 52.90%, 41.95%, lipid droplets 72.99% and 70.07% respectively. In conclusion mangosteen peel extract and \u00ce\u00b3-Mangostin are the most active antiobesity compared to \u00ce\u00b1-Mangostin.", "sitename": "Journal of Natural Remedies", "date": "2018-09-10", "cleaned_text": "and its Constituents to Lower Lipid Content on Adipogenesis Cells Model one of the risk factor for dyslipidemia incident, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.
