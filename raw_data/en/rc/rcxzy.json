Sophie Heilig* Department of Translational Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120, Heidelberg, Germany Introduction Leiomyosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that arises from smooth muscle cells. Treatment options for leiomyosarcoma typically include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, some patients may also seek out alternative and complementary therapies to complement their medical treatment. In this article, we'll explore some of the alternative and complementary therapies that may be helpful for patients with leiomyosarcoma [1]. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. This practice has been shown to be effective in relieving pain, nausea, and fatigue in cancer patients. Acupuncture may also help boost the immune system, reduce inflammation, and promote overall well-being. Massage Therapy Massage therapy can be a helpful complementary therapy for patients with leiomyosarcoma. Massage can help to reduce pain, fatigue, and stress, as well as improve sleep and overall quality of life. It's important for patients to work with a licensed massage therapist who has experience working with cancer patients [2]. Mind-Body Techniques Mind-body techniques, such as meditation, yoga, and tai chi, can help patients with leiomyosarcoma to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. These techniques may also help to boost the immune system and improve overall well-being.Herbal Supplements Some patients with leiomyosarcoma may choose to take herbal supplements to complement their medical treatment. It's important to work with a qualified practitioner who can help determine which supplements may be safe and effective [3]. Dietary Change Making dietar y changes, such as reducing sugar and processed foods and increasing fruits and vegetables, can help to support overall health and well-being. Some patients may also choose to follow a specific diet, such as the ketogenic diet or the Mediterranean diet, to help support their health [4]. It's important to note that while alternative and complementary therapies may be helpful for some patients, they should never be used as a substitute for medical treatment. Patients should always work with their healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes both medical treatment and complementary therapies. Additionally, patients should inform their healthcare provider of any complementary therapies they are using to ensure that they are safe and effective [5]. Conclusion Leiomyosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that requires comprehensive treatment. Along with conventional medical treatments like surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, alternative and complementary therapies can also be used as a complement to medical treatment. Alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage therapy, mind-body techniques, herbal supplements, and dietary changes have been found to be helpful in relieving symptoms and improving quality of life for some patients Keywords: Leiomyosarcoma, Herbal supplements, Dietary changes, Cancer treatment. *Correspondence to: Sophie Heilig.

However, it is important for patients to consult with their healthcare provider before starting any complementary therapies, as some may interfere with medical treatment or be harmful. The best approach is to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that includes both medical treatment and complementary therapies, tailored to each patient's unique needs and preferences. Ultimately, the goal is to provide the best possible care and support to patients with leiomyosarcoma, and complementary therapies can play a valuable role in achieving this goal. References 1.
