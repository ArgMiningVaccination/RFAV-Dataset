Meet the Team Learn more about the chiropractic physicians who see patients at UH Connor Whole Health. About Chiropractic Medicine Chiropractic is defined by the American Chiropractic Association as a health care profession that focuses on evaluation and treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health. Doctors of Chiropractic (DCs) care for patients of all ages, with a variety of health conditions. Chiropractic physicians are especially well known for their expertise in caring for patients with back pain, neck pain and headaches by using their highly skilled manipulations or chiropractic adjustments. Research suggests that spinal manipulation improves range of motion, and may temporarily increase space between the synovial joints of the spine. Other research suggests that in general, manual therapies generate neurological signals in the body, which reduce pain signals.

They will take the time to listen and perform a physical examination. Our chiropractors also can order imaging or laboratory testing when necessary. The information obtained from these steps will help the chiropractor make recommendations for a safe and effective treatment plan. This plan may include hands-on care, nutritional and/or exercise advice, further testing, and, if indicated, a referral to another provider. Our chiropractors will encourage you to ask questions and give input regarding their recommendations. During treatment, you may sit or lie down on a special table. The provider then uses their hands, elbows, or other tools to work on your body. The chiropractor may work in the region of your pain or complaint or in areas structurally or functionally related to it. You may want to wear or bring an outfit that is comfortable to help with this process. The length of time for an appointment varies. A new patient visit lasts typically over a half-hour, up to an hour, while a follow up visit is typically a half hour or less. On your first visit you may need additional time before the appointment to complete paperwork and questionnaires. Many patients feel immediate relief following chiropractic treatment, but some may experience mild soreness, stiffness or aching, just as they do after some forms of exercise. Current research shows that minor discomfort or soreness following spinal manipulation typically fades within 24 hours. You may need to attend several sessions with your chiropractic physician in order to maximize the benefits of your treatment and see long-term improvement in your symptoms. "}
