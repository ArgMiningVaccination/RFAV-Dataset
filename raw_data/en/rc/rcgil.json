The idea of a detox is to eliminate toxins in your body but if organic isn't an option, choose produce with skins that can be peeled off (i.e. bananas, oranges, grapefruit). Apples and pears have their nutrient base in the skin, so organic is necessary. 3. Exercise plays a key role in detoxification of the entire body and is very important during this process. Try to get at least 45 minutes of exercise that induces sweat 5 days per week. 4. Berries are high in antioxidants which help to eliminate waste from the body. Use berries as a delicious snack throughout this cleanse. If berries are not in season you can use frozen as an option. 6. The basic idea is to keep the diet free of toxins as well as eating foods that are easily digested. The recipes and menu plan are guidelines to assist you in knowing what to eat but you do NOT have to follow them each day. If you are lacking time to make food then either follow the guidelines listed in the Program Guide or fix a protein shake as a quick alternative. 7. Use raw, unsalted nuts when eating them as a snack. 8. During the first few days, when the body is adjusting to the detox, you may be more tired and weak than usual. If this is the case, drink more water and take brisk walks to help move the toxins out of the body. This feeling should pass after the first three days. 9. Try to get into the rhythm of making the majority of your meals as this will teach you how to eat when you are not on the detox. 10.
