Kristen Walters Advisor ................................................ ......... Marjorie Ryerson rom t On Sept. 12 the director of Student Activities at CSC decided to review my academic file. She discovered the dirty little secret that had been my sophomore year (a .40 grade point aver\u00ad age). She saw that I had taken a semester off, came back to Castleton and had since received a 2.65, a 3.08 and a 3.15 GPA. She decided that I wasn't good enough to be involved in any of the clubs and sent me a letter demanding my resignation as editor of the school newspaper. What followed next was a week j<>f sleeplessness. The Cairn's future was suspended in limbo. The Dean of Students stood finnly behind the school's The Cairn is Castleton State College's only student newspa policy when I presented a letter explain\u00ad per.

Yes, I'm back, and yes, every- The Cairn thing worked out...but this incident, in my opinion, brings CSC's whole legal system into disrepute. There is a definite feeling of powerlessness that one can not help but feel when school policy is firmly shoved down your throat. For a school that prides itself on its warm intimate surroundings and its personal feel, I found it very ironic that I couldn't schedule an appointment with the \"Dean of Students\" for two weeks. (A chat with the President would have taken even longer than that). I don't understand why the administration was so unflinching and cold even though they realized that without an editor, the school paper couldn't meet its deadlines and could not have been released. And why on earth is a student branded with a scarlet letter after a bad year that is not erased even after a year and a half of redemption? I'm wasn't asking for special treatment, just personal rights. Is it too much to expect a meeting and an expla-nation? Wouldn't everyone's lives haw been a lot easier if someone had jus explained the amelioration policy to me in the beginning , so we could have jus done this quickly and quietly? It bother me to think that this school is being ru1 strictly by its iron fisted policy, and tha the student's personal stories are disre garded. How many others, be they ath letes or club members, have been ign<>tt4 and swept under the rug by an apathetic administration? As students we deserve to hav a voice. As \"A\" students or as \"D\" stu dents, it still costs the same amour of money to go here.

He circulated the gathering with a divine smile and a cordial handshake for everyone who attended. His appreciation for those who arrived was genuine and I was instantly glad that I had come. As Nard Pugyao began his lecture I took notice of the numerous Biblical references . I am not a particularly religious person but Pugyao began to show how his experience with Christianity is miraculous. Born a member of an indigenou s tribe in the Northern Philippines, Pugyao only spoke Isnag. This is a spoken language, without an alphabet or written struc\u00ad ture. He was a member of an almost forgotten people who struggled to survive. In 1956 Richard Roe decided to make a difference somewhere in the world. As an educated linguist and scholar he signed up for missionary work and departed for the northern Philippine s. He drove as far as motorized vehicles would take him. He then took a canoe and went many more miles by water. Finally, after a lengthy hike, he arrived in Pugyao's vil\u00ad lage. Pugyao would never be the same. Roe lived and worked with the people of the village developing schools, creating a written language (after learning it), and earning the respect of H20: The Photography of Marjorie Rye~son by Erin McGann The Christine Price Gallery in the Fine Arts Center is now featuring Associate Professor Marjorie Ryerson's photo display, HlO, Images of Water. Previously, Ryerson's pho\u00ad tographs have been seen in The Boston Globe, Woman's Day, and Yankee magazine. This is the first time she has had an exhib\u00ad it like this at CSC. When I spoke to her about th.e exhibit she was both excited and nervous. Ryerson began photographing water at a conference in Florida while standing near a fountain. Soon after, she realized that all of her rolls of film included shots of water. These were not nature scenes with water in them, but water for the beauty of water. The display shows calm ocean water, babbling brooks, spray from waves and many more. Ryerson feels that there are a few more shots needed to complete the gallery and those are of rain. There is only one photo with rain in it but that does not truly represent rain. The rain photos will not be included in this exhibit but Ryerson is trying to take these photos. Ryerson began taking pictures at a young age when her dad gave her a Brownie Camera for her birthday. \"..Xnd I've been taking pictures ever since.\" Ryerson is happy about the gallery and hopes the stu\u00ad dents see her as an artist now and not merely a teacher. She has also published some poetry in various literary magazines and is listed in the inaugural Who's Who in Media and Communica1ions ( 1998-1999). The exhibit runs until October 25, 1997. Anyone who is interested in purchasing a photo can contact the Fine Arts Center Box Office. Pugyao's people. Roe educated Pugyao well beyond his wildest dreams.

By Jessica Bullock Assistant Editor They're everywhere, They're on every top 40 radio station, they're currently getting more play on MTV than ~ny other band, they're working on a film, they're on commercials and magazine covers, their action figures are gracing toy store shelves across the nation, and cereal boxes and billboards seem inevitable. They are The Spice Girls and they have officially attained the status as pop culture icons. I never really had a problem with New Kids on the Block, Menudo or Color Me Badd. I found their carefully for\u00ad mulated style and poor harmonies only mildly annoying. The Spice Girls, however, are another story. To me, they induce more than petty irritation; I loa~e them. With three songs currently on the US Billboard charts, and their album maintaining its position at #3, Spicemania has swept the nation, and I am genuinely afraid. What scares me the most is that little girls want to be them. I became acquainted with my friend's neighbor this sum\u00ad mer, a seven-year-old girl who worships The Spice Girls. She was constantly begging me to go up to her room and see her Spice Girls posters and listen to their latest hit single. I eventu\u00ad ally succumbed to her pleading, and I went up to her room where she and her little pal played the song \"Wannabe\" while they danced around and discussed who the prettiest ~pice Girl is. They knew the dance routines. They knew their names, their likes and dislikes, and were more than willing to share the information with me. So for all of you who are as Spice-illiterate as I was before I met my new friend and later perused the internet for information about the dazzling quintet, here are the stats on the five women who are corrupting the minds of little girls around the world. The Spice Girls are: Geri (aka \"sexy spice,\" who \"'.as reportedly a soft-core porn model before joining forces with The Girls), Mel C. (aka \"sporty spice\"), Mel B. (fans call her \"scary spice\" for Her alleged in-your-fa ce attitude, but you. kn~w her as \"tongue-ring spice\" as she flashes the adornment in vir\u00ad tually every photograph, she worked as a \"private dancer\" before taking her act public with The Spice Girls), Victoria (aka \"posh spice\"), and Emma (aka \"baby spice,\" who describes her\u00ad as part \"mummy's girl\" and part \"hot sexy bitch,\" you will recognize Emma by her cut~y/sexy poses of a very \"nau~hty girl\" in need of a spanking) . Emma is reportedly Prince Williams favorite Spice Girl -fascinating! So how was this quintet of musical genius born? The Girls, along with 400 other applicants, answered\u00b7 an ad (pla:ed by two men) in a U.K. trade magazine. The men were seeking \"streetwise, outgoing. ambitious singers,\" singing talent not required, right? So The Spice Girls that you .and I know t~a.y were the lucky winners of the search. Judging by The. Girl s level of musical ability, I think it's fair to say that their vast wardrobes of halter tops and hotpants didn't hurt their chances. The Spice Girls claim to collaborate ':\"ith t~chnici~s in the writing of their music. In an interv1 .e~ w1t.h Entertainment Weekly. the reporter alluded to The Girl s hesi\u00ad tance to discuss the origin of their songs. I feel I must know who the lyrical genius is behind such lines as, \"I really wanna zigazig ha\" and 'Tm c~oosey not~. floozy. I must be introduced to the brains behind such spmtuaUy pro\u00ad found verses as, \"there's no room for lovin', stop that push and shovin', yeah.\" Anyway, there are some more important reasons as to 4 '. why I abhor The Spice Girls. First and foremost, I hate them . because they are mindless bimbos. When Rolling Stone Magazine asked each Girl about her special talent, Victoria (\"posh spice\") replied, \"Wearing short skirts while dancing without showing your knickers and looking indecent is a talent as far as I'm concerned.\" Your mother must be so proud, Vic. When the magazine asked about the biggest rumor spread about them, Geri (\"sexpot spice\") replied, 'That I have small boobs, hah.\" Damn those tabloids and their hurtful rumors. Realistically, I think the world has some room for a few mindless bimbos. However, I believe it to be a serious problem when seven-year-old girls are emulating these buxom imbeciles and dreaming of meeting them. I certainly hope my six-year-old niece hasn't been exposed to them.

There is no \"law of magnanimi\u00ad ty.\" Magnanimity is an term megalophrosune, \"great-souled\u00ad ness\" or \"great-mindedness.\" This quality is the peculiar estate of those rare persons whose goodness stems not from principles public or private, but from an excellence which inheres in the singular nature of this or that unique human being. It should be clear that the attempt to reduce Aristotle's megalophro \u00ad sune-which applied to prodigies like Oedipus and Themistocles - -to a \"law\" for all to follow, is an absurdity. The illusion that the phrase \"law of magnanimity\" means anything, can only be perpe\u00ad trated if nobody's done the reading. 5. Fascism is the product of con\u00ad formity to a socially shared, partic\u00ad ularistic outlook and the shaming and exclusion -followed by the violent repression -of dissent.

Rather than fueling the cozy fires of love, they end up burning the house down. Healing is in order.

Bite the bullet. Biting the bullet might take several forms. Since I'm frugal in nature I decided to take the cheapest form available. Fasting. What a brilliant idea.

Noticing my zombie-like condition, the boy guided his half-wit mother (that's me) to her chair and proceeded to ladle one, two, three scoops of oatmeal into a waiting bowl. Beefy raisins with chipmunk cheeks smiled up at me. Toast landed upon my plate, unbuttered (as I like it) and steaming. Casey snatched my favorite spoon from the drawer and placed it cere\u00ad moniously in my hand. He sat down opposite me and asked, \"You want brown sugar or molasses?\" I pondered the delight\u00ad ful possibilities of both a little too long. \"MA? Hello?

I took a walk outside to see our cover photo sundrop -dead mountain s framing the ol' atom smashing blaster furnace -it's still up there .. .it's still blazing away, but there's just no heat! It's like <;um\u00ad mer pornography, beautiful as all hell but not real. see? Like a pic\u00ad ture, serene but sureal....1 can't help but get a little scared. Late autumn/early winter is one big long Halloween. The artists smile at its beauty, the beer Dear Editor: drinkers toast it at the festivals, the hikers celebrate it in the fields. All fun, all clean, but yet, as the brown leaves spiral lifelessly from the bar\u00ad ren branches , the beauty of death fades .. .leaving only death. Too powerful to be appreciated, I think. Honestly. l think it's the change that frightens me the most about autumn. People fear change, and the bone chilling winter. \"October ... where kingdoms ri e and kingdom s fall...but we go on ... \" Anyway. u's here so we may as well make the most of it. Our advice on the best way to beat the cold would be to curl up with the latest issue of The Cairn. Lose yourself in the glow of the philo\u00ad sophical waxings (\"To ~peak from the hean is to reveal the hean, and to reveal the heart is to invite expo\u00ad sure of things propriety endeavor-. to shame into silent subjection\", pg. 5), bum up the town on the 31st b) planning your very own ca.~tleton themed Halloween costume with a little help from Tabby Katz (pg. 12) or just relax to the steamy cynicism of Ducan Simmons (pg. 5).

Gay pride-fine. Don't shove it in my face, that's all I ask. We know you are out there. Just leave us alone. I understand you feelings, but, I am not gay so I guess I don't get it. All the slogans tried for taste and tact, except for one that said, \"what do heterosexuals do in bed?\" Same as you. Sleep, dream, thrive, grow. We heterosexua ls make the children. So there. Scandal! No, for the last time, I am not in a league with the professors to destroy Castleton. Whoever said this is insane. Just because me and an English professor write a complaint or two means nothing. I don't know him from Adam. He has no idea who I am. I wi h this stupid rumor would stop. Why would I team up with a professor? They obviously know more than we do -they teach the classes. Anyway, I found it entertain- ing. When it comes to the crunch, is it my fault? I don't scream in my dorm. I don't liuer all over the place Yet people single me out to complain that I'm \"mean and heanless.\" Whatever . Stop bothering me! All I have is an opinion, and if you don't like it, write your own damned letter! T.L.Girardi Dear Editor: Anyone interested in joining or contributing to The Cairn The One in Ten Group had a terrific idea that would make the campus aware of the gay community here at CSC, but they took their idea one step too far for this student The caption \"A Queer Sat Here\" with an arrow pointing to the Susan A. Litchfield Memorial Bench left a bad impression . The panicular bench that was chosen happens to be a memor\u00ad ial to a student who passed away less than a year ago. There was a complete lack of respect shown for this individual and for those who knew her. There are several other benche' around campus that have no meaning attached to them, so why didn't you guys choose one of them? welcome to attend our nieetings held Thursdays at 12:30 in the Campus Center Nlusic Room. lS I am sure I was not the only student on campus who had a negative experience with the One in Ten Groups \"remarks\" spread all over campus. I am not afraid to tell the indi\u00ad viduals responsible for the remarks how much their one simple phrase hun me. The incident left me with a very poor impression of the One in Ten Group. If the members of this group are looking for suppon from the campus community, they need to show a little respect first. The Susan A. Litchfield Memorial Bench serves a purpose on this campus. It i' there so that those of us who lcnew Susan can remember her every time we pass by. It is not there for groups around campus to raise pity for themselve s. The next time any group plan' an activity of this kind, please remember that there arc other people that deserve the respect you arc asking for. Heather R.

We already have plenty of (Ricki Lake) talk shows hosted by people more ignorant than their guests. Wake up and stop having children with gang members! Republicans- The Republican -controlled House of Representatives still refuses to raise the minimum wage, while the wealthy businessmen of the United States incessantly whine about welfare moms sucking $200 a month from taxpayers. Guess what? That huge corporation or conglomerate down the street gets three times as much. McDonalds got more than a billion dollars in corporate welfare to promote chicken nuggets in for\u00ad eign countries . (Conglomerate -using a geo\u00ad logical term penaining to rocks is fitting when discussing the mentality of wealthy businessmen and Republicans) Too bad they couldn't conglomerate a few good brain cells to create one actual wonhwhile thought which might consist of something aside from the rising price of a Mercedes . Corporate welfare is a joke! Could the hungry family down the block receive a welfare check if their family income was $200,000 a year? Of course not, we would be appalled. McDonalds is not a struggling company. \"Fifty billion served\" should be 50 billion stolen from the taxpayers of America. Are you as sick as I am of the campaign -finance debate? Clinton might be a clown but he has been no more crooked than any other politi\u00ad cian today, or in the past, except maybe a lit\u00ad tle in the pants.

Mr. Thornberg met me at the door with thermo\u00ad statically controlled warmth. I stepped into the foyer and told him I was family. \"Family, yes, of course, family,\" he said nod\u00ad ding and smiling, rubbing his hands rhythmi\u00ad cally before me. I could see the funeral home's \"display\" casket set up in the adjoin\u00ad ing room. The monician blocked a good view of the figure within. I waited for him to welcome me funher. He only smiled and wrung his hands. \"I'm his daughter, \" I ~his\u00ad pered, pointing past him to the object of my visit. \"Daughter, yes, of course, daughter,\" he munered smiling and nodding. \"Could I possibly see him?\" I asked directly. As if on cue, my reluctant hovering host waived his hands in a modified Vanna White, led me ceremoniousl y to the casket's side, and van\u00ad ished. My father lay very still. He looked dead. I watched the eyelids for a tell-tale movement or the orb beneath. Nothing. When my father slept you could count his heartbeat s by watching the pulse in the arteries of his neck. Nothing. I examined his chest for the rise and fall!'\" Again, nothing. As I say, he looked dead. But one could never be too sure. I knew what I had to do. It didn't come easily for me. I'm not a deviant. In fact, I felt, after hours of internal debate. that I would be strange if I didn't do it; even stupid. Regardless, it was futile to fight the impulse. My fearful regard for this monster did not arise from the complex meandering of intellectual thought. It lived elsewhere, lower, in an unseen receded pri\u00ad mordial self, hell-bent on survival. On the cuff of my coat sleeve I had fas\u00ad tened a large, very sharp hat pin. I withdrew it, took. one long breath and jabbed the divin\u00ad ers rod into the ann of my lifelong adversary. Nothing. No wincing. No grimace of pain. I saw no flicker of remorse for the sad yet necessary deed now done. He was dead. I wrote this to make a point (no pun intend\u00ad ed). Invariably, when I write, especially on \"touchy\" subjects like death, divorce, depression, or despair someone feels obliged to caution me. I shouldn't be so frank about my own life. I need to go easy, to lighten up, to back off, to water down, to enter the silence of the damned. They mean well. They have my best interests in mind. To speak from the heart is to reveal the heart, and to reveal the heart is to invite exposure of things propriety endeavors to shame into silent subjection. \"If you stare into the abyss,\" wrote Nietzshe, \"it will stare back at you.\" Hell is like that. My grandma used to say life was hell. the dismal abyss where the only sound to break. the silence is the brittle snapping of the will. Grandma knew. She lived and dieJ with silence and secrets, drowning herself in a barrel of booze. I asked her once to tell ml' why she viewed life in ~uch a dismal wa) \"lt ain't the hell of life that's the problem:\u00b7 she said. \"It's the silence that comes when you try to put words in it's mouth.\" \"This is the secret delight. the security of hell,\" the devil says in Dr. Faustus. \"that i, not to be informed on. that it is protected from speech, that it cannot be made public . . . Soundlessness. forgetfulne ss. hopeles-;\u00ad ness ... Here everything leaves off ... \" The hell of hell is the inability to expre ~' the hell of hell; to \"put words in it's mouth:\u00b7 as grandma said. Writing as I do is not an option. It's not a good idea or a creative out. It is an inevitable' necessity. It wakes me up at night. It pound' itself out onto the page. Others so possessed understand what I mean. There is a point where the prophet says. \"If these were silent. the veri stones would cry out.\" Sometime' you must speak up, even if it is considered subversiv e, unpleasant . or incriminating . We saw this phenomenon two weeks ago when the \"one in ten crowd,\" the gay com\u00ad munity of Castleton State College took chall in hand and assaulted our sacred sidewalk' with their questions, their slogans, their heans intent. I did not see the authors. It i~ not safe for authors of such work to be seen. Like ghosts they descended to their task out of the fundamental human necessity to \"speak a word in season.\" To do otherwise is unthinkable, it is hell itself. We all need to say our piece, but whose to say an introduction , like the one I provided. is helpful? Granted, there aren't a whole lot of people who have jabbed their father\u00b7 ~ corpse with a hat pin, but i'll wager there remains a good reason to hear of it. Stop to consider the vast number of walking wound\u00ad ed who do nothing more notable than contin\u00ad ue to survive the past and present atrocitie~ of everyday life. They need to hear it. We all need to know that human suffering, our own suffering, is not unique. It did not begin, nor will it end with us. But there are other rea\u00ad sons for the hearing of such tales. The first time I read Elie Wiesel's horren\u00ad dous account of his life in a Nazi concentra\u00ad tion camp I was grateful he survived to tell it. I was sure all those who heard him felt the same. I was wrong. What makes us tum a deaf, and at times, a defensive ear? When my younger brother lay dying hi, friends were reluctant to visit. \"They're afraid,\" he said. \"They're afraid they will feel too much.\" You cannot walk the corri- Continued on page J 1 NEW ENGLAND MOUNTAIN BIKE FESTIVAL RIDES OFF INTO THE SUNSET by Gregory T. McGannon Staff Writer So the 3rd annual New England Mountain Bike Festival has come and gone, and all that is left are the memories. This year's event took place from September 26 to 28 and brought an estimated 3,000 participants and spectators to Randolph, Vermont during a week\u00ad end foliage explosion. For the first time in the histo~ of the festival, there was sunshine and clear skies throughout the weekend. The weather made the weekend perfect for camping and biking. The bike festival was attended by a wide variety of mountain bikers, bike company representatives and other 'companies that are interested in the sport of mountain biking. Power Bar, Bicycling Magazine, Metro Sports Magazine and, most importantly, Lowrider Promotions, whc,> organize and sponsor the event. Throughout the weekend, there were group rides, clinics from the professionals, mountain bike oriented games for the young-at-heart, and even non-biking activities such as hikes. photograp hy lessons and live music. All of these activities were optional, but there is so much to do, one could not dare complain about boredom! There are hot showers and bath\u00ad rooms of course, as well as food vendors and com~nity grills for the campers. The cost was 55 dollars to camp the whole weekend. The pri t i luded camping fees, the facilities, clinics and use of the trails. There were daily admis \u00b7 prices for those who did not wish 10 camp. I have now attended the past two festivals and it was clear to me that it has grown -uemendously. From conversations with friends and people who have attended every year, I would say the event has grown by almost 1,000 people annually. This is all fine and dandy 10r the fun and entertainment of the sports enthusiast, but the influx of people could cause ~1gnifica nt damage to the trails. This is where the White River Valley Trails Association ~,,mes in. The WRTVA was founded in 1994 by a few local riders. It's purpose is to see the \"\u00b7'' ural landscape and recreational trail access preserved for the future. They are responsible 1rail development, maintenance , mapping and general information, as well as education . 1 advocacy concerning these trails. The organization sets up shop right in the middle of \u00b7 .\u00b7 1.::-tival and picks up a good numbQ' people every year due to the festival alone. Looking back to when the WRVTA was founded, it is amazing now to see the \"w,unt of interest that has exploded in the mountain bike industry. The sport of mountain ' .t_.ng is speeding down a huge hill to success, and I don't think that it's going to brake any-....

Box 4'044-L Los Angeles, CA 90044 - THE HOLY WARS Hecht vs Morgan Jamie Hecht Dear Editor, I write to register my personal and profes\u00ad sional anger at the uses to which Frank Morg11n put his acceptance as a speaker in Castleton's Soundings program. This is an academic institution, and the vexing question of whether that acceptance sh.ould have been granted in the first place, I leave to the dis\u00ad cretion of the appropriate committee. The manner and the matter of Professor Morgan's presentation before I 00-odd undergraduates is the object of this letter's dissent. The particular points of my ~ sjonal disagreement are the following: I. Moral objections (religious or otherwise) to the actions of the state, are not at all unique to the Christian or the Jewish tradi\u00ad tions. In fact, they can be found all over the Ancient world. e.g. in the Greek Iliad lCalchas' opposition to Agamemnon's enslavement of his daughter is a religious objection to state violence, an objection made in the name of the god Apollo). Greek liberty wins out over Persian despotism again and again in Herodotu s and the Aeschylus . 1. The notion that moral action is not possi\u00ad ble .. on the basis of conformity with belief' is alanningly naive. As I pointed out in the Q & A period, Christian violence over the ~enturies is characterized by a happy harmo\u00ad ny between belief and action no matter how .:rue! and macabre the action may be (the Crusades, the Inquisition, th.e Expulsion of 1he Jews from Spain, the Salem witch trials. 11ot to mention centuries of exclusively Christian inter-sectarian violence) because 111c texts which articulate the beliefs in ques\u00ad uon can be read in a staggering variety of ways. This multiplicity of arguable interpre\u00ad tations of a particular text is the central. ,.11il:nt reality of the adult world, acceptance ,)f which is so painful to adolescents throughout life and literature, including for 111~tance , Hamlet. It is what King Lear has lorgotten and what would have saved tJ1hdlo. It is the ineradicable human condi\u00ad llun. which fundamentalism and Fascism .like lack ears to hear. .'\\. The appeal to principles omits decency and fellow-feeling as sources of moral action. 4. There \u00b7 is no \"law of magnanimity.\" Magnanimity is an Elizabethan translation of Aristotle's term megalophrosune, \"great\u00ad souledness\" or \"great-mindedness .\" This quality is the peculiar estate of those rare persons whose goodness stems not from principles public or private, but from an excellence which inheres in the singular nature of this or that unique human being. It should be clear that the attempt to reduce Aristotle's megalophrosune-- -which applied to prodigies like Oedipus and Themistocles --to a \"law\" for all to fol\u00ad low, is an absurdity. The illusion that the phrase \"law of magnanimity\" means any\u00ad thing, can only be perpetrated if nobody's done the reading. 5. Fascism is the product of confonnity to a socially shared, particularistic outlook and the shaming and exclusion -followed by the violent repression -of dissent. It rep\u00ad resents a reaction against the university of Enlightenment documents like French Revolution s Declaration of the Rights of Man, and an embracing of the communally shared, particular form of life, aniculated in the 1930's and 1940's as nationalism (e.g. \"Germaness,\") though religious fundamen\u00ad talism of one kind or another frequently achieves similar results. 6. The Holocaust, on the contrary, was the result of the combination of this exclusive commitment to nationalism with ( 1) the adoption (throughout Europe, but especially in France, Holland, Switzerland, and Germany) in popular culture, political dis\u00ad course, and in state policy --of enthusias\u00ad tically racist and eugenic theories of anthro\u00ad pology in the century leading up to the Second World War; (2) the retirement of pri\u00ad vate conscience and the risks of decent impulse in the face of a shared, communal notion of right, untested by intellectual can\u00ad dor or emotional fellow-feeling . This was itself both the product and the source of (3) a bureaucratically organized, top-down system of social repression, slavery, and murder in which the claims of participation in a rigidly but perversely principled polity (whose rhetoric blended terms we like so much, such as \"rectitude\" and \"justice\" with tenns we continued on pg. 9 Frank Morgan Deftr ~itor, I would like to thank Jamie Hecht for his frankly stated reaction to my Soundings talk, \"Making Sense of Moral Excellence,\" in the last issue of the Cairn. I appreciate his con\u00ad cern that we not oversimplify a complex aspect of human life and experience. As I said in my introduction -I have no fonnu\u00ad la. My in~nt was to spark thought and con\u00ad versation about morality and the quality of life at Castleton . I continue to put my cards on the table, and invite conversation . I am cenainly not a spokesman for the-institutional fonns of nominal Christianity that have appeared as dysfunc\u00ad tional or violent forces on the pages of histo\u00ad ry. I agree with Dr. Hecht's judgement of these and appreciate the apology of leaders of various denominations that have continu\u00ad ity back to times of violence. The Red Cross today issued an apology for its shoncomings during the Holocaust. These apologies will help us remember the lessons of history and help us appreciate the strength of our tradi\u00ad tion of religious freedom -freedom that makes our country attractive in a world where religious violence and suppression are stilldangerous facts of life. A balanced study of Christian histo\u00ad ry is a complex topic. My personal inspira\u00ad tion in Christian history is with. such dis\u00ad senters as Roger Williams, Jan Comenius, the Waldensian s and goes back to the early church which was rooted in the Jewish faith communities as described by the prophet Malachi. The disciples of Jesus were first called Christ-i-ans in Antioch, where one of the first multi-ethnic faith communities was practicing the early church creed -'There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" Given the history of the human race as one of violence and warfare, I can easily believe that the providence of God was behind this movement. I am a member of a faith com\u00ad munity that hopes to take the best fromall enominations, and to learn the lessons of his\u00ad tory from all people groups and languages. Am I a fundamentalist? I think not. But I am a radically Biblical follower of Jesus. That is, the essence of my belief involves right relationship to the personal-infinite Creator who is revealed in the Bible. I think that all knowledge depends on relgiou\"' belief, but it will take another article 10 explain how theory-m;\u00b5cing i~ religiously controlled . Meanwhile I object to the com\u00ad mon practice of using fundamentalism as a sweeping label in a prejudicial way. I know many fundamen \u00ad talists, and the great majority of them happen to be decent. thoughtful. thinking peopJ,\u00b7 with about the same proportions of flaws ancl foibles as the rest of us mortals. They tOC' may try to persuade, but arenot allowed to impose. As a mathematician, I try to prac\u00ad tice clarity and logical thinking. I use induc\u00ad tive methods in my Bible study. History is 11 great drama designed to reveal truth. Being n theist does not excuse me from the necessil~ for critical thinking, and for the comprehen \u00ad siveness of my theories. And I would never expect or want anyone to accept my beliefs without his or her own search for truth. Thm process cannot be shon-circuited. lntegrit) requires me to reveal my presuppositions . Academic freedom allows me to voice them without fear of reprisal. Collegiality expects me to do so as kindly 11 ... possible. To anicuJate any belief or theory i~ not to impose it, but only to make it a rele\u00ad vant option. Silencing the voice is tanta\u00ad mount to remoing the option. In my view, tho: moral motions of every person are a reflec\u00ad tion of theimage of a Personal God. I did not say nor imply in my Sounding s talk tha1 Christians and Jews are morally superior. Jn fact I listed reference s to moral principle~ from many cultures. But I did demonstrato: that the Bible and Jesus' teaching and exam\u00ad ple provide a powerful basis for morality for anyone whose life is faithfully shaped b~ such belief. I am confident that the Biblical message has great relevance , clarity and coherence, as I illustrated in my talk with a discussion of the Hebrew prophetic tradition. In the story of Le Chambon , Andrl' Trocme's motivation to save lives w11~ grounded in his understanding of the incar\u00ad nation (Philip Hallie. ( 1979). Lest Innocent Blood be Shed. New York. Harper & Row. p. 160). I advanced the story of the Whit.: Rose as an example of moral excellencethn1 stood against the unimaginable power of the cultural flow that led to the evil Nazi regiml' and the silencing of human decency in Europe in the first half of this century.

Pi11no returns to the NBA .1lter an eight year absence. Before coach\u00ad ing at Kentucky. Pitino held the reins of the New York Knicks for two years, leaving the NBA with 50 wins in the Atlantic Divi~ion . He has now inherited a team with a poor work ethic and no drive to win. The only bright spot on the team last year was rookie Antoine Walker, who after a slow start. averaged 21. l points and 9.9 rebounds after the All-Star break. He also played for Pitino at Kentucky. What Pitino did first was clean house. He tore down the roster and held on to only six players. He went out and signed the big man that they so badly needed, cen\u00ad ter Travis Knight. who played back-up to Shaquille O'Neal on the Los Angeles Lakers. They signed him to a seven year, $22 million contract. He also pulled off the masterpiece of the 1997 NBA draft by using the \"jedi mind trick.\" When asked who he would pick, he stated he would not select multi-talented Kentucky star Ron Mercer, his former player. With the third pick in the draft he selected point guard Chauncey Billup!> from Colorado. Then with the sixth pick he chose his one and only coveted player, Ron Mercer. It seems that he said he wouldn't choose Mercer so that coaches around the league would think; \"If Pitino won't chose his own player, why should we?\" It worked and Mercer slid right down the draft into Pitino's arms.

McGannon Staff Writer This past season has been a long one for head coach Paul Cohen and the CSC Women's tennis team. The team has dealt with academic conflicts, sickness and mid\u00ad season recruiting; yet they recently captured their third straight Mayflower Conference champiqnsh1p. Although I 0 girls were Jisted on the roster, only eight were active. Six of those were regular starters, and four of them were freshman. This year's team was virtually brand new, with the exception of two return\u00ad ing players. Haley Barnard returned for her second season. She is described by her coach as \"a hard-working , serious competj\u00ad tor who constantly gives 100 percent effort on the court. She won a key match in last year's Mayflower Conference tournament that paved the way for CSC's second straight championshi p.\" Also back for a second year on the squad was co-captai n Season Walrath. According to coach Cohen, \"Season is a ded\u00ad icated athlete very easy to coach. Her game has been steadily improving and she has han\u00ad dled the pressure of moving up the lineup very well.\" Hitting the Mayflower Conference by storm, sophomore co-captain Erica Johnson was undefeated in conference play in the number one srngles and doubles p s1t1on. According to Paul Cohen. \"Erica is truly a complete tenms player. When she's un she can dominate a match. Enca is quite poss1bl) the best female tenms player we have ever had at Castleton.\" Holly Comngharn is another rising star. \"Holly 1s a great player to coach. She is smart and a quick learner. She is very determined to win and never gives UJi,\" Cohen said. Liz.a Rodgers was recruited mid-season and \"wa' a tremendous asset to the team\" coach Cohen said. \"She gives 100 percent on every hot. Liza is the type of player that woulol dive for the ball on hard courts. She has a strong drive to win.\" Rounding out the team weft' Christina Gill, Rebecca Teague and Heidi Bruce. Christina Gill was only able to pla~ sporadically due to a conflicting academi1 schedule. According to her coach. \"Christina is very comfonab le with a racque1 and can make virtually any type shot sh~ wants. As she develops her footwork on th CQUrt, she will put her game up a notch high\u00ad er and be extremely dangerous for any play\u00ad er in the conference.\" Rebecca Teague wa' caught between a bad flu spell and a con\u00ad flicting class schedule, but as her coach put it; \"Becky truly loves the game and ha' proven to be able to compete under the mo~t adverse conditions.\" Heidi Bruce did not play during the regular season but provided experience. semonty and a strong game dur\u00ad ing th1., year's Mayflower Conference tour\u00ad nament which helped the team complete thl' trilogy of championships.

The rest of Peace and Noise is a constant pendulum, sometimes swinging to the ragged right as in Death City (a snarling song about Detroit's rust belt); sometimes swinging to the left in a heartfelt folk num\u00ad ber about a teenage boy going out and look\u00ad ing for work, only to return to his starving mother tto tell her that he has found no job (Dust Bowl). The overall vibe of the album. like the title, is a contradictio n. If I were to describe it in two words, they would be \"depressingly uplifting\" . Yes. the songs deal with horrendous topics (the Heavens Gate suicides, the AIDS epidemic, Vietnam), but I guarantee you that after listening to it, you'll be strutting around your apartment or dorm crooning \"Have you Seen Death Singing\" in your best Patti howl with a smile on your face. Patti Smith is back. Whether you've been a fan since 1975, or you've never heard of the lady, I suggest you pick up Peace and Noise.

Movie Review: The Ice Storm Eric Butler Staff Writer Don't be fooled by the title \"'Th,\u00b7 Ice Storm,'' it's n.ot another film directh about the power of nature like that of th:\u00b7 special effects. pyrotechnical wizardr\u00ad blockbuster ''Twister.\" This one allows yo;1 to look deep into a shady entanglemen1 between two sexually promi!ocuous well-to\u00b7 do families. The setting is the rather placid Connectic ut town of New Canaan during thr Nixon years of the swinging 70'!.-or at lea,1 that's what channel E! labeled the decade on its educational program about the sexual rev\u00ad olution inside Hugh Hefner\"s mansion which I viewed over vacation. Back to th1\u00b7 film. Kevin Kline plays the father. Ben who is married to Elana (Joan Allen), and appar\u00ad ently their marriage counseling along with two children can't keep Ben from quittin;: his secret affair with neighbor Jenie Carber (Sigourney Weaver). who is married with two sons. To make matters won;e, Ben\u00b7, daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) can\u00b71 resist temptation and exploration while jug\u00ad gling love and emotions with Jenie's twn kids. one played by teen-hearth1ob Elijah Wood. As New ZeaJand's OMC would !.a\\. \"How Bizarre!\" Hell. even the Revere~ .I Edwards tries his best pick up lines on Elana throughout the film, but Elana ends up sleep\u00b7 ing with Jenie's husband after the cocktail \"key\" pany. To be honest. the only sanl\" charicter. if there are any in the film. is Ben and Elana's son Paul. a sharp-minded. 16\u00b7 year-old virgin, college student who miracu\u00ad lously mends his parents failing marriag'-' unknowingly when he arrives into town on :1 late train from NYC. Anyway. I'll leave you here and encourage you to try to understand the sym\u00b7 bolic importance of the overall scheme of the film. This film \"The Ice Storm\" received the award in the prestigious 1997 Canne\" Atm Festival and is based on a novel b' Rick Moody, hence the film's \"dark ironi~ mood\" with no pun intended. The director of \"Sense and Sensibility,'' Ang Lee. does a fine job on this two-hour-plus drama. Th1\u00b7 acting is brilliant and Elijah Wood's eyes ar.\u00b7 intense, which in fact sums up ''The le,\u00b7 Storm.\" It's no wonder this film got thre<' and a half stars however. I believe it deserved a solid four. See you next issue. TBE C.Ua.N PAGE 11 ' i - Hlya, Cairn reade,.! My name I Tabitha Katz, but you can call me Tabby.

After missing three classes for a certain pro\u00ad fessor I was disturbed when I approached him to talk. I wanted to present the reason I was absent and catch up on what was missed. I had a perfectly good reason as well as a medical excuse for my absence. I was not physically in Cai.tleton during the classes missed. Instead of help and some tips on how tp catch up and maintain the current work, I was berated for mis-.ing the classes. I was also insulted in an offhanded manner that I did not appreciate. I am a good student who does my work well and on time. The work missed due to my illness was not handed in. Those are the only classes missed and the only assignments not handed in on time. I want to know why that gave this professor reason to insuh me and question my intelligence. When a professor is ill for three classes no one whines that we didn't get to learn because they backed up the whole class. I think that we should get the same respect individually that we give. If I were a student who repeatedly did not attend class and my work w~ always late. then I would understand. The fact j.., that I am a good student who always does my best, and it isn't fair that I don't get the ben\u00ad efit of the doubt. I went for help, and all I got were insult'> and grief. I JUSt wanted to do my best, and that profesi.or made me feel like a loser who doesn't belong in college. Disgruntled Student Paint the Campus Green When I think of Castleton I think of the color green. Most of the people who know anything about Castleton know that green and white are the school colors, but for those of us who live in the residence hall s they are rarely seen. You see. as I sit in my room I look around and see absolutly no green. To me this is appalling. The chair in my room, that could be green! The trim around the walls in my room. that could be green! The rug in my room, that could be green! Then there is the mattress; the only item in my room that even closely resembles the color green, and it's the plastic green cover! .,. Don't get me wrong I think that the school does a fine job with the color green on the other side of campus. and they are getting better with the Campus Center. The benches outside of the Campus Center are now green, the Formal Lounge now has nice green chairi., some of the walls are green and some of the handrails are even green. The only naw that I noticed was that the black mats by the doors could have been green. I just think that if I could sit on my green chair. that wai. on my green carpet, that was in my room with green wall trim. then I would be happy. I would be.happy because that would mean that I could walk out into the hall onto the green carpet and go into the bathroom . There I would see green and white tile floors. with green dividers between the toi\u00ad lets, not to mention the nice green shower curtains. Then I would leave there and run to my lounge, where I would sit on the industrial furniture, but I should be happy because It was green. After a few minutes of relaxation, if I felt so inclined. I could kick off my shoes onto the green carpet and take a nap. My ideal Castleton would be green and in all reality it could hap\u00ad pen. Everything I have mentioned in the above paragraphs could very well be green and probably should be. The investment in these liule things would improve school spirit and pride, not to mention the look of the cam\u00ad puc;. I am not saying that everything should be green, it r., just that a human can take only so much of the creams and yellow\\. I am calling for a change from depressing colors to positive colors, and the color green is the answer. Daniel P. Hunt Homophobi a Alive and Well at CSC\u00b7 I am writing to respond to the letter to the Editor written by T.L.Girardi that you published in your last edition of the Cairn. May I be so bold as to say that Girardi is an ignorant, homophobic, bigot. In an feeble attempt to provide an intelligent response to the One in Ten Club's campu!t graphit\u00ad . ti, Girardi makes a fool of herself by exhibiting her overall unawarene ss of the world around her. Girardi began her letter with the brilliantly crafted phra e, \"Gay pride-fine . Don't shove it in my face.\" Isn't that what pride is all about? Isn't it about abandoning the shame that has been forced upon you and getting your message out there? lf someone 1s proud, why wouldn't they be vocal? The basis for Girardi's anti-homo exual I anti-pride \"We mentioning your doesn't exactly strenthen your argu\u00ad ment.

Also, the award it received during the 1997 Cannes Film Festival wa~ for Be\\t Screen Play. Thanks for your time. -Eric Butler The second half of Girardi's letter takes a very confusing tum. She starts rambling incoher\u00ad ently about her alledged conspiracy with some teacher. What is she talking about, and why would any of us care? It is clear that Girardi is a very unbalanc ed person with a variety of psychological issues to deal with. Celebrate America Recycles Day on November lSth. I am very thankful that you printed Girardi's disturbing letter.

The chorus reeled in shock and disbelief. since the music was not only long and difficult. the text was in Gennan. The occasion for choos\u00ad ing this masterpiece was the centennial of its compose r: Johannes Brahms ( 1833-1897). Who would have imagined that a piece which was so intimidating would eventually become so enjoyable . The piece that has griped us for these many months is the Brahms Gennan Requiem. Rehearsals have been transfonned from a frightening chore to an exhilarating delight for all involved. The choru~ has now been augmented. con~is ting not only of CSC students but al~o of faculty, administration . and singers from around the state a<; well as out of state. The faculty members and their families include: Joe Mark. Jeanne Albert, Beth Summer. John Gillen, Bill Rammage. Mark Worthy. Nancy Goodale, Jennifer Tebbs. Beth Miller, Darla Wigginton-Hecht. Penny Schick. and Jer~ Burger. In order to get a work of this mag\u00ad nitude 10 a level ready for perfonnance. cmmt les~ rehear~a l hours have been neces\u00ad ~ary. In addition 10 the time normally put in by the choru~ members, we have been par-ticipating in extra rehearsal s on Tuesday nights. Some panicipants have travelled from as far as Burlington and Benningt on just to rehearse this piece with us. This is a very demanding piece complete with an 85 voice chorus, an organ, a double bass, and timpani. We have been extremely lucky to have two very ta.tented musicians in the chorus to help us with this: Andrew Rousseau is playing the double bass, and Aaron Audet is playing the timpani. Kevin Davis, the organist at the Grace Congregational Church in Rutland, is play\u00ad ing the organ for us. This is a work that is most accurate\u00ad ly described as breathtakin g and unforget\u00ad table. It is best summed up in a letter to Brahms in 1869 by Herman Levi who con\u00ad ducted one of the first pcrfonnances of this piece: \"Last night. after rehearsal, when most of the people had left and I was sitting at the piano, lost in thought, I began uncon\u00ad sciously to play the first bars of your Req4iem . Instantly those who were at the door turned back. their hoods flew off and the girls crowded round the piano and began to sing, with radiant faces, until we at last got stuck in the third movement.\" Even now, that same enthusiasm and devotion can be seen in the members of the Castleton Festival Chorus.

Kieth Brostek Staff Writer World climate experts predict that the \"El Nino\" weather phenomenon brewing in the Pacific Ocean might be the largest cli\u00ad matic event of the century, setting off an unprecedented number of global disasters. El Nino is an unusually large mass of warm water that fonns near the equator and travels in a current (west to east) toward South America and the Southern Pacific coast. It is these warm currents that create abnormal weather condition s worldwide . The \"domino effect\" El Nino initi\u00ad ates has many severe consequences. The sys\u00ad tem can launch scaring droughts, while flooding areas that nonnally do not receive precipitation . The El Nino of 1983, which was the largest in recorded history, dumped 66 feet of snow on Squaw Valley. It vinually wiped out half the coral population , and gen\u00ad erally disrupted the entire ecosystem in the South Pacific. The El Nino system of this year already has measured warmer tempera-tures, up to five degrees wanner, than the I Nino of 1983. \"It will likely be the biggest I Nino in 150 meteorologi st/climatol gist Jagadish Shukla said. \"We have ne' observed such high ocean temperature s 150 years. And the only reason we say ii : the largest in so long is because we do1 .\": have any data from before then.\" What does El Nino mean for 1 ~ Mid-Atlantic area? Each El Nino is some\u00ad what different than the last so it is difficult to forecast with accuracy what effect it will have. The majority of large weather systems cause milder winters in the Nonhcast with a large amount of precipitation . Assuming temperature s stay low this winter. an increase in precipitation might result in a healthy ski season. If the temperature is too warm, however, you might want to keep your water skis out. No one is psychic. The weather expens can only anempt to predict the weather using stonns Jn the past as exam\u00ad ples. Just hope Mother Nature is kind.

It's become a common practice. he explained, to take pho\u00ad tos of vets who don't keep in touch so that everyone could link a face to a name. He listed the names of four members who died. I haven't taken many picturel>. but I remem\u00ad ber. Buddy. his name is Harold on The Wall, sat behind me at Hope High School .. homeroom\" in Providence. Quiet, friendly, attentive and organized, he always knew the cla!>~ assignment~ and due dates. He was a ~quad leader in a First Air Calvary unit when a booby trap wa\\ted him in 1970. Tommy's paper route bordered mine. We've been buddie )> since sixth grade. He ~pent a year on the light crui-.er. St. Paul. plotting coordinates for naval gunfire that !>Upponed Marine actions or demoli~hed vil\u00ad lages in the Nonh. Now the same hands that plotted coordinates ~hake from the medica\u00ad tions that keep his mind from downward spi\u00ad rals. Unable to apply his math degree and pensioned off by the Veteran's Administration. he !.pend\\ good days doing odd jobs. Dempsey worked with me at a Vietnam veteran's ~ocia l service agency. He was a big-heaned counselor who helped vet-erans get jobs, benefits and any other assis\u00ad tance entitled by military service. During the war, he drove a two-and-a-half ton truck for the First Infantry Division . A rocket destroyed his truck and left him with perma\u00ad nent head pain. \"Demps\" waged a 15 year battle for VA compensation and medical treatment. He helped hundreds, maybe thou\u00ad sands. of veterans and their families get help and treatment, but he only help he could find for his own pain destroyed his liver. Dempsey died just after his 40th binhday, leaving a wife, daughter and son. On a hot morning in Da Nang, the medics in my unit lab were distracted by an unfamiliar sound. Hidden by a screen door, we watched the mama-san (calling them that helped us to do what we did) weep as she shined the Captain's boots that he left regu\u00ad larly on the wooden doorstep of his office for her to polish. She sobbed and swayed slight\u00ad ly back and fonh as she bent over, struggling to keep the black polish off the white ao dai Buddhist s wear for mourning . A Vietnamese who was sweeping our lab floor told us that her son had just been killed in the war. At another place and time we might have tried to console her. For a few brief seconds we wondered how it happened and, of course, what side he was on. Then we looked away and returned to our work. It seemed imponant that we didn't ask about those things. ask those questions and, most of all, listen, and learn the answers . \"But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, \"We died at such a place\"; some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led h . \" t em to it. .. -Shakespeare Henry V, Act IV, Sc. 1 Generation X and Veterans Day Dave Mance Editor-in Chief November 11 is Veterans Day, a time to remember those who died for our country and a time to honor our military vet\u00ad erans. It is a day that would not be possible without war (as an anagram RAW); ie: the act of talcing someones life. Explained to me once as the one thing that separates man from beast, war is such a passionate word that fonunately remains relatively unknown to my generation. Although the world still reeks of it, World World fl is, for the most part, a dusty folktale and a seventh-grade textbook picture of a mushroom cloud. My Grandfather, who fought on lwo Jima is a proud marine. An American Legion member, he goes to all the rallies, and is never seen without his red hat U.S.M.C. hat. He sometimes mentions the war, or war in general, after a few drinks; but I don't think he really likes to remember . Sitting on his lap as children we'd try to drag out of him how many people he killed (it's human nature). Grandma would scold us, and Grandpa would just look down and stare a hole into the floor (my first hero, faraway, misty eyes and all.) My Dad never went to Vietnam but I sure did, Saturday afternoons after a morn\u00ad ing full of \"Rambo II\" and a few bowls of Weaties (the box with the American flag on it). I'd run sloshing through the swamps in my military surplus gear, BB-gun cocked, ready to blast Wayne Herman, his dog, or any other enemy soldiers who happened to be hanging out in my woods. Vietnam was action and adventure, everything a boy could want. I think that for those who were not directly involved in the conflict, the lessons learned were lost as soon as Hollywood started using the atrocity as a backdrop for the '80s Western. Gun toting badasses wast\u00ad ing Commies -it was all very patriotic. Had the war still been going on, I would have enlisted in a heartbeat. By the time Desen Storm rolled around, I was in 10th grade and was old enough to question the logic of war. As for the conflict in general, it again became a sur\u00ad real video game, the images so spectacular, wrapped in a candy coating of government propaganda and lies. ready to be consumed 24 hours a day with CNN's live coverage. Friends c:pne over to watch our soldiers angelically defend Kuwait. a spoiled brat ass country condemned by Amnesty International for its cruel torture (fingernail extractions, electrocution) of its enemies. We also fought to keep oil prices do\" n despite the fact that it was not at all obvil' that Saddam Hussein would have wanted. , , been able to elevate prices. The fact of 1' matter was that our soldiers died for capir ' ism and the military industrial complex that fuels this country's economy. It will happen again. With a military budget of billions and billions of dollars, you'd better believe that our government will test out its new toys at the first politically correct moment. Can you see why my generation is cynical? Maybe this cynicism will end when we have our ordeal . When our war does come, you old\u00ad schoolers will see us tum into you. War brings with it a hardness, a maturity and a respect for life to everyone who lives through it. I think the apathetical stereotype that characterizes my generation is due to the fact that we haven't been through anything cataclysmic. Our friends haven't come home from South East Asia in body bags. We haven't shed blood for our country. or rallied at home to vehemently protest our governments flaws. Instead, we just don't vote. I have the utmost respect for sol\u00ad diers, and the poet in me wishes that I could be one. I just finished reading the diary of Bobby Sands, a Northern Irish soldier who was captured by the British in Nonhem Ireland's war for independence . Even in jail, stripped naked, beaten and laying in his own excrement, Bobby had a burning desire 10 fight. He saw a hunger strike as his last available weapon, and aftt\"r 66 days of ~tar\u00ad vation, died for Ireland and the Irish people. In our country I'm sure their are similar <;tO\u00ad ries of heroism, and it's this passion that I'm envious of. I wish I believed in something so strongly that I would die for it.

As we passed through the doors, the \\tench of cri'P autumn air mingled with the smell of cheap beer and inundated our sens\u00ad es. Yes. we had arrived at what was for me. the most anticipated event of 1he year. the Blues Traveler concen. It was under the guise of a five-year anniversary 1hat my girlfriend and I traveled west of the comfonab le bordero; of Vermont to New York whose border, much to the <,uprise of many, doe' not end ju<;t past Finiu-; T. Flubberbuster, . This trip was not truly about a simple anniver..ary, it was an oppor\u00ad tunity to see one of my favorite bands Blue-. Traveler. Now to those of you who have just been !hawed out of a cryogenic <;late Blues Traveler is a funky band whose lead singer's harmonica abilities are unparalleled. After a long and arc.Juou' journey 1 finally arrived in Utica, New York the host of this marvelou s event. We walked into the lobby of the small stadium which was packed with a slrange band of disgnmt led. die hard youth and befuddled baby boomers who seemed lost in a sea of outdated grunge attire. As we were shuffied along by the wave of anxious fans we spotted our seats: jackpot. we were a mere 10 rows back from the stage. I checked my wa1ch impatiently, and 10 my obvious dismay there was still a halfhour until the opening act. There was only one cure for this situation: grossly overpriced. watered down beer. Two beers later I sat comfonably in my seat as the lights dimmed. Suddenly the spotlight went on and there was Jamie and the Whaler-.. who I now refer to as Jamie and the Melody Murderers . This band was one of the most horrific I have ever seen. Jamie. the so called lead singer was styled after Bon Jovi with his stone washed jeans and extra tight tee shin. I had to supres!> painful nash backs of middle school, fashion faux pas. Not only did this band shatter every fashion rule, but I do believe that I saw Yersachy rise from his grave and weep as they played. They stunk. The band played a 45-minute set that seemed more like a Tyson fight: it packed a powerful music punch that missed all the time and had too much bite. In fact, Jamie needed to spend less time prac\u00ad ticing a move which was a strange hybrid of an air guitar and a belly nop, and more time practicing his music. After the set the band stopped. either because of a lack of any more ear piercing melodies or because some fan beat me to the power switch. After this musical fiasco a DJ tried to cleanse our palate by playing miscella\u00ad neous songs by Puff Daddy. I found that sev\u00ad eral more beers improved the situation. Then there was no light, and a heavy smell of pot smoke suddenly filled the room. Lights began to flash and suddenly the prodigious John Popper leapt on stage like a 400 pound ballerina with leg weights. The re<;t of his band barely had time to scramble onto stage before he broke into music. which set the entire stadium into a frenzy of unbriddled excitement. Even the baby boomers let go of all social mores and began to pany with the younger crowd. My own reserved demeanor let go, and I jumped to my feet and bellowed what can only be described as something between a primordial war cry and a sick Chihuahua. To this day, despite my girlfriend's reassurances, I still believe that the crowd hesitated for a moment and the band nearly lost control of their music. I believe that if there were mul>ic police I would be spending the remainder of my life in a Mexican prison. The rest of the night was a blur of several more beers and great music. My rec\u00ad ommenda tion is to see Blues Traveler at any expense. and avoid the opening band at all costs. Earn $750-$1500 a week!

I feel lhc lbe unintended issue -I regret hav\u00ad Mlllftld someone I wish to befriend. l1 a lesson for me to ponder. 'le, I return to the question of the n:e of religion that underlies any dis\u00ad oa of moral excellence. This article will ire lhe religious dependency of various fviews including naturalism , and con\u00ad some implications for public education . ii fir more difficult than the most com- of mathematical theorems. I have a for my many naturalistic friends lheir accomplishments . I accept lbe facts of naturalism. but I take pan of its basis and interpreta- am keenly aware that naturalism has IP:IUin:d history, and that mathematic s a large role in its foundation . In his book The Myth of Religious , Roy Clouser likens the influence to that of geological plates -hid\u00ad casual view, but exerting control\u00ad beside which earthquakes are but a blemish. Clou!>er makes the follow- lefinitions: the divine is the irreducible ~ whether personal or impersonal that xist independently. that is changeless. on which everything else depends . ~on seeks to answer the most central fundamental questions about reality: I) is the divine? 2) what is our proper Ion to the divine? With these defini\u00ad a religion may be categorized accord\u00ad o its explanation of how the nondivine Inds on the divine. Clauser notes that there are three of religious dependency ideas. (I) The dependency idea is that the divine is put, aspect, force, or principle within \u00b7vene. (Please note that I am using the \"pagan\" in a technical sense with no 've connotation) . (2) The pantheistic idea is that all is divine, so what It is not my purpose to enter into 've religion. It is clear that there are t difference s within categories and 'lies across categories . But for pur\u00ad ol illustration. it is safe to say that ani\u00ad il one of many forms that paganism ; Judaism and Christianity are theistic; and Buddhism and Hinduism are examples of pantheism . The interesting thing is that this definition exposes the religious control of \"secular\" philosophical views such as nat\u00ad uralism that have privileged positions in pub\u00ad lic education by virtue of being \"secular.\" The divinity for naturalism is nat\u00ad ural law including the mathematical equa\u00ad tions and laws of physics laws on which all science depends. Cosmologi sts tell us that there are a couple of dozen finely tuned, unchanging mathematical constants and physical relationships that have allowed the ttniverse and all of life to unfold. These include the gravitational coupling constant, the strong nuclear force coupling constant, the weak nuclear force coupling constant. electromagnetic coupling constant, the ratio of electron to proton mass. the velocity of light, and others. These perfectly balanced forces miraculously popped into existence along with space and time in the big bang approximately 15 billion years ago, when everything that we see was condensed to a particle smaller than the point of a pin. The belief that these unchangeable forces can account for everything we see and experience is the central assumption of natu\u00ad ralism. The religious dependency idea here is the pagan one because this unchanging real\u00ad ity, this divinity on which all else depends, is within and a pan of the universe. Naturalism should be recognized as having a pagan reli\u00ad gious base in the same way Christianity is recognized as having a theistic religious base. I would argue that naturalism has a privileged position in public education by virtue of its unexamined claim 10 be secular while references to God are thought to be in violation of the separation of church and state. The first amendment reads \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establish\u00ad ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exer\u00ad cise thereof.\" In other words, government will not favor any religious organization or system of belief. There ought 10 be a level playing field. So tax-supported public schools ought not have a de facto bias in favor of a pagan-based religious dependency idea that claims to be secular. This is not a level playing field. You think the playing field is level? Then I find it \"passing strange\" that my granddaughter is told her poem can't be dis\u00ad played on the bulletin board because it refers to \"seeing God in the storm.\" I find it ironic that books are taken out of a school library because they talk about a child praying. I find it arrogant that sex education courses can demonstrate \"safe sex\" without signifi\u00ad cant emphasis on traditional beliefs about the continued on page 11 Avoid Living in Off\u00ad Campus Rat Traps by Greg McGannon Stall' Writer As I sit on my couch and ponder what brought me to lb.ll couch. a consistent scratching is coming from the animals in the wall.

I've now lived off-campus for two and a half years. The half part has been the only bad pan. My abode for the first two years was a good deal. It was near campus, living with good friends for a reasonable price. The rent coincided with the apartment. I now live near campus. with friends. but in a dysfunctional house for a ludicrous price. In a very short period of time I went from a comfortable zone of living to a modernized 19th century dwelling . Please don't take this the wrong way. I adore living off-campus. Living on my own, RA-free. has taught me just as much as the academic end of college. But in this town there can be an upside and a down\u00ad side. The upside is finding a place that keeps the tenants warm. The downside is my dys\u00ad functional home. Stay away from the bad\u00ad vibe houses. The pros are few and far between the cons. so I will start with them first. The porch that leads into my house is a great asset. During the warmer days it was our outside living room . When one reaches for the doorknob to enter the house. it might very well fall off. That is. until I got even with some duct tape. The kitchen area is actually functional, but because of a sudden rotation and abandonment by former house\u00ad mates. we have next to no cooking utensils.\u00ad Therefore a good meal is impossible to pre\u00ad pare. The only decent light in the kitchen i!> a halogen that we have named \"the death ray,\" due to the brightness and constant hum\u00ad ming of the beast. The feeling is equivalent to Supennan getting weakened by kryp-tonite. Passing through the kitchen, 0111\u00b7 ends up in the living room. This is the onl.' warm room in the house, but not an excitinl-' room to be in. We have no cable and lh\u00b7 stereo we do have is a decade old. One those all-in-one deals with the turntable on top.

Cabbage Night, as it was explained to me, is called so because in the \"old days\" they used to throw cabbages. I thought it was just because they were severing cabbage in Huden. l nicely contributed my two cents about what we do the night before Halloween. Little did I know that we would all get a firsthand les\u00ad son in what the night before Halloween real\u00ad ly means. Mischief Night is the title granted to the haunted eve, at least in New Jersey that is. It's a night more celebrated than Halloween by most teenagers. Grocery stores refuse to sell eggs and other such products to the public, unless they are over 21. Pumpkins are removed from the front porches of many homes in fear that they will end up as road kill. Kids as young as sev\u00ad enth and eighth grade stock up on shaving cream, toilet paper. eggs and various types of spray confetti, in hopes of trashing a neighborhood, possibly their own. This is the night when all hell breaks loose in some towns. Some towns have resoned to setting a curfew of sundown for the eve of Halloween . Is this a ridiculous tactic? No! My fi(st Cabbage Night in Vermont will never be forgotten. I learned firsthand that the night is taken pretty serious here too. It was somewhere around I a.m. when the first fire alarm went off in Ellis Hall. r pioneered my way down the hall in my pajamas all the while wondering if someone just burned their noodles again, or if this was perhaps a test. We gathered out\u00ad side on the front lawn, most in our pajamas tucked inside our comfoners, rather than sleeping in bed. The usual comments and complaints were made: \"If I find out who did this ... \"Who ever did this is gonna die.\" I stood on the lawn wondering what was going on. I was cold, tired and wanted to be in my nice warm bed, not on the grass in front of Ellis. Sure we all heard the tales of last year. How the fire alarms went off at all hours of the night, and how you were made to stand outside for hours at a time. But they forgot to mention one thing, that usually occurs when someone who has been out for the evening comes home and feels the need to pull the fire alarm. Not this time. They were cautious about letting us back in the building due to a funny odor, perhaps gas, maybe lighter fluid. But because they couldn't pin the smell down to anything specific they let us back in after about 45 minutes. No more then 30 min uteslater another alarm went off. This time l was smart. I changed out of shons and into flannel pajamas. I grabbed my blanket, slipped into my shoes and out to the lawn I went. Only this time was different. While making my way down the stairs from the third floor, smoke was enfer\u00ad ing the haHway and there were a few people who were choking and pushing ti:> get by. r moved aside and let them through. By the time I made my way to the front lawn l had learned that a couch in the second floor lounge had ignited, and that two students. one of whom doesn't even reside in Ellis, had put the blaze out. Cabbage Night was in full swing. I would have done almost anything at that point to have some toilet-papered trees and smashed pumpkins. Anything would have been better than a fire in my home. So there we were again, outside Ellis Hall on the grass, wondering who could have done a thing like this. You could hear rumors about the fire circulating through the crowd about the event, but mostly all you heard were people outraged and shocked that we could be living with someone who would do Your Ticket Before And After I I The Movies!

The Campus Center became our home for about two hours that evening due to the fact that the contents of the fire extin\u00ad guisher had to be cleared from the air. All the Resident Assistants worked hard to keep us informed of what was going on. Some people tried to sleep, but most stayed up talking about what had happened . About two and a half hours after the fire was extin\u00ad guished we were send back to Ellis, our home. Did I forget to mention that this event caused Dean Mark to pay us. the resi\u00ad dents of Ellis, a visit at 3:30 a.m.? l was not at all entertained -or happy that he had to come talk to us. I'm sure he didn't appreci\u00ad ate it either. Back at Ellis I found it hard to fall back asleep. What was next? As I sit here thinking about what happened last night I'm appalled that any\u00ad one would want to cause such harm to another. l am grateful to the Resident Assistants, the Resident Directors. thl' majority of Ellis residents, Public Safet) and to Dean Marie This situation could have been I 0 times worse than it was. Thanks to quick thinking as well a<; action on the part of the two guys who put the tire out, we are all safe. A little shaken perhaps. but happy to alive. So what happens now?

I have had an ongoing banle with the issue of receiving tickets from Public Safety. I have been a student here for over 4 years now and the problem still arises at least two or three times a year. I understand that the ticket giving process is fundamental in maintaining order on the campus roads, but every year I hear tons of complaints about how Public Safet) puts the sting to students' wallets. My problem is not with Public Safety (well actually it is, but that's nol the point) My point is this: Where does all this money the school fines us go? I know it must go some\u00b7 where. Did it go to that cute and most likely very expensive map of the school right next 10 the Public Safety Building ? Or how about those beautiful metal covers for the stairs outsid.\u00ad of the Campus Center Snack Bar? A bigger concern of mine is how the whole process take' place. A car receives a ticket for an incident. lf the owner of that car would like to appeal it, he/shemay do so at Public Safety. 'They are very quick to offer this opportunity. Once you hand in that appeal form, don't expect to see that form again unless it is asked about or a cou\u00ad ple of months later when the unpaid ticket bas built up a modest late fee. This has happened to me twice. As a maner of fact, I don't recall hearing of anyone ever winning an appeal. How about the appeal process? Who decides to accept or deny an appeal? I have no idea about the past rules of thumb but I did learn that the student court presently receive-; all of the appeal forms. Th.is recent information makes me feel a bit more al ease knowin :~ my fellow peers and drivers are now reviewing the cases. But I would have to presume tha1 an authoritative figure or figures must have made the decisions in the past I know I don't have all the information, but I do know that a lot of money is banlt~cl on parking and driving violations around this campus. I have waited too long to tty an,1 change the Public Safety Tax. This tener's intent is to inform the students of Castleton th:u they shouldn't park illegally. That will save you the money and hassle of dealing with th.\u00b7 campus fuzz. If one does get a ticket, pay it right away. Don't let them get anymore mone) than they deserve. If an incident has grounds for an appeal, get the appeal in ASAP. The longer an appeal is put off, the less likely the appeal will even be looked al before it get' stamped \"DENIED! \" -Big Lou Death Row Inmate I am writing 10 ask if you would run an add for me in your school newspaper.

Page2 11 II The Cairn November 18, 1997 SA President implicated in election scandal by Joshua Gilbert Contributing Writer According to the student senate log of minutes from the November 5 meeting of the senate, the student assosiation president has been implicated in an election scandle. Corruption, the nasty word that we thought only described some of the politicians in Washington D.C. has now come to our little campus, and into our own elections for senior class officers. The deadlines for the class officers 10 get their ballots in was October 31. At that time, Alex Pinizzotto, the SA President, Victor Echandy, Cheif Justice of College Court, and Joann Cassano, a senior, had not handed their ballots in to Victoria Angis, who was in charge of keeping track of the ballots. On November 3, Victoria recieved the ballots and all the applications with Alex's, Victor's, and Joann's names appear\u00ad ing among them, regardless of the fact that they were not handed in on time. Victoria got in touch with Alex 10 find out who had actually completed the ballots and why these three names were included. Al that time Alex Jenied having anything to do with making ballots but, did suddenly remember that Joann and Victor had their ballots in on time. Joann and Victor backed up-Alex's story say-ing that they had turned their ballots into her before the deadline. On November 4th, Alicia Young, SA Secretary, came to Victoria to inform her that Alex wanted Alicia to lie to Victoria 10 cover up the underhanded deeds that that she had done. On November 5th Alex finally cracked under the pressure and admitted everything 10 Victoria about all the lying and wrong-doings. Alex did say, however, that Victor had extended the deadline, which he can do but, not without the full vote of the College Court. The College Court, which Victor leads, is the deciding factor in whether these ballots will be accepted even though they were turned in after the deadline. Victor and Joann promised to have nothing 10 do with the voting because it \"YOuld be a conflict of interest. The Court has to decide whether there were any wrong-doings . The meeting of the College Court was on Monday, November I 0, and they came 10 a decision, but the decision will not be revealed until Wednesday, November 12. At this point, there have been no repercus\u00ad sions for the actions that these students have taken. Alex could not be reached for com\u00ad ment. Celebrate America Recycl~ Day on November lSth.

The fire, which was set at aproximately 2 a.m. in Ellis Hall, destroyed a couch and forced the evacuation of Ellis residents. Public Saftety officials believe the fire must have ignited with the use of an excellerant, because all of the couches -;upplied by the school are flame retardant. \"An excellerant must have been used,\" said Mike Davidson, Director of Public Safety. It is believed that the fire was set by residents of the hall. According 10 Residen1 Director, Kathleen Daigneault , some residents heard running back and forth in the hall around the time the fire was believed to have been ignited. The State Arson Squad is continuing its investigation and suspects are being sough1 out. The perpetrators of the fire could face felony charges and if convicted could be ~en\u00ad lenced to up to ten years in jail and fined $500. In unrelated news, numerou s acts of vandalism occurred during the same night a' the couch fire. In all, seven fires were reported on or around campus. The majority of the fire\" occurred when trash bins were set on fire and destroyed . There was also one reported inci\u00ad dent of Public Safety Officers being egged by unknown students. Suspects are being sough1 in all incidents. Rape and Awareness Panel scheduled at CSC by Tara Rodin Staff Writer The Women's Issues Club has planned a Rape and Awareness panel to take place next semester, and preparatio ns for the organization of this panel have begun. The goal is to provide students on campus with information on how to prevent a rape from occurring , how to properly report a rape and 10 know the process by which each victim will go through if they choose to prosecute their rapist. The idea for this panel was addressed when Tracey Butkus, a CSC senior and member of the Women's Issues Club, noticed that there 'was an apparent lack of information concerning rape and sexual assault on campus. \"I don't feel enough peo\u00ad ple are aware of this issue. The majority of rapes occur in women on college campuses between the ages of 16-24. This targets us.\" The panel will tentatively consist of one victim's advocate , a prosecutor, a state police officer and local police officer, as well as a social worker. These professionals will be from the Rutland and Castleton commu\u00ad nities. Both the school nurse and counselor at CSC will be available after the presenta\u00ad tion to offer any support to students who may have questions or concers regarding rape and sexual assault. CSC campus security reported 3 forceable rapes in 1995 and 4 forceable rapes in 1996; however, while this campus may appear relatively safe, these numbers do not reflect what may actually be happenin g, but only the rapes that are being reported. Tracey feels this is important to understand since ~he has personally spoken with a num\u00ad ber of women on campus that never reported they had been raped. ..Many women are confused as to what even defines rape,\" 'he said. Tracey, a rape victim herself, wants othe~ to be able to have the information and support they need if ever faced with 1h1s sit\u00ad uation. ''When I was raped, I didn't know what 10 do, how 10 deal with it-if I knew more I would've reported it sooner. Because I didn't, they didn't have any physical evi\u00ad dence for the case, which is vital. My rapi ... 1 went free and I have 10 live knowing thi' My hope is that others will not have to g through this.\" Lorie Blaine, a senior at CSC and \u00b7' Women's Issues Club member is enthusia\\t\u00b7 about the possibilities for the upcomin\u00b7 panel. \"I hope to see the panel a great sue cess and show the Castleton communit y th~ women's issues does affect all of us and 1h.11 the real issues women face every day\u00b7 do occur on this campus and deserve to b. addressed .\" For more inforrnation, Women\u00b7 Issues Club meetings are held ever Wednesday night at 6 p.m. in the inform .. lounge.

Sucker MC's should call n1e sire.\" The Cairn November 18, 1997 RUN-DMC Profile It would be hard to over- state Run-DMC's influence on popular culture during the decade that has elapsed since they released \"It's Like That/Sucker MCs.\" As the first and the Greatest of hip\u00ad hops superstars , Run-DMC's mis\u00ad sion has always been (in their own words) to \"crash through walls, go through floors, bust through ceil\u00ad ings, and know down doors.\" They have succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams -their own includ\u00ad ed -by embodying for the world the endless creative subculture of young black New York. They were the first rappers to earn a gold album (for Run-DMC in 1984), the first to earn a platinum album (for King of Rock in 1985), the first to go multi-platinum (for Raising Hell in 1986), the first to have their videos played on MTV, the first to appear on \"American Bandstand,\" and the first to grace the cover of Rolling Stone . Noting that Run\u00ad DMC does indeed \"hold a fistful of rap firsts.\" Rolling Stone's Rob Tannenbaum recently wrote, \"it's hardly surprising that it's now the first rap group to come back t:om the ~ead . This may be its most impres\u00ad sive achievement , given all the hip hop heroes who've gone ou1 like Hoffa.\" Of course, Run-DMC's impact can\u00ad not be measured by musical milestones alone. Run-DMC have been responsible for the introduction of new dances, new fashion, new language , new energy. They have been largely responsible, in short, for nothing less that the hip-hop-ification of popular culture. It is not for nothing that Bart Simpson and Barney Rubble rap, that Madonna grabs her crotch, that Spike Lee invented Mars Blackman, that George Bush and Bill Clinton both thought it necessary to attack rappers during the election campaign of 1992. It was not without justice the Details nam~ ~un-DMC one of the four biggest fashion influence s of the Eighties. Not bad for a trio of 28-year-olds. Still the greatest rappers aspect of Run-DMC's triumph is that it has come from the ground up. ''I'm not saying we invented !hardcore, I'm just saying we did it on record before anyone else.\" Run told New Musical Express. \"It was our life: There was no image to fonn. We were just ourselves and we took that to peoplef' Or as Scott Poulson-Bryant put it in Spin: \"Run-DMC managed to be our turntable heroes, around\u00ad the-way superstars, selling us back us to us with Lee-clad bravado and beat-chic mini\u00ad malism.\" Joseph Simmons (Run), Darryl McDaniels (DMC), and Jason Mizell (Jam Master Jay) grew up in Hollis. Queens, New York, a relatively stable, relatively comfon\u00ad able black community not unlike hundreds of others in America. Friends from childhood they were nunuring vague dreams of caree~ in the music business when they entered col\u00ad lege in the fall of 1982. Luckily for them, Russell Simmons. already had a career in the music business as the manager of rappers Kurtis Blow and Whodini . Luckily for Russell, Run and his two partners has a ton of talent. Revolutionary as they were, Run-DMC were a smash from the very start. Unlike both rap stars and the pop stars of the day, Run-DMC didn't sing, they didn't dance, they didn't dress up, and they didn't smile when some\u00ad one pointed a camera at them. They were hardly the first rap group, but -as Newsday's Frank Owen noted -they were \"the first rap group that mattered.\" Their impact on the music was immediate and cataclysmic. The Source's Reginald Dennis has written that \"just as Christ split history into BC and AD Run-DMC forever separated rap into the ne~ and old school.\" Ten years later all that history might as weU be bunk. When it comes to the noto\u00ad ~ous _ly demanding hip-hop crowd the ques\u00ad uon 1s What have you done for me lately? What Run-DMC have done on their latest album, Down With The King, is no small trick. They have simultaneously mod\u00ad ernized their sound by opening themselves to outside producers and stayed true to the pure rap vinuosity that has always distinguished them. Down with the King features produc\u00ad tion by such present day st.ars as Naughty by Nature, EPMD, the Bomb Squad, Diamond D. Specialist (Mad Cobra). Chyskills (Onyx), Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest. Rage Against the Machine, and Pete Rock and CL Smooth. \"A year ago my brain wasn't ~y for Run confessed to Rap Pages's Michael Gonzoles . \"All of a sudden I had to chill out: 'You can't do it all yourself. You've got to collabor.u, and let CL Smooth try to rhyme with you.\" In fact. Run DMC found thn these new jacks were thrilled witl the old masters, on record and in th video \"Down With The King\" - which features cameos from Pete ,\\ CL, Naughty by Nature, A Trib1 Called Quest, and Kriss Kros' Easy-E, KRS-One, PM Dawn, Part,. Salt 'n' Pepa, and Redman. In at least one way, the collaborn \u00b7 tions represent a dream come true DMC's reactions to def jams b' other artists has always been th: same. \"Yo, if I has a that crack, I'd rip it!\" And time and again on Down with the King that is precise- ly what happens. The aggressi,, and virtuosiry of Run-DMC's vocah is staggering. As Geoffrey Himes, writinr for the Washington Post. noted in 1990, \"rap may dispense with melody for the most part but rappers are still vocalists: tone amt phrasing are as important to Run-DMC a' they are to Luther Vandros or Anita Baker Rap may boast better songwriters than Run DMC, but no better vocalists. They are thr Sam and Dave of hop-hop.\" Technique and conlenl have often dovetailed in Run-DMC's music: they rap superbly well about being the greatest rap\u00ad pers. One of the few times they deviate fom1 this subject. it is to praise God on the album\u00b7, title track. \"We were runnin' around jus1 thinking about ourselves and we took a fall because we foryot where all blessings comr from,\" says DMC who, like Run, has become a born-again Christian. \"Now we've seen thl\u00b7 lighl Ask God wants is his probs. So just a' the Five Percenters rap about Allah and th1 rastas sign about Jah, we're praising God in our music.\" And none of this is to touch on Run-DMC', undiminished skills in live performance ~eviewing a show are the Gavin Convenrio1 , m San Francisco in February of this year Billboard's Havelock Nelson was moved to describe it as \"hip-hop utopia,\" adding 'Think of how many weak shows ya slep1 through, then bow at the altar of Run-DMC ', greatness . Assessing Run-DMC's Caree1 recently for his cover story in 1lle Source Reginald Dennis wrote: \"Call is a comeback if you must, but I would never undercstimati the power of a group that set a standard tha1 held the rap industry hostage for five strati years. They faces similar odds a decade age and prevailed . In 1993 they are focused. hungry, and have something to prove.\" Page4 rr The Cairn November 18, 1997 Do You Worry About Contracting A Terminal Illness? Is It The Illness You Fear Or Death? Greg Mack Stair Writer \"Worry\" is not the word I would use lo describe the way I think about contracting a tenninaJ disease. I do not say this because I want to defend myself in some way from worrying too much. Unfortunately illness, i.imilar to many things in my life, is a prob\u00ad lem that I usually choose to ignore. I am, however, in no way blind to the health issues that surround me. Instead, I choose to ignore what I know is good for me. A quote from a country music song comes to mind: \"I'm old enough to know better, and still too young to care.\" Am I afraid of tenninal diseases? You bet. Am I afraid lo die? Not really. I live a very unhealthy lifestyle. My favorite brealcfast is a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich (the more grease the better). I love to eat pizza for lunch (lots of meat), and a juicy steak for dinner. Of course, all of my meaJs are topped off with a big fat cancer stick (AKA cigarette). I smoke about a half pack of cigarettes a day unless I drink. If I'm drinking, which I only do about once or twice a week, I'll smoke as many cigarette s as I can get my hands on. I'm fully aware that all these disgusting habits will probably kill me if I keep them up, but for some reason I have made no attempts to stop any of them. So obviously, living the lifestyle I do, diseases such as cancer and emphysema tend to dominate any thoughts I might have about death or illness. ln the back of my mind, I feel that I will eventually die of a heart attack. and I would rather have it that way than to be laid up in a bed somewhere wasting slowly away into death. About a month ago I had a long talk with my friend's grandmother. Her husband died in the local hardware store one Saturday morning. He always said he wanted to die with his boots on, and I feel the same way right now. Sometime s I feel like the way I speak (or don't speak) about these issues that I am purposely avoiding the way I truly feel. This is not the case, however. Even though I feel downright foolish saying it, I feel like there is nothing that can kill me. There is a differ\u00ad ence between what a person's brain says and what a person's guts say. My guts say that I will live forever. That sounds good to me, so I choose, at this point in my life, to listen to my guts. Maybe I should have grown up in the 19th century. It would have been so much easier for me. I aJways wonder, in those days, was there any time to worry about how you felt about what we call \"seri\u00ad ous issues?\" I don't think so. Back then peo\u00ad ple were too busy with real problems such as: How am I going to put food on this table all winter Jong? I don't feel like it's a cop-out to want to live like this either. Some people are good at thinking about issues and developing philosophies about them, while others are good at simplifying things and trying to worry about life instead of death. Underneath all of my well thought-out B.S .. I am certainly scared. I would rather die quickJy and with much pain then to suf\u00ad fer with something such as cancer for what would seem like a lifetime. I do appreciate the issue of \"closure,\" and I think it's impor\u00ad tant. Obviously there is no closure in a quick death. I can only hope that I have strong enough relationships with people while I'm alive, that friends and family would be able to successfully cope with not having talked to me about my own death. I don't fear death. I have no idea what happens when a person dies, and I find it very difficult to speculate about it. Ideally, it would depend on what you believe when you are on Earth. Christians go lo heaven. Atheists lie in the grave forever. It is certain\u00ad ly hard to imagine that there is one belief on this planet that is correct, and that is what happens to everyone. To be so brainwashed by your religion as to believe that it is absolutely the correct one is the epitome of ignorance. I truly hope that there is some\u00ad thing after this life. Even though I hope to have led a full life by the time J die, the one thing about death that scares me is the possi\u00ad bility that we will lie under the dirt in an infi\u00ad nite coma. The reason I say I don't fear death is because I find this scenario highly unlike\u00ad ly. I believe in something after death. I just don't know what it is. It has taken me a while to finally spit continued on page 11 Is There a Bandit in Your Mailbox? The U.S. Postal Service will deliver more than 180 billion pieces of mail this year. including some interesting, appealing and attractive solicitations . Unfortunately , some ol these solicitations come from scam artists. . The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service say the mail\u00ad box bandits lurking behind these solicitations are only after only one thing -your money. ~ncl many are using approaches that tug at your heartstri~g s, take advantage of your trusting nature or the entrepreneur in you. The two federal agencies suggest that ~onsumers c~uld beat the bandits at their own game if they recognize the lines they use. and if they practice some defensive moves. For example, you may find these lines in your mailbox: *\"You are a guaranteed winner of one of five valuable prizes!\" . . A prize often used as the bait for an investment in products such as low quality VII\u00b7 amins, ineffective home water purifiers or alann systems. The amount of money you send back always exceeds the value of the prize being offered. -You have been selected to receive a fabulous vacation!\" . Just send a membership fee to receive the \"dream\" vacation. Look for scheduhnl-' problems , nonexistent cruises, shabby hotels and Oy-by-night airlines. *\"Stuff eO\"Velopes at home and earn BIGS$$!\" Few companies hire individuals to provide this service. When you send money fo1 the plan to operate this business-it's likely that you'll receive a \"plan\" that doesn't rea_ll~ apply to this opportunity and an order for high-priced samples that you'll have no choice about using. *\"This chain letter is perfectly legal!\" . All chain letters are illegal. It's that simple. The people who make big bucks from chain letters are the organizers : the people at the top of the list. Everyone C?lse loses. . *\"Your humble assistance is highly solicited in transferring millions of dollars, avaalabh from the National Petroleum Company of (name of country), to share with your good self. All we need is your bank account number.\" . . The invitation to \"launder\" foreign money is a solicitation to commit a cnme and 11 doesn't stop here. Once the foreign-based scam artists receive your bank acc~unt num~1. they usually ask for money in advance to \"assist\" the transfer. Consumers l~se in two way:-. \u00b7 by sending the requested money and by providing scam artists access to their bank accounh The Best Defense The FfC and USPIS advise you to be skeptical about all mail solicitations. including tho, .. delivered by private carrier that might be marked as priority delivery. Private carriers are cm\u00b7 ered in the U.S. mail-fraud law. * Don't pay for a free gift. . . * If the mailing asks for money or an upfront fee for a pnze or contest, don t do II You don't have to pay to play. . * If a solicitation urges you to use a private courier to send payment, toss 11. * If a solicitation looks like a government document, and says it's agovemment do..: ument, pitch it. The federal government does not solicit. * If you respond, document your transactions. Keep the mailing envelopes from solicitors to prove that the mails were used. * Never provide credit card or bank account numbers to any solicitor. * Before you send any money for any product or service, check out th~ company with the attorney general in your state or the state where the company 1s located.

Sliced Ham Eggs, Erin McGann Contributing Writer Colleges and Universities all over the U.S. have problems regardless of the size, ethnicity or gender of the student body. The most common problem is alcohol being on and around college campuses. Alcohol is a drug that can drag students, their GPAs and their friends down. It can kill you or some\u00ad one you care about. Many people think that most cases of overconsum ption of alcohol is only relat\u00ad ed to fraternities, spons clubs and other orga\u00ad nizations that use hazing as a form of initia\u00ad tion. This in fact is not true. Anyone can con\u00ad sume too much alcohol and become ill or even die. It is a serious problem that most people do not think about or take seriously. Here at CSC we have been fortu\u00ad nate not to lose students as a result of inebri\u00ad ation. There have, however, been accidents involving students who consume too much alcohol and either drive or ride with someone who has had too much to drink. If students refuse to think about the consequences of their actions it will only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed. One of the main problems with alcohol on campus is that a large majority of the student body is underage. This does not deter students from drinking because they have friends who can buy alcohol for them. The other alternative for underage drinkers is off-campu s parties. At CSC it !s not diffi\u00ad cult to find off-campus parties who have no problem serving minors almost any night of the week. Srudents can drink with their friends all night and not have to worry about getting caught. They do have to worry about how they might need to get home, can they find a sober driver, getting back into their dorms without being seen by an RA or just maintain enough common sense not to get involved in siruations that could harm them. Alcohol dulls the senses and impairs motor skills to the degree that most people cannot make wise decisions. Another problem is that many stu\u00ad dents who do go to off-campus panies are freshmen who do not have a lot of experi\u00ad ence in being able to drink as much as they want. This could lead to alcohol poisoning . It seems that at CSC drinking is a favored way to pass time as there are few alternatives that provide entertainm ent. A large majority of the student body, both underage drinkers and those who are legal, enjoy drinking and hanging out with their friends. After questioning a handful of ran\u00ad dom students it would \u00b7seem that most stu\u00ad dents drink on average four nights a week. On any of those given four nights an average of five to I 0 beers are consumed. According to a pamphlet received from a local SADD chapter, that means students who do drink more than five beers, more than three nights a week are considered binge drinkers. This is a peninent sign of a drinking problem. Understanding that this is college and that most people do drink more than an average amount is still alarming . It can lead to health problems in the fyture as well as become habit forming. College studen1 need to realize that alcohol is a drug and i addictive. Ask anyone of the thousands ' people in AA. Did they just decide 1 become alcoholics or did it just happen a' they grew dependent on the alcohol? Even in college alcohol can cause its own proh\u00b7 lems aside from dependency. It can cau' \u00b7 moodiness, grades to slip and, unfortun ate!~ it can lead to other drugs. No one is saying that people shoul0 not drink or have a good time, it should ju\u00b7\u00b7 be understood that caution is neces sar~ Students should designate drivers and nn overindulge. Keep a close eye on a frien i who might have had too much, maybe g; them home or at least stop them from con suming more. Don't let someone who is your friend get into serious trouble over a coup! of beers.

I . i - The Cairn November 18, 1997 Beyond Naturalism: Reversing the Mechanization of Life Framk Morgan Contributing Writer In the last issue of The Cairn pointed out the hidden religious basis of nat\u00ad urnlism and the need for a level playing field in public education . The distinctive of natu\u00ad ralism is its belief that the regularity of nature I!. the only self-existent reality. Sonat\u00ad urah\\m is the negation of theism which holds that the personal God alone is irreducible and that 'uch qualities as goodness, justice, love, and faithfulness are prior to the matter and energy of the physical universe. For purpos\u00ad es of this discussio n, we may consider both naturalism and theism as philosophical posi\u00ad tions rather than religions, though both have a religious base. Admittedly I am an outsider 10 naturalism, so I may not have a compre\u00ad hensive grasp of its tenants. But I do have lot'> of questions . Like what is the impact of naturalism on the humanities? Do the regu\u00ad larnie., of nature really provide a basis strong enough 10 suppon my deep yearnings for jus\u00ad uce, love. and faithfulne ss? You say that I am a \u00b7\u00b7child of the universe.'' Is not the child of a machine '>lilt a machine? My hean cries out, .. I am not a machine.\" Historically a powerful flow of ideas from the humanitie s inspired and restrained the social and natural sciences. But now the flow is the other way. The over\u00ad whelming success of mathematical model\u00ad ling and the mushrooming of technology and the :.riences has led to the triumph of natu\u00ad rali'm and the capitulation of the humanities 10 the \\Ciences. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to tum back the clock on mathematics an<l 'ctence. I owe a debt to medical technol\u00ad ogy I am not ctiucizing the good wort.. of my collctgues in the sciences. But I am ques\u00ad uonuig the philosophical position of natural\u00ad l\\111 wi1h 11'. corollary that man is a cog tn the big machine we call the ur.iverse. Admittedly it is a corriplex '>UbJeCt a lifelong search for truth. We can only begin 10 scratch the surface in a bnef anicle. A thorough '>ludy would need 10 be framed in the history of ideas, but even a provisional loot.. requires the whole range of the '>Ciences and humanities. Roy Clouser* sugge!.tS an 01 <lered hst of fifteen aspects of-experience u,eful in looking at the inter-connections bc1ween the humanities and the sciences. I. liduciary 6. social 11. biological 2 ethical 7. linguistic 12. physical 1 JU'>tiual 8. historical 13. kinematic -1. ;1c,1he11c 9. logical 14. spatial 5. economic I 0. sensory 15. quantitati ve At the very bottom is mathematic s, the least complicated aspect, the study of pat- 1crns involving quantity and space. Gomg up, we see that the kinematic, or motion, builds on ideas of quantity and space. In tum, the quantitative. spatial, and kinematic aspects prepare the way for physics. And on we go up the list with increasing complexity through the natural and social sciences to the humanities, starting with the aesthetic, our recognition of good quality. The justitial admits our belief that the good things should be apponioned fairly. The foundatio n of the ethical is agape love, defined as doing justice regardless of personal cost. The fiduciary refers to the varying levels of reliability a thing or person may have, especially as it relates to human social relations. It also has a connection to religious faith defined as belief in something as unconditionally reliable. An example of this is naturalism's belief in the unconditional reliability of cenain mathe\u00ad matical and physical laws of nature. How does naturalism describe the interconnectedness of the aspects? If the reg\u00ad ularities of nature are the only self-existing realities, then the tendency is to reduce all the aspects to natural law and mathematical constants. The sciences are not adversely affected by this. but the funher we go up the list. the more damaging this reduction becomes. It is the the humanities, that are in danger of becoming irrelevant. The current movie Ganaca is an unsettling metaphor of technology applied to people. Perhaps 1984 i' still to come. Cynicism in our post-modem culture is realistically and depressingly com\u00ad municated by our poets and artists. We unthinkin gly try to fill the abyss of meaning\u00ad lessness with obsessive work, play, alcohol, or sex. Meanwhile our most perceptive observers tell.us that the fabric of society is unraveling. I recen1ly heard two radio talk show hosts assuming that all human behavior can be reduced to chemical process. But such reductioni stic talk misses the main point of being human. It is like saying a book is only a list of letters. A person is way more than a machine. Love is far more than a chemical reaction. Moral excellence is far and away beyond a genetic propensity . We dare not omit the fiduciary in any discussion of human behavior. Why do we find the idea of cloning people so terrifying? It is because human Teproduction is far above the biologi\u00ad cal. Childbearing is a complex human expe\u00ad rience that spans all the aspects, but the gov\u00ad erning aspect ought to be the fiduciary. Children are meant to be born under the pro\u00ad tection of a covenant relationship between a man and a woman within a covenant-keepi ng community governed by an ethic based on love and justice. This covenant relationship itself points to the corresponding faithfulness of the personal Creator who instituted mar\u00ad riage and the family to teach us the most pro\u00ad found lessons of life - justice, love and faithfulness. Then how does the theistic world\u00ad view explain the interconnectedness of the aspects? The theistic dependency idea of the Bible teaches us that all aspects are part of one continuous reality sustained by God, the continued on page 11 The Mysterious Dome: An Open House by Barbara Kimmel Melissa Kelley Dr. Patrick Keller You have all seen, at one time or another, the whitewashed dome near the cen\u00ad ter of campus. What is it, you ask? No. it's not a lawn sculpture of an igloo, nor a downed spaceship. It's a greenhouse, of course! The CSC greenhouse had remained dormant for several years and was overrun with hundreds of fems and ivies, forgotton plants, decay, a one-eyed toad and tons of bugs. Its only function in recent years had been to overwinter various campus landscap\u00ad ing plants and ornamental s. Inspired by inde\u00ad pendent study projects involving the extrac\u00ad tion of chemical compounds from medicinal \u00ad plants, it was decided that the greenhouse would have to be restored. Over the summer, all the existing infested plants were tipped out, their con\u00ad tainers washed and disinfected; the floors, walls, benches, stone beds, vinually every\u00ad thing, was scoured and disinfected; the roned work benches were tom down and rebuilt; new light fixtures and timers were installed; sprinklers repaired; ceiling panels cleaned and caulked; the list goes on and on. By 1 start of the Fall semester the negleclC<l dot had been transformed into a tropical p adise! Dozens of species of medicinal plai grown at home over the summer have be transplanted into their new home. A nurse was started and new seedlings are sprouti and growing by leaps and bounds. Ever hospital bench for sick plants has been cc structed. The CSC greenhouse is once aga a functional and attractive part of our beau fut campus! At this time, we would like invite all those students and faculty who ha spied from afar, wondering what lies insi the mysterious dome, to an open house spo sored by Dr. Keller and the Medicinal Ph Chemistry students. We encourage eveiyo to stop by on Tuesday, December 2, betwe 12: 15 p.m. and 2 p.m. Come in from out the cold and take in the sights, smells a pleasures of the tropics.

I find people who go though these .gooizing diseases to be incredibly brave, .erbaps even more so than a war hero or a :owboy who goes down.in a blaze of glory. n war a soldier is shot, he smokes his last :igareue and he's a hero. He is a hero, no ll8tter what his cause is. I would never lebale that To die in a hospital though, and n tty to come to terms with your own death -cquires something different. An old line\u00ad J&Ck\u00ab in the NFL was once asked to define ihc word courage. He said, \"Those are the guys lbat are scared, but they go anyway.\" I :an only speak for myself, but as a soldier I joo't think I would have time to be scared. I would be more scared to die in a hospital and have to taUc about my feelings for a year. forme. it would require more courage to die in. hospital. As I've said. now that I'm thinking about them, the issues of disease, and to an meat. death, do scare me. Previously, how\u00ad ever, this has not been the case. I really have been scared in the past simply because I not thought about death and disease. I 't want to die of a disease that I could prevented with a different lifestyle, lllbough I realiz.e that if I don't change mine, I probably will. Right now, I think I'm hop\u00ad ing to be one of those guys who smokes butts and eats bacon until the day he dies at age 90. I realiz.e this will probably not happen. \"A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth glancing at.\" -Oscar Wilde Naturalism from pg. 10 Creator of all kinds of causality in the uni\u00ad verse. Setting up any aspects as having an unconditional existence is a form of idolatry as much as bowing down to gods of wood or clay. It is absolutely necessary to study all the aspects without reduction. The Bible is first and foremost a book of religion -not a technical manual for biology or geology or mathematics. It exercises guidance but does not replace theory-making within and across the aspects, including the fact that all theory and practice involving human beings is meant to be governed by the fiduciary aspect. Refusal to be a faithful steward of the Creator is the root whose fruit is a vari\u00ad ety of covenant-breaking offences including cheating, dishonoring parents, abuse, mur\u00ad der, adultery, stealing, lying, ingratitude that flow from the deadly internal sins of pride, coveting, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. The Biblical hope is redemption and grace bringing reconciliation with God and then with self, others, and nature leading to justice, love, and faithfulness. The reader may have sincere differ\u00ad ences with some of what I have written. This gives us an occasion to sharpen issues, seek truth and practice tolerance. We are left with a question. \u00b7Do these sincere differences provide an excuse for unrighteous behavior under the guise of relativism? I think not. The commandments that I alluded to in the previous paragraphs have analogs in the lit\u00ad erature of many cultures and religious tradi\u00ad tions. These provide an objective standard for morality and a hedge against violence. We talk about the need for high expectations in academics. Is this possible without higher expectations for the greater values of justice, love and faithfulness? * See Roy Clouser. ( 1991). The Myth of Religious Neutrality.

I l Poets, Artists, And The Bible as a Story The other day while walking through the Campus Center, a man gave me a little green bible for free. Upon opening it, I was greeted with a disclaimer warning that God will \"condemn all who trifle with its sacred contents.\" At the risk of being brand\u00ad ed sacrilegious, I read anyway. Blood, tears, and magnificent mira\u00ad cles stimulated the imagination, and the fan\u00ad tastic writing reinforced the riff between religion and faith. All around me it was apparent that the fabric of society certainly was unraveling to the tune of the foretold seven deadly sins, but a perceptive observer could see that it is a lack of passion and poetry, not a lack of religion and morality that will be our downfall. I enjoyed the bible. Dusty stories to be sure, but brilliant. Truly these prophets were poets and artists, as they made the hair on the back of my neck stand up; my soul touched deeply be their beautiful thoughts (darkly disturbing as they may have been.) Despite the threatening undertone, I could not help but to be filled with faith (unbeliev\u00ad ing but inspired). Like a chalice I was filled with the love of God -it spilled out through my eyes. I began to doubt fantastically with a wondrous new cynicism, and the world glowed through my faith goggles. I grabbed a canvas and a brush, and painted to cele\u00ad brate life, love and art; swirled blue, red and green, much like our creator must have. 1 painted stories good and bad-with a gift bestowed upon me by the character Satan (the first artist), who showed me black. Onyx religious fundamentalism and mid\u00ad night eyes in dead crusaders. Christian neo\u00ad nazis, Jesse Helms and radical racists. Satan the outcast didn't really fit in with the white, Christian format; but he certainly deserved a chapter none the less in this book of faith and enlightenment. So\u00b7 I combined the beauty of the creator's words with the artist's wisdom and open mind. The glowing light leaked out of me everywhere as I .saw Baby Jesus in the arms of the un-wed mother. I danced, drank and sang God's praises with people of all races and all religions; the earth a holy movie screen and a colored film loop, illu\u00ad minating the blac~ and white shadows and traditional imptica1ions of \"religion and morality\". I saw Jesus in the love shared by homosexuals. I saw Mary, the mother of God in my lover's eyes. I saw God himself in everything alive. Somewhere bells sounded, tri\u00ad umphant and glad.

VSC.EDU December 9, 1997 This issue was written and published under protest of the fact that Alexandria Pinizzotto, our student association president, was not impeached for her misuse of power and premeditated lies. The Cairn urges everyone to become more politically active on campus and take notice of what is actually going on within our student ovemment. Dear Editor, After venting my frustrations with the abundant amount of parking tickets given on this campus in the last issue, a strange but interesting thing occurred. All sorts of friends and acquaintances kept telling me about how they too were victims of huge parking fines. So I realized that to bring any closure to this subject, I needed to do some research. So I set up an appointment and here's what I got. My interview with Mike Davidson, Director of Public Safety was a very pleasant one. He was helpful and answered all but one question of mine. The way the system works is quite simply really. A vehicle gets a ticket. In ten days if that ticket is not paid, campus law reserves the right to add a late fee to the unpaid ticket. Davidson was aJso quick to point out that he holds back on a strict \"ten days then a late fee.\" He gives the fined\u00b7 vehicle an ample amount of time to paid the ticket. Now if an appeal fonn is filed. there are two ways it is dealt with. In the beginning of the school year, the student court is not even elected yet. So Mike Davidson takes care of the appeals that come through before the court is established. He reads through each appeal and judges them as impar\u00ad tially as he can. But when the student court b elected and in session, they review and pass judgement on all of the appeals. This process is what eats up aJl the time it takes for the appeal to be decided on. By the time the appeal has be delivered to and looked over by all the right people, it's three to four weeks later. Welcome to the wonderful world of due process! When I asked Mike about the set payments for the various violations, he informed me that our campus fines were well below the average college parking fines, and that most schools' tickets start off anywhere between thirty and fifty dollars. Davidson also correct\u00ad ed me in the fact that the student court has dealt with appeal forms for at least the past five years, not recently as I was lead to believe. But the million dollar question was still at unanswered; Where does aJI the money go? Mr. Davidson told me I would have to go to Dean of Administration Robert Bruce's office for that answer. He deals with aH the money lhat Mike Davidson receives from the parking fines. This is where I hit the brick wall. Bob Bruce is away until after the deadline for this issue. I was told that Kelly Gilmour was my only hope. No such luclc. Mrs. Gilmour just recently had a baby and in on maternity leave. Congratulations Kelly. But no Congratulations to me.

Jessica Gulley has resigned as treasurer of the St11dent Association due to a moral con\u00ad flict, and consequently, Castleton State College has lost one of its most dedicated and hard working class officers. The Cairn would like to thank Jessica for her service to our school, and commend her for her integrity i11 making this moral stand. The following is her letter of resignation, explaining the circumstances for her decision. Good luck Jess, we're all behind you ... -Ed. November 18, 1997 The Code of Conduct of our Student Handbook states \"Falsificatio n of information on College records or providing false infonnation to the College is prohibited\" (CSC Handbook, pg. 12). Two weeks ago, Alexandria Pinizzotto , our student body President was accused of violating the Student Association Constitution by involving herself with the class elections. Alexandria has also been accused of lying to a college official to cover up he\u00b7r own actions, and attempting to rely on other members of the SA to lie for her. Therefore , it is my opinion that she \"provided false infonnation to the College.\" In a Senate meeting held on November 5, 1997, Alexandria admitted to committing the actions stated. On Novembe r 16, 1997, a petition for impeachment Wa!> taken to the Senate, by a student-at-large. and it was narrowly voted down. All of these actions show a lack of honesty and integrity by Alexandria. Due to the moral and ethical conflicts that have arisen. I have chosen to withdraw myself from the student government. I hereby resign as Treasurer of the Student Association Executive Board, effective immediately. I have been on the Executive Board as Treasurer for the past two terms. In the past two years, I have gotten to know many of you very well and have helped your clubs and orga\u00ad nizations the best way I knew how. I have given my all to the Student Association and have enjoyed every minute of it. I want you to know that this resignation was not an easy decision. It is with a heavy heart that I give up a huge part of my life. I want you to know exactly why I made this dicision. It is because I refuse to be associated with an organization whose President violates the SA Constitut ion to benefit herself, and then have her go unpunished, especially with the action\u00b7s being so blatant and deceitful. I personally want to thank everyone for a wonderfu l two years. I hope that all of you, those who are involved and those of you who are not, understand what has happened in your student government. Maybe because of this, more people will become aware of what goes on in their student government. Sincerely , Jessica A. Gulley Problems in the ACC There are a lot of problems in the ACC. On some days, computers are down, launchers are nowhere to be found due to a type-39 error in the system, spell checks won't work or printers are not working properly. The ACC is for students to get work done on the computers, and especially now, at the end of the semester, students don't have the time to deal with freezing screens and other hassles. There is also the problem of the ACC monitors. some of whom are helpful, and some of whom are definitely not. Many times the monitors act like it is a burden to help stu\u00ad dents out, but isn't that their job? Isn't that why they are getting paid? It seems like it is time to get the ACC back on track. With exams coming up quick\u00ad ly, there will be limited time for students to use the computers, and the last thing they need are problems with the tenninals. Let's hope that when students come back from break, these little bugs will be worked out. Erin McGann eacts Chief Justice Reacts I got involved with the Student Association two years ago. The reason was because I thought I would feel proud of belonging to an organization whose main purpose is to defend the rights and be the voice of the CSC student body. Lately my perceptions of the SA have changed. People taking sides and getting involved for the wrong rea,ons have given the SA a bad reputation. The purpose of this letter is to express my discontent with the quality of the work that is coming out of the SA. Impeachments, misunderstandings and conflict!. between mem\u00ad bers have destroyed the communication and lack of interest within th1'> organiz.a11on whose main purpose has become a constant competition to demonstrate who has more power and more guts. Today, I am ashamed to admit that I am part of this Student Association . This is not a letter of resignation, but a wake-up call. I, like many of my cowork\u00ad ers, am tired of useless meetings that are just a waste of time. The lack of communica tion and people taking sides are destroying this organization . We need to open our eye~ and real\u00ad ize that nothing is getting done. We are not achieving anything. For most of us this is our last year. We should be an example to the !.tudents that are taking over our positions next year. ln,tead we are teaching them how to wa\\le 11111e and go through a whole year without accomplishing anythmg . We need to 'tart workmg togeth\u00ad er as a team. Difference!. need to be either brought up and re!.olved, or 1-ept in and forgotten. We need to realize that there is only five more month'> left in the 'chool year. For us ,eniors. that means five months to make some changes and leave our landmark,, and for the remain\u00ad ing students. it means getting better and striving for higher positiom.. The way I 'ee it. we have two choices. We can either !.lay in and work hard to accomplish '>Orne thing' a-. a team. or quit. I hope our posiuons are meaningful enough to reali7e that staying in i' the nght dec1- sion. Thank you for taking the time 10 read this teller. Please feel free 10 give any foed\u00ad back, or offer any sugge!.lions. Sincerely, Victor Hugo Echandy Chief Justice of the College Court Thanks! For the past four or five year!., as many of you know, we did not require residents 10 move their cars from the resident lots when snow storms occurred. We would plow the road\u00ad way behind the vehicle and clean the lot during break weeb. This policy was adopted because many students would not move their cars when a \"snow emergency\" was declared. making plowing virtually impossible. This winter, in an effort to respond to student's concerns, we agreed to try the old \"move your cars and move them back when asked to\" policy. I would hke to take thi!> oppor\u00ad tunity to thank the resident student population at CSC for making the first \"snow emergency\" declaration of the winter an absolute success. We were able to plow and i.alt all of the resi\u00ad dent parking lots in a very efficient manner, and only a handful of cars had to be towed. If the rest of our \"snow emergencies\" go as well as this one did, we should have a much more enjoyable winter. Who says we can't al I cooperate and unite on a common issue? If you have comments, good or bad, I wou Id like to hear from you. I can be reached at xl335 or by e-mail (parkerg@sparrow .csc.vsc.edu). Once again, thanks for making it work! Gary F.

National Literacy Program Underway by Jeremiah Sargent Staff Writer -President 8111 Clinton issued a chal- lenge to mobilize students across the country to assist in children's literacy, and many CSC students have accepted his challenge. The goal of this program: to fight illiteracy by sending 100,000 students to serve as reading tutors for children across the country The baule grounds: libraries, schools and head stan programs. Equipped with books and a giving spirit, 23 CSC students and community members have taken on the president's chal\u00ad lenge to increase literacy across the country The program, which 1s in llS first year of existence. pairs students with children, who range in age from grades K 1hrough founh. and a\\s1sts them wllh reading skills. All of the state colleges, including the University of Vennont, are dedicating funds and workers toward this program. Many of these Reading Partners as they are called are work-study sponsored, but several volunteers have also offered their ser\u00ad vices The school has allotted S 12,500 toward the program. e nabling students to get paid for their effons. The coordinators for the program in Castleton are Brooke Manin the RD m Wheeler Hall, Ken Moulton director of financial aid, and Joyce Cunningham chair of the education department. \"h's very excit\u00ad ing being part of this program, students acro:.s the nation are going out and helping kids learn to read bener,\" Brooke Manin said. The Reading Partners are required to go through a day long training program which helps them understand how to teach and work wuh students Not only are the children benefiting but according to Martin the schools are reap\u00ad ing the rewards. 'The teachers are very excited about the program, and the kids love the students as roll models,\" she said. \"You get the opponunity to work with all different types of student:. and all different types of learning styles,\" said Cory Monastero, one of the Reading Partner:-.. \"Our only goal is to be there to help the stu\u00ad dents.\" According to Manin lhey intend to continue the program into the spnng semes\u00ad ter and that <;everal positions might be open\u00ad ing next semester.

Square. Flatland was like a vast sheet of paper within which figures could move freely about but were unable to rise above or sink below the flat plane of their existence. Flatland had an east/west axis, and a north/south axis, but no up or down. It was a two-dimen sional world with time as ours is three-dimensional universe with time. Flatland residents had thoughts, emotions, and aspirations like ours, but had shapes like plane figures, mostly polygons, though some had so many sides that they were almost circular. It was approaching midnight of the last evening of the second millennium, the year 1999. Mr. Square wai. sitting in his living room waiting for the new millenium to begin. Ju!>I as the clock finished striking twelve, a figure suddenly appeared within the locked house. It seemed 10 grow rapidly from a mere point to a full-sized circle. In his a,1oni)hmen1. Square cried out to the creature 10 identify itself. The stranger explained that he wa~ from Space, the land of three dimension s. After several unsucces)ful attempts to explain three-space to Square, the circle (actually Mr. Sphere) did a demonstrJtion. By moving up, he shrank to a point, then disappeared from Square's view above the plane of Flatland. Moving parallel above Flatland, he descended into Square's closed bedroom and took a tablet from Square's closed, locked cupboard. As Sphere moved he described all his actions, and soon reappeared with the tablet in his possession. He then tickled Square's insides causing a shooting pain, and his chuckle !>t!emed to come out of Square's stomach. This was more than our hero could take, and he charged angrily, sticking an angle into Sphere's clothing. Refusing to back off. he was carried into Space as Sphere moved up ou1 of Flatland. Suddenly Square could see al once the inside and outside of his whole house and all its contents and occupants as well as his neighbor's. Square cried to his com\u00ad panion. \u00b7\u00b7Behold I have become as God!\" Sphere explained that knowledge was not the moM imponant quality of godliness, but that love was greater. Then Sphere whisked him off to the metropolis where the High Council of Flatland was in !>ession for ils millennial meeting 10 squelch the reports of revelations from other worlds. They were about 10 start 1he millennial search for misguided persons who claimed to believe in.the third dimension . Square saw that imprisonment would await the apo)tle of the third dimension. But now he so well understood the existence of higher dimem.ions that he thought he could explain it to a child. But Sphere forbad him to do a demoni.1r.11ion 10 th!.! High Council. Then Sphere himself entered their presence and ~howed his inter!>ecting circles in their mulliplici1y of radii. The Council took this 10 be a magical growth. and ordered him arrested. But Sphere quickly retreated into three-space . Sphere then gave Square a lesson in solid geometry. Square was a fast learner, and soon was applying the lesson 10 Sphere's world. Perhaps there were yet higher beings of four or more dimensions who could see through walls and tickle the insides of Spheres! Square said, \" ls it not a fact that your countrymen have witnessed the descent of Beings of a higher order that your own, entering closed rooms, even as your lordship entered mine, without the opening of doors or windows, and appearing and vanishing al will?\" As you can well imagine. Square was a different man from that day forward. In spite of the threat of imprisonment in an asylum, he began to speak up. Square often attended seminm where the number of dimen)ions was 10 be discussed . One day an arro\u00ad gant scholar read a paper that claimed 10 prove that the number of dimensions had 10 be two. Square could no longer contain himself. He arose and spontaneously gave a com\u00ad plete account of his experiences. As you can imagine, he was immediately arrested and brought before the High Council. And so Square was sentenced 10 perpetual imprisonment . There he mel others who had i.een manifes1a1ions. But they could not grasp the nature of the Sphere, and attributed the manifestations to magic rather than movement in another dimension. In time he began to have periods of doubt when the reality of the Sphere he had seen appeared \"no better than the offspring of a diseased imagination, or the baseless fabric of a dream.\" And yet the memory of his encounter with Sphere sustained him as he wrote his memoirs. I share in his hope that \"these memoirs might find their way 10 the minds of humanity in some dimen\u00ad sion. and stir up a race of rebels who shall refuse 10 be confined 10 a theory of limited dimensionality.\" Abbott, Edwin A.

Hecht'l> hi!>torical analysis is accurate and without distortion (though is examples are 'omewhat exclul>ive), and Morgan's idea that moral excellence is derivative of the choices a pen.on make!> in being an agent of free will and moral goodness (though his examples are l>Omewhat obl>cure) il> al~o valid. It i!> not my intent to pandor or to capitulate on any of the key elements in this point/coun\u00ad terpoint; nonetheles!>, the discussion is complex and requires more than I can do in this brief rel>pon~e. My rel>ponse numerica lly corresponds to Mr. Hecht's. I. Moral objection obviously exists in other contexts but its relevance in the Hebrew and Chri,tian context cannot be ignored. Homer, moreove r, would have known of and been influenced by Hebrew writings. 2. \"The notion that moral excellence is not possible (other than] on the basis of confor- 1111t\\' with belief' adherel> to Erich to internal authorities, ~uch a~ c.:onl>cience\" which is often the response to a perverse and repressive government, becau!>e de.,tructive and irrational impulses exist in us which we rationally understand. 3. Principle~ such as Hillel's \"13 Principles of Faith\" can be premised on belief and in thtl> ca~e are the basis of moral action: \"I believe with perfect faith that the Creator .. . rewards those who keep His commandments and punishes those who transgress them.\" (Number 11) 4. We can u~e \"Law\" in the connotative sense (example: natured law), that is, a guiding rail more than a behaviora l certainty. 5. The French Revolution produced mob rule and a Reign of Terror as well as the Declaration of the Rights of Man. 6. Eugenics was embrclced in the U.S. by notable think tanks and institutions (including UVM). In Holland Christians (acting out of mornl conscience) who hid Jews or spoke out against Hnler' l> policiel> were also l>ent to death camp!.. In Denmark the entire population, led by their King. refused to comply with the Nazi order that all Jews wear armbands (the first step in i~olating and identifying Jews for purposes of extermination). The king wore an armband in defiance of the decree. Everyone followed his example. thus thwarting the entire process. In more recent history the Mi Lai Massacre was abhorrent even to the most hawkish sup\u00ad porter.. of the Vietnam War, and the Nurenburg Trials have established eternally that moral conM:ience ill. a higher authority than obedience to the state. Miscommu nication of ideas may be compelling theater, and the discussion by both Mr. Hecht and Mr. Morgan is welcome regardless of the controvers y we now find ourselves digesting, but there is a more important aspect to this discussion which I hope will not end here. whether or not I am correct in my assessment. I say this because we live in morally complacent times. where conscience and matters of justice are simply not discussed and are not central to the \"character structure\" which ultimately determine s how we behave toward one another. We learn how to ~hove. Being honest, intelligent, free of prejudice requires thal students and teachers respond with honesty. intelligence and without prejudice . I wel\u00ad come this discussion and see it as an opportunity to evoke matters of conscience as a priori- ty of the educational process. \"Life is like music; it must be composed by ear, feeling and instinct, not by rule.\" Does religious commentary have a place in a state institution? by Frank Moulton Contributin g Writer In as much as no attempted reply to Professor Morgan's running commentary has been published in the last three issues. I feel obliged 10 respond on behalf of those in the cam\u00ad pus community who do not share his religious views nor wish to see them expounded upon ad infinitum . While Prof. Morgan is polite and articulate, I believe that his continued use of official and student -sponsored campus forums for the propagatio n of Christian values is inap-' propriate at a state institution, and somewhat offensive to those of us who are agnostic (or atheistic) yet morally responsible. Moreover, since the intent of his most recent effons has . been to persuade us to abandon rationality in education and return to dogma, based on the recent, unsupported speculations of one Calvinist theologian. Roy Clouser, I feel impelled to offer a contrary view. First I must admit 10 not having read '\"The Myth of Religious Neutrality\". As a librarian, 1 am singularly aware of the multitude of sources of information and opinion that are regularly published, all of which cannot be digested (or even approached) by one individ\u00ad ual. For this reason, like most academics, I rely on the opinion of established writers with acknowledged expertise, as tempered by my own judgement based on personal experien ce, to aid in the selection of reading materials . That is, I read book reviews. Allow me to quote from one such review of Clouser's book, by Peter Byrne, as published in the March 1995 issue of \"Religious Studies:\" Clouser has not appreciated the full force of a counter to his claims based in a fallibilist, agnostic epistemology. It is a measure perhaps of his lack of awareness of the possibilities of alternative approaches to understanding the nature of reason and enquiry that he appears supremely confident that we know where to get the religious recipe for putting together a right theory of things ... Even granted the point that he is speaking lo a Judaeo-Christian audience. even an exclusively Christian one, this stance seems problematic. Needless to say, Prof. Morgan is not speaking to an exclusively Christian audience. Although other critics hold different opinions of this work (several acknowledge its complex\u00ad ity), my own judgement leads me to recognize his central thesis, that rationalism= na1uralism = paganism, as a standard rhetorical device known as \"reframing the debale.\" Apparen1ly the first six chapters of this book are spent in esoteric philosophical arguments intended 10 sup\u00ad port Clouser's redefinition of scientific theory as a (palenlly inferior) form of religion. From the basic assumption of a divinity which is founded on faith but built on rhetoric, all of his subsequenl arguments follow. It is basic to the central tenets of education worldwide for stu\u00ad dents to undersiand the difference be1ween assumptions and that which can be proven or demonstrated. The founda1ion of !he body of modem scientific and analy1ic knowledg e require a gradual accumulation and synthesis of these results of observations and experiments, con\u00ad stantly tested for validity on a pragmatic and empiric basis. Despite its limitations, this reliance on rational investigation, largely free from predetennined value judgements , has resulted in all of the major advances in standard of living since western science emerged from the suffocating cocoon of Christian tutelage during the European Renaissance and Enlightenment. Despite ages of philosoph ical and religious debate over the existence and meaning of God, no demonstrable progress was made in our material culture un1il society detennined to concentrate on aspects of life thal could be proven 10 have a consistenl basi\"'1 reality, al least al the level of our senses. To consider the effects of slate-supported theistic moral judgements on the progress of knowledge, one need look no further than the penecu\u00ad lioo of Bruno and the forced recanta1ion and imprisonmenl of Galileo. Prof. Mcqan refen IO ''The Fabric of Reality\" (Viking 1in, 1997) both use the sometimes oxical principals of quantum physics stulale lhe existence of multiple uni\u00ad ;. in which our \"unchanging mathe\u00ad al constants and physical relation\u00ad , would not necessarily apply, thereby aking Clouser's redefinition of scientif\u00ad uralism as a form of faith. Both of rationalist writers have the courage onesty to question even the most basic . of their upbringing, with a will to from the results. Can Roy Clouser (or Morgan) claim the same? \"I know but one freedom and that is the free\u00ad dom of the mind.\" -Antoine de Saint-Exupery )OS' ,0 Coast Silk Screen;n Custom 9 Keep recycling working.

The stone walls put up against the radio station start\u00ad ed in the Communi cation department itself. None of the radio classes showed any interest in using the sta\u00ad tion, contrary to what the CSC Bulletin suggests. Even the clubs faculty advisor, Bob Gershon, tool.. an indif\u00ad ferent stance as he regularly failed to attend meetings . Despite these obstacles, the station forged ahead. A plan was hatched that would move WTUV to the old Student Life offices, across from the mail room in the Campus Center. Measurements were taken and pro\u00ad posals were drawn up and submined for approval. The Campus Center Advisory l oard turned down the pro\u00ad posal. claiming that the station didn't have the interest or the commitment to make the move. Topf resigned with a bitter taste in his mouth. \"Castleton has the second highest out of state tu1t1on rate in 1he country for a state school\", he recalls, \"and frankly, it seems \\ery immature to me.

I think I speak for all in wishing the staff good luck, and hoping that someday WIUV will once again become the voice of CSC . 77 Percussionists bring Japanese tradition to CSC by Andrew Buck Staff Writer On Thursday, January 28th, in a huge burst of energy, the Burlington Taiko drummers erupted into a frenzy of excite\u00ad ment. Ta1ko, an ancient, Japanese form of fe~tival drummm g. is rapidly gaming popu\u00ad larity m this country as an expressive, thun\u00ad derously exciting, and exhilarating form of entertamment and exercise which incorpo\u00ad rates movements from the martial ans. A smaller group comprised of eight impressed the audience with their rhythmic playing. The total Burlington group is thirteen, with a total of about 120 groups across North America. The Burlington group staned in 1987. led by their sensei, Stuart Paton. The popular Japanese art form was invented about 1,500 years ago but came to the U.S. only fifty years ago. One of the pieces, Shi-Shi Mai, The Lion dance, introduces a favorite mythical creature who brings good luck, especially when he bites you. The Audience found this particular piece the most humorous because one of the entertainers dressed up as a lion and danced around the stage. Another piece, Tsunami or tidal wave began on the 0- Daiko(big drum), followed by a fan drum duet. A series of 0-Daiko solos surged to a resounding conclusio n. \"Taiko is neat because you use your entire body when you play.\" explained the sensei. After the performan ce, the group stayed behind and answered any questions the audience might have. The group practices every Tuesday night and all are encouraged. to learn the Japanese art. College store blamed for inflated book prices by Erin McGann Staff Writer It's that time of year again here at CSC -time to buy books. Students lined up to spend their hard earned cash on books they feel are too expensive . We've all moaned and groaned about the unfair prices but it's time to explain why we pay so much for our textbooks. John Schwaner , director of the College Store, explained that it is not the col\u00ad lege that charges the inflated prices of books, but the publishers. According to Schwaner , the College Store marks up the books only enough to cover the shipping, and actually makes only a fraction of the profit. If the books are not all sold to students, they must be shipped back to the publisher, also at the cost of the college. There are a couple of reasons the students feel the brunt of the book expense . It is the professors who decide which books to use in their classes. They send the name of the book and the publisher to Schwaner for ordering. Accordin& to Schwaner, professor s need lo be --e..oo.s of the boob they decide to ~. there may be a similar iext for Qfl I t a better price. Professors also need to prede\u00ad termine whether the books they have chosen will be mandatory reading or simply a sug\u00ad gested title. This will eliminate the possibili\u00ad ty of students paying for books they will not actually need for classes. Schwaner noted thai. t\"1ough he is always looking for better prices from pub\u00ad lishers it is difficult because he can only order through four big companies. Like most businesses, those publishers have competi\u00ad tive prices to make a profit also. The pub\u00ad lishers' cost of books rose 8% this year, that's 8% more than we had to pay last year. Everyone knows that buying books is expensive, but after the first few semesters the students should be accustomed to the prices. It should no longer be a surprise that books cost a lot. As for incoming freshmen, their parents are a given a clear idea of how much it will cost their children to buy books. During the summer orientation periods the SOS leadus and faculty explain that books willllecmdy. CSC men's basketball team off to a great start by Tim Matteson Staff Writer The CSC men's basketball team is having a good season so far. Their overall record is 7-6, but the team is a very impres\u00ad sive 5-0 in Mayflower Conference play. Coach Dave Blake told me in an interview that the Spartans have lost to many tough teams, including Middlebury College, Elmira, St. Thomas Aquinas and Dominican College. The team has many talented players that work together and compliment each other very well. Blake said, \"A different player can step up his game on any given night.\" The player that has \"stepped up his game\" the most this season is senior Tony Higgins. Higgins is the team's leading scor\u00ad er, averaging 15 points per game. He just ~ored his one thousandth poinl last Sunday ..-.. ~ co11csc.

Religion, Science and Dialogue in the Public Square by Frank Morgan Contributing Writer I want to thank Stuart Lavm for his constructive comments in the December issue of the Cairn regarding moral excellence and moral objection. Also appreciation goes to Frank Mouhon for his frank response to my Cairn articles. His commentary will serve to 'harpen the di,cussion. though I admit I find it ironic that a librarian would suggest censor\u00ad mg my thoughts on the connections of religion, naturalism, and morality. But in our society, no one 1-. excluded from civil d1-.course in the public square because of religion. And a state ~upported mstllution is part of the public square. Please hear me out. Having recently returned from a conference on teaching courses in science and reli\u00ad gion. I can report that there 1s an incre~ing interest in the connections. My own study on the impact ol mathematics in the history of ide<is has convinced me that these interconnections 'hould not be denied or trivialized. Mr. Moulton is correct that the contribution of Roy Clou,er to the discussion of the relationship of science and religion has not been widely rec\u00ad t)gnized. Howe\\er. there 1' a 'mall, growing network of scholars from several countries who are u-.mg a '11nilar approach In brief. this approach agrees that religion is not pan of what con,tllute' 'c1ence. Rather all theory mak.mg mcludmg science is regulated by religious belief Sc1l!nce 10 tum ca\\h 1h light on all other a'pects includmg religion. All the aspects are mter-related . The scientific method with its requirement of repeatability and falsifiabili\u00ad ty in the buildup of scientilic theory is indeed a wonderfu l success story. We are tempted to take a pos111on that ~cience should be free from all regulation. certainly religious control. But here \"the po1111 -the po'111on that \\C1ence -.hould be free from control is itself a claim that is not \\erifiable or fabifiablc! by \\C1ence. Clou'cr 'howed that this position has religious roots. The regularity of nature becomes the d1\\ init} a' we give 11 the status of the Creator - rndependcnt. autonomous. and controlling everythmg eb.e. This 1s the definition of the .. pagan\" relig1ou' control idea. Let me repeat -I am not saying that the discoveries of sci\u00ad ence are a\"umptlons . I rather think that tht: modcb of science are useful. theoretical con\u00ad \\trucl\\ that correspond t~ entitles or structures that actually exist in the universe. I am saying that beliel 1n the regularity of nature as independent, autonomous, and controlling everything else 1s a rellg1ou' belief. Clearly the scientific methud is not necc~sari ly contrary to religion. We should be remmded that Gulileo and his contemporaries were Christians. and that the primary. opposi\u00ad t10n to Galileo\u00b7, '>upport of the heliocentric hypothesis came the academy, not the church! E'en a cur<>ory readmg of his \"Dialogues\" will show that Aristotelian physics was the problem, not ''state-supported theistic moral judgmen ts.\" I couldn't agree more that the church \"-as out of line in u'ing political clout to st1nc ideas. But a more accurate description of the protected view i~ .. ,late-supported Ari:.totelian philosophy.\" This is akin to the stining role of the present \"state-supported naturalistic philosophy\" that I argued against in an earli\u00ad er article. Far from abandoning rationality and returning to dogma. I question the new dogma. and seek a true pluralism. Mr. Moulton states that\" 11 is basic to the central tenants of education worldwide for ~tudents to understand the difference between assumptions and that which can be proven or demonstrated.\" Though I am not a post-moderni st by far, I recognize that one of its positive effects has been the demonwation that the idea of the \"impartial investigator\" is a myth. It is clear that even the act of observation and the use of instrumentation can impact the out\u00ad come of the experiment. This is especially true in the social sciences perhaps more than biol\u00ad ogy more than physics more than mathematic s. More significantly , even mathematics has shown us th.! necessity of undefined terms and postulates to avoid circular reasoning. The sci\u00ad entific method has indeed led to great progress in our material culture, but our science will never get us comprehensive truth. For some of us, the unreasonable effective ness of mathe\u00ad matics and science points to a higher reality, an eminent and transcendent Creator. The personal qualities of love, justice, mercy, forgiveness, and respect are the foun\u00ad dation of my ethics because I believe a Personal Creator holds everything together and calls us to be faithful to an ethic of agape love and justice. This viewpoint cannot and should not be excluded from the conversation of what ethical principles will guide scientific research. Whether Christian, Jewish. or \"morally responsible agnostics and atheists,\" we must contin\u00ad ue to cooperate to adopt standards that will guide research. The caveat \"if it can be done, it will be done\" is a frightening prospect in a day when an American scientist has announced continued on pg. 10 How it looks from here by Nancy Smolke Staff Writer The rock whizzed past my head and ricocheted off the parched exterior of the barn. \"A little close for call,\" I said, laughing in mock alarm. Sharon didn't laugh, she didn't seem to notice me at all. Her blue eyes narrowed to a slit as she calculated the distance and angle between herself and the open knothole high on the leaning structure. Already, projectile number two rotated impatiently between thumb and forefinger of her good hand. She low\u00ad ered her gaze to study the rhythmic movement. I wondered if she also paused to relish the moment of grace. Sharon's coordination is a gift; an unpredictable reprieve from the intrusion of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is potentially crippling disease of the central nervous system which creates a mind-boggling array of symptoms and disabilities . When Sharon's doing well, pans of her body, not yet surrendered to the intruder, miraculously return to perform the daily twists and turns most of us take for granted. On this particular day, Sharon bent and rose seamlessly. Setting her left foot for\u00ad ward, without the tell tale spasm, she swung her arm an fired the second volley at the target on the wall. \"About two feet low and to the right,\" I reported, official like. This time she heard me. Wagging one finger in my direction, she clucked, \"I hit the broadside of a barn ... that's progress.\" Sharon's eye for progress is why I think of her as an authentic athlete. Athletes are big in our culture. We adore them. We send our children off to bed safely wrapped in their image or cuddled up to their likeness. We collective ly spend over $60 million to share in their glory; at the stadium. on the tube, in sweatshirts, posters, sneakers, ad nauseam. Who qualifies for this level of praise? What amazing contortions must be per\u00ad formed to win national admiration and envy? My hero won't make the front of a box of cere\u00ad al. The TV networks won't beg for a few words from her talented hps. She's an athlete none\u00ad the-lesi. because she says something about the game that doesn't smack of shallow enter\u00ad tainment or mindless diversions. If an athlete is one who trains in feats of physical strength and agility, then Sharon fits the bill; especially when she's at her worst. She speaks life to me. I've seen her maneuver robot like, swinging one hip and then the other, determined to propel stiffened lifeless legs. Is that not feat of strength? I've watched mesmerized as she forces gnarled shaking fingers to button her coat or pull a comb through her long, auburn hair. ls that not an act of agility'! At her worst, she may lose her sight, hearing, speech and the contents of her bladder. At her very worst, she does not walk. nor can she recall what we dis\u00ad cussed just minutes ago. But it's here, at her worst, when I see the athlete and gather the invaluable lessons they teach us. mere mortals. When her limbs curve like question marks in the effort to rise from days in bed, I gather courage to face my own insurmountable odds. When she reaches one tremulous hand forward to lightly touch the cup of tea I hold to her lips, I receive discernment to understand what constitutes true grace and beauty. And when she misses her mark, whether it be to set herself upon the toilet squarely, or place a spoonful of peas in her mouth, i know I too can fail and t'i'y again :md again and again, and in the trying team to value success, no matter how small. Sharon is not a happy cripple. She isn't in love with the disease; she's in love with life and grabs the fleeting here and now to squeeze the contents out of it. But she is\u00b7 not what I would call a serious person. Her sense of humor carries her around like two good legs. Sharon is only 27, and newly divorced . Prior to this, she was newly married. Her former husband's vow to remain \"in sickness and in health\" allowed for colds, the flu and perhaps broken bones. He did not realize how enormously unhealthy sickness can be. Neither did Sharon. \"We talk of tragedies,\" said Sharon, \"of auto accidents, severed limbs and lost lives, but it's always someone else, not me and my protected world.\" Sharon Jives with loss and prepares for it. Not only the loss of her husband's companionship, but the loss of self-esteem . ''There are times, huge clumps of them, when I'm feeling like nothing going nowhere, \" Sharon said. \"I adjust to that like a necessary evil, it's where I am.\" Like any athlete, Sharon craves and relies upon the support of others around her to fight these unseen, internal struggles. We attended an MS pep-rally where we could mingle with the \"glory gang of wounded soldiers,\" as she fondly calls the support group. It was a strange and rewarding experience. there were no pompoms. cheerleaders decked out in team colors or hysterical fans on the sidelines . No band played. Instead, 12 or more people wheeled, hobbled and stag\u00ad gered their way into a small conference room at the local hospital. They reminded me of the halt and lame coming to Jesus to be healed depicted in Bible scenes. Each found a place in the circle of chairs and open spaces and greeted one another like ol\" friends. Jack began by reading the minutes of the last meeting. Halfway through this formal procedure, a latecomer entered the room. She was an attractive young woman (MS is a young disease), in her thirties. with blond, curly hair gathered in a loose knot on the top of her head. The room grew quiet as we watched her navigat.e the course from the door to an continued on pg. 10 eacts What is your opinion of the Clinton sex scandal?

Deconstructing Eric by Eric Butler Staff Writer Happy New Year and welcome back to good ol' C.S.C. Well, over the holidays I got a chance to waste an evening while view\u00ad ing Woody Allen's latest release, \"Deconstructing Harry.\" I use the term \"waste\" rather loosely; however, I sincerely enjoyed this comedy despite my full blown denial to accept a failed auempt to have an incredible time in grandiose NYC. Here's the low down, for some reason or another, (I don't know if it relates to your area or not but) in Bergen County, N.J. one can see somewhat fairly new released lilms a1 dirt cheap ($2.50) movie theaters. I don't under\u00ad stand why this phenomenon exists but II can be mo:.t satisfying to your monetary funds that u~ually go to alcohol, cigarettes, etc. Back to my story, I had made some plans with a friend of mine for a Sunday evening \"take it slow kind of night\" mm 1c which we could barely agree upon. We both sort of wanted to see something that was intense and quite thoughtful as well. I suggested to her that we choose \"The Ice Storm,\" which I've already seen but ~ould have loved to checked it out again, and although she had mentioned something about a new Woody Allen nick, we felt at ease over the firl.t one. We found out that the movie wasn't playing anywhere in Jersey anymore '>Owe opted for a theater in NYC, since my desire for her to see that particular film was like the cliches 'Tm telling you, this is a great film. trust me, you'll love it.'' It was cold that night and on the way over the bridge, we were on pace to be at least five minutes late for the film at the Lincoln Theater down near the 60's and Broadway, somewhe re across the grand Lincoln Center, the movie was scheduled for 9\u00b730 p.m. Nonetheless, we found a parking spot a block away from the theater (of course, only on Sunday nights can you find a decent parking spot in NYC without losing your mind in the struggle) and could you imagine, we both had no iJea on how to manipulate her mother's \"The Club.\" We left that car thinking 11 could be gone by the time the movie would be over. but who would steal cars on ,uch a religious d.iy. Oh well, that's what makes life so thrilling. To our chagnn, the theater had misprinted their movie schedule in the \"Daily News\" for that weekend and in turn, Woody cting Harry'' had replaced 'The Ice Storm\" wh1d1 sort of made me up ... et but, to her it didn't matter. To make matters worse, the movie W<l!I playing an hour later too. Anyways. we headed down the street for \"a drink or two\" (something everybody ha\\ said at lea\\t once in their lifc11me) and could only find a mildly crowded T.G.I.F.

A personal post script 1s necessary lest I be misunderstood. I agree with Mr. Moulton that some popular science wnters are showing increased humility because of the uncertainties that have appeared in mathematics physics, and biology. This is a welcome developmen t and a great story in the history of science. As for my own humility, I confess that I, too, live by faith. That means I am open to all the data, including that which is not explainable from a logical positivist worldview, as I indicated in the \"Flatland\" article. My personal courage and humility is not the issue. I am pretty ordinary -no better than aver\u00ad age on some absolute scale of moral excellence. But I can say with confidence that my belief system is a positive factor in holding me to account as a moral agent. To 1he extent that I live up to the standard of my Boss, I should be more courageous, honest, righteous, and humble than I would otherwise be. I celebrate my belief !hat there is ample evidence of a personal God whose character includes mercy and grace. My feeble auempts to serve Him are meant 10 flow ou1 of a thankful heart ra1her than fear or legalism or ideology. I accepl the premise that all persons, being created in the image of God, are gifted with an ethical sense. So I cer\u00ad tainly don't deny that an agnostjc or atheist can be morally responsible. In fact I can coher\u00ad ently hold high expectations for all women and men, including all my students. My complain! is that naturalism has a reductionist tendency on the humanitie s including the fiduciary, eth\u00ad ical and esthetic aspects. Perhaps I am wrong! My challenge, that has not been answered, is this: what is your basis for moral action? And are there not principles in every cultural tradi\u00ad tion for human moral choice? And could we not reason together and come up with a covenant that would lead to a belier quality of life at Castleton? The next deadline for The Cairn will be February 27.

From the Editor's desk ... Activists wanted As the world holds its collective breath while observing the tentative peace in Iraq the threat of armed invasion still lingers menacingly on the horizon. Also fresh in the mine is the memory of 4,000 college students drowning out Secretary of State Madaline Albright' promises of a U.S. military attack at last week's \"town meeting.\" Their protest commandec national headlines that day. Ohio certainly hasn't been the only hotbed of social criticism over the past fev weeks. Right here in Vermont, over 200 UVM students staged anti war protests it Burlington. In Middlebury, students from Lyndon, Johnson, VTC, UVM, SVC and a hand ful of other schools converged at another rally. Curiously enough, there was no one to rep resent Castleton at either function. I honestly don't know why we dido 't organize. I think that certainly there are man) conservative thinking individuals on campus who supponed our governmen ts threats. On tht other hand, I think a lot of students probably didn't really care. Who I'm concerned abou1 are those that maybe had an opinion and were simply not heard. College is the time in our lives when we can make a difference. As students, we are connected to and supponed by other students all around the world. Our collected opin\u00b7 ions are extremely influential on world events (as the \"town meeting\" demonstrated), and our voice is loud enough to be heard. Assuming we do have silent activists out there, I urge you to stand up and be active. Whatever the issue, whatever your platform; get the word out. Hang a banner, organize an event, write an article for The Cairn, or simply help spread the word about regional events. It frightens me that at press time, despite the fact that our world is alarmingly close to war in the Middle East and disastrously close to environmental catastrophe (as shown in the recently released rain forest clear cutting figures); despite the fact that the United States has political prisoners locked away in jail and a government that is becoming more and more conservative every day; despite the genocide in Rwanda , the slaughter in Chiapas, the tor\u00ad ture in Kenya ; the only form of propaganda I see adorning our campus walls are Christian proverbs. It's your world you can change it. To all members of the faculty and staff who contributed to the canteen for the Blood Mobile of February 3 with food and beverage as well as time, and to those who donated blood, I say, \"thank you, thank you, thank you.\" On behalf of the Red Cross, we appreciate your support. -Pauline Young Chair of Castleton Drawing WANTED: Anyone with goalie experience for the Women's Lacrosse Team.

College radio is a vital part of the college community . Coming from a college town, I have listened to, through much of my high school years, a college radio station. Here, in Castleton, the college radio is practically non-existent. This is mainly because the single individual who gave a damn about the college station has thrown in the towel. Greg Topf, who has been the general manager since 1995 has resigned and who can blame him? Before Greg was the GM here, he had a real show on a real radio station in Middlebury. I think that says something about the man he is. Mr. Topf is the one who was respon\u00ad sible for having all of those basketball games broadcasted last season via WfUV. Can any\u00ad one remember the last time that happened at CSC before Mr. Topf? I doubt it. Most like\u00ad ly it was because it was long before many of Irresponsible reporting? What is going on with this school? l thought that a newspaper was supposed to be a unbiased as possible. A newspaper is supposed to cover the news as it happens, and a newspaper is suppose to cover both sides of the story. The controversy that has been brewing concerning Alex Pinizzotto is almost entirely one sided. It seems Like the newspaper has a personal vendetta and wants nothing more than to smear her name, as well as, oust her from Castleton . This is outra\u00ad geous!! How can such an influential form of media use its power for what seems like its own crusade? I read your last paper before the winter break and was disappointed at the approach taken by the Cairn and its staff. The story on Alex Pinizzono and the contro\u00ad versy surrounding her as president of the Student Association, angered myself, as well as, many other people. The cairn accused Alex of various acts, these acts were not clearly outlined or discussed by the paper. Alex Pinizzotto's name was dragged through the mud and not once was there a comment in the article that the paper tried to contact her for her statement It seems that the paper saw an opportunity to disgrace her and took il Where is the line that says \"We tried to Coalllct Alex, but she did noc want to speak to us!\" The Cairn? Where is her side of the story? Where is her defeme? Where IR the U\\ were here, or even thought of attending college. He personally sat in the station and made sure that everything ran properly while his air talents got to watch a game. Lets look at the commu01cat1on classes. Do they even use the radio stanon for educationaJ purposes? No. The travel to a station in Rutland. How embarrassing, when a perfectly good station goes unused nght here within walking distance. It must be a big hassle for those students who do not have cars to travel to Rutland for class. Lets take a look at where the college station is located. It is in the musty basement of Haskell Hall. Where does this compare to other colleges? The radio station al Western New England College, Springfield , MA is located in the middle of the campus center. The radio stauon at SUNY Oneonta, Oneonta, NY, is located on the top floor of the communicatio ns building, yet is very prominent to all of campus. by now all of you are wondering how I have come across people that do not agree with your views and believe that Alex was not at fault for the actions she is accused of? (They may be see\u00ad ing that the article was more about smudging her name then getting any type of story across to the readers.) Where are the follow up stories? Is it just that the damage has been done so now it can be forgotten? I would think that the Cairn would honor its responsibility to its readers by fol\u00ad lowing up and investigating all aspects of the story. It seems that this is a big story that has many sides. Jess Gully wrote her resignation letter and it was printed during this time. Where is the investigation into why she resigned and what Jess's role was in the SA. Where is aU the background that helps us to understand the main story? Did Jess and Alex get along? Were they friends? We don't know because the Cairn did not follow these avenues. I am asking why? Is it really that personal? ls the Cairn staff using the newspaper as a way to carry out personal vendettas? All these questions and right now the only answer is YES. I come up with this answer because of the articles that I have read and continue to read on this topic. It seems that any way the Cairn can add insult to injure they will. A good example is the late article on the General Manager of WIUV resigna\u00ad tion. The Cairn printed this article widl out doing some imcstiption into Gres Topf. Who is he and whll type of person is he? thi'> bu of information . I have friends who are air talents at these vanous colleges. One time we were comparing notes about our col\u00ad leges and the topic of radio stations came up. I supplied with this information. Little did I know that some day 1t would come in handy. Mr. Topf proposed to the Faculty, Staff and Admmistration of this college to move WJUV to the campus center. The proposed site was the former home of the club offices just off the mail room. You all know where that is. It is that dark empty area that no one uses. Lronically , WIUV was located in this very location until its move in 1981 to its pre\u00ad sent location. Mr. Topf has all these great ideas and no one who listens to him. lf they do lis\u00ad ten to him, they never follow up on what they say they will hoping that he wilJ disappear like a ship in the night. Not so. Mr. Topf was the kind of person who was very dedicated to the station. Many individuals supported him. Did you know that Mr. Topf was elected GM What has he done in WJUV? ln Greg's let\u00ad ter he mentions the Alex Pinizzotto contro\u00ad versy and claims that this had a great influ\u00ad ence on his decision. Why? Greg says it is because he cannot in good faith allow him\u00ad self to represent an institution which harbors confessed liars and yet also professes to pre\u00ad pare us for the rest of our lives. What is the connection to this and the rest of the story that talks about WIUV needing repairs? Why only mention the Alex controversy for one line and not explain it more? Could it be that it is another personal vendetta? Could it be that Greg Topf is upset that Alex got Governor Dean to come to the radio station and that she asked Greg to fix up the station for the visit? Could it be that Greg does not want to continue being the station manager? I see this controversy as a perfect way for Greg to get out of his responsibilities and look good. Really good. We may never know the answers to some of these questions because the Cairn fails to cover both sides of a story. Where are the stories about the Cairn and their misdo\u00ad ings or failure to cover the entire story? -Luis Daniel Turner unanimously la!.t spring? Where are thei.e supporter of his now? We ai. a college com\u00ad munity have to realize that the radio station 1s an important part of this campus. We aJso have to reaJize that all of Mr. Topf's ideas cannot be accomplished 1f he 1s the only one trying to make a difference . We should have supported Mr. Topf in his effons to make WTUV the best that it could be. It should be one of the corner stones of Castleton. Instead, ll 1s locked up in the musty basement of Haskell Hall, quiet. Now, Mr. Topf is fed up with making suggestion s, writing propos\u00ad als, and not being heard. Castleton State College has lost a valuable and dedicated asset in Mr. Topf. This listener will sadly miss him. however, I understand his reason\u00ad ing. There is only so long you can ask for help and not receive it. -A faithful listener and supporter of Greg Topf Well Danny, I'll try to address a few of your many questions right here: l. \"/J seems like the newspaper has a per\u00ad sonal vendetta and wants ncthing more than to smear her (Alex's) name as well as oust her from Castleton .\" Frankly Dan we don't care if Alex stays in Castleton or not. 2. \"Where is the line that says we tried to contact Alex but she did not want to speak to us.\" The line is actuaUy the last Line in the story (SA President implicated in election scandal, p. 3). It says \"Alex could not be reached for comment.\" 3. \"Did Jess (Gully) and Alex get along? Were they friends?\" Hmmm, lets see. In Jess's letter that we printed she says \"It is with a heavy heart that I give up a huge part of my life ... I refuse to be associated with an organizati on whose president violates the SA constitution to benefit herself. \" l don't know for sure Dan, but I would guess that no, they're not friends. Well, I hope these answers helped you out. Feel free to write that in-depth story about the Cairn's \"misdoings\" anytime, and remember Dan, there is no such thing as an unbiased media -F.d Cam 3 E-mail bombed ... again Hackers: Robin Hoods of Cyberspace John Sokolich Contributing Writer Authors note: This is the first of a two part story on compute r hackers. The first installment is a bemused look at hackers in the everyday on-line envi\u00ad ronment . The second installment will feature computer crime and its crimi\u00ad nals; it will also explore what is being done to prevent these crimes. \"Another one got caught today, it's in all the papers. 'Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal', 'Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering .. .' Damn kids. They're all alike.\" These are the opening lines of the Hacker Manifesto; The Conscious of a Hacker written by the Lloyd Blankenship after bis arrest for com\u00ad puter hacking on January 8, l 986(full manifesto on page 12). Blankenship was one of the first hackers ever arrest\u00ad ed in the United States, but by far the least annoying. I refer to him as the least annoying because he used cyberspace for crime. Today hackers are more apt to perturb you than steal from you; which is why checking my e-mail box has been so frustrating the last few months. It's not computer or network problems that get me frustrated, it's what's in my mailbox that bothers me; Bombs. Perhaps it was curiosity that made me want to know more about computer hackers, or perhaps it was just too much caffeine and too little sleep that actually made me pursue my curiosity and try to find some backers. I have been paying the price for it ever since. Changing my e-mail address and getting different screen names doesn't help. The hackers find me and mail bomb my box about once a week. They fill it with hundred s of pieces of e-mail; e-mail that has no content; e\u00ad mail that is meant to upset me. I have to admit though, I find the whole thing pretty cool. My pursuit of hackers came to me after I found myself looking for software pirating rooms on American On-line. As a beta-tester for AOL, I sometimes have to find out where peo\u00ad ple illegally trade software on their systems. This illegal trade is termed \"pirating\". Hacking on the other hand, is defined as a sort of breaking-and-enter\u00ad ing in cyberspace. Though most people 4 Cairn perceive backers as computer geeks who break the law, the term hacking in the late 20th century has broadened to include many other types of computer crimes and pranks. One of the most abundant of these crimes is also the most costly for computer software companies: the notoriou s pirating. Pirating is the illegal trading of software; taking software for free. In 1997 pirates cost software companies over $60 billion in lost revenue. The illegal software is coined \"warez,\" and one of the best places to get these \"warez\" is on American On-line in des\u00ad ignate4 \"warez rooms\". These are pri\u00ad vate chat rooms with secret names where pirates gather to give away or trade software. Spending as little as 30 minutes in one of these rooms a person can get e-mailed over $50 thousand in software by merely joining a mass mail. Mass mails are a type of sign-up sheet to get software mailed to you. My job is to close down these rooms and report the names of the people in these rooms to AOL. Unfortunately, many software pirates also dabble in hacking as well. Meet \"James\" (a.k.a. Mad Cow, Milk, AOCow and Holstein) . He is just 12 years old and has been trading ille\u00ad gal software since his parents bought him a computer when he was 10. \"The way I see it,\"he begins, \"my parents bought a computer for $2000 dollars and it is generally useless unless you buy another couple thousand dollars more in software. Who can afford that?\" And so he trades software. But pirates and hackers alike don't consid\u00ad er the illegal distribution of software as hacking. \"Hacking is breaking into computers ... trading software is taking from the rich and giving it to regular people,\" says James. But his philoso\u00ad phy has strong hacker innuendo that can be seen in the further lines of the Hacker Manifesto : \"This is our world now ... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the bawd. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons.\" So if pirating software is not considered hacking, the quest began to find out what indeed was hacking . The answer was surprising. Where James had been a kid merely looking for free goodies, Mark was an adult Continued on page 12 CSC brings learning outdoors by Ray Beaver Contributing Writer In the April 19, 1995 issue of the Cairn, an article appeared confronting President Farmer for the treatment of a tract of wetland located by the observatory. This wetland, known as a vernal pool, serves as an area in which a multitude of zoologic life, particularly amphibians, breed. Birds inhab\u00ad it this area as well as invertebrates, small mammals and deer. The CSC campus was asked by a group of concerned biology stu\u00ad dents to become cognizant of this treasure and to preserve it as a learning environment. For those who have found them\u00ad selves without parking and end up at the end of the lot by the observatory, a kiosk is locat\u00ad ed in the middle of what some might believe to be no where. There is a logical explana\u00ad tion. The kiosk. arranged by Karen Sanborn of the library Media Center, serves as an introduction, for those who venture near, to the Outdoor Classroom. What started as an attempt to save a wetland has blossomed into an outdoor learning area. Vegetation and bird life have been cataloged. Amphibians have been pho\u00ad tographed and identified, and records have been sent to Middlebury College where a book is being written about amphibians in Vermont. Markers are set in the vernal pool area to guide people to points interest, and information at the kiosk alerts us to the many wonders which exist in this four-plus -acre treasure. A recent walk, around the area found me following a fox track as it seemed to follow a rabbit track. As I stood at station number seven, I was able to view bird tracks in the snow. As I proceeded along the path surrounding the vernal pool, I wanted Spring to arrive so that I could bear the Spring Peeper's mating sounds which we all have heard and have even become the base for a story by Vermont storyteller Mac parker. No project would have succeeded as this one has without dedication and perse\u00ad verance. We at CSC have a group who have been instrumental in seeing this project through to fruition. Initiated by then senior Julie Farrell and other students, the conser\u00ad vation of the vernal pool area has been embraced by several professors and CSC staff as well as members of the town of Castleton. There have been as many as 13 members at some meetings; currently the group is chaired by professor Jeff Freeman. Their discussions range from how to best conserve the area. creating inventories of the various organisms in the pool, and how to best allow for observation of the area while conserving the integrity of the vernal pool. Assistant Physical Plant manager, Gary Parker, biology professor Anne Hampton business professor Angele Brill were asked by the group to write a grant from the Vermont Watershed Grants which is funded through the Vermont Conservation License Plates sold in the state. There were 11 finalists in the state of Vermont. The Outdoor Oassroom was one of the finalists. The group recently learned it was awarded a mini-grant of $500. the awud demonstrates the importance of this habitat and will aid in further development of the project. This endeavor has not proceeded without difficulties . Mowing too close to the pool area. cars encroaching on the habitat, and vandalism to the kiosk have all added to the difficulties in conserving the area for out\u00ad door studies. Dr. Hampton made an obser\u00ad vation that we are so lucky to have such an opportunity for study within walking dis\u00ad tance of the college. For now, the vernal pool communi\u00ad ty waits for spring's thaw to signal the begin\u00ad ning of renewed life and a chance for us to enjoy the unique area most of us have often lamented about when we have had to park there. As the sounds of the Spring Peepers echo across campus this spring, take a minute to reflect and maybe take a stroll to the kiosk to see what is happening in the Outdoor Classroom. The Cairn encourages all responses. If you have any let\u00ad ters, stories or poetry, drop your work off in our mailbox in the Student Life office. Ice fishing derbies equal big prizes by Liam Callahan Contributing Writer Ice fishing derbies have been the hot spot in recent weekends throughout Vennont. The area lakes have been populat\u00ad ed with both avid and novice fishermen . Those brave souls, who bundled up to protect themselves against the cold weather, were in search of the Junker that would win them big prizes. It paid off! ment such as tip-ups, power augers or shanties. The top prizes can even consist of $10,000, a new truck or a new fishing boat. In Brattleboro, a specially tagged brook trout was caught during the 14th Annual Harriman lee Fishing Derby which won the angler $10,000. On Lake Bomoseen , a brown trout brought out of the ice during the 25th Annual Great Benson lee Fishing Derby turned into a new Ford Ranger pickup worth $13,500 for the fisher\u00ad man. The derbies around the state have different ways of winning prizes which . include; weight categories, specially tagged fish and raffles. The prizes range anywhere from small cash awards to Photo by Kristin Walters VAHPERD conference held at CSC by Tim Matteson Stan' Writer The Vermont Association for Health, Physical Education , Recreation and Dance is holding its spring conference at the Glenbrook Gym gym on Thursday , March 12.

CSC theater celebrates Women's History Month by Alison Morse Staff Writer The Pleiades Theatre Project held two one-act plays Thursday , February 26, to celebrate Women's History Month. Lorraine Reynolds and Nichole Miller produced the plays, \"Overtones\" and \"Credo.\" The first play, \"Overtones,\" is about two women in 1913 and was written by Alice Gerstenberg. The play is set in Harriet's house, (played by Erin Ballard), a wealthy socialite. She invites Margaret (played by Amy Collemer) over for tea. Throughout their conversation, the audience gathers that these women are very unhappy with their lives. Their true personalitie s and feelings toward one another are expressed by their consciences. Lynne Wifholm plays Harriet's conscience, Hetty. Amy Bader plays Margaret's conscious, Maggie. While Harriet and Margaret converse, their con\u00ad sciences express how they truly feel about each other. By the end of the play, the audience realizes that these two women virtually lie to make the other person jealous and make their lives seem better than they really are. The second play, \"Credo,\" written by Craig Lucas, starred Heather Edwards. Lit by a spotlight, her character sits in a chair wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette. She tells the audience about the misfortunes of her life: her boyfriend breaking up with her, her dog dying and attending her first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. The man\u00ad ner in which she tells her story is dramatic, yet has a comical twist that keeps the audi\u00ad ence entertained. During her monologue, she says something that the audience can relate to: \"I will have an extraordinary and rich and com\u00ad plicated life. It is entirely up to me.\" Listen: change is on the air by David R. Nadeau General Manager WIUV WIUV is changing its image and its attitude. Teamwork and responsibility are the two new catch phrases.

Cairn 5 Some catch flies by Dave Mance Editor-in-Chief Veranda was a knock-kneed gut, tall and slender, with a nose like a pnzefighter and a smile the size of Manhattan . I say girl although she was actually around forty years old. Still, to me (I was about 9 at the time); she was my equal, and thus still a child. Her raven hair was streaked with silver and she wore it combed straight down, cutting it her\u00ad self and tying the loose ends in blue bows. Her eyes were gentle, but a bit startling if you looked into them for to long, kind of like staring into the eyes of a baby tiger; cute and adorable windows to a wild, untamed soul. Veranda was a wandering poet and for a few weeks, my best friend. She was hired by my elementary school to teach poetry during the school day. Her nights were spent in the attic guest room of my family's home. Veranda became my mentor, teaching me how to rhyme and forget reason. She also taught me the therapeutic values of poetry and prose. \"Just pour it out,\" she'd say. \"Tell me about this. Tell me about that.\" So I did. I told her about church on Sunday where I watched an old man keel over in the front row. Poor old bastard just died right on the spot. Could you imagine, dying in church. Mom said he was lucky, assuming that he had prayed for for\u00ad giveness before throwing himself on to the floor and wrench\u00ad ing violently in seizure, but that made no sense. He's squirm\u00ad ing around there foamin' at the mouth, looking anything but fortunate. I wrote a prayer in the hymn book as they carted him away. I told her about my friend Noah Mercier and his family who were sitting in the pew oext to me. We used to sit up in Noah's room and watch his dad smack his mom around through the floor vent. Him grabbing her head and squeezin it kool-aid red, her screarnin' HBO dialog -smash\u00ad ing dishes like a cartoon character, then getting hurled onto the floor like a pro-wrestler and all the while we'd be staring, four little mouse eyes in the vent watching . Now I hope I haven't Jost you. The church, the Merciers, the dead guy, they may seem like random stories, but that's why I remember Veranda. Not because she shared the moments with me, but because she taught me how to question blind faith and obedience . She taught me how to cope with adolescent questions and contradictions. She taught me how to understand life. Church would end, and I would escape unscathed, running home like a freed prisoner, ready to go worship my own gods of nature and ink. Veranda and I spent most of our spare time together in those days, taking long walks and unwinding. She was deftnitely at home in the forest, and would use those beauti\u00ad ful spring afternoons to teach me, among other things, the peculiar rejuvenatory qualities of icy May water. She had a poetic name for sitting naked up to out necks in the forest stream, envisioning where the water would take our detached heads. I simply called it damn cold water sitting ... but hey, I never forgot. To a 9 year old boy, sitting in a spring stream, becoming runoff, and flowing to the sea made a lot more sense than church or school. While in the river we talked; Veranda waxing on in her Dickinsonesque way about lost butterflie s and Taoin prophets, stuff way over my head. I liked to talk about fishennen and trout... Other days we'd go to my backyard pond and the red clover field. On the inlet stream's riverbank, beneath the willow tree, we'd listen to frogs croaking spring contentment and watch the red wing blackbirds shadow box defiantly . Veranda explained to me about the feisty bird, using her as a metaphor for life in the city, a time that she was trying to for- get. This place, where she used to live in the city, housed many personal demons for Veranda, but to a nine year old, stories about New York in the sixties were great fun. High rise monster beasts and gasoline rainbows, lost lovers and dead dogs. At the time Veranda lived on a rooftop with pigeons who she'd named after artists and prayed to when she was alone. Some stories healed, while others brought the tiger out of her eyes. I don't think her scars ever healed from these jackal people and burning hot asphalt which blistered and peeled. Other people wrote about this though, not her. \"Bee boppin\" she called it, painting with words. I would read them later in life; niggers named Ginsburg and Kerouac; but they were always too holy and grand for me. Kind of like urban priests, I think, burning their worlds from both ends with their fire and brimstone . After Verandas stories we'd eat peanut butter sand\u00ad wiches, drink lemonade, and quote Dr. Seuss. For two weeks we lived the simple life, 378 miles away from beat poetry and the city. While her poems and philosophies would live in my head forever, our time togeth\u00ad er came to an end. Quickly, before I get to the moment that changed my life, I want to tell you about the last day of school before Veranda left. It's not a very exciting story, just a moment, when in English class, we finished the book Bridge to Terebithia. I remember it because it was such a bizarre scene, 24 kids weeping genuinely innocent tears -but the teacher, Mrs. Sears, didn't find it sad at all. She told us she had read it too many times. I guess this is my metaphor for my time with Veranda . She was my friend who left and my Terebithia all rolled into one. When I told her about the story she cried a little, good tears though. The Saturday morning before Veranda took off, I crept up into the attic, a glass of tea in hand, to say goodbye. I found my friend sitting \"Indian style\" by the huge semicir\u00ad cular window, bathed in soft light. Like a picture she glowed, swaying back and forth, and I paused for a moment before letting her know I was there. Here, in my attic as a silent vis\u00ad itor, I saw Veranda's world clearly for the first time. I can see her still, a model of concentration, carefully catching the window flies between her long fingers and humming softly to them; a big black ugly one with green eyes, a little baby one with a broken wing, a lost honey bee, buzzing and homesick. I stared in amazement as she sensed my presence and requested my company with a smile. \"Alive,\" she whispered, thanking me for the tea and sitting me gently between her legs. ''Do you know they've been dead all winter long?\" That was the moment I remembered -when science, reason, the fear of God, and all of life's problems were for\u00ad gotten. That was my moment. A moment when this little boy didn't have to question. The moment when the dead came back to life when kissed by the sun. Spring Break '98 -Sell Trips, Earn Cash & Go Free!!!

Fortunately I remember little of the actual accident Impact and pain is the extent of it. Collectively I spent lO days in the hospital. I have some bad memories of that time, but finding myself alive means I must act accordingly . It is foolish to demand healing if I'm flat on my back looking for trouble. I figure flat on your back dictates a certain upward view. Amazing what happens when you follow the lead. Out of all the nurses, I cherished but one. Her name was May, a true Vennonter . She talked the whole while she was near me. She sympathized with my pain, groaned when I groaned and winced when I winced. Most importantly (and this is the crux of the matter) May touched me. I don't mean her kindness touched me, I mean May literally touched me. She stroked my head when I shuddered. She rubbed my arm when I cried. When chills set in. May hurried off wordless\u00ad ly. In my morphine haze I thought I had lost her. Not so. May returned with a blanket fresh from the oven. She tucked me in like a Jong-lost child found in the cold night air. Her lovely hands instinctively smoothed the furrows in my brow and closed my weary eyes. May was not the only hero in my misery. Every night, my friend Janice, drove straight from her work in Granville to the hospital. When I was at my worst. Janice cradled me in her arms. Each night she made it a point to touch me in some tangible way. She rubbed my back, mas\u00ad ~aged my battered legs, petted my hair. Her hands were never far from me, even if it meant to simply sit and stroke my cheek. Afterwards, I asked Janice why she dedicated her\u00ad self in such a way. \"It did you good,\" she said, \"and it did me good to see that.\" Looking up has taught me the incredible untapped power of human touch. Abraham Maslow identified five hierarchical levels of human needs. He may have a problem with the ordering. At a recent conference of the Society for Neuroscience, the largest organization of c:cientists and physicians dedicated to understanding the brain, spin!ll cord and peripheral nervous system, it was revealed that providing junior with food, shel\u00ad ter and warm just didn't cut it. Denial of adequate touch had serious biochemical consequences for the child. Caresses influence the production of certain honnones involved in \"learning, memory and the management of stress.\" How seri\u00ad ous can it get? Over a century ago most children died before the age of five, but did you know that over half of the infants under the age of one succumbed to a diseased called marasimus? The tenn is derived from a Greek word which means, ''wasting away.\" The situation was far worse in foundling institutions, even in progressive America. The death rate for infants in these \"homes' were nearly one hun\u00ad dred percent. The tread did not reverse itself until the late l 930's when someone discovered that infants who were cud\u00ad dled, stroked, rocked and pampered thrived where others in the prescribed \"managed care\" met an early grave. Whitman, in his \"Song of Myself,\" had the right idea, \"/ make holy whatever I touch or am touch 'd from.\" Psychology Today cites research showing that peo\u00ad ple who grow up with touch are more talkative, cheerful, socially dominant and nonconfonning. By contrast, the rest of us unfortunates, deprived of healthy human touch are gen continued on page 13 How do you feel about a state college such as CSC funding the Christian Fellowship, a religious club?

For Ani fans in search of Impeifectly 's acoustic poetry or Dilate's electric fury, little Plastic Castles will not satisfy your craving, as it exhibits Ani from an entirely different angle. Gone is the musi\u00ad cal notion of the lone folksinger armed only with her poetry and her guitar, and in steps electronic sampling, production wizardry and in some cases, a five-piece horn section. On this, her tenth full-length release, she is soundly backed by longtime drummer Andy Stochansky and occasionally by bassist Sara Lee and new bassist Jason Mercer. Throughout little Plastic Castles Ani proves that her music has undergone some son of evolution; she has grown as an anist and she is no longer the one-woman-acou stic show that she was years ago. However, for long\u00ad time Ani fans -fear not, because the gritti\u00ad ness, the poetry, the quirkiness and the attitude are all still there, but they have just emerged in slightly different forms. The diverse range of songs on little Plastic Castles is typical Ani. As with many of her albums, the first track (in this case the title track) is the most engaging. \"Little Plasnc Castles\" is an enduring little ditty that she's been performing on the road for the past year, and serves as an ideal way to ease the listener into the experience of this CD. \"Fuel\" is a spoken word piece that laughing\u00ad ly criticizes the entertainment industry in a manner that only a such a performer who has refused to be its slave could ever attempt (\"people used to make records as in a record of an event I the event of people playing music in a room I now everything is cross\u00ad marketing I it's about sunglasses and shoes or guns or drugs I you choose\"). \"Gravel\" and \"Pulse\" are both songs that Ani has been playing on tour for some time, but hearing them in studio form provides for an entirely new musical adventure . \"As Is\" is pure pop, but can not be classified with the radio vari\u00ad ety (thankfully). \"1\\vo Little Girls\" is a love\u00ad ly ode to a troubled gal-pal and \"Deep Dish\" 8 Calm is a swinging musical tale complete with sampling and ska-like horns. \"Loom\" and \"Pixie\" ai:e straight rock and roll. \"Swan Dive\" is an introspective glance at loving and being loved and contains such unforgettable lines as \"cuz I've built my own empire out of car tires and chicken wire I and now [' m queen of my own compost heap I and I'm getting used to the smell.\" \"Glass House\" is an eerie yet vaguely angst-filled collection of musings and \"Independence Day\" is classic Ani -just The Folksinger, her acoustic gui\u00ad tar and an assembly of regrets. Each track on little Plastic Castles possesses its own unique appeal, as they range from the pro\u00ad foundly silly (\"we know the difference between the font of twenty percent more and the font of teriyaki\") to the blatant (\"I'm gonna pull out my tampon and start splash\u00ad ing around\") to the beautifully poetic (\"and I realized that night that the hall light which seemed so bnght when you turned it on is nothing compared to the dawn which is noth\u00ad ing compared to the light which seeps from me while you're sleeping\"). Throughout little Plastic Castles there are many references to fish and fish tanks; the front cover of the CD even pictures Ani's face on the body of a goldfish and the back cover shows her looking frail and tired, curled up on the pebbles at the bottom of a fish bowl. Is she providing some sort of commentary on the media frenzy that has surrounded her in the past year? Admittedly, she is a rather unlikely and seemingly hesi\u00ad tant superstar, but judging by the music she makes on little Plastic Castles, it seems that for Ani Difranco , life in the fish bowl1s just fine. Movie Review: Half Baked by Eric Butler Staff Writer I remember when 'Roll up a fat one and pass it around' sounded like sweet music to my ears while in search for the ultimate high during adolescence many moons ago. The days when mastering the intricate an form of rolling tightly packed joints were like taking the training wheels off of my speedy Red Line bicycle in hopes to make my father proud. Although I am no longer in need of any marijuana to enhance my per\u00ad ceptions at the present moment and you can bet your money that I'll pass any urine test too, I will take only the fondest of memories regarding my relations with 'Mary Jane' to the inevitable eternal sleep. So, have you been stoned lately? Well, comedian Dave Chappelle hopes you are still preserving America's favorite pastime since the inven\u00ad tion of the hula hoop and the fading popular\u00ad ity of baseball because he has co-written a slap-schtick comedy with Saturday Night Live funny guy Jim Breuer bluntly entitled 'Half Baked.' Now do not get me wrong I laughed just about as much as anybody dur\u00ad ing the Cheech & Chong classics and the amusing Dazed and Confused, but you would have to be completely stoned out of your skull rather than 'half baked' to choose this flick over any others playing at the the\u00ad aters. The film was released on January 16th of this year, so maybe you will be lucky enough to have avoided this lame excuse for drug exploitation as well as embarrassing drug culture stereotyping of the post-Hippie era. The story revolves around four friends (Dave Chappelle as Thurgood, Jim Breuer as 'Deadhead' Brian, Guillermo Diaz as Cuban Scarface and Harland Williams as Kenny) who share a NYC East Village apartment while maintaining minimum wage jobs. Lo and behold, after a smoke session on their 'Billy Bong Thonon' hooka (which brings back visions of Haskell Hall dorm life), continued on pqe 13 From the asylum to the community The mentally disabled 's harsh road from institutions to mainstreaming within communities by Lea Verna Reed Contributing Writer A dark, damp place. Overrun with rats and other vermin. The trees, flowers and grass are on the other side of the strong iron bars of your narrow cell Your wrists and ankles are chained to the cell wall. You're sitting in a pile of your own waste, wearing filthy, tom clothes. Your meals of stale and rotten food leave you semi-starved and ill. An attendant walks by with a whip, ready to strike at the slightest outcry. It is amazing that you are even alive. The above description is not of a prison for convicted murderers awaiting exe\u00ad cution; criminals were treated much better. The above setting is an asylum for the insane. The definition of insane during the 18th and 19th centuries was expanded to include alcoholics , the mentally retarded and people suffering from a mental illness such as Schizophrenia. In many of these asylums restraint and corporal punishment were the order of the day. People were often restrained with chains, ropes, strait jackets or housed in cages or cells. Often times they were beaten with whips or clubs, tortured and raped. Asylum, a word that mean pro\u00ad tection, was the name often given to build\u00ad ings which housed the mentally ill. During this time, however, an asylum was the last place to look for health and healing. There were some people who fought for more humane treatment of the mentally ill. Dorthea Lynde Dix spend two years touring Massachusetts' almshouses, jails and asylums where the insane and dis\u00ad abled were kept. She appeared before the state legislature with her evidence in hopes of implementing a change in the way the mentally ill and physically disabled were cared for. Her solution to the problem was to have state hospitals built in which the dis\u00ad abled could be cared for. She was able to convince the Massachusetts state legislature to enlarge the Worcester State Hospital. After this first victory, she extended her trav\u00ad els to include parts of Canada and most of the states east of the Rockies, advocating for those who had no advocate. The hospitals might have provided a cleaner bed and better food, but the mentally disabled still suffered abuse and neglect. Often times the hospitals were overcrowded and understaffed . The available staff were often inexperienced and abusive. Instead of being restrained in a cell, the patient was often restrained in a bed. Deborah Reily*, a former state hos\u00ad pital caregiver, remembers the hospital where she worked. \"In 1948 the hospital wards had 40 patients to a room. The patients didn't do anything but stay on their beds all day. T\\vo staff were assigned to each room and their jobs were to change messy briefs and bedding, feed the patients and administer patient's medications .\" \"When I came to work there, the place had undergone many changes. There were only two or three patients to a room and the rooms were setup to look more homelike. Curtains were put up between the beds for more privacy, the patients were able to do arts and crafts, go outside, learn new skills and take part in group activities.\" \"Mainstreaming\" is now the latest change in care for the mentally ill. Essentially it means becoming a part of the community and that includes more personal\u00ad ized care. It is not unusual for the mentally ill to attend public schools or be employed at regular, full and part-time jobs. Some peo\u00ad ple, like Reily, believe that the best place for the mentally ill is in the community. Reily takes care of a lady with Down's Syndrome . The lady lives with Reily in h~r home and has become part of the family. Instead of living in a private home, some mentally ill people are able to live in group homes. Group homes provide a more homelike atmosphere than the state hospi\u00ad tals. Here the patients are able to work with staff and fellow patients creating a feeling of family and community. Mainstreaming is not without oppo\u00ad sition. Some people, including doctors and parents of mentally ill children believe that their family and patients were receiving bet\u00ad ter and more specialized care in an institu\u00ad tional setting. Others believe that the men\u00ad tally ill are more likely to harm someone or be harmed outside the safety of the asylum walls. We, as a society, tend to be ignorant of the needs of people with mental illness. The mentally ill are lumped together as one problem and offered one solution. These are individuals, however, with individual needs. One person might require the care that only an institution can provide, with round the clock medical care, while another might fare better in a group home. It doesn't matter whether the mentally ill are placed in a home, institution or asylum; if society wants to start treating these people more humanely , why not start by treating them like one of us?

And as of this article, he also enjoyed mail\u00ad bombing my e-mail box. Mark and his concepts of social structure are as mysterious as the subject he talks about. Knowing thnt what he says could land him in jail, he is careful and vague with his answers. Mark is the ideal hacker-he is the vision that gets conjured up in peoples minds when they think about hacking. His social skills seem weak from malpractice and his attitude is that of an anarchist. His persona alone makes him the quintessential hacker. \"My job as a hacker is to even the score between the have-nots and the upper one percent,\" Mark states. \"Myself and other hackers are not criminals, we are truth seekers.\" The line about being truth seekers has been used and over used by the world and the media lime and agatn. The latest Hollywood movie about hacking used the slogan, \"Their only crime was that of cunosuy. Ironically, the line is not a cliche'. but a definite ideal that most (if not all) hackers It ve by. \"Generally I break into com\u00ad puters to '>eek out answers,\" says Mark. \"There \u00b7~ a lot more technology and secrets out there than the government and corporate world is telling the peo-pie about.\" Amused by VISIOOS of The X\u00ad Files, I had to ask Mark what secrets he thought were out there. His answer was not what I expected ... \"I think that there are tech\u00ad nologies out there that can revolution\u00ad ize the way people work,\" he began, \"just like the internet did in the late 80's. Only now do we find out that it was really invented (the internet) in the l 960's.\" So basically, hacking is like a robin hood in cyberspace type of pro\u00ad ject I implored him. \"To some it is,\" he said. \"To others it is a dark realm of profit and crime.\" I found it hard to believe that the same people who have been mail bombing me for the last several months were capable of high security crime, albeit of the white collar kind. He agreed that it wasn't the same type of hacker who would do both: Pranks and cnme. So the ques\u00ad tion remains who the hackers really are; computer nerd pranksters or hard\u00ad ened criminals? E-mail bombing is not a crime. rt is annoying and at time childish; nothing to criminal about it. But who are the hackers tn jail? What exactly are their crimes? How exactly did they do what they did? My search contin\u00ad ues, as does my list of screen names. Conscience of a Hacker by The Mentor 12 Cairn Another one got caught today, it's all in the papers. \"Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal,\" \"Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering ... \" Damn kids. They're all alike. But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's tecbnobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?

We seek after lmowledge . and you call us crirninaJs. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias ... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you mmder, cheat and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good. yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not by what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarung you, something that you will never forgive me for, I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.

When you think it through organi\u00ad cally, our bodies are asking for a heaJing bind. Our skin is the largest sensory organ ~the body. The most sensitive areas of the lkin are our hands and face, especially the lips (hence the popularity of kissing). The lqest area of our brain surface is devoted to the llCllsation of the hands alone. I remember a particularly black time in my life. I had nothing. No home, no car, no income, nothing but a clinging ten\u00ad year old who wondered if mom was going to fold. One night I wandered into the local university to get out of the cold. The doors of the inner auditorium opened and soon the foyer where I previously stood alone was filled with warm bodies intent on discussing the play they had just experienced . The sud\u00ad den change from silence and solitary exis\u00ad tence to the growing crowd made my head spin. Then it happened . Someone, quite innocently, pressed a bit of themselves apinst my upper ann. We stayed this way, dlil sttanger and I, for nearly 20 seconds. The sensation it created startled me. I felt ltw\u00abI.

I returned home to the mid-west to care for my dying younger brother, David. He was not a great one for being touched. David was tough, period. I respected the way he faced the grisly effects of cancer. He spat blood with reserve and kept his cool when the red ooze bubbled down his chin Uld spattered into my face. We kept it together and remained apart. I kept watching for a break. When would he need more than a witness? My answer came two days before his death. Out of the blue he arose from a three-day coma and asked for food. A piece of toast, with strawberry jam and a Little peanut butter. Did we have any fresh fruit? He wanted watermelon and a bit of choco\u00ad late. Is the milk good? Pour a bowl of cere\u00ad al and chop a banana up in it. I joyfully pre\u00ad pared his meaJ, anxious to tell everyone of his sudden and remarkable recovery. David hoarsely called my name, \"Nan,\" \"Hmm?\" I said, poking my head around the comer. He mouthed the word, \"White.\" Two weeks ear\u00ad lier I bad slipped him some of my whole wheat toast and he had spit it out in disgust. He gave me a suspicious look and wagged one finger in my direction, smiling broadly. We talked, watched TV and talked some more. At ten-thirty it ended. \"I'm tired Nance,'' he said. I low\u00ad ered his bed, gave him his injection, checked the morphine pump, helped him with the uri\u00ad nal and tucked him in. As I stood near his bed putting the syringes away, David reached out and took my arm. He was nearly asleep. I stepped closer. My brother pulled me to his side and then. for the first time in over 30 years, leaned his bead against my breast. \"I'm dying Nanny,\" was all he said. We stay there, frozen in my mind, bridging the distance between us. For someone like me, who grew up spinning from the backhand and a swift kick, touch, kindly touch is a radical experience . The first dictum in medical education, \"Above all, do no harm,\" is a code that can just as easily be violated through doing noth\u00ad ing at all.

Suddenly, we are brought to the point of the film and it's probably one of the only bright spots that displays a trace of writ\u00ad ing genius. Upon Kenny's voyage back to the apartment, he stops to have a brief conversation with a police horse and offers the animal a morsel of his Funyons. The horse chows all of his food instead; keel\u00ad ing over with four stiff legs up in the air since it was diabetic. Kenny gets arrested for 'killing a cop' with a bail estimated at $100,000 dol\u00ad lars. Oh no!Thurgood decides to devise a plan to raise the money and save Kenny from the night\u00ad mares of 'doing time' with sexually frustrated inmates. Thurgood 's idea is to continually steal pound after pounds of government medical testing marijuana from a hospital where he mops their floors for a living in order to sell enough weed to meet Kenny's bail. \"We're not drug dealers, We're fund raisers!\" demands Thurgood to his cohorts. The plan seems sensible with one exception; a very powerful reigning drug deaJcr known as 'Samson' surely will not enjoy his target market being interfered with by these novice pushers. As always, I leave the rest of the movie up to you (if you even wish to see or rent this disaster) to discover what happens to poor ol' Kenny and da' boys. The one cool aspect to the film are its cameo appearances of such faces as Tommy 'Chong,' Snoop Doggy Dogg, zoning' Wright, Clarence Williams m, Raebel True , Stephen Baldwin , Bob Saget and Jerry Garcia?!? The film also does a decent job of mocking other popular movie scenes inside such films as Shawsbank Redemption , Jerry McGuire, Dead Presidents, etc. Tamara Davis directs this D-comedy that falls way short of providing a wholesome laugh even if you're as high as a kite and prone to be vul\u00ad nerable enough to laugh at recycled jokes.

Can you feel it reach out to you? My breasts ache for you to touch them. -Kimberly Anne Remsen They feel so hot, full with need. I can close my eyes and almost feel your touch graze my nipples, teasing me. I imagine you running your hand, along the inside of arm, touching my breast ever so lightly and stroking my neck Your lips exploring my lips, my ear, sending fire throughout my body. I want you to take me, stroke my warmth. Heat spreads over me. You raise my passion higher, slowly stroking my leg, my thigh. Lightly teasing me. My breath is ragged with anticipation. Hesitantly , I reach for you, through time and space. My fingertips finding your nipples, exploring the texture of you skin. My lips, feverish, move along your fingers, your arms. I kiss your lips, your needing brow. If you were here I would explore, my aching need igniting your passion. My hand, my face traveling the expanse of your chest, imprinting all upon my fingers. I must look into your eyes, hear your voice wanting me, kiss you lips. I touch your leg, your thigh, gently stroke and caress you. Your hair brushes my cheek. I take you into my mouth feel your hardness respond to my need. Your hand guides my movements . You pull me closer, our bodies rhythms match our need. Candlelight dances with us on your wall, flames reaching higher Time stands still as the sweetness of ecstasy flows through our bodies. Gently we touch; lying together as sleep delivers us into the night. -she who longs to soar with the hawk One Sad Song I can still remember the stillness in the air, the quiet weeping in the shadows near the window, the window that overlooked a gloomy, rainy night. In the middle of this room lay my sister in a hospital bed. She wheezed , she coughed, she gasped. The machine played a sad song in rhythm with her heartbeat. She looked over at me, her face pale, her bones frail, her eyes tearing. She looked right through me. Someone from the shadows took my hand and led me away from my sister lying in that hospi\u00ad tal bed, in the middle of the room. As I walked away I heard the machine play its last note of that one sad song. -Alison Morse Cairn 15 Are You Struggling Academically? Can't Seem Up with Amgnments?

Here, here, to our ancestors, crowded into America's slums, who rose up to build our country's railroads, to mine our precious metals and to lead our country's government. Here's to the peace talks and the lRA cease-fire. Not enough can be said about the ability to tum the other cheek for the greater good of a nation, despite the defiance of the radical paramilitary .

Here's to the Irish everywhere, a people of unsurpassed resilience and character. Happy St. Paddy's day all... Shame on you, Cairn! After reading the last issue of The Cairn, I began to question the integrity of the journalistic standards of the CSC paper. The content of the poem \"A Touch a Desire\" was a bit out of range for a college paper. Did you really consider the audifnce outside of CSC students? Besides our students there are many others who take notice of the paper, including families of CSC students and prospective students and families visiting the college. Personally , if I were in their shoes , I would not be impressed by such decisions. One can only hope that in the future you will be a bit more careful and realize the full extent of the paper's audience and power. Sincerely, K Burton It's a sure sign of spring!

Ii! vermont woman iriakes a diff ere nee by Tara Rodin Staff Writer You have probably seen her rushing around campus, always smiling, always busy, always involved in a million and one things at a time. Well, Tracey Butkus, a senior with a double-major of Criminal Justice and Sociology at CSC, has learned that hard work and dedication do get rewarded. Tracey has been awarded as a \"Vermont Woman Making A Difference. \" This award, which up until one year ago, was geared toward female community members only, has given Tracey much deserved recog\u00ad nition for a long list of involvements and causes that she has worked for tirelessly. A few of these involvements include bing a member of the Women's Issues Group and the vice-president of Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society, as well as organizing a Rape Prevention and Awareness panel to take place during Sexual Assault Awareness week this April. Tracey also juggles a hectic schedule of classes and a part-time job at J.C. Penney in Rutland. Tracey found out she had been nominated and awarded as a \"Vermont Woman Making a Difference\" only one day before the award ceremony took place. fo Huden's alumni room the morning of the kick-off breakfast for Women in History Month, Tracey presented her acceptance speech. She included her recognition of the Women's Issues Group and the difference it has made on campus and in the community, as well as \"Take Back The Night,\" which is also fea\u00ad tured during Sexual Assault Awareness Week. Most importantly, however, was her mention of Sara Patch, a CSC senior, and last year's first college student to be awarded \"Vermont Woman making a Difference\" and Linda Olson, Assistant Professor for the Department of Sociology and Faculty advi\u00ad sor of the Women's Issues Group. Tracey's friendships with both women have helped open her eyes to many awareness issues that she now works so hard for. \"Sara is my men\u00ad tor and I feel honored to be awarded for the same thing as her,\" Tracey said. Professor Olson, who was one of the people who nom\u00ad inated Tracey for the award was thrilled to see her honored. \"She's been very active on campus, especially in Women's Issues, and Tracey is very dedicated to social change,\" Olson said. Currently, all three women are con\u00ad ducting a survey of female students at CSC on the topic of women's issues that include: safety, political, personal and national con\u00ad cerns. With the results from this survey they plan to report to the Governor's Commission on women's issues and hope to go to a con\u00ad ference to report their findings. Tracey's future goals include a pos-sible law degree and future involvement for women's causes. \"My goal is to be an advo\u00ad cate for women victims of crime, especially rape, domestic and physical violence,\" Tracey said. With the winning of this award, Tracey bas found herself even more motivat\u00ad ed and dedicated to making a difference. \"All the things I've done for women's issues have made a difference and now I'm even more motivated to raise awareness, \" Tracey said. It appears that Tracey will not rest until that difference has become a reality for women everywhere. CSC student Spring Break Warning saves a life by Kelly Ann Burton Contributing Writer John Nuceder is a seemingly aver\u00ad age student enrolled at CSC. As a physical education major, he attends daily classes and works part time. However, just weeks ago near Lake Bomoseen, John proved himself to be anything but average. It was the first day of the semester in January and John was working on his pickup when he heard the crash. When he saw a car flipped upside-down and sliding across the road, he bolted into action. After directing his roommate to call emergency services, John ran to the scene. He found the driver of the automobile lying across the front seat. Using \"instinct as his guide,\" he checked for\u00b7 breathing and a pulse, both of which were very faint; the victim was in need of immediate medical care. With the help of another bystander, John removed the driver from the demol\u00ad ished car and proceeded with rescue breath\u00ad ing. The victim was in grave danger, and a wrong move could have meant death. Thanks to John's ability to respond in a high-pressure situation, the accident vic\u00ad tim survived, escaping with only minor cuts and bruises. Without John's know-how, the situation could easily have taken a grave tum. Luckily, as a physical education major, John had to meet certain requirement s, including becoming certified in CPR/first aid response. In one of his classes, he gained experience through the local emergency response team. When asked if he feels like a hero for saving a life, John remains modest. He claims that he bas no need for heroic status, he is simply happy that he was able to help someone in need. The Cairn encourages all responses. Submissions can be placed in our mailbox in the SA office. Planning a spring break trip? A sunny beach? A foreig\u00b5 country? Skiing? If you're using a tour package, you might think everything's taken care of. How sure are you? Before you show up at the airport with your boogie board, passport or skis, review the tour package and investigate the operator. Lots of students don't get the trip they expect; others lose out completely. They didn't take the time to evaluate the pro\u00ad motion and make sure it's not run by a fly\u00ad by-night company peddling a first-class scam. Flights for many spring break trips are by public charter, which have different rules than commercial flights. Before you dot the \"i\"s and cross the \"t''s on your con\u00ad tract, do some homework and take a good look at the package. The Federal Trade Commission and the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) offer the following tips and information to help you avoid a spring break bust. Check out the operator. Avoid high-pressure sales pitches for a spring break package. Ask the operator to send you infor\u00ad mation about the business and the names of satisfied customers. Ask friends who have used the operator about their experience. Check with local travel agents to see if they know if the operator is legitimate, or call ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department at (703) 739-8739. If the trip involves a charter flight, call the Department of Transportation Public Charter Licensing Division [(202) 366-2396) to make sure that the charter operator has properly filed to operate charter flights from your depart\u00b5re city to your destination. Charter packages cannot be sold until the charter filing is approved by the DOT. Read the fine print. Get a copy of the operator/participant contract. This will tell you the conditions under which the oper\u00ad ator can change flight schedules (charters can be canceled for any reason by the opera\u00ad tor up until IO days before the trip) and hotel accommodations (operators might put you up in an alternate hotel listed in the operator contract that is not as nice as the hotel adver\u00ad tised in the package materials), and the rules and penalties for cancellation. Ask about cancellation insurance. Rules state that an operator cannot ask for or accept your pay\u00ad ment until you have signed and returned the contract. Understand your rights. You have a right to cancel a charter package without penalty (under DOT rules) if a \"major change\" is made by the operator. Major changes include a change of departure, return date or city, a hotel substitution to a property not named in the charter operator/participant contract or a package continued on page 13 Cairn 3 The Bobby Sands Story Dave Mance Editor-in-Chief While we all get dronk today on green beer and pretend to be Irish, it is imperative that we pray for peace in Northern Ireland and remember those who have fallen. Since 1969, over 3,000 people have died in Northern Ireland's struggle for independence. One of the most horrifying stories to come out of the war has been the ordeal of the ten hunger strikers of 1981. Bobby Sands was the first to die, what fol\u00ad lows is his story: The year is 1954. Beneath the North Star's light in an Irish sky, a child is born to John and Rosalleen Sands. In the couple's brick Belfast home, mother and child rest as Irish men and women have on Irish soil since time began. Forgotten for the moment is the 800 year British occupation of Northern Ireland. Forgotten\u00b7is the Irish peo\u00ad ple's struggle for freedom. Here, beneath the crucifixion and the tri-color, a wee Bobby Sands sleeps peacefully in his mother's arms. The year is 1960 and Bobby has become your typical towheaded six year old. His days are spent minding his two younger sisters, Marcella and Bemadetta , and playing childish games with his brother John. Bobby has developed a great love for nature, in par\u00ad ticular the meadow larks which nest outside of his window. His grandfather spoke often of this little bird, in particular, he is especial\u00ad ly fond of a certain story about a caged bird refusing to sing. Bobby would write about this years later, and use the lark as a symbol of his people's oppression. Religious bias and political lines are formed early in Northern Ireland, and it is in school where Bobby first feels the sting of anti-Catholic sentiment that plagues his country. As a seven year old boy he is regu\u00ad larly beat up on the playground and repeat\u00ad edly subject to denominational slurs. Being the only Catholic in a Protestant/Loyalist class, he never learns about Great Britain's historical colonizatio n efforts. He is never told that his lrish ancestors were driven into the bogs or lcilled by British invaders who confiscated their lands. He does not hear about the Easter rebellion in 1916 and the successional Irish revolution which liberated the southern half of Ireland from British rule. He only knows that as an Irish Catholic, his place is in the back of the class where he won't be seen or heard. Clutching his bruised little body, he spends his school days watching the windows and longing for the freedom of the meadow larks. Bobby remembers his mother spealcing of the troubles: \"Although I never really under\u00ad stood what internment was or who the 'spe\u00ad cials' were, I grew to regard them as a sym\u00ad bol of evil.\" 4 Cairn The year is 1969 and Bobby is 15. Ttred of school, he drops out to work in a coach building factory. As a Catholic, he makes significan tly less than his Protestant co-workers but really has no choice. Northern Ireland has become a third-world nation where it is estimated that 57% of all households are living below the poverty line. Despite the bleak surrounding s, Bobby remembers that life at this time wasn't that bad. \"Starting work, although frightening at first, became all right, especially with the reward at the end of the week. Dances and clothes, girls and a few shillings to spend opened up a whole new world to me.\" Unfortunately, things wouldn't stay this way. After serving two years at the fac\u00ad tory, Bobby is intimidated out of his job. His sister Bernadene recalls: \"Bobby went to work one morning and these fellows were standing there cleaning guns. One fellow said to him 'Do you see this here, well if you don't go you'll get this.\" One day on his way home from work, Bobby is cornered by the same Protestant gang. They attack him with their fists and knives, leaving him lying on the Belfast street, his ears ringing and bleeding. After spending time in the hospital to recov\u00ad er, Bobby returns home to find that his fami\u00ad ly's home has been \"sold\" to a Protestant family despite the fact that the house wasn't for sale. The Sands family picks up and moves to one of the poorer Catholic housing projects in west Belfast. While his parents look for food and work, Bobby joins the IRA. The year is 1972 and Britain has imposed direct control of Northern Ireland from Westminister. This action brings a nationalist resurgence to the Catholic com\u00ad munities, who are then singled out and attacked by the British. On January 30, British soldiers slaughter 13 unarmed Catholics in what will later be referred to as \"Bloody Sunday.\" As the IRA begins to fight back, the policy of internment is introduced which makes imprisonment without a trial legal. Bobby is arrested on a weapons possession charge and taken to an RUC inter\u00ad rogation center. For five days he is held in a basement storage room where British police\u00ad men play Russian roulette and implement other forms of psychological torture. His family is threatened, his kidneys are relent\u00ad lessly punched and kicked and his testicles are squeezed in a vice. Cattle prods and other instruments are forced into his anus. Despite the torture, Bobby refuses to crack and is sentenced to five years in Long Kesh. Long Kesh, also known as 'The Maze,\" is a prison just outside of Belfast where many Irish political prisoners are kept. Because of their political status, the prison\u00ad ers are granted five basic rights which set them apart from \"common criminals:\" I. the right to wear their own clothes 2. the right to abstain from prison work 3. the right to associate freely within their own prison confine 4. the right to use educational and recreational areas 5. the right to full remission on their sentence for good behavior Bobby spends three-and-a-half years in Long Kesh where he studies Irish politics and history. The year is 1976 and upon release from prison, Bobby marries his childhood sweetheart Geraldine. They have a child who hears the same caged bird story that Bobby's grandfather told at night before bed\u00ad time. The family is prominent in the com\u00ad munity, as Bobby organ ize~ a social club to raise awareness of Irish culture and circu\u00ad lates a Catholic newsletter. Bernadette remember s how \"it got to the stage where people were coming to the door looking for Bobby to put ramps on the roads in case cars were going too fast and would knock their children down.\" Later that year, Bobby and five other IRA men are picked up by loyalist security forces. Earlier that day, an IRA caused explosion had ripped through a downtown Belfast commercial building. Although the men all have alibis for the bombing, the police find a revolver in the car and charge all six men with possession of the weapon. Bobby is led, blindfolded, to a secret courtroom under Long Kesh where a lone judge, without a jury, convicts him to 14 years. Bobby immediately realizes that this stay in prison will be much different than his last. Long Kesh has been rebuilt, and now consists of 12 buildings that when viewed from the air look like the letter H. Hence the prisoners refer to them as H\u00ad blocks. Inside the H-blocks, Irish prisoners are no longer granted political prisoner sta\u00ad tus, as their five rights have been taken away by Britain's newly implemented policy of criminalization. In reaction to this, Bobby and the other inmates refuse to wear prison clothes, opting instead for blankets. Conditions in the prison get pro\u00ad gressively worse. The blanket men are not allowed to wash, shave, exercise or leave their cells unless they conform to wearing a uniform. Since there are no toilets in the cells, they are forced to dump their waste out of the windows or push it under the doors. When the windows are riveted shut and the matter pushed back .under the cell doors, the prisoners smear their excreatment on the walls in protest. Soon, all Irish inmates refuse to wash or shower in reaction to the blanket men's treatment. They are joined in their no-wash protest by the women in Armagh Jail in February 1980. Bobby becomes the public rela\u00ad tions officer for the blartket men and is con\u00ad stantly at odds with prison authorities. His beatings continue, as do long periods in the punishment cells and starvation diets. On Dec. 19 he is granted negotiation rights with the prison governor, Stanley Hilditch. Although it seems like a positive step, Bobby's step-by-step de-escalation propos\u00ad al is rebuffed. That night, Bobby writes: \"We have discovered today that our good will and flexibility was in vain.\" Putting the pen and paper down, he withdraws into the comer of his cell, a man with no options left. Here, amidst the foul stench of the no-wash protest and the cries of the tortured, Bobby realizes that someone will have to die to achieve political status. At dawn, he volun\u00ad teers to lead a hunger strike. The hunger strike is the most basic and horrifying form of protest. Following the lead of Brendan Hughes who had fasted until his demands were met months earlier, Bobby refuses food as his last available voice. Hughes' hunger strike had resulted in empty British promises which were never fulfilled and Bobby vows not to let the same thing happen again. This strike will last until death. It is Sunday, May 5, 1981 and the hunger strike begins. Others are eager to join, but Bobby insists on starting two weeks in front of them in hopes that his death could save the others' lives It is today that Bobby begins a diary with the words \"I am standing continued on page 10 t.

With every tap of the mouse on the delete button my e-mail box starts to look nonnal again'. Four hundred forty pieces of mail to go. In a small Washington town with the same amount of people as I have e-mail, three hackers start their night as well. They aren't into mail-bombing ; their crime is of money, power and curiosity. Cyberspace to them isn't of chatrooms and webpages, it is of profit and exploitation. As I erase, they consume. lnfonnation about the most intimate parts of our lives is what these three hackers are after. Credit card numbers, social security num\u00ad bers and PIN numbers are their prey. As eas\u00ad ily as I delete bothersome mail, they are into security computers around the United States. Three hundred pieces of mail to go. By now these hackers are into some bank computers: They read through millions of lines of digital codes trying to find the most vulnerable parts of the bank's security system to hack into. If successful on their first run of the night, these hackers can obtain more information about an individual than the FBI. By getting one credit card number these three hackers can manipulate the system well enough to each get thou\u00ad sands of dollars of your money and even know about where you shop on the week\u00ad ends. Their next victim is a computer for a collection agency in the midwest. Though these three hackers are in different houses, they work together, systematically attacking the computer system trying crash it without being caught. by C. Greene Contributing Writer Walking up to the door of the gym I could hear the bouncing of more than one ball. It was still too early-too early for me on a Sunday morning, 8:50 to be exact. The glass doors that held back the frigid air were already steamed silver and the interior of the gym was hazy; ghosts dribbled and shot in\u00ad between muffled conversation. When I walked into the gym I was Their self-made programs do most of\"the breaking-and-entering work for them.

I was assaulted by high-school memories still not reconciled ; blown shots, losing seasons, an abortive try at college ball and a \"career\" less successful than in my dreams. I began to remember all the things I didn't like about basketball-the pressure, imagined and real, the hoarse bark of the coaches, the tiny gyms like this one that thundered with opposing fans. I would fail numerous times when it counted and my frustration made worse by excelling during pick-up games with friends. r began to ask myself why I couldn't perfonn under pressure, and then I began to ask myself why I played the game at all. It was amazing that I took it all so seriously even now, when I had given up my designs on stardom, but it was hard to forget. I would continue playing, though with less frequency and fervor than I did when I thought I was something. I would shoot around half-assed sometimes, feel flashes of my love for the game, but always cloud it with competition after a while. It got to the point where I would hate even watching the game being played. This from a person that once cov\u00ad ered his walls with cut-outs from magazines , played with a lucky card in his shoe, and practiced for hours like I was going to be the next \"Pearl.\" Now I wasn't even keeping tabs on my favorite teams. One hundred pieces of mail to go. Their programs are successful and they start looking around the computer sys\u00ad tem for sensitive data and possible credit card numbers to steal. Once into these com\u00ad puters they can run the system programs as if they worked in the office and ran the com\u00ad puters everyday. Every person ever in the computer system at this collection agency is fair game to these hackers. On any given night they can gain access to more credit card numbers than I have e-mail. Ten minutes pass and the hackers get ready to leave. Between the three of them they have changed the credit histories of countless people and taken over 300 valid credit card numbers. Like any good thief, they double check the computer system before leaving to make sure they didn't leave anything behind. They ar.e so good at what they do that nobody will probably ever know that they were ever there. In a total of 20 minutes of work, these three hackers have made more money than I will make in a year. And in that 20 minutes, I still have 35 pieces of mail yet to delete. I keep on deleting my mail for the night. I know that tomorrow I will go through the same process of systematically deleting each piece of mail from a hacker I once crossed. As I continue, I wonder how many times my name has been seen by any hacker. I wonder sometimes if my credit report has been changed by these people or if my credit card number has been taken as well. Ten pieces of mail to go. It scare\u00b7s me sometimes to think that so much information can be obtained by peo\u00ad ple who just happen to know a little some\u00ad thing about computers. Why was I up then, out of a per\u00ad fectly warm and inviting bed, and into this steamy, archaic gym? To lose some pounds? To start my comeback? To convince myself I didn't love the game anymore? I didn't know. But I know now, and this is the story of how and where I came 10 know. Five pieces of mail to go.

If playing in the game, one could probably detennine what color and flavor gum the loudest of those fans was chewing without too much trouble.

Layers upon layers of wood\u00ad stain and wax have made some court lines indistinguishable from the long, slim boards, and ~ is finely layered in the comers; out of reach of the quick sweep of an equally dusty broom. Six hoops ring the floor, hang\u00ad ing at various angles. Two on either end for the game, and the others for practice when the bleachers are pulled in along the wall. They are all soft, making for some friendly rolls here and there. The rules are simple: two games on, win or lose, and teams are made up with foul shots. If you are a horrible shot from the line, then you sit until next time. After sit\u00ad ting for two games, you get on. Every play\u00ad er is responsible for calling his own fouls. If you are fouled and happen to be the quiet type, you may be out of luck; not everyone is quick to admit an infraction if there isn't sufficient skin-on-skin noise. I was told of this infonnal league by Bill, a friend and co-worker who began going in order to get into shape. He had played in college and described it as a \"pret\u00ad ty friendly group\" with a decent level of play, which surprised me because all of my expe\u00ad riences with \"men's leagues\" had been any\u00ad thing but friendly or at a decent level of play. As a younger person J had made infrequent forays into the men's league of my home\u00ad town, and was repeatedly sent home with my tail between my legs. These men did not take kindly to my youth or my Michael Jordan fantasies. The play in such leagues was and usually is on the physical side, but when I could come I felt the play go up a few notches. Hit a few in a row, and the play would become decidedly more physical. Cro-Magnon-type physical. As a result of these experiences I met Bill's appraisal with some skepticism, but in a last-ditch attempt to hold back my waist-line and find the game I once loved, I decided to go. Fortunately for this bank, the hack\u00ad ers run into a dead end. The security mea\u00ad sures that this bank has, called firewalls, automatically start tracing the call back to the hackers. They must sign off before they are found out. They do so, and start again. It also scares me that these three hackers aren't even teenagers yet. Proctor High School is a small, old school with a small, old gym. Both inspire intimacy with their size and feel in anyone who has attended or spent time in a school in a small town. Every Sunday a group of men, some young and some not so young, gather in this gym and play for two musty hours, full court. five-on-five basketball. They are a friendly group of men who socialize and play together with high energy and a love for the game of basketball. Upon entering the gym for the first time I was met with more than one curious gaze. I am used to a second look now and then. I am a man of color in a fairly homo\u00ad geneous population, and have been since my move to New England fifteen years ago. Beyond that first look though, I only got a few hellos and was pleasantly surprised; it seemed the only distinguishable thing about me was my presence-I was new and that was all. Comfoned, I slowly got ready to play. 1\\vo hundred ten pieces of mail for me to still delete. The hackers sign on again. They take preventive measures this time to avoid being traced. Because most line tracing is done with electricity surges run through the phone lines, the hackers plug in a hair dryer to consume the potential enetgy surge that could lead to their demise. The gym is at least three decades old, decorated sparsely with fading banners, yellow where once white, and garish adver\u00ad tisements for local establishments. The bleachers, when fully extended from the walls would place raucous fans alongside the As I walked to the foul line to shoot for teams, I could feel eyes once again wander my way.

When I saw the continued on pagelO Calm 7 Madness by Nancy Smolke Staff Writer \"And without something to believe in?\" I asked, \"Without hope?\" ''We go mad,\" she answered, \"and fulfill another life work.\" Have you ever met the evangelist who, after hearing of your near brush with death, asks the million dollar question? \"If you were to die right now, where would you be?\" One Bible-thumping Baptist I met at a county fair said death for him was when he gave his life to Jesus and was born again. He even gave me an exact date, time and place; September 3, 1978, 2:31 p.m. in the back of a red Chevrolet pickup truck heading down to lake Bomoseen. Kind of like inher\u00ad iting a new personal ID: 09-03-78-2-31. Don't misunderstand me, I believe in being born again. I'm just not so sure that the experience is blissfully universal or instantly realized. To be born again requires a death. Whose? The participants.' Was my exuberant county fair friend dead? \"Yes,\" he said, \"I am dead to trespasses and sins and alive unto Christ!\" So we die, but not really, not as long as something comes im to take up where we left off. Mickey taught me how it works. He clung to the rear wall of his bunk-bed, terrified. The old man was on the war path again. Fortunately some of the older ones anticipated the evenings events and hid the shells to the rifles and the keys to the gun cabinet in the dryer. In his drunken rage, the old man tore it apart wilth his bare hands and finding no ammunition, could be heard from upstairs clattering through the many carving knives he kept in the drawer by the sink. For Mickey, death came when the knife appears a few inches from his face. Death came when the blade swung out wild\u00ad ly in his direction and he begged, \"Please, Daddy, please don't kill me!\" Death came when the near-miss second slice ripped through charged air and left my brother unharmed , yet as dead. \"That's when I bought the farm,\" Mickey told me years later. He was born\u00ad again, at first to sheer madness: drinking and drugging, breaking store-front windows, shaving his head and dropping acid, demol\u00ad ishing his farm house with an array of firearms, etc. Then slowly, subtly he emerged making sense, speaking with clari\u00ad ty, compassion , courage, still fringed with madness but telling the truth about human nature, about children who continue to cringe in the dark, about another kind of enlightenment. One of my favorite 19th century poets wrote: ed: \"Keep out of the Past. It is haunt- He who in its avenues gropes, Shall find there the ghost of a joy 8 Cairn prized cbe most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopes.\" Newsweek (9/29/97), ran a cover story on Ted Turner and his billion dollar gift. The article says Turner views himself as a man dangling above the chasm, always at risk. The cause? His \"tyrannical father who beat him severely before committing suicide when Ted was 24 (can you read between the lines?).\" After a reckless life, attempting sui\u00ad cide and other i.nlponderables, Turner found relief through treatment for manic depres\u00ad sion. Now he gives a billion dollars to aid children in need. Most people live several feet off the ground.

His response was to break out with praise, 'The wisdom of the Lord is infinite! So are His glory and His power. Ye Heavens, sing His praises.\" 1\\vo hundred years later, Pierre-Simon LaPiace, mathematician and physicist, speaking of God, was able to say for the first time, \"I have no need of that hypothesis.\" Early in this century positivists decreed that God talk was nonsense, and forty years ago even the theologians finally got on the band\u00ad wagon and decreed that God was dead. At that same time my high school science teacher was informing me that Stanley Miller had produced the \"building blocks of life,\" and that the synthesis of life in the lab\u00ad oratory would soon follow, disposing of the need for the Creator. Today God is so mar\u00ad ginalized in higher education that many Cairn readers will not look beyond the first word of the title of this article. 0 God, how far You have fallen in our estimation! You have been lowered from a transcendent, glorious, living Being to a disposable abstraction whose time has passed. And what has replaced Your glory? The new gods are not alive, but are theoreti\u00ad cal constructs -inventions of our minds that describe wondrous real structures -but they rule! These new divinities seem inde\u00ad pendent of all else and all else depends on them. These gods are mathematical princi\u00ad ples, constants of physics, laws of nature, and natural selection. Time plus chance plus the impersonal has yielded the personal. Our new gods have given us great control of nature and material wealth, but we have paid a toll on our humanity. We are biochemical machines who celebrate our freedom from God's authority at the price of meaning. What is this emptiness, this loss of meaning, this joyless search for satisfaction ? No more can we sense the trees clapping their hands, no more are the heavens declaring the glory of God, no longer is Love the center of the universe, no longer is it possible to find truth, no longer do we believe that our choices have significance. How great is the defama\u00ad tion of God, and how far-reaching the conse\u00ad quences. But now at the end of the twentieth century the false attribution of God's cre\u00ad ation to lesser gods is being reversed, ironi\u00ad cally by these gods themselves. Like the pagan gods of old tipping face down before Yahweh, so the gods of modernity are reveal\u00ad ing their limitations. Being within the uni\u00ad verse themselves, they can't account for its existence. One of these gods is mathematics. By its own methods, mathematics has declared itself to be incomplete. Its fame has declined from being the source o~ all truth to being an effective but limited servant. Likewise physics has reached a limit with the discovery of the in_determinism in quantum mechanics. In its servant role, mathematics together with its sister science is telling us that the universe had a beginning, perhaps fifteen billion years ago, and that the uni\u00ad verse is expanding. This idea of an expand\u00ad ing universe was unpopular precisely because it seemed to reopen the door to God. Of course, the \"big bang\" theory doesn't prove the existence of a creator. But it does require us to rethink our dismissal of God. The parameters of nature are finely tuned to allow the universe to unfold in this remark\u00ad able way, and we are allowed to observe this fantastic development through modem astro\u00ad nomical tools. No longer does the universe look like a random aggregation of pebbles tossed into space. An appearance of design is emerging. But the latest wonder is found in miniature scales. The big story in the new discovery of design is in biology, where the god of natural selection is bowing to the dis\u00ad covery of amazing complexity at the molec\u00ad ular level. Against Darwinism it has long been argued that the fossil record has dis\u00ad continuities contrary to his predictions. My own first great doubts about the deification of natural selection came from the mathe\u00ad matics of information theory. Randomness destroys codes, and life is clearly based on self replicating codes. How could these codes be built up by randomness? But I sup\u00ad pose that these arguments can be turned aside by blind belief that there is no other alternative. It is after all, only an argument that life is unlikely and many unlikely things happen. But now information has appeared that may do to Darwin's hypothesis what Galileo's Dialogue did to the Aristotelian physics of his day. New evidence for design is coming from within biology itself, as modern biochemistry unlocks amazing com\u00ad plexity at the molecular level. A recent book by Michael J. Behe, Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution, The Free Press, New York, 1996, points out that the evidence of complexity at the cellu\u00ad lar level cannot all be explained by Neo\u00ad Darwinian gradualism, or newer models such as complexity theory or Lynn Margulis' view of progress by cooperation and symbio\u00ad sis. Bebe cites examples of \"irreducible com\u00ad plexity\" including the structure of cilium and blood clotting mechanisms to demonstrate with convincing logic that these mechanisms are clearly a product of design by some supe\u00ad rior intelligence. Behe points out that his conclusions do not force faith in God, though they are compatible with such faith.

I came to CSC nearly 10 years after graduating from high school. When I first got to CSC, I was in culture shock and creat\u00ad ed most of my own problems. However, it would have been nice to know that someone was here to be a friend who I could talk to about my problems . Maybe you have expe\u00ad rienced some problems that you don't know how to deal with too? --------- -------.that gives human life its deepest meanings. The There was a time in my life when I would have told you that the idea of going to college was out of the question. Back then, I had a good paying job and a nice apart\u00ad ment. I had nothing to be worried about, or so I thought, until my life took a strange twist. The company which I worked for went bankrupt and had to dissolve anything of equitable value in order to repay their loans. Consequentially, I found myself out of a good paying job and a nice apartment while worrying about what direction my life was headed towards in the future. Recently, a few of us students won\u00ad dered about the activity fee which the college charges on our tuition bill. We found that the fee supports the athletic department and the clubs and organizations that the college sponsors. Unfortunately , there was no group on campus for the 800 CSC students who are considered \"non-traditional.\" I I f I B I \" I Now Open Behind Bomoseen Post Office Castleton Comers -10% We Deliver (802) 468-3400 Center of the universe is love, and its Creator is worthy of highest praise and fame.

Randomness destroys codes, and life is clearly based on self replicating codes. How could these codes be built up by randomness?\" My search for a new job in the workplace did not go well. Employers seemed to be looking for people with cre\u00ad dentials, you know, someone with a ton of experience and more importantly, a college education. My only experience was in the restaurant business, and as far as college experience went, I didn't have any. I could have agreed to work at an insurance compa\u00ad ny, but that kind of job didn't get me very excited. Unless I did something to improve myself, I was going to be stuck earning $5.25 for the rest of my life at a local conve\u00ad nience store. If you want to own a house, a new car and have a family, $5.25 is not going to make these goals easy to obtain. I thought long and hard about what I should do and came to the conclusion that in order to make myself more marketable in the workplace, I was going to need a better education. I applied to CSC and was gra\u00ad ciously accepted. We all go to college for different To remedy this, we have started an on-campus organization called \"The Connections Group\" which was formally known as \"The Cabaret Committee.\" The organization meets every Thursday at 12:30 p.m. in the Campus Center's Music Room, located on the second floor.

I don't know the priest who said mass. The orderlies were giving out food tlJ all who were returning from mass. They tried to give me a plate of food. It was put in front of my face but I continued on my way through as though nobody was there. I saw one of my doctors this morn\u00ad ing, an ill-mannered sort. It tries me. My weight was 57. 70 kgs. I had no complaints. An official was in with me and gave me some lip. He said \"I see you're reading a short book.

People say a Lot about the body, but don't trust it. I consider that there is a kind of fight indeed. Firstly the body doesn't accept the Lack of food, and it suffers from the temptation of food, and from the other aspects that gnaw at it perpetually. The body fights back sure enough, but at the end of the day everything returns to the pri\u00ad mary consideration, that is, the mind. The mind is most important. But then where does this proper mentality stem from? Perhaps from one's desire for freedom. If they aren't able to destroy the desire for freedom, they won't break you. They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart. The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show.

I toed the line with all eyes on my feet; I missed. Badly. Smiling weakly to myself, I made my way back to the bleach\u00ad ers and watched the first games, fighting my natural instinct to leave when things start poorly. I was rewarded for my persis- tence. The games were wonderful. Basketball is a game of deception at its basic levels. Back-door cut, sneaky inside passes, and fakes were all employed with aplomb. The game rewards wisdom, bus\u00ad tle, and ~marts ~ver physical lalents when played weU, and the pick and roll, the ster\u00ad ling example of smart play, was used more than any other device to score. The players were made up of all types: the scorer, sum\u00ad moning the cool, sweet, stroke of his high\u00ad school or college years from the outside, the all-around player, who passes and steals along with his shot and the grunts, and the inside guys that pick up the missed shots, the \"garbage\" of the game for their scoring. Nearly everyone playing drifted in and out of the various roles, playing, passing and shooting with something close to joy. Everyone was congratulated on nice plays and most jumped to take blame for the bad ones. Even on defense, some would con\u00ad gratulate their opponent as the ball slipped through the net with that sweetest of sound. Of course, some things were not so idyllic; the \"black hole\" type of player exists on every basketball court-the ball goes in to them but never comes back-and there were the occasional disputed fouls, but for around my neck so many years ago, began to slowly dissolve into enthusiasm for play with these strangers. I decided to stay. By the next few games, I W learned some names and even began inter~ acting with my teammates. When on the bench I would revel in my rediscoveRd respect for the game, cheering even, wbeo a nice pass was made or a play was smooch\u00ad ly completed. The guys that played were easy to root for; Wayne, the man with the keys to the gym and easily the most com\u00ad plete player on the court, made me wonder what he was like when he first came to play at Proctor. He has over 25 years of ex ence on this court alone and it shows in smooth ways. He often outplays his nent, whatever the age or -skill level, b ing in with his teammates, providing they need when they need it. He isn't tfe. only one that inspires with his play. Nearly everyone has at least one pretty pass or m throughout the morning. Jim, \"Jimmy\" to some, all 63 years of him, plays in evay game he can get into, splitting his time widl another league in Barstow. Born in Ludlow, Jim has played since he was in his teens, spending his last three years al Proctor, mostly because he thinks \"they all a great bunch of guys.\" He jokes, \"If) stop moving, rigor-mortis might set in,\" but watching him play you would never believe that, much less his numerical age. He moves better and more smoothly than SC9 men half or a third of his years, incluq myself. ---------------------------------. the most part, it was easy going and com\u00adSince that first time there, I have returned for more Sunday Gospel.

By the end of the first game I had 20% off all Clothing and Boards (Including Burton) 10 Calm made up my mind to leave after my two and never pick up a ball again. At the start of the second and what I believed to be my last game, my feeling of dread was slowly replaced by another: surprise. Not only was I being passed to, I was urged to shoot the ball. No one froze me out of play and, heartened, I played along. Of course, the rust of months caused the ball to slip through my fingers easily, and I missed more than I hit, but the pressures of performance that I had placed the game and erodes the pressures don't count. They have indirectly tau me that the important thing is to enjoy playing, whatever it's for and whoever it's with. The game takes care of itself if you relax and play it for its beauty. No matter where I go or who I play with from now on, I will remember those things, and simply enjoy, like dial assembly of players in the musty Proctor gym, my love for the game of basketball.

Written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Fargo), 'The Big Lebowski\" revolves around Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude (Jeff Bridges), an unemployed pothead who gets involved in a case of mistaken identity. Dude, the \"hey man\" protagonist who enjoys grocery shop\u00ad ping in his bathrobe, smoking joints and a good White Russian every 10-15 minutes, returns to his modest home to find that two thugs have broken into his apartment. After roughing him up a bit, the thugs soon realize that they have mistaken The Dude for the \"Real Lebowski,\" a wheelchair -bound tycoon whose wife owes their boss a hefty sum of cash. Furious that one of the thugs urinated on his rug, an accessory that \"really pulled the whole room together,\" The Dude sets out to find the \"Real Lebowski,\" and as a result, ends up caught in a deceitful web of kidnapping, double-crossing and suitcases full of money/dirty undies. Surrounding the loveable Dude is a band of typical Coen-style characters includ\u00ad ing Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) , Dude's best buddy who relates every instance to his time in 'Nam; Donny (Steve Buscemi) a mild-mannered quiet guy who endures numerous reprimand s of \"shut the fuck up, Donny\"; and Maude Lebowski, a feminist artist who becomes The Dude's partner in a variety of plots. The film also features a few curious yet pleasing appear\u00ad ances including a bit-part by Flea, who rep-resents one third of the trio of German Nihilists, as well as the character of The Stranger (Sam Elliott) who narrates the twisted tale of Dude while he enjoys a good sasparilla. Sadly, 'The Big Lebowski\" gives only limited exposure to its most memorable player, Jesus Quintana (John Turturro), the Hispanic bowler/molester who seems ready for \"league-play\" with his greasy hair and skin-tight purple leisure suit. This film does have that one weakness -it teases us with brilliant characters who we want to see more of. Director Joel and producer Ethan Coen employ many of their signature cine\u00ad matic methods in \"The Big Lebowski .\" Their trademark point-of-view shot and \"tracking\" shot are used more than once, but are done with such variety and technical finesse, the angles never become mllildane. Particularly memorable is a shot from one of Broadway comes our way! by Erin McGann Staff Writer Thursday, March 19, 1998 will be the opening night of CSC's production of \"Guys and Dolls\" at the Fine Arts Center. The musical is directed by Harry McEnemy and has a cast of more than 30. The story takes place in Brooklyn in the I 940's and revolves around romance, gambling and a night club called The Hot Box. There are four lead roles, two \"guys\" and two \"dolls.\" There are several smaller roles as well as those who help with the singing and dancing. The cast and crew have had eight weeks to prepare for the play. There were lines to memorize and also song and dance numbers to work on to perfect everything for the final performance.

Since the sentence, Mumia's voice has become the voice of America's oppressed.

THE BUS now services Castleton State Coll~e at night (ftee with a ~liege ID). Pick! up a schedule in the Student Life Office, located in the Canglus Center. 1 Campus construction underway by Duncan Simmons Stair Writer The academic expansion is expected to begin prior to commencement. according to a memorandum issued by the office of the Dean. The new facility will be constructed between the southwest end of the library and the northeast comer of the nursing building. The construction is tenlatively scheduled to begin as early as this week. Walls in the ACC, the media center and the nursing building will be demolished to connect the-two-story addi\u00ad tion with the existing buildings. The mem\u00ad orandum went on to state that the expan\u00ad sion project had come in below the bud\u00ad geted amount. clearing the way for work to begin. Because of fluctuating costs, CSC administration is unable to specify exactly when the lengthy process will begin. The contractor is to notify the school of a work schedule as soon as possible. Waiting until after graduation will reportedly raise the price of the project. The preliminary blueprints of the building are extremely elaborate, showing a bi-level addition that will not only con\u00ad nect the old structures , but add a second floor to the existing nursing building. The new expansion will produce more room for computer services, media center equip\u00ad ment. interactive classrooms, workroom s, lecture halls, study areas, offices and stor\u00ad age. The existing library and nursing buildings will also be reorganized because of the creation of new space. The most complex design on paper is the large inter\u00ad active lecture hall which will be designed in an amphitheater shape, complete with large screens and video projectors . The upstairs will house nursing labs, seminar rooms, lounges, study areas and interactive classroom and more offices. The math, education and nursing departments will gain much needed space along with the media center and computing services. The movement to the new structure will create vacated space for other departments to acquire in the old buildings. Because the project involves some demolition, CSC administration has requested the patience of the faculty, staff and students. Dean Larkin's office is working with the Registrar to ensure that any disrupted exam rooms will be relocat\u00ad ed to a suitable place. College officials also say that plans are being made to pro\u00ad vide alternate buildings for computer ser\u00ad vices and the media center. Summer internship costs reduced CSC has approved, on an experi\u00ad mental basis, a reduction in the tuition rate for summer internship credits. 1lle new rate for this Summer is $75 per credit. This reduction applies to both in-state stu\u00ad dents. 1lle previous Summer internship rate was approximately $150 per credit for VT residents and $330 per credit for non\u00ad residents. The Business Adminstration Department has been busy recruiting employers who are interested in providing internships. This information has been used to create a database that will store contact information and descriptive infor\u00ad mation about each internship opportunity. Students will be able to enter a search request such as desired location or field of study, and a list of possible internships will be provided. Summer and Fall internship opportunities are still available . The Business Administration Department also provides internship information for majors outside of business, so all students are wel\u00ad come to participate . Any student who knows of a business in Vermont or their home state that they worked for, and would like to design an internship with should contact the Business Adminstration Department. If students are interested in the program or have any questions , they should contact Professor Paul Cohen, Internship Coordinator , at 468-1453 to set up an appointment.

Cash prizes were awarded for the winning essafS. Thanks to all participants! ..> by Tara Rod.in Stall' Writer '1t is better to light a candle than to curse the ~.\" I saw this proverb; on a poster ooe day a few weeks ago and was struck with an odd conoection to the saying. Last week. April 15, students, fac\u00ad ulty, Women's Issues Group members and others gathered to do just that. to make light and to dispel the darkness, even if only for ooe evening. The darkness is the fear of sexual assault, rape and domestic abuse that women and men face every day, and the light was the ability for all of us to stand up together io support of a less vio\u00ad lent society, where we feel safe to walk the streets alone at night and can trust that a person we know and trust will oot tum out to be our attacker. For me, this experience was far more iotewie and uplifting than I couJd have ever co~iyed of. The feeling of unity among the people gathered was overwhelming. Rape is qot something you just read about in your Seventeen maga\u00ad zines girls, and is not only io those naugty movies, boys. Rape, violence and sexual assault arc all around us, and our decision to recognize this chilling fact or to oot rec\u00ad ognize it will make the difference between helping to end this tragedy in all fonns or silently letting it grow. Somehow, it seems many people arc willing to do just that, ignore it, laugh about it, even encourage it by their lifestyles and mannerisms . It sad\u00ad dens me that some response from various people was negative toward the Take Back the Night March and the whole idea behind the Sexual Assault Awareness Week. It is much easier to be uneducated on a certain topic and let society, the media or your parents instruct you on what your views should be. Lets get real, the future is ours and if we con\u00ad tinue to stare numbly at the world like we do our TV screens. I shudder to think what fate might have in store for us. As my Professor Tom Conroy said recently, '1f kids have the choice between a 50().page history book of the Vietnam War or a video of Rambo or a P.O.W. computer game, which one do you think they arc most likely to pick up?\" Unfortunately, the answer to that question is all too obvious and living in a society where Rambo is one of the top fifty highest grossing movies ever, I must confess I'm frightened . Empowerment marches on by Merry Trude Contributing Writer Rape. Violence . Sexual abuse. These were just some of the issues raised at the Third Annual Take Back the Night March, held on campus Wednesday , April 15. The march, sponsored by the Women's Issues Group of CSC, is designed to help women speak out on and combat abuse. This year's events consist\u00ad ed of guest speakers, a candlelight march through campus and up Main Street and an open-mic speak out. Over 75 people attended, and many told their stories of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Tracey Butkus, a senior at CSC and by Alison Morse Staff Writer Everyone on campus is familiar with Public Safety. Some of us arc more acquainted than others because we have dealt with parltlng warnings, fines or vari\u00ad ous other citations. But very few people arc aware that you can get those tickets appealed through Castleton State's College Court. This is just one way the College Court serves the students. ~ The Student Association \u00b7 bas three branches : Executive Branch, Legislative Branch and Judicial Branch. The College Court is a part of the Judicial Branch. The newly established Court bas become more active this year after filling positions . \"Right now the Court is very young and Clllm4 Women's Issues Group member said, \"It shocked me how many people got up and we arc trying to define ourselves,\" said new Chief Justice Ben Mosher. Mosher was appointed to this position because for\u00ad mer Chief Justice, Victor Echandy will be graduating this year. There arc two branches of the Court. The Appellate Court handles appeals to campus traffic violations and hearing processes of the other Court Officials . If you were a appeal a ticket, your case would be beard and judged by this branch. The Peer Judicial Board hands out sanctiens to college policy vio\u00ad lators. For example, if you were to be caught drinking and you were under age, this board would handle your case. As new Chief Justice, Mosher bas a lot of goals he wants to work on. One thing he wants to do is redefine and clarify the job descriptions of the positions on the spoke out about their own experiences . It really opens people's eyes on the amount Court and rewrite parts of the constitution. Mosher would also like to make the campus aware of the Court and the people holding positions on it. One way he would like to accomplish this is by hosting a midnight breakfast next year. During election time, he want to post pic\u00ad tures of the candidates at the polls so peo\u00ad ple know who is running. There are still some positions available on the Court. If you are interest\u00ad ed io holding a position, contact Ben Mosher during his office hours in the SA office. of violence women face.\" Guest speakers Liz True, Assistant Dean of Campus Life and Victoria DeRosia. Professor of Criminal Justice, gave compelling speeches about the importance of getting the word out about abuse. Both women stressed the point that men should also join the fight against abuse of all kinds. Sara Patch, the president of the Women's Issue's Group and a CSC senior, started the tradition of the march three years ago, and has stuck with it ever since. She spoke before the march, stating that this event was ''bitterswed'' because it was her last march at CSC. Tbe Women's Issue's Group plans to continue this tradi\u00ad tion in future years.

These students were part of the CSC Alternative Spring Break Program. Brooke Manin, the Resident Director of Wheeler Hall and the Castleton ('.ommunity Survive coordinator, bas been in chuge of the Alternative Spring Break plOpllll for four years. \"It offers students die opportunity to participate in communi\u00ad ty leMc:e work while giving to, and learn\u00ad ing from, thole who are less fortunate than us,\" said Martin. This year six students and two administraton from CSC traveled to New Yodt City to volunteer at God's Love We Deliver. God's Love We Deliver is a non\u00ad profit, non-sectarian organization that delivers fresh, nourishing meals to home\u00ad bound people with AIDS. This organiza\u00ad tion helps ~ and deliver meals to 1,ISO clients throughout New York City and Hudson County, New Jersey. God's Love We Deliver was start-ed in the Summer of 1985, and since bas delivered over two million meals to over 16,000 men, women, and children. GLWD operates an industrial kitchen that is open 22 hours a day, five days a week. plus eight hours on Sunday. It is operated by over 2,500 volunteers, 63 full-time staff members , and a network of 61 community based Neighborhood MeaJ Distribution Centers. \"We have gone to Boston for the past three years so this was something new\" said Martin. The group worked as van assistants and helped deliver the meals. They worked in the kitchen and helped prepare the food. They even worked in the office doing such things as calling other organizations for donations, stuffing envelopes and tiling. 'This program bas given me a totally different perspective on life\" Martin said '1 delivered meals in the Bronx where there were a lot of homeless people and poverty. You realize bow these issues affect people, and this exposes you to what is really going on in our society. It was detinately a whole new experience. I highly lllC<>mmcod this program to anyone who is interested.\" Practice makes perfect in interviews by Lisa King Contributing Writer The second annual mock inter\u00ad view dinner for seniors was held April 14 in the Alumni Room at Buden Dining Hall. The dinner is sponsored by Aramark, Residence Life and Career Planning. Chip Stevens, Director of Career Services and a professional recruiter, gave interviews. Norm Milot, Director of Dining Services, also gave students tips on dinner etiquette. Stevens told students how they should dress, what they should do before an interview and how they should conduct themselves during an interview . Stevens said some questions are considered illegal during an interview. An interviewer cannot ask an interviewee about marital status, if be or she bas chil\u00ad dren or plans to have them, or if the inter\u00ad viewee attends church. If one encounters an interviewer asking these questions, be or she must find a strategy to avoid these questions. The proper interview dress for men is khaki pants, a dress shirt with a tic, and dress shoes, Stevens said For more prestigious jobs, a suit and tie are required. He said the object is to dress as well as your interviewer. Stevens said men must choose a suit that fits their build, and get it tailored at least a week before an interview to avoid any last-minute problems . He said, \"A double-breasted suit docs not look good on everyone .\" Women should wear conservative dresses or skirts and blouses. Dress pants and a blouse are also acceptable. 'The important thing is to make sure your outfit works for you. If you feel more comfort\u00ad able wearing flats, then wear them\" Stevens said. He also told students that they should not try to dress like something they are not because when they are in a two-hour interview fidgeting with clothes and shoes is unimpressive . Also, Stevens said women should Ellis Hall getting a facelift by Kristen Breton Contributing Writer As some have wondered, and many have gossiped, Ellis Hall will be closed for residential living in the spring 1999 semester. Because of her old age, Ellis will be renovated on the inside, malt\u00ad ing changes in the heating and electrical systems. As of March 1998, the plan for the fall 1998 semester is to leave the third floor open for all women's single rooms. the second floor will be co-cd as it bas been in the past. and the first floor will also remained both female and male rooms. A new exception to the living arrangements will be the fact that only one Resident Assistant will reside on the third floor. The thought behind keeping only one RA on the third floor is that there will be 50% fewer residents living on that floor, therefore , less attention needs to be payed to monitor that floor. When the spring semester rolls around. some residents will have found housing off campus, or roommates in Adams, Haskell or Babcock. \"It seems as though people are fearing the change, but change can be a good thing, and we promise we'll take extra specjal care of the residents,\" said a current Ellis RA Ellis Hall bas had many internal problems. ..The beat bites in this place. You can't control the temperatures and just when you think you've got it all under not wear perfume or large earrings that may distract the interviewer . The same rule applies to men who wear cologne because some people are hypersensitive to smell. Stevens said that an interviewee should malce sure to bring extra clothes, boots and an umbrella to be prepared for stains, rips and changes in weather. Aside from clothes, Stevens said, if one plans to get a new haircut. it is important to get one a week before the interview to avoid hair problems. Stevens said that before a dinner interview, it is wise to drive to a restaurant a couple of days before the interview to see how long it takes to get there and avoid being late for the interview . At the same time, one can observe the atmosphere of the restaurant Milot added that foods which are sloppy or difficult to cat at one's own home must be avoided during a dinner interview. Also, an interviewee should only eat something similar to what the control...they go and turn it off,\" said one mildly angered resident of the building. His roommate, Mike, says that \"it's almost sad that this dump will be closed for a semester. If I have to live in it for a whole year ... so should they.\" Not all students feel the same way, however. \"Ellis is such an experi\u00ad ence. That was the greatest part of my freshman year,\" stated Tracey, an off-cam\u00ad pus student Judging Ellis on the outside would be a shame ... for inside her walls she is the home for over 150 students whose living experiences in her building are both wild and uniquc ... aod sometime chilly. It won't be long before she works like new\u00ad evcn though she will always remain 'Good 'ol Bellis.\" interviewers arc eating. If they are eating a small dinner, like soup and saJad, then the interviewee should too. Milot also discussed dinner eti\u00ad quette. He advised students on how to use silverware and napkins, and bow food should be passed around a table. One student asked Stevens what to do if a person receives food that is not prepared well. He said one must avoid slowing down the meaJ and interview as much as possible. He told students they could avoid the undercooked food on their plate or quietly call the waiter or waitress aside and ask him or her to prepare a new mcaJ. ~ Stevens gave students a brochure that tells them most of what they need to know about dinner etiquette. It is titled, Put Your Best Fork Froward: The Rules of Business Dining Etiquette . More brochures are available in Stevens' office. cairns -Spartan soccer preparing for fall season by H. Jason Wam Contributing Writer As the 1998 Spring semester draws to a close, most students have already decided what he or she will be doing next Fall. Once again, the CSC men's soccer team is gearing up and as the runners up in the Mayflower Confen:nce in 1997. The 1998 season will no doubt be one to get out and see. The Spartans will lose several key players due to graduation or ineligi-bility. Goalkeeper Rob LaBate, sweeper Scott Chapman, and m.idfielders John Holmes and Todd Moore arc all members of the starting lieup that will not return for the 1998 season. Next year's co-captain Jon Schnobrich is very confident and opti\u00ad mistic about the teams run at the Conference title. \"We need to come together as a team and make a lot of adjustments\" Schnobrich said He's confi\u00ad dent that the team can pull together and Looking for Work? Looking For Work:? Looking For Work:? Becket School make another winning season. Schnobrich pointed to several factors in his confidence about next sea\u00ad son; one is that rival Green Mountain College, who denied CSC of the Conference title, will loose several key players. However, Schnobrich was quick to point out that Green Mountain has very good recruiting for such a small school. Another factor is the acquistion of a Division I player from Radford University named Chris Hanley. Entering CSC as a transfer student. Hanley is a midfielder who will fill the gap left in the midfield by the player turnover this year. Every player on next year's Spartan squad is upbeat about the coming season. The team is even holding open practices every day at five o'clock in the afternoon and they encourage anyone who wants to try out to attend. a special education treatment facility serving youth at risk: has job openings now and in May/June for Residential Counselors.

I turn the key and depress the cigarette lighter as I pull a Marlboro out of the pack and place it between my lips. The cigarette lighter pops. I touch it to the end of the Marlboro. I inhale. I take the first drag into my lungs. It tastes like shit. I don't bother fiddling with the radio as I pull the truck out of the parking lot. I push into the tape deck the same Lynyrd Skynyrd tape that I've been listening to for the last two weeks. I turn the volume up loud so I don't have to think. I try to sing along with the music but thoughts keep running through my head. I wish I could just shut them off and concentrate. I can't. I am a senior in college. I have never felt pressure the way I feel it now. I never believed my peers when they would tell me how stressed they were. I would tell them to get a beer and stop crying. Beer is the last thing I want now. I have too much to do. If I'm not in the real world, please shoot me before I get there. I decide to take the back way home for a reason that has something to do with relaxation . Most days I slow down as I cross the railroad tracks. Today I speed up to over 60 miles per hour. Nothing like beating the crap out of your automobile when you're pissed at something. Nothing like getting pissed at your automobile for breaking down the very next day. Nothing l~ knowing that it's your fault. I think back to when I was living at home: before high school, before junior high school. Scott Maxfield, the oldest kid on my street on Long Island, was 12 years old. I was younger. I remember that l couldn't even comprehend being that old. I would never be 12 years old, but I couldn't wait to be l 0. I try to convince myself that \"life was so easy back then.\" I try to convince myself that I would love to return to that age, and stay there forever. \"Sweet home, Alabama,\" I sing as I make the conscious effort to return to what is important, \"Where them skies are so blue!\" The truck is still bouncing from hitting the tracks so hard. I come up on the first fann of the ride home. A farmer waves as I drive by. I wave back at him. I've never met the man in my life. I know him only as the farmer who waves when I drive by. When I drove a car, he didn't wave. Now that I drive a truck. he does. I love Vermonters . I guess being l 0 years old again would suck, but there has got to be some\u00ad thing better for me out there than this. Too many deadlines, too many commitments. I just had a meeting with the dean of the col\u00ad lege that I attend. I have one month left of classes. I told him that I would like to add a class, graduate in a month and substitute another class to fulfill a requirement. \"Oh by the way Dean, I'm graduating .... yeah. ya' didn't know that? Well I guess you know now. Thanks a lot, Dean.\" I arrive at a hypothesis . I'm stressed out because I Looking back .. ~ by Liam Callahan Contributing Wrtiter Graduation is fast approaching and for those of us who arc receiving degrees, so is the end of our college career at CSC. \u00b7 Where have those four (or five) years of our lives gone? I remember, as if it were just the other day, my parents drop\u00ad ping me off at Haskell Hall so I could move into a suite full of total strangers. My parents helped me lug my belongings up four flights of stairs and then with departing hugs and a \"good luck. son,\" they headed back to Connecticut in their Dodge Caravan. It was so sudden -you are a college studcnt. .. NOW. \u00b7 The first few weeks were strange, finding those new college buddies seemed to be the most important task. In high school, the friends I had seemed to always be there and were taken for granted, but in college everybody was new. Where would I fit in? 1bc college buddies came easily and so did the crazy, out of control memo\u00ad ries. 1bc memories make for the type of Caimi stories that are funny and meaningful only to the people involved -outsiders never seem to understand because they were not a part of it. These are also the type of sto\u00ad ries that you're glad your parents will never bear anything about. Occasionally, a rare and carefully censored edition of one of these talcs might be told in the future to prove a point to a son or daughter, but the names would have to be changed to protect the innocent. Campus life was both good and bad. The good was that the off-caffipus bills were never included in the price of tuition and everything that was needed was within walking distance. Freshman year, leavuig campus was a rare event. The bad part about campus life was most definitely the gourmet meals served at the beloved Huden Hall. There was also the pestering RA's who seemed to always come in at the high point of the nighL My biggest gripes about RA's was that they were not much older than us and they were telling us what was right and wrong. Most of the time they were correct. but accepting it was hard. I remember the routine that we try to buck the system by not paying atten\u00ad tion to deadlines. Deadlines and other similar rules are for other people. In high school my friend Russ and I figured out that we were better than everyone else. We agreed that we should not have to deal with the public. We should not have to wait in traffic. For example, if Russ and I were to take a road trip from Northport, Long Island to Castleton , Vermont, we believed that there should be an interstate built that runs in a straight liine from Northport to Castleton. This interstate could be trav\u00ad eled only by Russ and me. Secretly, sub\u00ad consciously, something like that, I think I still believe that. I hope, for his sake, that Russ does not. Misconceptions can make life extremely difficult. \"Sweet home, Alabama,\" I try to stop thinking, \"Lord I'm comin' home to you!\" As I approach the first uphill, I push the gas pedal down a little further. I am getting further from school by the second. I take a drag off the cigarette. I tastes a lit\u00ad tle better than before. I try to concentrate on that classic guitar riff. I push the pedal down further. I scream as loud as I can. I want the world to know I'm alive. I feel insane, yet strangely sane. I push the pedal all the way down. Maybe if I drive fast enough, I won't be able to think about any\u00ad thing except, \"I hope these damn tires can hold a curve!\" I decide that I will call my broth\u00ad er when I get home. I decide that I must drive cross-country when I graduate. I decide that it must be done in a '66 Mustang . I decide that there simply is not needed to go through to get \"beverages\" into the dorms. We had people who car\u00ad ried, people who held doors, and the look\u00ad outs. We usually switched positions regu\u00ad larly and seemed to always be humming the tune to Mission Impossible . These actions seem to make indulging in the bev\u00ad erages more rewarding . I look back to the first times at events such as Halloween parties, Clam Bakes and Pig Roasts. These are all great times to look forward to every year , but the first time seems to stick out best in my mind, simply for that reason. These events are, to me, when everyone seems friend\u00ad liest. The headaches that bothered me in the past years do not seem as trouble\u00ad some as I look back on them now. The crunch time period just prior to and during exams was always stressful. I need to write how many pages and study for how many exams in how long!? A lot of coffee was brewed during those times but now it seems to be more under control. I also recall the run-around during the schedul\u00ad ing week. What a pain trying to figure out how to get all the courses needed to grad-another way to do it. I have many Mustang catalogues at home and I know that when I get there, I'll begin looking at them. I'll stare at the best one for an hour. I will dream about Mustangs and road trips tonight. I won't do any homework . Homework is for other people. I think about graduation . I realiz.e that I care much less about graduation than I do about graduating . Mom and Dad are very excit\u00ad ed to come up to Vermont and watch their son walk. I just want to grab that silly piece of paper that says I'm better than anybody who doesn't have one and get the bell out of here. I don't feel a need to leave the area. I feel a need not to attend any more classes. Maybe I'll go to graduate school eventually. Right now, I don't want to. Mom and Dad pay a lot of money for me to go here. Maybe they deserve to watch their son graduate. I think about all my old friends. It seems to take everyone at least five years to graduate college. Most of my bum-out friends will do it in four, just like me. I won't have time to look at those catalogues after all. I have to make some phone calls as soon as I get home. I have a story due tomo.rrow at nine in the morning. I can sec my house quiclcly approaching. The lake looks nice today.

I tried to make up backup schedules that would help if classes were closed, but my five years here saw how badly that worked ouL The years in between freshman and senior seem to basically repeat them\u00ad selves with the addition of some new friends and the departure of some old ones. Classes and weekends went by quiclcly then it turned into semesters that were fly\u00ad ing by and now it is the years which have flown by me while I stood still. I am going to miss CSC. The first few weeks of freshman year I was somewhat homesick. although I was ready to be on my own in college. Five years later, I am starting to feel home\u00ad sick again for my fading home at CSC, while I am also ready to get out on my own.

According to the ~ 'edical Enscyclopedia. it is common for iildren to be born with Down syndrome the mother is over 40 years old. Alice lived with ther parents, two >ters and brother at their home in .uiington. Alice, the youngest, was the ~y one of her siblings with Down syn-drome. In 1949, at the age of nine, Alice was admitted to the Brandon Training School. It was the place where she would be secluded from the world for 42 years. When Alice was first admitted to the Brandon Training School, she had min\u00ad imal speech abilities, often talking in sen\u00ad tence fragmdnts . Now, she does not talk at all. 'The hardest thing about this job is trying to figure out Alice's wants and needs at various times,'' comments Deb. Alice knows two signs in the Americal Sign Language vocabulary, \"yes\" and \"more.\" Deb watches Alice's facial expressions and body movement to tell bow Alice is feeling. The cereal in the bowl is gone and Alice moves on to her cup of coffee. She loves coffee. Sometimes she has two cups in the morning. She gulps down the entire cup as if someone is going to take it away from her. When breakfast is over, Deb helps Alice into her coat. Alice's 4-foot-5- inch body looks even smaller next to Deb's 5 feet 8 inches. Alice is 57 years old. Despite dainty hands and tiny feet, she is plump. She has thin gray hair and probing brown eyes that bold many expressions. Under her flat nose is a mouth which bas almost as many expressions as her eyes. Sometimes it is small and straight. Other times it expands into a wide smile. Alice is smiling now. It is 8:54 a.m. and she knows that it is time for a ride in the car. Riding in the car is one of Alice's favorite things. After Deb and Alice finish run\u00ad ning the morning errands, they make the 25 minute drive to Julie's house. Julie was one of Alice's room.mates at the Brandon Training School. Julie has Down syn\u00ad drome, too. She is more verbal than Alice, talking in sentence fragments.

Julie was placed with Deb's sister immediately , but Alice spent three years with another family before the State of Vermont decided that Alice would receive better care with Deb's family. On Valentine 's Day in 1994, Alice moved in with Deb's family. It's 10:06 a.m. and Julie is being hustled into the car next to Alice. The next stop is the Diamond Run Mall. It is 10:45 a.m. and the mall only has a small number of morning shoppers. Deb is pushing Alice in a wheelchair and Julie is tagging along with slow, rocking steps. Alice can walk as well as Julie, but Alice has become lazy and would rather be pushed. According to Deb, the Brandon Training School did not encourage Alice's movement while she was there. All three of them love to go shopping, but most of their shopping trips are window shopping. If Deb buys an item without buying some\u00ad thing for Alice, Alice gets mad and pouts for the rest of the day. Sometimes Deb will pick up lunch for them at a fast food restaurant; both Alice and Julie love french fries. On this chilly day, however, Deb is taking them home for lunch. Chicken noodle soup and grilled cheese are on the menu. Deb, Alice and Julie reach Deb's home at 11:50 a.m. Deb brings Alice and Julie inside and starts to prepare lunch. She usually has lunch ready by noon, just in time for her husband to come home and quickly cat before heading back to work. Deb, Alice and Julie stay at Deb's home until 1:30 p.m. Sometimes they bake, sometimes they watch television and on nice days, they go outside. It's 1 :35 p.m. and the trio are on the road again. It's time to take JUiie home. Deb takes care of Julie three days a week, four hours per day. The rest of the day is uneventful.

Most times Alice will sit in her blue arm chair and watch all the activity in the house. She watches Deb's children do their homework and bicker over who gets to watch what on television . She watches the five cats slink around the house or dart at shadows. She watches the little dog bark and pester the cats. She watches Deb prepare supper. It's 5:30 p.m. and supper is on the table. Alice is not looking at Deb's two children, Deb's husband or the pets. Alice is watching Deb cut the food on her plate into bite-size pieces. As soon as the plate is in front of her, Alice begins eating, shoving the chick\u00ad en and rice into her month. Within min\u00ad utes her cheeks are stuffed with food. \"Slow down. Take a drink. please,\" Deb warns again. \"If you can't eat like a lady, I'll have to take it away.\" \"It is bard,\" comments Deb, ''to try and un-do what her life at the Training School has taught her.

I was playing with little Russell Sprague in the woods behind my house. We were clumsi\u00ad ly piling fallen branches in a square arrangement, constructing a roofless heap of dead bark and petrified needles that we referred to as \"the pine tree cabin.\" Russell called a time-out from our building so that he could go to the bathroom, and walking a few paces away from our cabin, he turned his back and relieved himself. I bad been drinking from a thennos of lemonade all afternoon , and the hundred yards to the house seemed like ten miles at the time, so I decided to save myself the trip and solve my problem as Russell was solving bis. Turning my back to my friend and our poorly conceived dream house, I planted my feet firmly into the soft, leaf-covered earth and began to do as Russell was doing and what I knew my father must have done a thousand times when he was working in the woods. I knew I was different from the boys when I felt the warm liquid stream down the inside of my brown corduroys, soaking my socks and canvas sneakers and causing my cheeks to flush a deep shade of pink that can only be induced by complete humiliation . I was embarrassed and fwi\u00ad ous at my f emalencss, a cbaractcristic that at the time I viewed as a limitation . This notion of my X-chromosome related impairment was reinforced on an exceptionally humid summer afternoon about five years later. Having teamed my lesson that day in the woods, I rushed into the house to use the bathroom before I was about to meet my friend at the pond that separated our parents' property. To my horror and disgust, I discovered that a small, dart reddish-brown stain had begun to spread across the seat of my shorts. I knew what was happening , that I was now cursed with a lifetime of cramps, headaches and unpredictable hormone fluctuations . I told my mother that there \u00b7 was no way that I was going swimming now, that I probably wouldn't go out for another week because everyone was sure to detect my new \"curse.\" I begged her not to tell my father, I was so embarrassed that I bad to carry around this premature bur\u00ad den of womanhood when I still had the physique and mind of a twelve-year-old girl. I wasn't any happier the next year when my chest, which had always been conveniently flat, swelled enough so that the trip to the lingerie section of the depart\u00ad ment store that I had been putting off for so long became inevitable . When my mother finally tricked me into going shopping, I insisted that I wanted to find something calm 12 simple and to get out of there -nothing fancy for me. When she turned her back to ask the saleswoman where the \"teen sec\u00ad tion\" was, I can remember for one second, secretly admiring the intricate lace of the teddies and the other colorfully sexy, fem\u00ad inine garments . However, my state of dis\u00ad tress was resuscitated when I got to the teen section and discovered that everything was adorned with pink bows and looked so cutesy, that I could imagine even the perki\u00ad est of girls gagging with repulsion . My . mother, who shares in my contempt of anything pink, picked out two plain white bras with little blue tennis rackets fastened between the cups. I waited in the car while she paid and I ripped the light blue stitches of the girlish decals as soon as I got home. I can remember cursing my gen\u00ad der once ag'\"1 in gym class a couple of years later. I had patiently endured gruel\u00ad ing units of basketball and archery, count\u00ad ing the days until we would begin my favorite phys. ed. activity -floor hockey. With the possible exception of badminton, floor hockey was the indoor sport that I excelled in the most. I recall emerging from the locker room and into the freshly waxed gymnasium and seeing that all the girls were standing in a giggling clump at one side of the room while the boys were putting on mesh jerseys and picking out their sticks on the other side. Mr. Withee, the varsity football coach/algebra profes\u00ad sor/gym teacher extraordinaire blew his whistle and ordered all the girls to go up on the stage for an alternative activity. When I questioned his command, be explained that the boys were bigger and more aggres\u00ad sive than last year, many had experienced major growth spurts over the summer, and as the person responsible for all of us, Mr. Withee just couldn't guarantee that the girls would not get hurt. I told him that I really wanted to play, that I was probably better and faster than most of the boys there. Being the sensitive and understand\u00ad ing man that he was, he blew bis whistle and told me to get on the stage so that they could begin the game. Furious, but unea\u00ad ger to suffer yet another detention that week, I did what he said and stomped up the steps to the stage. Behind the curtain, I discovered about a dozen girls positioned in front of a television , gossiping and half\u00ad heartedly doing step aerobics while a \"Buns of Steel\" video played on the VCR. This was the \"alternative activity\" that Mr. Withee had so carefully planned for the females in the class. Unwilling to endure even five minutes of prerecorded \"and one, and two, and three, feel the burn!\" I opted for my own alternative activity and chose to sit in my car and smoke cigarettes, silently fuming that I was damned with a mandatory membership to the club that makes up 51% of this country '~ popula-ti on. For the next couple of years after, every time I bad cramps, got a C in math or peed on the cuffs of my pants while ~o\u00ad verting the forest into my bathroom dunng camping trips, I credited my misfortune to my gender. I absolutely loathed being a member of what my sociology teacher referred to as \"the second sex.\" It actually wasn't until college that I even began to understand, appreciate and eventually adore the physical, hormonal , spiritual and emotional elements that make me woman. I was 18 years old and in my first year at a New England state college when I began to undergo this amazing feminist transformation. I befriended a shaven\u00ad headed lesbian named Dominica who insisted that the world could not persist without the x-chromosome; that poetry, music, philosophy and everything beauti\u00ad ful would not exist if it were not for women. Dominica had this way of malting everything female seem romantic and sacred. \"Vennont is such a woman,\" she would say whenever we drove through tree covered bills or paused at the edge of a stream during one of our walks. Perhaps Dominica was really convincing in her poetic musings or perhaps I was just an extremely impressionable freshman , but eventually I began to understand that my femaleness was, in fact, some sort of divine gift. That Spring when I saw AID Difranco perform for the first time, my newfound love for womanhood was strengthened . Surrounded entirely by other females and watching the feminist punk-folk singer strum her acoustic guitar so adeptly and so violently that I thought her fingers might start bleeding, I was completely entranced. She stomped around on stage with her heavy black boots, shook her hips, defiantly swung her blue braids over her shoulder and sang about having \"highways for stretcbmarts\" and how she always wanted to be \"Commander in Chief of her one woman anny.\" I looked at her and felt that she was everything strong and beautiful and bril\u00ad liant and suddenly the notion of a \"real woman\" seemed like something that I wanted to attain rather than something I was ashamed of. For the past few years I have been working on defining and becoming a \"real woman.\" I'm growing stronger and smarter, I'm learning to assert my female\u00ad ness and to appreciate it as an empowering tool that allows me to be a part of that glo\u00ad rious 51 %. Over time I have discovered that the realm of womanhood extends far beyond monthly cramps, stereotypical pink bows and poor math grades, lower salaries and camping inconveniences .
