A young person is considered independent if they are aged 22 or over, or if they meet other specified criteria. A personal income test also applies. The rate payable will be the lowest of that produced by the parental income test, the Family Actual Means Test, or the personal income test.

The Family Actual Means Test may still apply. The parental means tests do not apply to Youth Allowance (job seeker) claimants assessed as having a partial capacity to work. If independent, only a personal assets test and a personal income test apply (if the person is a member of a couple, this includes their partner's income and assets). *Subject to the passage of legislation, the Family Actual Means Test and the family assets tests will be abolished from 1 January 2016. Assets test If not independent, the family assets test applies (no personal assets test): - no payment can be made if the family's assets exceed $661,250 - a 75 per cent discount for farm/business assets applies to the family assets test. If independent, no payment if assets exceed personal assets test limit \u2014See Table A (page 31). Hardship provisions may apply to the personal assets test. Payment may be deferred when liquid assets are equal to or exceed $5,500 (single) or $11,000 (couple or single with dependants). Parental income test Parental income is the parents' combined adjusted taxable income for the base tax year*. Rate reduces if parental income exceeds threshold of $50,151. The parental income test rate reduction (which is 20 cents for every dollar of parental income over the threshold) is shared between recipients of specified payments (Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, ABSTUDY Group 2 school fees allowance (means-tested component) or additional boarding allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme) who are also subject to the parental income test. This rate reduction is also generally reduced where the family includes a senior secondary student (dependent child aged 16-19 in full-time secondary education, including children attracting FTB for a parent). For example, where there are two Youth Allowance recipients in a family and each attracts the 'aged 18 and over, at home' rate, each Youth Allowance recipient's rate is reduced by 10 cents for every dollar of parental income over the parental income test threshold. Where children attract different rates of payment the reduction is shared based on each recipient's share of the total maximum rate payable to all family members. The parental income limit at which Youth Allowance ceases to be available to a dependent youth increases with the number of dependent youth in the family (including senior secondary students) and where one or more dependent youth receives an 'away from home' rate or Rent Assistance. Please contact Centrelink for advice based on your circumstances. *The base tax year is the financial year ending on 30 June of the year before the calendar year in which the payment is made. The financial year following the base year may be used if there has been a substantial increase or decrease in parental income since the base tax year. Family Actual Means Test The Family Actual Means Test (i.e. family spending and savings) applies in relation to the base tax year* where one or both of their parents: - had an interest in a trust, private company or unlisted public company - was self-employed (except as a sole trader engaged wholly or mainly in primary production) or a partner in a partnership - earned in excess of A$2,500 (including tax exempt income) from a source in Norfolk Island or outside Australia - was a wage or salary earner who claimed or will claim a tax deduction for a business loss (whether current or carried forward) that does not consist only of a passive investment loss in their partnership income tax returns - had an interest in assets held in a country other than Australia in excess of A$2,500 or is a migrant who first entered Australia under a business skills category (business migrant) in the last 10 years. Rate reductions are calculated in the same way as the parental income test. *See note on base tax year for parental income test. Personal income test Gross income is assessed. The first $7,710 of a merit and equity based scholarship is exempt from means-testing. There is an income free area of $143 per fortnight for job seekers and $427 per fortnight for students and Australian Apprentices. Income above the income free area reduces payment unless credit is available in the Income Bank (for students and 25 of 40 Australian Apprentices\u2014see following) or Working Credits are available (see page 34). If the person is a member of a couple, their partner's income also reduces payment if it exceeds the cut-out point (the cut-out point varies depending on individual circumstances). See Table D(a) (page 33). Income Bank Allows Youth Allowance students to accumulate up to $10,600 of any unused portion of their fortnightly income free area.

The maximum Pension Supplement is currently $64.50 a fortnight for singles and $97.20 a fortnight for couples, combined. The minimum Pension Supplement is an amount below which the Pension Supplement does not fall until income or assets reach a level that would otherwise reduce a total pension including Pension Supplement to nil. The minimum amount is currently $34.60 a fortnight for singles, and $52.20 for couples, combined. Pensioners may elect to receive the minimum Pension Supplement amount on a quarterly basis. Instalments will be paid as soon as possible after 20 March, 20 June, 20 September and 20 December each year. The Pension Supplement is paid while the person is in Australia or, if outside Australia, only while the person has the right to continue to be paid their social security payment outside Australia. After an absence of more than six weeks outside Australia, the Pension Supplement is reduced to the Pension Supplement Basic Amount. The Pension Supplement Basic Amount is currently $22.50 a fortnight for singles and $37.20 a fortnight for both members of a couple, combined. Recipients of Parenting Payment (Single) under age pension age have the Pension Supplement Basic Amount added to their regular fortnightly payment.

TAL is also paid to telephone subscribers who receive certain social security allowance payments and are in specific circumstances. A higher rate of TAL is payable to recipients of Disability Support Pension who are aged under 21 years without children if they or their partner also have a home internet connection. The current rate of TAL is $111.20 per year ($27.80 per quarter). The higher rate of TAL is $165.60 per year ($41.40 per quarter) for home internet subscribers. This amount is shared between both members of an eligible couple. The payment is made in January, March, July and September each year. For most pensioners and other income support recipients who have reached age pension age, the value of TAL has been either added into the Pension Supplement (page 30) or forms part of the rate paid under transitional arrangements. Utilities Allowance Utilities Allowance is a quarterly payment to recipients of Widow Allowance and Partner Allowance who are under age pension age, and to Disability Support Pension recipients who are aged under 21 years without children, to assist with meeting the cost of utilities bills. The payment is made in March, June, September and December each year. The current annual rate is $603.20 for singles and $301.60 for each eligible member of a couple.

Pharmaceutical Allowance Rate: $6.20 per fortnight for an eligible single person, and $3.10 per fortnight for each eligible member of a couple (i.e. $6.20 in total if both members of a couple are eligible).

See Parenting Payment (page 11). *Income over these amounts reduces the rate of pension payable by 50 cents in the dollar (single), and 25 cents in the dollar each (for couples). For transitional or saved cases income over these amounts reduces the rate of pension payable by 40 cents in the dollar (single), and 20 cents in the dollar each (for couples). Pensioners receiving payments at 19 September 2009 may be paid under 'transitional arrangements' (page 13). #These figures may be higher if Rent Assistance is paid with your pension. Some assets are deemed to earn income, while there are special rules for other types of income. Contact us for more information. Employment income is subject to a Work Bonus for eligible pensioners over age pension age. The assets and income limits in Tables B and C may only apply to people who are resident in Australia, or who are temporarily absent from Australia for no longer than the portability period for their primary payment. Contact us for more information. Work Bonus Basic conditions of eligibility The Work Bonus is a concession on the income test treatment of employment income for pensioners over age pension age, except Parenting Payment (Single). The Work Bonus is used to reduce assessable employment income in an instalment period. An instalment period is a period of a maximum of 14 days. From 1 July 2011, the first $250 of employment income each fortnight is excluded from assessment under the income test for pensioners of age pension age.33 of 40 In addition, any unused amount of the $250 fortnightly exemption accrues in an Employment Income Concession Bank, up to a maximum of $6,500. Any credit in this bank offsets future employment income that would otherwise be assessable. The unused bank amount carries forward between years. All pensioners over age pension age, other than recipients of Parenting Payment (Single), are eligible for the Work Bonus. If they are eligible for a transitional rate, we will compare the transitional rate (which has no Work Bonus) to the new rate (which does include the Work Bonus). The transitional rate is paid where it is higher. The Work Bonus applies to individual pensioners. It cannot be shared by a pensioner couple. No registration process, however pensioners must keep us up-to-date with their employment income. Compensation payments Compensation payments, such as weekly workers' compensation payments, are assessed differently. If the compensable injury occurred prior to receiving an income support payment each dollar of any regular compensation payment reduces the income support payment (pension or allowance) by a dollar. If the compensable injury occurred while receiving an income support payment any regular compensation payment is assessed under the normal income test. If a person has a partner, any amount of regular compensation payment over the standard payment amount is treated as the partner's own ordinary income and may reduce their rate under the ordinary income test applying to their payment. Compensation payments may include a component of taxable income and it is this component that is included as income for Family Tax Benefit purposes. Lump sum compensation payments may result in a non-payment period. A partner will not be affected by a non-payment period and can still be paid social security payments provided they are otherwise eligible. Contact us for more information.

For income above $252 per fortnight, fortnightly allowance reduces by 60 cents in the dollar. In general, partner income which exceeds the cut-out point reduces fortnightly allowance by 60 cents in the dollar. However, the cut-out point varies for individuals depending on their circumstances. **These figures may be higher if you are eligible for Pharmaceutical Allowance or Rent Assistance. ***For maximum payment, the recipient's income must be no more than $102 per fortnight. Income over this amount reduces the rate of payment by 40 cents in the dollar. Working Credit Working Credit helps working age people to keep more of their income support payment when they take up work. When people have little or no income, they will build up 'working credits'. Then if they do work, their working credits increase the amount they can earn before their income support payment is reduced. For example, someone with 150 working credits is able to earn an extra $150 above the income free area before their payment starts to reduce. It also helps people who take up short-term jobs by making it easier for them to get their payments restarted (for up to 12 weeks). This means that people don't have to reapply for payments, they just need to prove that their job has ended, or that their income has dropped, and we will restart their payments.Taxable and non-taxable payments Taxable Age Pension, Disability Support Pension (for people of age pension age), Widow B Pension, Carer Payment (if carer or person being cared for is of age pension age), Wife Pension (if wife or husband is of age pension age), Parental Leave Pay, Dad and Partner Pay, Parenting Payment, Bereavement Allowance, Newstart Allowance, Widow Allowance, Sickness Allowance, Special Benefit, Youth Allowance, Partner Allowance, Austudy payment, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Pension Supplement Basic Amount (except for recipients of Disability Support Pension under age pension age) and Education Entry Payment.

Generally, to qualify for Rent Assistance, a person must be paid a social security payment, ABSTUDY or more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A, as well as pay a minimum amount of rent to a private landlord or to a community housing provider. Rent Assistance for families with children is usually paid with Family Tax Benefit. See Family Tax Benefit for current rates. Rent Assistance is not paid: - to people paying rent to a government housing authority, although in some situations sub-tenants may qualify for Rent Assistance - for residents in Australian Government funded places in nursing homes and other aged care facilities. Special rules apply to single sharers, and people who pay board and lodging, or who live in a retirement village. Rent Certificates are required to verify rent where a customer does not have a formal written tenancy agreement or is not named as a tenant in a formal written tenancy agreement. Rent Assistance is paid at the rate of 75 cents for each dollar of rent above the minimum rent amount, up to the maximum rate, applicable to the family situation (see Table F and Family Tax Benefit Part A, basic rates table on page 5). Rent Assistance is paid as part of another payment and it may be reduced due to the income and asset test rules applying to that payment. Rent Assistance may be paid for temporary absences overseas until the portability period for the primary payment ceases, or for up to 26 weeks if the primary payment may be paid indefinitely . Please contact us for detailed information on eligibility and payment rates for Rent Assistance.Energy Supplement The Energy Supplement is a tax-exempt, permanent payment to assist with household expenses including energy costs. Energy Supplement payments are paid automatically at the same time as regular payment cycles for pensioners, other income support recipients, families receiving Family Tax Benefit payments, youth and student payments recipients and Disability Support Pension recipients aged under 21 without dependent children. Most pension, allowance and family payment recipients can choose to receive the supplement with their regular fortnightly payment or quarterly in arrears. Eligible Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders will receive the Energy Supplement quarterly in arrears.

Single Income Family Supplement will provide assistance of up to $300 a year for families with a main income earner who earns between $68,000 and $150,000. This supplement recognises that, unlike dual income families at similar household income levels, single income families would receive little or no assistance through tax changes. Customers who receive Family Tax Benefit will automatically be assessed for Single Income Family Supplement eligibility. Customers who do not receive Family Tax Benefit, but who have a Single Income Family Supplement qualifying child in their care need to submit a claim form annually and lodge an income tax return within 12 months after the end of the financial year in order to be assessed for payment each year. Basic conditions of eligibility Single Income Family Supplement can be paid to a parent or guardian. To be eligible the claimant must: have a qualifying child in their care (see qualifying child information below), and meet residential requirements (as described under Family Tax Benefit Part A eligibility). Qualifying child A Single Income Family Supplement qualifying child is an FTB child (see FTB child definition under Family Tax Benefit Part A eligibility). A Single Income Family Supplement qualifying child also includes a child who would be an FTB child except that the child (or someone on the child's behalf) is receiving an \"at home\" rate of one of the following payments: Disability Support Pension Youth Allowance Special Benefit ABSTUDY living allowance, or An education allowance under the Veterans ' Children Educatio n Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme. Income test The Single Income Family Supplement will be paid to individuals where the main income earner has a taxable income of between $68,000 and $150,000. If there is a secondary earner in the family, their income needs to be below $18,000. The income test is based on a financial year income. Basic rate Up to $300 (depending on income).A guide to Australian Government payments38 of 40 Low Income Supplement / Low Income Family Supplement The Low Income Supplement/Low Income Family Supplement is a payment of $300 for people in low income households to assist with household expenses including energy costs. The Low Income Family Supplement is an administrative name for the Low Income Supplement as it applies to Family Tax Benefit recipients and it is paid to one member of a couple, if eligible. Claims for the Low Income Supplement and the Low Income Family Supplement must be made annually to receive payment each year. For the purpose of the Low Income Supplement and the Low Income Family Supplement, assessments of tax and income requirements are made against the previous financial year to the one you are claiming the supplement in. For claims submitted in the 2015-16 financial year, the assessment year is the 2014-15 financial year. Basic conditions of eligibility Adjusted taxable income for the previous financial year was below: - $30,000 for a single person without a dependent child - $45,000 for couples without a dependent child - $60,000 for a single person or a couple with a dependent child. Claimant was either not required to pay tax in the previous financial year or had a tax liability of less than $300 for the year. There must have been 13 weeks or more in the previous financial year in which the claimant did not receive a pension, benefit or other government payment that attracts the Energy Supplement (see Energy Supplement amounts for the full list of government payments that attract Energy Supplement) . For the Low Income Family Supplement this does not include Energy Supplement on Family Tax Benefit amounts. A person is not entitled to the Low Income Family Supplement if they or their partner (if applicable) have received a Low Income Supplement. A person satisfies the tax requirement for the income year if the person's accepted taxable income for the income year is: - less than $18,000, or - $18,000 or more but is less than the person's LIS threshold amount. Residence requirements Must be an Australian resident or special category visa holder residing in Australia. Must have been in Australia for at least 39 weeks of the previous financial year. Must have been in Australia for at least 46 weeks for claims in relation to financial year 2013-14 and onwards. Must not have been subject to a newly arrived resident's waiting period at any time during the financial year.Basic rate $300 a year. Essential Medical Equipment Payment The purpose of the payment is to assist eligible people who have additional costs in home energy as a result of the need to operate essential medical equipment or medically required heating/cooling in their home, to manage their disability or medical condition. The payment is available in addition to any existing state and territory government medical equipment rebate schemes. Following the initial payment, the claimant will continue to receive the payment automatically in each subsequent year that they continue to be eligible. Basic conditions of eligibility Available to people with medical needs, or their carers who: - are covered by a Commonwealth Government concession card or a Department of Veterans' Affairs Gold or White Card, and - use certain essential medical equipment in their home, or have certain medical conditions that require the use of additional heating and/or cooling, and - contribute to the energy account. The person with medical needs, and their carer if applicable, must live together in Australia in a residence that is not an excluded residence\u2014residential aged care, hospital, prison or detention centre. Where one piece of medical equipment is shared by multiple people in the same residence only one payment is payable in respect of that equipment in that residence. Where one person uses more than one piece of medical equipment in their residence the payment is payable in respect of each piece of equipment. Where a person uses one piece of equipment in multiple residences, a maximum of two payments can be made in respect of that piece of equipment each financial year, regardless of the number of different residences involved. Note: the lists of eligible essential medical equipment, medical conditions that require the use of heating and/or cooling, approved forms of energy and excluded residences can be found at humanservices.gov.au/emep Basic rates and methods of payment The payment is paid at one rate regardless of the piece of equipment being operated.
