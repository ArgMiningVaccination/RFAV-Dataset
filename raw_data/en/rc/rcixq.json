Section A: Funding Opportunity Description Section A: Funding Opportunity Description A.1. Program Information The U.S. Depart ment of the Interior's (Department) WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage America's Resources for Tomorrow) P rogram provides a framework for Federal leadership and assistance to stretch and secure water supplies for future generations in s upport of the Department 's priorities . Through WaterSMART, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) leverages Federal and non -Federal funding to support stakeholder efforts to stretch scarce water supplies and avoid c onflicts over water. WaterSMART provides support for the Department's priorities, including creating a legacy of conservation stewardship, sustainably developing our energy and natural resources, modernizing our infrastructure through public-private partne rships, and restoring trust with local communities by improving relationships and communication with states, tribes, local governments, communities, landowners and water users. Through the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program (Title XVI), authorized by Public Law (P.L. ) 102-575 in 1992, Reclamation provides financial and technical assistance to local water agencies for water reclamation and reu se research and the planning, design, and construction of water reclamation and reuse projects. Water rec ycling is an essential tool in stretching the limited water supplies in the Western United States. Title XVI projects develop and supplement urban and irrigation water supplies through water reuse, thereby improving efficiency, providing flexibility during water shortages, and diversifying the water supply. Through the Title XVI Program, Reclamation provides funding to facilitate investment in technology and enables broader scale use of recycled water which supports the goals of the October 19, 2018 Preside ntial Memorandum on Promoting the Reliable Supply and Delivery of Water in the West. Water reclamation and reuse research helps states, tribes, and local communities tackle water supply challenges. For purposes of the Title XVI Program, a water reclamation and reuse project is a project that reclaims and reuses municipal, industrial, domestic, or agricu ltural wastewater or impaired groundwater or surface waters. Research funded under the Title XVI Program (Title XVI Research) supports the development of water reclamation and reuse projects to supplement urban and irrigation water supplies through water reuse, thereby improving efficiency, providing flexibility during water shortages, and diversifying the water supply. Water reclamation and reuse p rojects provide growing communities with new sources of clean water which increases water management flexibility and makes our water supply more reliable. Title XVI is an important part of the WaterSMART Program. For further information on the WaterSMART Program, see www.usbr.gov/WaterSMART . 1 Funding Opportunity Announcement No. B OR-DO-19-F009 A.2.

All labor estima tes must be allocated to specific tasks as outlined in the applicant's technical project description. Labor rates and proposed hours shall be displayed for each task. 19 Funding Opportunity Announcement No. B OR-DO-19-F009 The budget proposal and narrative should i nclude estimated hours for compliance with repo rting requirements, including final project and evaluation. Please see Section F.3.2. Interim Performance Reports for information on types and frequency of reports required. Generally, salaries of administrative and/or clerical personnel will be included as a portion of the stated indirect costs. If these salaries can be adequately documented as direct costs, they should be included in this section; however, a justification should be included in the budget narrative. Fringe Benefits Indentify the rates/amo unts, what costs are included in this category, and the basis of the rate computations. Federally approved rate agreements are acceptable for compliance with this item.

For local travel, include mileage and rate of compensation. Equipment Itemize costs of all equipment having a valu e of over $5,000 and include information as to the need for this equipment, as well as how the equipment was priced if being purchased for the agreement. Note: if the value is less than $5,000, the item should be included under materials and supplies. If the equipment will be purchased and installed under a construction contract, the equipment should be included in the construction contract cost estimate. If equipment is being rented, specify the number of hours and the hourly rate. Local rental rates are only accepted for equipment actually being rented or leased . If the applicant intends to use their own equipment for purposes of the project, and the cost to use that equipment is being included in the budget as in-kind cost share, the propsed rates should fall within the equipment usage rates outlined by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in their Construction Equipment Ownership and Operating Expense Schedule (EP 1110-1- 8) at www.publications.usace.army.mil/USACE-Publications/Engineer - Pamphlets/u43545q/313131302D312D38. Provide the rates and hours for each piece of equipment owned and budgeted. 20 Section D: Application and Submission Information Materials and Sup plies Itemize supplies by major category, unit price, quantity, and purpose, such as whether the items are needed for office use, research, or construction. Identify how these costs were estimated (i.e., quotes, past ex perience, engineering estimates, or other methodology). Note: If the materials/supplies will be furnished and installed under a construction contract, the materials/supplies should be included in the construction contract cost estimate. Contractual Identify all work that will be accomplished by subrecipients, consultants, or contractors, including a breakdown of all tasks to be completed, and a detailed budget estimate of time, rates, supplies, and materials that will be required for each task. For each proposed contract, identify the procure ment method that will be used to select the consultant or contractor and the basis for selection. Please note that all contracts with an anticipated value of $10,000 or more must use a competitive procurement method. Only contracts for architectural/engineering services can be awarded using a qualifications -based procurement method. If a qualifcations-based procurement method is used, profit must be negotiated as a separate element of the contract price. See 2 CFR \u00a7200.317 through \u00a7200.326 for additional in formation regarding the standards for procurement transactions, including required contract content. Third -Party In -Kind Contributions Identify all work that will be accomplished by third- party contributors, including a breakdown of all tasks to be complet ed, and a detailed budget estimate of time, rates, supplies, and materials that will be required for each task. Third -party in- kind contributions, including contracts, must comply with all applicable administrative and cost principles criteria, established in 2 CFR Part 200, available at www.ecfr.gov , and all other requirements of this FOA. Environmental and Regulatory Compliance Costs Prior to awarding financial assistance, Reclamation must first ensure compliance with F ederal environmental and cultural resources laws and other regulations (\"environmental compliance\"). Every project funded under this program will have environmental compliance costs associated with activities undertaken by Reclamation and the recipient. To estimate environmental compliance costs, please contact compliance staff at your local Reclamation Office for additional details regarding the type and costs of compliance that may be required for your project. Note, support for your compliance costs es timate will be considered during review of your application. See Section G. Agency Contacts of this FOA for a list of Reclamation staff by region to contact regarding compliance costs and requirements. 21 Funding Opportunity Announcement No. B OR-DO-19-F009 Environmental compliance costs are considered project costs and must be included as a line item in the project budget and will be cost shared accordingly. The amount of the line item should be based on the actual expected environmental compliance costs for the project, including Reclamation's cost to review environmental compliance documentation. Environmental compliance costs will vary based on project type, location, and potential impacts to the environment and cultural resources. How environmental compliance activities will be performed (e.g., by Reclamation, the applicant, or a consultant) and how the environmental compliance funds will be spent, will be determined pursuant to subsequent agreement between Reclamation and the applicant. The amount of funding required for Reclamation to conduct any environ mental compliance activities, including Reclamation's cost to review environmental compliance documentation, will be withheld from the Federal award amount and placed in an environmental compliance account to cover such costs. If any portion of the funds budgeted for environmental compliance is not required for compliance activities, such funds may be reallocated to the project, if appropriate. Costs associated with environmental and regulatory compliance must be included in the budget. Compliance costs include costs associated with any required documentation of environmental compliance, analyses, permits, or approvals. Applicable Federal environmental laws could include National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA ), Endangered Species Act ( ESA ), National Historic Preservation Act ( NHPA ), Clean Water Act ( CWA ), and other regulations depending on the project. Such costs may include, but are not limited to: The cost incurred by Reclamation to determine the level of environmental compliance required for the project The cost incurred by Reclamation, the recipient, or a consultant to prepare any necessary environmental compliance documents or reports The cost incurred by Reclamation to review any environmental compliance documents prepared by a consultant The cost incurred by the recipient in acquiring any required approvals or permits, or in implementing any required mitigation measures Other Expenses Any other expenses not included in the above categories shall be listed in this category, along with a description of the item and why it is necessary. No profit or fee will be allowed. Indirect Costs Indirect costs are costs incurred by the applicant for a common or joint purpose that benefit more than one activity of the organization and are not readily assignable to the activities specifically benefitted without undue effort. Costs that 22 Section D: Application and Submission Information are normally treated as indirect costs include, but are not limited to, administrative salaries and fringe benefits associated with overall financial and organizational administration; operation and maintenance costs for facilities and equipment; and, payroll and procurement services. If indirect costs will be incurred, identify the proposed rate, cost base, and proposed amount for allowable indirect costs based on the appl icable cost principles for the applicant's organization. It is not acceptable to simply incorporate indirect rates within other direct cost line items. If the applicant has never received a Federal negotiated indirect cost rate, the budget may include a de minimis rate of up to 10 percent of modified total direct costs. For further information on modified total direct costs, refer to 2 CFR \u00a7200.68 available at www.ecfr.gov. If the applicant does not have a federally approved indirect cost rate agreement and is proposing a rate greater than the de minimis 10 percent rate, include the computational basis for the indirect expense pool and corresponding allocation base for the rate. Information on \"Preparing and Submitti ng Indirect Cost Proposals\" is available from the Interior Business Center, Office of Indirect Cost Services at www.doi.gov/ibc/services/finance/indirect- cost-services. If the proposed project is selected for award, the recipient will be required to submit an indirect cost rate proposal with their cognizant agency within 3 months of award. Total Costs Indicate total amount of project costs, including the Federal and non-F ederal cost share amounts. D.2.2.6 . Environmental and Cultural Resources Compliance If the proposed project includes ground- disturbing activities, environmental and cultural resources compliance will be required. To allow Reclamation to assess the probable environmental and cultural resources impacts and costs associated with a proposed research study , proposals that include ground- disturbing activities must included responses to the following list of questions focusing on the NEPA, ESA, and NHPA requirements. Please answer the following questions to the best of your knowledge. If any question is not applicable to the project, please explain why. The application should include the answers to: Will the proposed project impact the surrounding environment (e.g., soil [dust], air, water [quality and quantity], or animal habitat)? Please briefly describe all earth -disturbing work and any work that will affect the air, water, or animal habitat in the project area. Please also explain the impacts of such work on the surrounding environment and any steps that could be taken to minimize the impacts. Are you aware of any species listed or proposed to be listed as a Federal threatened or endangered species, or designated critica l habitat in the project area? If so, would they be affected by any activities associated with the proposed project? 23 Funding Opportunity Announcement No. B OR-DO-19-F009 Are there wetlands or other surface waters inside the project boundaries that potentially fall under CWA jurisdiction as \"Waters of the United States?\" If so, please describe and estimate any impacts the proposed project may have. When was the water delivery system constructed? Will the proposed project result in any modification of , or effects to, individual features of an irrigation system (e.g., headgates, canals, or flumes)? If so, state when those features were constructed and describe the nature and timing of any extensive alterations or modifications to those features completed previously. Are any buildings, structures, or features in t he irrigation district listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places? A cultural resources specialist at your local Reclamation office or the State Historic Preservation Office can assist in answering this question. Are there any known archeological sites in the proposed project area? Will the proposed project have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations? Will the proposed project limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites or result in other impacts on tribal lands? Will the proposed project contribute to the introduction, continued existence, or spread of n oxious weeds or non- native invasive species known to occur in the area? Note, if mitigation is required to lessen environmental impacts, the applicant may, at Reclamation's discretion, be required to report on progress and completion of these commitments. Reclamation will coordinate with the applicant to establish reporting requirements and intervals accordingly. Under no circumstances may an applicant begin any ground -disturbing activities (including grading, clearing, and other preliminary activities) on a project before environmental compliance is complete and Reclamation explicitly authorizes work to proceed. This pertains to all components of the proposed project, including those that are part of the applicant's non- Federal cost share. Reclamation will provide a successful applicant with information once environmental compliance is complete. An applicant that p roceeds before environmental compliance is complete may risk forfeiting Reclamation funding under this FOA. If you have any questions regarding NEPA, ESA, and/or NHPA requirements, please contact yo ur local Title XVI Coordinator.

The application includes an official resolution, adopted by the applicant's board of directors, governing body, or appropriate authorized official (this may be submitted up to 30 days after the application de adline) . The application and funding plan meets or exceeds the minimum non-Federal cost shar e requirements identified in this FOA. Reclamation reserves the right to remove an application from funding consideration if it does not pass all initial s creening criteria listed above. An applicant that has submitted an application that is determined to be ineligible for funding will be notified along with other applicants, or sooner, if possible. E.2.2. Application Review Committee Evaluation Evaluation criteria will comprise the total evaluation weight as stated in the Section E: Application Review Information . Applications will be scored against the evaluation criteria by an Application Review Committee (ARC), made up of experts in relevant disciplines selected from across Reclamation. The ARC will also review the application to ensure that the proposed project meets the description of eligible projects and meets the objective of this FOA. During ARC review, Reclamation may contact applicants to request clarifications to the information provided, if necessary. E.2.3. Red-Flag Review Following the results of the ARC review, Reclamation offices will review the top - ranking applications and will identify any reasons why a proposed project would not be feasible or o therwise advisable, including environmental or cultural resources compliance issues, permitting issues, legal issues, or financial position. Positive or negative past performance by the applicant and any partners in previous working relationships with Reclamation may be considered, including whether the applicant is making significant progress toward the completion of outstanding financial assistance agreements and whether the applicant is in compliance with all reporting requirements associated with previo usly funded projects. 37 Funding Opportunity Announcement No. B OR-DO-19-F009 In addition, during this review, Reclamation will address any specific concerns or questions raised by members of the ARC. E.2.4. Managerial Review Reclamation management will prioritize projects to ensure the total amount of all awards does not exceed available funding levels. Management will also ensure that all projects meet the scope, priorities, requirements, and objectives of this FOA. Management may also prioritize projects to ensure that multiple project types are represented . E.2.5. Pre-Award Clearances and Approvals The following pre- award clearances and approvals must be obtained before an award of funding is made. If the results of all pre- award reviews and clearances are satisfactory, an award of funding will be made once the agreement is finalized. If the results of pre -award reviews and clearances are unsatisfactory, consideration of funding for the project may be withdrawn. E.2.5.1. Environmental Review If the proposed project includes ground- disturbing activities, Reclamation will forward the proposal to the appropriate Reclamation Regional or Area Office for completion of environmental compliance. To the extent possible, environmental compliance will be completed before a financial assistance agreement is signed by the parties. However, in most cases, the award will be made contingent on completion of environmental compliance. The financial assistance agreement will describe how compliance will be carried out and how the costs will be paid. Ground-disturbing activities may not occur until until environmental compliance is complete and a notice to proceed is issued by the awarding Grants Officer. In some circumstances, environmental compliance may be completed by another Federal agency. If this occurs or if there is an existing environmental compliance document, the environmental compliance document will need to be reviewed and adopted by Reclamation and a notice to proceed must be issued by the awarding Grants Officer before ground-disturbing activities can begin. Note: Any construction costs incurred prior to the completion of environmental and cultural compliance are not eligible for reimbursement and cannot be used to meet the non -Federal cost share requirement. E.2.5.2. Budget Analysis and Business Evaluation A Reclamation Grants Officer will also conduct a detailed budget analysis and complete a business evaluation and responsibility determination. During this evaluation, the Grants Officer will consider several factors that are important, but not quantified, suc h as: Allowability, allocability, and reasonableness of proposed costs 38 Section E: Application Review Information Financial strength and stability of the applicant Past performance, including satisfactory compliance with all terms and conditions of previous awards, such as environmental compliance issues, reporting requirements, proper procurement of supplies and services, and audit compliance Adequacy of personnel practices, procurement procedures, and accounting policies and procedures, as established by applicable Office ofManagement and Budget circulars E.3. Federal Award Performance Integrity Information System Prior to making an award with a Federal total estimated amount greater than $150,000, Reclamation is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently Federal Award Performance Integrity Information System [FAPIIS]) (see U.S.C. \u00a72313). An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through SAM and comment on any information about itself that a Federal awarding agency previously entered and is currently in the designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM. Reclamation will consider any commen ts by the applicant, in addition to the other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described i n 2 CFR \u00a7200.205 Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants. E.4. Anticipated Announcement and Federal Award Date Reclamation expects to contact potential award recipients and unsuccessful applicants in January 2020 or slightly later if necessary. Within 2 to 4 months after that date, financial assistance agreements will be awarded to applicants that successfully pass all pre -award reviews and clearances. 39 This page is intentionally left blank. Section F: Federal Award Information Section F: Federal Award Administration Information F.1. Federal Award Notices Successful applicants will receive by electronic mail, a notice of selection signed by a Reclamation Grants Officer. This notice is not an authorization to begin performance. F.2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements F.2.1. Environmental and Cultural Resources Compliance All proposed projects that include ground- disturbing activities will require compliance w ith NEPA before any ground-disturbing activity may begin. Compliance with all applicable state, Federal and local environmental, cultural, and paleontological resource protection laws and regulations is also required. These may include, but are not limited to, CWA, ESA, NHPA, consultation with potentially affected tribes, and consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. Reclamation will be the lead Federal agency for NEPA compliance and will be responsible for evaluating technical information and ensuring that natural resources, cultural, and socioeconomic concerns are appropriately addressed. As the lead agency, Reclamation is solely responsible for determining the appropriate level of NEPA compliance. Further, Reclamation is responsible to en sure that findings under NEPA, and consultations, as appropriate, will support Reclamation's decision on whether to fund a project. Environmental and cultural resources compliance costs are considered project costs. These costs will be considered in the ranking of applications. Under no circumstances may an applicant begin an y ground -disturbing activities (e.g., grading, clearing, and other preliminary activities) on a project before environmental and cultural resources compliance is complete and Reclamati on explicitly authorizes work to proceed. This pertains to all components of the proposed project, including those that are part of the applicant's non -Federal cost share. Reclamation will provide a successful applicant with information once such compliance is complete. An applicant that proceeds before environmental and cultural resources compliance is complete may risk forfeiting Reclamation funding under this FOA. 41 Funding Opportunity Announcement No. B OR-DO-19-F009 F.2.2. Approvals and Permits Recipients shall adhere to Federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local laws, regulations, and codes, as applicable, and shall obtain all required approvals and permits. Recipients shall also coordinate and obtain approvals from site owners and operators. F.2.3. Real Property, 2 CFR \u00a7200.311 Real property, equipment, and intangible property, that are acquired or improved with a Federal award must be held in trust by the non- Federal entity as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved (2 CFR \u00a7200.316). Title to real property acquired or improved under a Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the non-Federal entity. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or by the Federal awarding agency, real property will be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the non-Federal entity must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests. When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the non-Federal entity must obtain disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity. As required by 2 CFR \u00a7200.329 Reporting on real property, recipients will be required to submit reports on the status of real property acquired or improved under a financial assistance agreement issued under this FOA. F.2.4. Reclamation Administrative Costs All costs incurred by Reclamation related to the development and administration of any award under this FOA are considered part of the total costs of the project, and the recipient will be required to provide non- Federal cost share for Reclamation's administrative costs. These costs include, but are not limited to, salary, overhead, travel, and other costs directly or indirectly related to the award, as determined by Reclamation. Following the completion of each quarter of the fiscal year, Reclamation will provide the recipient with a statement of Reclamation's costs for the previous quarter. The recipient may request explanations or a review of the costs included in the statement; however, Reclamation's determination as to the validity of the costs will be final. The recipient's required non- Federal cost share for Reclamation's costs will be deducted from payments processed by Reclamation for an y award issued under this FOA. F.3.
