Introduction According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 80% of people around the world use herbal medicine. Studies show that certain herbs effectively treat several health issues, like allergies, premenstrual syndrome, chronic fatigue, cancer, diabetes and many more. India is one of the big resources of medicinal plants and natural products due to its geological diversity. In recent years, various researches have been conducted on medicinal plants and spices worldwide. Plant-derived chemicals have attracted the attention of the scientific community for their various potential positive qualities. Studies have shown that polyphenols are anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory, cardiac and neuroprotective, as well as having anti-cancer properties [ [1](#B1), [2](#B2)]. Some of these natural chemicals have been included in clinical trials due to their inherent biological activity in a variety of disease models [ [3](#B3), [4](#B4)], as they exhibited promising benefits in terms of boosting the anti-proliferative response and reducing the toxicity of conventional treatments. Islamic medicine, often known as Arabic medicine in medical history, is the science of medicine developed during the Islamic Golden Age, which lasted from the ninth to thirteenth centuries. Although the main medical tradition was Greek, it was influenced by Islamic or Prophetic Medicine, as well as folk medicine to a lesser extent. The Holy Quran has provided the knowledge for a variety of crops, including grains, seeds, and fodder, as well as their germination and growth processes in several Surah. Plants are considered a gift from God, and the Quran mentions various plant names such as Date palms, figs, olives, ginger, grapes, miswak, onion, barley, garlic, pomegranates, camphor, Christ's thorns, bottle gourds and other significant therapeutic herbs and plants utilized as food [ [5](#B5), [6](#B6)]. Various medicinal plants and nutraceuticals derived from different natural resources, as well as their products such as polyphenolic components, flavones, flavonoids, and antioxidants, have been found to provide significant protection against a variety of diseases [ [7](#B7)]. Epidemiological observations show that various traditional Islamic medicinal plants have powerful disease inhibiting properties [ [6](#B6), [8](#B8)]. Currently, developing a preventive/therapeutic drug that reduces the particular disease without harming normal cells, is the primary goal of the research performed. For instance, in the case of cancer treatment, some of the methods used by the experts to cure the condition include tumor debulking, chemotherapies, radiotherapies, targeted treatments, immunotherapies, stem cell transplants, and photodynamic therapies [ [9](#B9)]. Around the world, researchers are trying to develop new strategies to eradicate the diseases. The present chapter summarizes the recently reported pharmacologically and therapeutically based medicinal plants and its products mentioned in Islamic scriptures. The chapter also highlights the recent studies of medicinal plants and their natural products based on [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 2. Traditional Islamic medicinal plants and their products 2.1 Dates palm ( Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruits [10](#B10)]. The date palm tree is a part of the family Arecaceae. Date palm is a multifunctional plant that contains fiber, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins and various phytochemicals, which were used traditionally because of having great therapeutic properties [ [11](#B11)]. Therapeutic benefits of Ajwa dates fruits are well documented in Islamic scriptures such as Hadith and other works of Islamic literature. According to Al-Bukhaari (5445) and Muslim (2047), narrated by Sa'd ibn Abi that the Prophet (PBUH) said: \"Whoever eats seven Ajwa dates in the morning, will not be harmed by any poison or witchcraft that day.\" Date palm fruit has been described in traditional and alternative medicine to provide several health benefits including anticholesteremic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective and anticancer effects [ [12](#B12)]. According to prior phytochemical studies, Date pulp fruit contains about 80% reducing sugars, including fructose, glucose, galactose, and maltose, [ hypolipidemic and anti-apoptotic properties [ [15](#B15)]. The bioactive components present dates palm pulp protocatechuic vanillic and cinnamic acid derivatives; o-coumaric [10](#B10), [16](#B16)]. 2.1.1 Utilization of date palm fruit and its products as complementary therapies 2.1.1.1 Cancer The ethyl acetate fraction of [10](#B10)]. In addition, the ethyl acetate fraction of [17](#B17)], ethyl alcohol extract against [19](#B19)] and human breast adenocarcinoma Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells [20](#B20)]. In a previous study, an aqueous extract of [21](#B21)]. [22](#B22)]. 2.1.1.2 Diabetes Low glycemic index (GI) diets have been proven to be effective in the treatment of diabetes. Dates can be classed as a low GI superfood because of their high fructose content, which is sweeter and less diabetogenic than glucose [ [23](#B23)]. [24](#B24)]. A previous study has revealed significant anti-hyperglycemic effects of dates fruits in diabetes management of hyperglycemic Sprague-Dawley rats [ [25](#B25)] and diosmetin glycosides isolated from the epicarp of date fruits have significantly alleviated the biochemical profile of alloxan diabetic male rats [ [26](#B26)]. 2.1.1.3 Antibacterial and antiviral The use of dates is also important for antimicrobial activities. The [15](#B15), [27](#B27)]. 2.1.1.4 Hepatoprotective and antioxidant Date palm fruit has shown the protective effect on dimethoate induced-oxidative stress in rat liver [ [28](#B28)]. Moreover, date palm fruits have shown anti-hyperlipidemic and hepatoprotective effects in hyperlipidemia and fatty liver male albino rats [ [29](#B29)]. 2.1.1.5 Pregnancy and delivery The use of dates is especially important for pregnant and postnatal women. Women who consume dates before and after giving birth might strengthen their uterine muscles by consuming dates [ [20](#B20)]. Consumption of date fruit in the last 4 weeks before labor reduced the need for initiation and augmentative labor and resulted in a better delivery outcome [ [30](#B30)]. Due to their high fiber, iron and trace element contents, as well as their high energy and low GI, date fruits seem to be the ideal superfood for today's health-conscious age. 2.2 Fig ( Ficus carica) fruit One of the largest angiosperm genus, Ficus belonging to the family of Moraceae (Mulberry) are perennial plants comprising of over 800 different species including climbers, trailers, and epiphytes distributed around the tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide [ [31](#B31), [32](#B32)]. [33](#B33)]. Despite, its origins in the Sub-Himalayan regions of the Bengal and Central Indian subcontinents, it has been widely cultivated all around the globe. However, some of the world's major producers of figs for their dry and consumption were US, Turkey and Greece [ [33](#B33)]. Bush/small tree-like appearance with single, alternating and large foliage, deep lobes with three or seven lobes; rough and hairy on the top surface; soft and hairy underneath along with smooth and gray bark. In addition to being cultivated from ancient times, they were found growing in the wild in dry and sunny places with rich and fresh soil, as well as in rocky locations. A reasonably permeable and easy draining soil is ideal for the plant's growth; nevertheless, it can also grow in nutritionally poor soil [ [34](#B34)]. The edible part of [35](#B35), [36](#B36), [37](#B37), [38](#B38)]. They are bad cholesterol-free, low in sodium and an excellent source of minerals (K, Zn, Mg, Fe, N, Ca, and P), dietary fibers, carbohydrates, sugars, vitamins (water-soluble\u2014B1, B2, B3 and C; fat-soluble\u2014A), good cholesterol and essential amino acids. Figs have acquired a considerable amount of folkloric importance and still invite the attention of researchers globally for their pharmaceutical properties to be used as complementary medicine. Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha are the classical medicine systems of Ayurveda that have acknowledged the medicinal benefits of fig [ [39](#B39)]. Therefore, it promises to treat and cure disorders of endocrine (diabetes), ventilatory, cardiovascular, digestive (ulcers and vomiting), urinary, reproductive (menstrual discomfort), and immune systems, as well as infectious diseases of the skin, scabies, and gonorrhea [ [40](#B40)]. Phytochemical analysis results revealed a number of secondary metabolites being isolated from different parts of [41](#B41), [42](#B42)]. Linolenic acid (53.1%) was found to be the most prominent fatty acid present in dried figs followed by linoleic acid (21.1%), palmitic bergapten isolated from the fruit pulp [ [43](#B43)]. However, numerous volatile components in the [Figure 2](#F2)) [ [44](#B44)]. The fruits have emerged as an outstanding complementary medicine that could be used in treating leprosy, nasal hemorrhage, and deficiency disorders as well as are used in various drug preparations [ [45](#B45)]. 2.2.1 Utilization of F. carica fruits and its products as complementary therapies 2.2.1.1 Cardioprotective (hypotensive effect) [46](#B46)]. 2.2.1.2 Cancer Methanolic fruit extract of [47](#B47)]. Virtual screening, molecular docking and dynamics simulation investigations were combined to give a structural insight into the putative binding mechanism of prospective drug-like phytocomponents of [48](#B48)]. and antihyperlipidemic in the aqueous-ethanolic extract of Tunisian [49](#B49)]. 2.2.1.4 Anti-diabetic activity As a promising nutritional intervention for acute postprandial glucose and insulin homeostasis, [50](#B50)]. 2.2.1.5 Antispasmodic and antiplatelet activities In a previous study, it has been found that the fig seems to have a spasmolytic action that might be mediated by activation of the K+-ATP channel, which supports some of its therapeutic uses in hyperactive gastrointestinal illnesses, and its antiplatelet effect [ [51](#B51)]. 2.3 Black cumin ( Nigella sativa) seed [52](#B52), [53](#B53)]. Black seeds and oil have been used in traditional medicine for more than 2000 years, and Hippocrates and Discroides termed it \"the Melanthion\" [ [54](#B54)]. It is an important drug in various traditional system of medicine like Unani and Tibb, Ayurveda and Siddha. Traditionally, [55](#B55)]. In Arabic, [56](#B56)]. Black seeds have quite a rich history of folkloric use as food and medicine in Indian, Arabian, Southeast Asian, and Middle Eastern civilizations, and have traditionally been used to cure asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, and other inflammatory illnesses. Extract prepared from black seed is used for the treatment of indigestion, diarrhea, loss of appetite, amenorrhoea, dropsy, and dysmenorrhoea and useful in the cure of skin eruptions and worms [ [57](#B57)]. Various therapeutic attributes of black seed and its active component thymoquinone have been shown in [58](#B58)], anti-microbial and antioxidant properties [ [60](#B60)]. Black seed has been shown to have anticancer action in blood, breast, colon, pancreatic, liver, lung, fibrosarcoma, prostate, and cervical cancer cell lines, as well as in animal models of lung, kidney, skin, colon, and breast cancer [ [61](#B61)]. Phytochemical investigation of The most important the various active components reported thus far, thymoquinone, which is a major component of essential oil, is the most bioactive chemical and has a variety of therapeutic properties ( [Figure 3](#F3)). 2.3.1 Utilization of black seed and its products as complementary therapies 2.3.1.1 Anticancer activity Thymoquinone, the active compound of the black seed helps to train T cells [63](#B63)]. Thymoquinone induced a higher percentage of growth inhibition and apoptosis in the human osteosarcoma cell line sarcoma osteogenic-2 (SaOS-2) and inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth through suppressing nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and its regulated molecules. Thymoquinone cytotoxicity was also studied in human cervical squamous carcinoma cells (SiHa). Thymoquinone's anticancer effects on breast cancer cells, as well as its potential effect on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-activation pathway, were investigated [ [64](#B64)]. It was discovered that thymoquinone had a strong antiproliferative effect in breast cancer cells, and cytotoxicity was increased when thymoquinone was combined with doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. Migration and invasive properties of MDA-MB-231 cells were also reduced in the presence of thymoquinone. 2.3.1.2 Antimicrobial activity Black cumin is one of the most inspirational medicinal plants, with potent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic properties. Thymoquinone isolated from [65](#B65)]. Different extracts of black cumin and thymoquinone were found to have potent fungicidal activity against dermatophyte strains such as [65](#B65)]. Complete recovery and retroversion of a 46-year-old HIV-positive patient were observed after therapy with 10 mL of black seed twice daily for 6 months, according to a case report done by Onifade et al. [ [66](#B66)]. In a mouse model, [65](#B65)]. 2.3.1.3 Antioxidant activity [67](#B67)]. Collagen-induced arthritis was used to the antioxidant and antiarthritic effects of thymoquinone in [52](#B52)]. After two months of contemporaneous ingestion of [68](#B68)]. 2.3.1.4 Antidiabetic activity The administration of black cumin seed to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for one month resulted in a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose, serum MDA, interleukin-6, and immunoglobulin A, G, and M, as well as a significant increase in endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, Glutathione-S-transferase, and catalase expression. Diabetes-induced elevations in tissue MDA and blood glucose were greatly reduced in rats treated with [69](#B69)]. A placebo was given to 99 diabetic patients in an experimental randomized controlled study, while two treatment groups received oral black seed oil. Black seed oil at 1.5 and 3 mL/day for 20 days resulted in significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin A1c and random blood sugar levels [ [70](#B70)]. 2.3.1.5 Antihypertensive activity According to a nonrandomized controlled trial, 57 patients who were given 2 g daily supplements of black cumin for one year showed a significant reduction in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP, heart rate, TC, of TC/HDL-c, and LDL-c/HDL-c, while serum HDL-c was suggestively raised when compared to baseline values and the control group. It was also used to assess the blood pressure-lowering capability and possible processes of [71](#B71)]. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 3.
