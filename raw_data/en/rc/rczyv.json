The main goals of Naturopathic Medicine are to treat the whole person and determine the cause of whatever issues are at hand. Most Medical Doctors are only able to spend a couple of minutes with each patient, but Naturopathic Doctors spend between 30 minutes to an hour each visit. This enable Naturopathic Doctors to take an in-depth health history (Past medical history, hospitalizations, allergies, sensitivities, family history, medications, supplements, etc..., perform a thorough physical exam, request detailed blood work (and explain it), and to really get to know patients. Naturopathic Medicine is designed to determine what the actual cause of the condition is. If someone goes to a Medical Doctor with headaches, there is a good chance they will be given a medication for headaches, but the cause will not be explored unless dangerous red flags are present. If they were to go a Naturopathic Doctor with headaches, the Naturopath will ask about when it started, triggers, relieving factors, location, etc... to determine what is causing the headache. Common causes for headaches are: tension from stress, food sensitivities, nutrient deficiencies, trigger points, caffeine intake or withdrawal, improper sleeping position, etc... so we strive to determine what the cause is and work with you to eliminate or reduce these contributing factors. A Brief Summary by the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors \"Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care system that combines modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. The naturopathic philosophy is to stimulate the healing power of the body. In order to do this you must identify and treat the underlying cause of disease. Symptoms are seen as warning signals of improper functioning of the body, and unfavourable lifestyle habits. Naturopathic Medicine emphasizes disease as an imbalance rather than as an entity. Treating both acute and chronic conditions, naturopathic treatments are chosen based on the individual patient - their physiological, structural, psychological, social, spiritual, environment and lifestyle factors. In addition to diet and lifestyle changes, natural therapies including botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, naturopathic manipulation and traditional Chinese medicine/acupuncture, may also be used during treatments. In Canada, the naturopathic medical profession's infrastructure includes accredited educational institutions, professional licensing, national standards of practice, participation in many federal health committee initiatives, and a commitment to state-of-the-art scientific research.\" An Ant Analogy Let's say you have a house that is infested with ants. Most medications are similar to just stomping on the ants that you see and replacing the parts of the house that are chewed. This process as we know is redundant, you'll just have to keep coming back to stomp those ants and replace parts. Naturopathic medicine takes the time to stomp every ant, find out why and how they are entering and make sure they can't get in anymore. This process takes much longer but the problem would actually be gone in the end.
