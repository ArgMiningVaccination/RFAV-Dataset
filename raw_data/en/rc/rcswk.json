Our goal is to create a positive, healthy environment for our patients to receive the highest-quality of care. Our providers and staff take the time to listen and build meaningful and long-lasting relationships with our patients.

We want to be an encouragement to each patient in their personal health journey. Your health is important to us and we are here to care for each individual like family. Our Services Regenerative Health & Wellness Medical Center offers medical services to help our patients regain their health and live their best quality of life. We use functional medicine to find the root cause of disease so patients can have lasting results. We contract directly with patients, rather than insurance so that we are able to lower costs of care and pass those savings on to you. This allows us to slow down, take more time to listen, remove distractions and focus on each of your medical needs. Our Services What to Expect When visiting any place for the first time, it is nice to know what to expect. We strive to make your appointments easy and enjoyable while offering a welcoming and comfortable environment for us to address your needs. Your fist appointment will be a consultation with a provider. After you have booked your appointment, we encourage you to fill out the necessary paperwork online prior to your first visit. This will save 15 to 20 minutes of your wait time in the office. If this is not an option, we understand. Please plan accordingly to save time for this prior to meeting with your provider. TESTIMONIALS I have been going here for over 5yrs. In that time the turn over has been a little more than normal, but I'm so happy and relieved with the staff there now. They implement systems and give you exceptional service with a smile. Taylor, Kiera, Lexi and Jane are SOOOOO amazing at what they do!! I get my blood drawn, hormones/testosterone, IV therapy and weight loss assistance all there and have no plans on changing. This team always goes above and beyond. Stephanie H. Got the most extensive lab test and review I have ever had. Kiera took so much time explaining what each number meant, where it was supposed to be and how that affected me. Ive been on the meds prescribed to me for about a month and I've lost 15 pounds and have so much more energy than I did. Ally I've been going here for a number of years. All of the staff are friendly, personable and helpful. Scheduling is timely and convenient. Office offers many services to help people get and stay healthy using a comprehensive and wholistic approach. Shannon D. Absolutely love this clinic and the staff. From hormone balance, to the Meyers IV that gave me a boost of energy that I desperately needed to amazing lips, I can't thank them enough for their expertise and customer service. Can't wait to go back next month! Janey C. Amazing experience! The staff was so friendly and professional. They answered all my questions, and made me feel comfortable. Love being able to come here and for fillers and Botox. I will absolutely be coming back. "}
