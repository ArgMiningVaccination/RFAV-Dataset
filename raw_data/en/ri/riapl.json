This is partly because of its minimal dependency on medicines and more reliability on ancient treatments like Ayurveda, Yogic Kriyas, Proper Diet and other ancient treatments like Acupuncture and Acupressure too. While the former treatments are known almost to everyone, the later ones may sound new to many ears. In this article, we aim to present a brief introduction to Acupuncture and elucidate how it helps to diminish back pain and knee pain, and usher in good sleep and great health\u2014 - Like Yoga and Ayurveda, Acupuncture is also an ancient method of treatment. It is a traditional old healing procedure as exemplified in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is a self healing procedure whereby needles are inserted around the painful area into the skin. However, if you are skeptical about its safety, then you would be happy to know that in 1997, The United States National Institute of Health certified acupuncture as 100% safe and efficient method of treating numerous diseases and conditions. - Although fine and sterile needles are mostly used to stimulate the acupoints, in extreme cases, electrical, heat or pressure stimulation are also used. - According to ancient Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are the two forces that govern and describe the universe. It is the perfect balance of these two forces in the body that produces energy, known as qi in Chinese. Acupuncture, it is believed, releases the energy, when blocked, and evokes the natural healing process of the body. - According to modern medicinal science, acupuncture has positive effects on nervous, cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine and immune systems of the body. And, it is by stimulating these systems of the body, and the Central Nervous System in particular, that acupuncture resolves pain and the digestive function of the body and improves sleep as well. - The best part of Acupuncture is that it, through its pain stimulating method of treatment, helps in curing many chronic ailments including neck pain, knee pain, low-back pain along with migraine and tension headaches too. No doubt it is a cost-effective mode of treatment, but you should always seek for professional help. Another good thing about Acupuncture is that it is an effective treatment for all age groups\u2014be it a young professional with bouts of tension, headache or a 75 years old uncle with severe knee pain or osteoarthritis.
