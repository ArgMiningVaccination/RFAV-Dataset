COVID-19 Notice During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the University is issuing guidance and updates on the MCPHS University COVID-19 Information webpage: https://www.mcphs.edu/covid (the \"COVID-19 Guidance\"), which MCPHS University students, faculty, and staff are expected to consult regularly and comply with as applicable. In the event the COVID-19 Guidance conflicts with anything contained in this Catalog, the COVID-19 Guidance shall govern. 3 May 17, 2021 Annual Notification of Student Rights under FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, affords students certain rights with respect to their own education records. These rights include the following: 1. The right to inspect and review student education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the Office of the Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The registrar will make arrangements for access within 45 days from the date of such request, and will notify the students of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The University reserves the right to deny a copy of a student education record (including, without limitation, a transcript) for which a financial hold exists (a hold is imposed if the student fails to pay bills, fees, or fines owed to the University). A hold will not interfere with the right to visually examine student education records. Questions about the University's policies and practices relating to the Act should be addressed to the Office of the Registrar. 2. The right to request an amendment of student education records that students believe are inaccurate or misleading. Students should write the University registrar, clearly identify the part of the records they want changed, and specify why the records are inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the records as requested, it will notify the students of the decision and advise the students of their right to a hearing. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the students when they are notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in student education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to appropriate parties in connection with a health or safety emergency. Another exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review a student education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the University may disclose student education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll if the disclosure is for purposes related to the student's enrollment or transfer. Education records may be compelled and disclosed without consent by, or notice to, the student pursuant to a valid subpoena issued under the USA Patriot Act. Finally, personally identifiable \"directory information\" may be released freely unless the student files the appropriate form requesting that such information not be released. This form is available at the Office of the Registrar. Directory information includes the following: Name Gender Student ID Local address Permanent address University email address Major and minor field(s) of study, including the division or program in which a student is enrolled Classification as a freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate, or by number referring to such classes Course load\u2014full time or part time Participation in officially recognized activities Dates of attendance and graduation, and degrees received Most recent previous educational institution attended Honors and awards received, including selection to a dean's list or an honorary organization New England School of Acupuncture Clinical Internship Schedule 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5920 4 May 17, 2021 Clinical Rotations and Background Screenings For some MCPHS programs, placement in clinical rotations at healthcare providers is a required part of the MCPHS curriculum. Some healthcare providers require background screenings, and a conviction for a criminal offense might present an issue. It is possible that certain types of criminal convictions, whether prior to being a student at MCPHS or while attending MCPHS, could preclude a student from being able to complete a required clinical rotation. For additional information, please contact the MCPHS Office of Legal Affairs. MCPHS University Complaint Procedure Regarding University Licensure Requirements; Violation of State Law, etc. United States Department of Education Regulation 34 CFR 600.9, the \"Program Integrity Rule,\" was adopted to ensure that students have the opportunity to voice concerns through a state governmental process relating to programs offered by postsecondary educational institutions authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, as amended. The regulations require states to have a process to review and appropriately act on complaints about the University such as violation of (i) the University's licensure requirements, or (ii) state laws; and allegations of state consumer protection violations, including, but not limited to fraud and false advertising, among other things.

Commission of Higher Education MCPHS University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (formerly the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc.). Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the Commission indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied though a peer review process. An accredited college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Commission is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding the accreditation status by the Commission should be directed to the Office of the Provost at 617.732.2854.

However, requirements for licensure and eligibility for professional examinations vary by state and are subject to change. Accordingly, MCPHS recommends that students contact the licensing board in the state in which they intend to practice to determine the requirements for licensure in that state. Residency Course and program availability varies by state. Admission into a program is dependent on program availability in the state where the student is physically located at the time of admission. If a student moves to a different state after admission to the program, continuation within the program will depend on the availability of the program within the new state where the student is physically present. It is the student's responsibility to notify the college of a change in physical presence. 37 May 17, 2021 Student Services Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) The goal of the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on all three campuses, is to assist students in maximizing their potential to be more efficient, effective, and independent learners. The CASE seeks to develop the whole student by enhancing integrity, professionalism, and self-responsibility. Students who are willing to make a commitment to their academic success and are serious about pursuing their educational and professional goals will learn how academic support outside the classroom contributes to that success. These University resources are designed to provide students with the tools that they will need to succeed in their academic programs and that they can ultimately use to enhance their professional careers. Services are described below, and more information is available on the MCPHS website. The CASE Boston offers several key services to assist students with exploring majors, minors and careers, managing course registration each semester, and acquiring new learning and study strategies. At the CASE Boston, students can interact regularly with their major-specific MAC Team, which consists of a Faculty Mentor (M) and an Academic Coach (AC). Faculty Mentoring (CASE Boston) The Faculty Mentor program on the Boston campus was created to provide additional support for our students in the areas of career discernment, long-term course planning and goal-setting. Faculty Mentors are full-time faculty members who have weekly office hours within the CASE. The Mentors represent each major at MCPHS University and students are paired with a Faculty Mentor within their own major. The Mentors work in conjunction with the Academic Coaches to make up MAC teams, which work together to provide more well-rounded guidance and support for our students. Academic Coach (CASE Boston) Academic Coaches are committed to shaping a dynamic advising environment designed to meet the educational and developmental needs of the student body. The professional staff who work in the center are available to assist students with goal setting, course registration, referral to campus resources, and other services designed to contribute to their academic experience. They provide focused advising for each degree program by helping students understand their specific program requirements and policies. The CASE Worcester and Manchester works in collaboration with faculty and deans to provide students with the tools they need to succeed in the accelerated professional programs. Academic counselors on both campuses hold workshops on study skills, time management, test-taking strategies, academic reading, and critical thinking to help students maximize their performance. All students are encouraged to meet with an academic counselor with any questions concerning the curriculum or if they are looking for academic assistance with their coursework. Writing support is also available.

Early Alert and Mid-semester Warnings At multiple points during each semester, faculty members submit academic warnings via WebAdvisor, which are processed by the CASE on each campus. Students who receive academic warnings will be notified by their academic departments/programs by email to their official MCPHS emails and provided additional instructions. Boston: Each student placed on academic warning will be encouraged to attend academic skill-building workshops and to meet with their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. These actions may be required of students who receive more than one academic warning (as stipulated in a letter from their school dean). Worcester/Manchester: Each student placed on academic warning will be required (as stipulated in their notification letter) to meet with an Academic Counselor in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Worcester/Manchester) and meet with a faculty advisor. Pharmacy Learning Groups (Worcester and Manchester) Worcester and Manchester pharmacy students are organized into assigned learning groups, which are designed to enhance learning and group support. Each learning group consists of students who remain together as a unit throughout the curriculum, and each group is assigned a faculty member as an academic mentor. Peer Mentors are assigned to learning groups to further facilitate peer support. Center for Professional Career Development The Center for Professional Career Development provides all students with individualized advising, industry-specific information and resources, development of job search skills, and the opportunity for hands-on professional experiences to support personal goals and career success. Through workshops, job fairs, alumni and community networking, and employer partnerships, students have access to a range of programs to meet their needs and their schedules. The center works in collaboration with academic departments, student services, student organizations, and professional associations to ensure quality engagements and timely information.

The University makes available a general health insurance program that meets these standards. This policy is provided by an independent carrier beginning September 1 and continuing for 12 months. University student health insurance information is located on the MCPHS website under Student Health. Students will be automatically enrolled in this plan unless a waiver is completed and received by Student Financial Services prior to the first day of classes. Students registering late must submit the waiver at that time. The waiver stipulates that personal coverage will be maintained during the enrollment period. If Student Financial Services does not receive the waiver prior to the first day of classes, the student will be billed for the insurance premium and will remain responsible for payment of said premium. The waiver must be renewed annually. All international students will be enrolled in the University student health insurance plan automatically, with the exception of those international students whose sponsoring institutions have a signed agreement with MCPHS that complies with the University's health insurance waiver requirements, or international students with a plan for which the insurer's primary home office is based in the United States and the policy provides comparable coverage to the University student health insurance plan. International students who do not fall under one of the two conditions above must purchase the University student health insurance plan. Financial Responsibility of Students Following an Injury, Accident, Exposure, or Needle Stick Students are responsible for all costs and expenses resulting from any injuries, accidents, exposures, including exposure to communicable diseases (such as COVID-19), or needle sticks in which they are involved on campus or during any clinical rotation. When seeking treatment for any such injury, accident, exposure, including exposure to communicable diseases (such as COVID-19), or needle stick, a student must present their own health insurance information to the healthcare provider. Any deductible or copayment is the student's responsibility. All students must follow the claims procedures required by their respective insurance companies. Students are not eligible for workers' compensation benefits from MCPHS University or any affiliated teaching hospital or clinical site to which they are assigned while completing their clinical requirements, unless required by applicable state law, because students are not employees of either the University or such clinical facilities. Health Services For routine healthcare while on the Boston campus, MCPHS students utilize the Massachusetts College of Art and Design/Optum Student Health Services located on the second floor of 578 Huntington Avenue, in the Treehouse residence hall.

WAIVERS/EXEMPTIONS All MCPHS students who are under the age of 22 on the first day of the first semester of admission to the University must provide proof of receipt of the meningococcal vaccine, unless they qualify for one of the exemptions allowed by the law. Students under the age of 22 may begin classes without a certificate of immunization against meningococcal disease if: 1) the student has a letter from a physician stating that there is a medical reason why he/she can't receive the vaccine; 2) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) presents a statement in writing that such vaccination is against his/ her sincere religious belief; or 3) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) signs a waiver stating that the student has received information about the dangers of meningococcal disease, reviewed the information provided and elected to decline the vaccine. If a student has a medical reason why he/she cannot receive a specific immunization, such immunization may be waived if the student submits a letter (on official letterhead with a signature) from the student's health care provider explaining the reason/s the student is unable to receive the required vaccination/s. Medical exemptions must be renewed annually, at the start of each school year. Immunizations may be waived for religious reasons if a student submits a statement in writing that such immunization is against a sincere religious belief. Requirements for clinical rotations are set by clinical sites and MCPHS does not have the authority to override these requirements. Medical and religious exemptions may be accepted at the discretion of clinical sites. Please contact your Clinical Coordinator for your academic program to discuss how waivers may affect your clinical rotation requirements. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Certain health care agencies and clinical training and service learning sites may have additional immunization requirements. In order to be eligible for clinical placements or service learning experiences, students must meet all University immunization requirements and any additional site requirements. In cases where the site does not pay for the completion of additional immunization requirements, the student is responsible for paying any associated fees, if it is not covered by their personal health insurance. Without clearance with respect to all University and site immunization requirements, students will not be permitted to begin clinical or service learning placements, and therefore, would be unable to meet program requirements. Students who change academic programs must become compliant with all immunization requirements of their new academic program. Students must contact their Program Director/Clinical Coordinator for necessary steps to review their immunization compliance with the new academic program. MCPHS works with a confidential health information service company that maintains and processes all student immunization records and monitors compliance with state law immunization requirements. Authorized officials at MCPHS have access to student immunization records to monitor compliance. (October 2020) Internships, Licensure, and Certification Students graduating from the Acupuncture, Dental Hygiene, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Optometry, Pharmacy, Physical Therapy, and Physician Assistant programs at MCPHS University will seek professional licensure in conjunction with a national examination in order to practice in their chosen profession. Regulations governing licensure (and 47 May 17, 2021 internship) differ from state to state and country to country. The Registrar's Office completes application materials for licensure candidates and assists students in navigating the overall licensing process. Licensure application preparation sessions are offered for students prior to graduation. Licensure application materials for all programs will not be released by the Registrar's Office until the degree and date awarded have been posted to student records. Only materials with a submission deadline required for specific state board testing will be released prior to degree posting. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program will take part in practical experience overseen by a registered pharmacist. National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidelines require that pharmacy students complete 1,500 clock hours of practical pharmacy experience prior to applying for licensure. Students completing their practical experience must register as a pharmacy intern (as applicable) with the state in which they complete their internship experience. Internship hours must be documented as specified on the internship application form or state board of pharmacy website. As with licensure, intern eligibility criteria and paperwork differ from state to state. Mandatory intern preparation sessions are scheduled for students before they can apply for internship. Further information regarding the licensure and internship process can be found on the Registrar's Office page of the University website.

POLICY STATEMENT MCPHS University (\"MCPHS\" or the \"University\") is committed to maintaining a positive living, learning, and working environment that is free from all forms of Sexual Harassment, which is a form of sex discrimination. The University does not discriminate based on sex, in admission and access to, and treatment and employment in, its education program or activity or while a person is attempting to participate in an education program or activity. For discrimination and harassment that is not of a sexual nature, please refer to the University's Protection from Discrimination and Harassment Policy. The University actively complies with the requirements of Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and pertinent laws, regulations, and executive directives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and other applicable state and federal statutes. This Policy defines prohibited sexual misconduct and identifies the procedures that will be utilized to investigate and adjudicate possible violations of this policy. This policy does not preclude application or enforcement of other University policies. Individuals who violate this Policy are subject to discipline and corrective action, up to and including termination or expulsion. The University will not tolerate sexual harassment in any form or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. The University recognizes that discrimination and harassment related to a person's sex can occur in connection with misconduct related to a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, disability, or other protected classes. Targeting a person based on these characteristics is also a violation of state and federal law and the University's Protection from Discrimination and Harassment Policy. As appropriate, the University will endeavor to coordinate the investigation and resolution of sexual harassment complaints with the investigation and resolution of complaints of discrimination or harassment based on other protected classes. There is a presumption that the Respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process. There is a presumption of innocence throughout the grievance process, with the burden on the university to gather information and to prove that the conduct violated the policy. Inquiries regarding the University's compliance with Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action laws should be directed to Richard J. Lessard, President, at 617.732.2132. II. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS Obligations to Report Sexual Harassment. In order to take appropriate corrective action, the university must be aware of sexual harassment, and related retaliation that occurs in university employment, educational programs, and activities. The following individuals have a duty to report whenever they witness, receive notification of, or otherwise have knowledge of an incident of discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation that occurred in the course of University employment, educational programs, or activities. All University Officers; All Deans, Department Chairs, and Program Directors; The Title IX Coordinator; All employees with supervisory authority; All employees in Human Resources; and All employees in Public Safety. Where to Report. Anyone who believes that they experienced, witnessed, or otherwise have knowledge of sexual harassment shall immediately report such behavior to the: Title IX Coordinator or; Human Resources (for employees); or Senior Student Affairs Officer-Dean of Students (for students). 50 May 17, 2021 An individual may choose to report sexual harassment to a faculty or staff member. All employees with supervisory authority have a duty to report potential Title IX violations and every employee is encouraged to report and inform the reporting individual that: You are not a confidential source; and You will report their concerns to the Title IX Coordinator. Dawn M. Ballou, Title IX Coordinator 179 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115 617.732.2077 - office 857.337.4117 - cell Dawn.Ballou@mcphs.edu When to Report. All reports or complaints shall be made as promptly as possible after the occurrence. For students, while they should expect that faculty and staff would inform the Title IX Coordinator, students are strongly encouraged to contact the Title IX Coordinator or the Dean of Students directly. Failure to Report is a Violation. A failure to report this information by a mandated reporter is a violation of this policy, except in the case of an individual whose profession and university responsibilities requires them to keep certain communications confidential (e.g., a professional counselor). Such an individual is not required to report confidential communications received while performing those university responsibilities. Right to File Criminal Complaint. A complainant has the right to file a criminal complaint before, during or after the university's Title IX investigation. Amnesty Policy. The university encourages the reporting of all concerns regarding sexual harassment. Sometimes individuals are hesitant to report instances of sexual harassment because they fear being charged with other policy violations. Because the university has a paramount interest in protecting the well-being of its community and remedying sexual harassment, other policy violations will be considered, if necessary, separately from allegations under this policy. Zero-Tolerance for Retaliation. The university will not tolerate retaliation by any employee or student. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy, as well as of federal, state, and local law. Anyone who believes he or she is a victim of retaliation should report the matter immediately according to the same procedure provided in this policy for making complaints of discrimination, harassment, or sexual assault. III. PROHIBITED CONDUCT Sexual Harassment as defined by Title IX. Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectionably offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school's education program or activity; or an employee of the school conditioning the provision of aid, benefit, or service of the school's on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct (quid pro quo); or sexual assault (as defined by the Clery Act), dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking (as defined by the Violence Against Women the Act (VAWA)).

EVALUATION OF THE COMPLAINT Upon notification of a potential Title IX violation, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly contact the complainant to discuss supportive measures; to consider the complainant's wishes with respect to supportive measures; to inform the complainant of availability of these measures with or without the filing of a formal complaint; and to explain the grievance process and the procedure for filing a formal complaint. Emergency Removal of a student-respondent may still be appropriate, provided the university does an individualized safety and risk analysis; determines there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of students or employees that justifies removal; and, provides notice and an opportunity for the respondent to challenge the decision immediately following removal. Non-student employees may be placed on administrative leaves during investigations. The complainant or Title IX Coordinator files a document alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the university investigate the allegation of sexual harassment, known as a \"formal complaint.\" A complainant may only file a formal Title IX complaint under this policy if the complainant is participating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the university. 53 May 17, 2021 When a formal complaint is filed, the Title IX Coordinator or designee must evaluate the complaint to determine whether the allegations may be investigated and adjudicated under the Title IX Grievance Process or if they should be referred to another university officer for appropriate action, such as investigation and adjudication under the Discrimination and Harassment Investigation Procedures. 1. Mandatory Dismissal. If the conduct alleged in the formal complaint, even if proven, would not constitute sexual harassment as defined by Title IX, or did not occur in the university's education program or activity, or did not occur against a person in the United States, then the Title IX Coordinator must dismiss the formal complaint from the Title IX Grievance Process. Such dismissal does not preclude action under another policy or provision of the university's code of conduct. Upon dismissal, the Title IX Coordinator must promptly send written notice of the dismissal and reason for the dismissal simultaneously to the parties. Both parties will have a right to appeal the dismissal from the Title IX Grievance Process pursuant to the appeal procedures described below. In circumstances in which the conduct alleged in the dismissed Title IX complaint could constitute sexual harassment not covered by Title IX, sexual exploitation, or a violation of another university policy, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the allegations to the appropriate university officer(s) for consideration. Dismissed allegations of sexual harassment not covered by Title IX and sexual exploitation will be investigated under the Protection from Discrimination and Harassment Policy. Dismissed allegations of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking will be investigated in accordance with the Title IX investigation process set forth in Section VI.B. below prior to referral for adjudication through the student Code of Conduct process when the respondent is a student or through the Employee Handbook or the Faculty Manual when the respondent is an employee. 2. Discretionary Dismissal. The Title IX Coordinator may dismiss the formal complaint from the Title IX Grievance Process, if at any time during the investigation or hearing: the complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant wishes to withdraw the formal complaint; the respondent is no longer enrolled or employed by the university; or circumstances prevent the gathering of evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding responsibility. Both parties will have a right to appeal the dismissal pursuant to the appeal procedures described below. VI. THE TITLE IX GRIEVANCE PROCESS The complainant and respondent are treated equitably while addressing allegations of sexual harassment. Equitable remedies should include supportive measures for the parties that are non-disciplinary, non-punitive in nature and designed to restore or preserve equal access to education programs and activities while addressing the allegations through a fair and unbiased grievance process. A. THE COMPLAINT The university has actual knowledge of a potential Title IX violation when notification is given to the Title IX Coordinator or any official who has the authority to institute corrective measures. Upon notification of a potential Title IX violation, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly contact the complainant to discuss supportive measures; to consider the complainants wishes with respect to supportive measures; to inform the complainant of availability of these measures with or without the filing of a formal complaint; and to explain the grievance process and the procedure for filing a formal complaint. Emergency Removal of a student-respondent may still be appropriate, provided the university does an individualized safety and risk analysis; determines there is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of students or employees that justifies removal; and, provides notice and an opportunity for the respondent to challenge the decision immediately following removal. Non-student employees may be placed on administrative leaves during investigations. The complainant or Title IX Coordinator file a document alleging sexual harassment against a respondent and requesting that the university investigate the allegation of sexual harassment, known as a \"formal complaint.\" A complainant may only file a formal Title IX complaint under this policy if the complainant is participating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the university. The university treats the complainant and respondent equitably throughout the grievance process. All university officials involved in the grievance process must not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against either party. The respondent is presumed not to be responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process. The parties are advised as to the range of possible disciplinary sanctions and remedies that the university may implement following any determination of responsibility. The university will determine 54 May 17, 2021 responsibility based on the evidentiary standard of Preponderance of the Evidence and both parties are permitted to appeal the final decision. The university will provide for an informal resolution process such as mediation after the filing of a formal complaint. Informal resolution does not involve a full investigation and adjudication. The informal resolution process may begin at any time prior to a determination regarding responsibility. The university must provide the parties with the written notice as to the allegations and the requirements of the informal resolution process. The parties must voluntarily agree and provide written consent to the Informal resolution process. The parties have the right to withdraw from the informal process and participate in the formal grievance process any time prior to a determination regarding responsibility. Informal resolution is not permitted in cases of harassment of a student by an employee. B. TITLE IX INVESTIGATION 1. Initiating the investigation. Upon receipt of a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator will provide written notice to the parties of the allegations of sexual harassment, including sufficient details known at the time of filing and allowing sufficient time to prepare a response before the initial interview. The details include the identity of the parties, the alleged conduct constituting sexual harassment, the date and location of the alleged conduct. The written notice must contain a statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process. The notice must inform the parties that they may have an advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. The notice must inform the parties of the section of the Student Code of Conduct that prohibits knowingly making false statements or knowingly submitting false information during the grievance process. 2. Time frame. The university will endeavor to complete its investigation in sixty (60) days. However, there may be reasonable delays or extensions as circumstances arise. 3. Standard of Proof. The \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard shall be applied to sexual harassment complaints. This standard requires a finding that it is more likely than not that sexual harassment occurred in order to assign responsibility to the respondent. 4. Gathering information. The university will conduct prompt and thorough interviews of the complainant, the respondent, and any witnesses. Both parties will have an opportunity to suggest witnesses. The investigator will interview the suggested witnesses unless the investigator determines that the information that the party claims the witness will share is not relevant. The burden of gathering both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence and proof sufficient to reach a determination of responsibility is on the university. The university will not restrict the ability of either party to discuss the allegations under investigation or gather and present relevant evidence. The parties are both allowed to have their advisor of choice present during any grievance proceeding. The university may restrict the extent to which the advisor may participate in the proceedings as long as the restrictions apply equally to both parties. Written notice of the date, time, location, participants, and purpose of all hearings, interviews or meetings must be provided to a party whose participation is invited or expected with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate. An investigative report will be generated at the end of the investigation. Prior to completion of the investigative report, the Title IX Coordinator will send each party and their advisors any evidence gathered that is directly related to the allegations for their inspection and review with ten (10) days-notice to submit a written response, prior to completion of the final investigative report. The final investigative report is sent to the parties and their advisors ten (10) days prior to the live hearing. Once the Title IX Coordinator is satisfied that the investigation is completed, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant and the respondent as to the live hearing. C. Live Hearing The parties (through their advisors) may make opening statements and the decision makers may question the parties and their witnesses prior to and after any cross-examination. 1. Cross-examination. The decision makers preside over the live hearing, permit each party's advisor to ask the other party, and witnesses all relevant questions. The cross-examination must be conducted directly, orally, and in real time by the advisor and not the party. Either party can request that the live hearing occur virtually with the parties in separate rooms. The technology is to allow the decision makers and parties to simultaneously see and hear the cross-examination of the party or witness. Only relevant questions will be answered. The decision makers make a determination as to relevancy after the question is asked and before 55 May 17, 2021 the answer given. The university must provide an advisor, without fee, to a party who does not have an advisor present for the live hearing. Parties or witnesses who do not submit to cross-examination will preclude the decision makers from relying on their statements in determining responsibility. 2. Recording or Transcript. The university must create an audiovisual recording or transcript of the live hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review. 3. Determination Regarding Responsibility. The decision makers must issue a written determination regarding responsibility simultaneously to the parties using the preponderance of the evidence standard. The written statement must include the allegations constituting sexual harassment, describe the procedural steps taken, the findings of fact supporting the determination, conclusions regarding the application of this Policy and a statement the findings and the rationale, as well as the procedures and basis for appeal. D. Appeal. Both respondent and complainant may appeal a determination regarding responsibility and from a dismissal of a formal complaint based on: (1) procedural irregularity that affected the outcome; (2) new evidence not previously available that could affect the outcome; and (3) bias or conflict of interest on the part of a Title IX official that affected the outcome. The university must maintain records for seven years of all sexual harassment investigations, appeals, informal resolutions, all materials used to train Title IX officials and make such materials available on its website, hearing recordings and transcripts, records of any actions, including supportive measures, taken in response to reports or formal complaint of sexual harassment. V. COMPLAINTS INVOLVING TWO OR MORE MCPHS UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES The Title IX Coordinator has oversight for all Title IX cases. When an alleged violation of this policy involves more than one MCPHS University campus, individuals approved by the Title IX Coordinator at the campus with disciplinary authority over the respondent may handle the complaint. VI. COMPLAINTS BY AND AGAINST UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS ARISING IN AN AFFILIATED ENTITY University employees and students sometimes work or study at the worksite or program of another organization affiliated with MCPHS. When a violation of this policy is alleged by or against University employees or students in those circumstances, the complaint should immediately be directed to the Title IX Coordinator. The University will follow the designated protocol for all Title IX allegations. VII. NO LIMITATION ON EXISTING AUTHORITY No provision of this policy shall be construed as a limitation on the authority of an appointing or disciplinary authority under applicable policies and procedures to initiate appropriate action. If a Title IX investigation is conducted under this policy and no policy violation is found, that finding does not prevent discipline of the respondent for inappropriate or unprofessional conduct under other applicable policies and procedures. VIII. ANNUAL REPORT For the purposes of the Clery Report, the Office of Public Safety shall maintain an annual report documenting: (1) the number of reports or complaints received pursuant to this policy; (2) the categories of those involved in the allegations; (3) the number of policy violations found; and (4) examples of sanctions imposed for policy violations. The annual report does not contain any personally identifying information regarding the complainant or the respondent. IX. EDUCATION The University will broadly disseminate this policy, distribute a list of resources available to respond to concerns of Protected Class discrimination, harassment, and related retaliation and develop and present appropriate educational programs for students and employees. 56 May 17, 2021 X.

A complainant has the right to file a criminal complaint before, during or after the University's investigation. 58 May 17, 2021 Amnesty Policy. The University encourages the reporting of all concerns regarding Discrimination and Harassment. Sometimes individuals are hesitant to report instances of Discrimination or Harassment because they fear being charged with other policy violations. Because the University has a paramount interest in protecting the well-being of its community and remedying Discrimination and Harassment, other policy violations will be considered, if necessary, separately from allegations under the Policy. Confidentiality. The University will maintain the privacy of the complaint, and the privacy of the persons involved, to the greatest extent possible, consistent with its goal of conducting a thorough and complete investigation and to the extent permitted by law. It is important to understand that while the University will treat information it has received with appropriate sensitivity, nonetheless there may be a need to share certain information within the University for the purposes of investigating, stopping, or preventing Discrimination and Harassment. Zero-Tolerance for Retaliation. The University will not tolerate retaliation against any employee or student based upon such individual's filing of a complaint of discrimination or harassment or participation in the investigation or adjudication of such a complaint. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy, as well as of federal, state, and local law.

The diploma awarded and the date of the award must be clearly indicated on the final transcript. Standardized Tests Standardized testing, such as the SAT and ACT, is optional for all freshmen and transfer students applying to MCPHS University. Candidates for whom English is not the primary spoken language are required to take the TOEFL, iTEP, IELTS, PTE, or the English Proficiency exam offered on campus. This test requirement may be waived on an individual basis for applicants who have attended all four years of high school in the United States (exclusive of ESL courses), who have scored 480 or higher on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT, or who have scored 21 or higher on the English section of the ACT. (Please refer to the International Applicants section.)

Advanced Course Credit Freshmen may be awarded a limited amount of MCPHS course equivalency credit in transfer for Advanced Placement (AP) courses, International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, and/or college coursework taken during high school. Credit for science course equivalency will not be awarded. The minimum score on an AP test for credit consideration is a 4 or a 5. The minimum score on an HL (high-level) IB exam for credit consideration is 5. Dual Credit Programs Courses taken for college credit while a student is enrolled in high school will receive transfer credit only if the course was administered in a college setting. A grade of C+ or higher is required. Courses taken in a high school that are taught by teachers who have been certified to offer college-level courses will not receive transfer credit. Delayed Enrollment for Accepted Students Students who are accepted for admission may request approval of delayed enrollment (deferral) for one full academic year due to military enlistment or student medical reasons. To do so, they must submit a written request to the Admission Office and provide documentation for military enlistment or student medical reasons and promise, in writing, that they will not attend any other college or university during the deferral period. MCPHS reserves the right to deny requests for deferral. The candidate must submit a nonrefundable enrollment deposit before requesting a deferral. This deposit will reserve a place in the class starting in the fall of the following academic year. If the student enrolls at that time, the deposit will be credited in full toward the first-semester tuition. Students are canceled from the accepted applicant pool if they are denied deferral and choose not to enroll at the University in the fall for which they were admitted or they defer but do not enroll in the fall of the academic year following the deferral period. Students who are canceled from the accepted applicant pool must forfeit their accepted student status and full amount of the corresponding enrollment deposit (deposit is forfeited after May 1 of the freshman applicant's senior year).. Transfer Admission Candidates who are accepted as transfer students may receive a limited number of course credits in transfer. Please refer to Residency Requirement in the section Academic Policies and Procedures. Transfer credit is not awarded for life experience or work experience. Transfer credit can be achieved through coursework taken prior to enrollment at other regionally accredited colleges and universities, successful passing of Advanced Placement (AP) and/or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations (see below), and successful passing of International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations. Policies that determine the amount of transfer credit awarded and that identify courses accepted in transfer vary among programs. Candidates interested in transfer credit should contact the Admission Office about their particular program of interest. Transfer credit for professional coursework is very limited and is awarded on a case-by-case basis through special petition to the dean of the school in which the program is offered. All petitions must be processed through the Admission Office and initiated by August 1 prior to fall enrollment or by December 15 if entering in the spring semester. The Admission Office conducts a transfer credit evaluation on all transcripts in a candidate's file during the application review process. Accepted students receive access to an online student portal where they are able to 67 May 17, 2021 view their transfer credit evaluation. Courses considered for transfer credit must meet the following requirements: Comparable in breadth and depth to those in the preprofessional phase of the specific program to which the candidate is applying. Comparability is determined by the Admission Office in collaboration with the Office of the Registrar, school deans, program directors, and faculty in related discipline(s). Successfully completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better at a regionally accredited college or university. Transfer credits for Nursing prerequisites will only be accepted if a grade of C+ or higher is earned. Completed within the last 10 years at the time of enrollment. This restriction is limited to courses in the area of mathematics and the natural, physical, and behavioral sciences. Submitted with an official transcript by August 15 (fall entry), December 15, (spring entry) or May 1 (summer entry). For transcripts submitted after these deadlines, and no later than the add/drop deadline of the subsequent term, the student must work with their academic dean for approval. AP examination results are accepted for transfer credit for selected coursework. Students must achieve a score of 4 or better on an AP examination for transfer credit to be awarded. CLEP results are accepted as transfer credit for selected subject matter for incoming transfer students. Candidates must receive a score of 50 or better per subject to be awarded CLEP credit. Examination(s) must be taken before the student's first semester of enrollment at MCPHS. Those who achieve a score below 50 may not repeat the examination and must take the course. CLEP is an opportunity for students whose coursework is comparable but not otherwise transferable (e.g., exceeds the 10-year limit, earned grade is below C) and others who have not taken coursework but believe they have comparable knowledge. IB courses will be accepted for transfer credit for selected coursework. Students must achieve a score of 5 or better on an HL (high-level) IB exam. Transfer credits are limited to exams for English, language, and the arts. Transfer students accepted into the professional phase of an MCPHS degree program will receive transfer credit for IB courses accepted by a previous college. Transfer credit of AP, IB, CLEP, and/or dual enrollment courses is limited to a total of 18 semester hours of credit. Exam documentation must be provided to MCPHS no later than August 15 (fall entry), December 15, (spring entry) or May 1 (summer entry). Candidates who desire to receive credit based on AP and CLEP examinations must arrange for official test score results to be sent directly from Educational Testing Service (ETS) to the Admissions Office in Boston. A complete list of the AP and CLEP examinations and the corresponding MCPHS courses for which transfer of credit is allowed is available upon request through the Admissions Office. Dual Credit Programs Courses taken for college credit while a student is enrolled in high school will receive transfer credit only if the course was administered in a college setting. Courses taken in a high school that are taught by teachers who have been certified to offer college-level courses will not receive transfer credit. Petition for Additional Transfer Credit Post Matriculation Once a student has matriculated at the University, no courses taken outside of MCPHS will be accepted for transfer credit. (NOTE: COF courses are allowed for Boston students.) Exceptions to this policy may be granted in instances involving delay of graduation or extreme hardship. Prior to taking a course for transfer credit at another institution, students must submit a Petition to Transfer Credit form to the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, which approves or denies the petition. Notification of the decision will be distributed to (1) the student, (2) the program director, (3) the school dean, (4) the Office of the Registrar, and (5) others as appropriate. The student is responsible for requesting that official transcripts be sent to the Office of the Registrar, which will verify the credit and post a grade of TR in the student's transcript. Official transcripts must be received no later than the add/drop deadline of the subsequent semester. These petitions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may take up to two weeks to receive official notification. Students are advised not to enroll in or make payments for non-MCPHS courses without official University approval. 68 May 17, 2021 Fast Track, Postbaccalaureate, and Graduate Admission (Boston) NOTE: All candidates must refer to General Admission Policies for additional information including interviews, mailing address, and deadlines.

Graduate Transfer of Credit Transfer credit for graduate-level coursework taken at other accredited institutions may be accepted for transfer toward a student's degree requirements pending approval of the Graduate Council. Only courses that are clearly relevant to the student's program of study and have not been used to fulfill requirements for another degree may be considered for transfer credit. A maximum of 8 semester hours for MS and 12 semester hours for PhD programs may be transferred for coursework in which grades of B or higher have been attained. In some instances, transfer hours received in certain courses taken on a pass/fail basis may be approved by the Graduate Council. It is the responsibility of the student's Graduate Advisory Committee to determine the student's comprehension of the material before such hours are shown on the program of study for credit toward the degree. Research credit from another institution cannot be accepted for transfer credit. Coursework must have been completed not more than two years prior to the date of the request for transfer. Transfer credit for all MS coursework, including research credits, taken at MCPHS is acceptable for transfer toward a student's PhD degree requirements, provided that the coursework is clearly relevant to the student's program of study. Graduate Student Status At the time of acceptance, each student is classified as regular, provisional, or non-matriculating. Regular Status Candidates who have met all requirements for admission to a graduate degree program are admitted as regular students. The transcript must show sufficient and satisfactory undergraduate preparation in the major field, a minimum GRE score, and (if applicable) a TOEFL, ITEP, MCPHS EPE, PTE, or IELTS score. (Please refer to the International Applicants section.) Candidates who are accepted to the MS track of graduate studies in the pharmaceutical sciences and desire consideration for acceptance to the PhD track may do so after successful completion of one full year in the master's degree track at MCPHS. A candidate must submit a letter of petition to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies carefully outlining his or her career goals and reasons for consideration. Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Associate Dean or the Graduate Advisory Committee. Candidates will be notified of the decision by the Associate Dean. Those who are not approved will continue in the master's degree track contingent upon satisfactory performance. A graduate student is considered to have full-time status if he or she is registered for 9 or more graduate credits, or registered for 6 or more graduate credits while appointed as a graduate assistant for 15-20 hours per week, or registered for DRA 810A Case Study Thesis, or registered for PEP 880 MS Thesis Research in Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, or registered for PEP 890 PhD Dissertation Research in Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, or registered for PSB 872 Special Problems in Pharmaceutical Sciences (internships), or registered for PEP 899 Special Topics in Pharmaceutical Economics and Policy, or registered for PSB 880, CHE 880, or CHE 885 Research, or 71 May 17, 2021 registered for PSB 895 Graduate Student Extension (thesis/dissertation completion, no credit), or registered for DHY 895 Graduate Extension of Thesis registered for CHE 895 Graduate Study Extension Provisional Status The University may, at its discretion, admit candidates into a graduate degree program on a trial basis as provisional students to ascertain their ability to do graduate work.

The University makes available a general health insurance program that meets the required standards. This policy is provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield, beginning September 1 and continuing 12 months. Insurance brochures will be available online. Students will be automatically enrolled in this plan unless a waiver is completed and received by Student Financial Services prior to the following waiver deadlines: Fall starts -August 21; Spring starts - January 8, Summer starts - May 1. Students registering late must submit the waiver at that time. The waiver stipulates that personal coverage will be maintained during the enrollment period. If Student Financial Services does not receive the 87 May 17, 2021 waiver prior to the applicable deadline, the student will be billed for the insurance premium and will remain responsible for payment of said premium. The waiver must be renewed annually. All international students will be enrolled in the Blue Cross Blue Shield student health insurance plan automatically, with the exception of those international students whose sponsoring institutions have a signed agreement with MCPHS that complies with the University's health insurance waiver requirements, or those international students with a plan for which the health insurance company's primary home office is based in the United States and the policy provides coverage comparable to that of the University student health insurance plan. Travel insurance plans and short-term limited duration plans are not comparable. International students who do not fall under one of the two conditions above must purchase the University's student health insurance plan. Criminal Background Information Fees Any out-of-pocket expenses for criminal or sex offender background checks that may be required by clinical rotation sites, including, without limitation, Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI), Sex Offender Registry Information (SORI) checks, or level 1 background checks, must be paid by the student.

After the add/drop deadline, there will be no tuition refund for individual course withdrawal. 88 May 17, 2021 University Withdrawal, Leave of Absence and Refund The following graduated scale of charges for tuition and residence hall fees is used for purposes of determining refunds for students completely withdrawing from the University during the semester, as well as students taking a Leave of Absence: PERIOD OF ATTENDANCE REFUND Add/drop period 100% First week after the add/drop period 75% Second week after the add/drop period 50% Third week after the add/drop period 25% Fourth week and beyond after the add/drop period 0% Students who withdraw from the University, please review Withdrawal and Approved Leave of Absence from the University, under the Student Financial Services section of the catalog. Students taking a Leave of Absence from the University must contact their Academic Dean to complete the official process. Approved refunds are computed on the basis of the date appearing on the form. Absence from class without completing the form does not constitute withdrawal or approved Leave of Absence from the University. Students should contact Student Financial Services to determine how this withdrawal affects their financial aid. 89 May 17, 2021 Veterans Affairs (VA) Currently enrolled or accepted students with Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits must submit a copy of their VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to the Registrar's Office via e-mail, fax, or mail. The Registrar's Office may require additional information to properly certify enrollment. Students must complete a Veterans Affairs Request form to request that their certification of enrollment be submitted to the VA. The form must be completed each semester a student is enrolled, no later than 60 days prior to the start of the semester. The request form and additional support resources provided by the University Educations Team (UVET) are available online at https://my.mcphs.edu/departments/registrar/veterans-affairs. The UVET is comprised of faculty and staff members that contribute to the university's overall mission of support and advocacy for our student veterans and other military-associated students. Prior Credit MCPHS University maintains written records of previous education and training of the veteran or eligible person and indicates appropriate credit has been given for previous education and training. Students Receiving Veterans Benefits under 38 U.S.C. Ch. 31 and 38 U.S.C. Ch. 33 MCPHS University will permit any covered individual to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 (a \"certificate of eligibility\" can also include a \"Statement of Benefits\" obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) website - eBenefits, or a VAF 28-1905 form for chapter 31 authorization purposes) and ending on the earlier of the following dates: The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution. 90 days after the date the institution certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certificate of eligibility. MCPHS University will not impose any penalty, including, the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under chapter 31 or 33. Delayed VA Payments Under S2248 PL 115-407 Section 103, MCPHS University will not impose a late fee, denial of access to facilities, or other penalty against a veteran or eligible dependent due to a late payment of tuition and/or fees from the VA up to the certified benefits amount. Any portion of the student bill not covered by VA benefits is still expected to be settled by the due date. Students are responsible for all charges and fees not covered by the veteran or other eligible beneficiary's VA educational benefits (for example, housing, meal plans, or beneficiary is less than 100% eligible). but do require a Form I-20 for entry The Form I-20 is the first step in the visa process. A Form I-20 is a government document that informs the United States government that you are eligible for F-1 (Academic Student) status. It certifies that you are or expect to be a bona fide student; that you meet our admission requirements; that you will pursue a full course of study; and that you have the financial capability to study and live in the United States for the duration of your program. The Admission Office at MCPHS issues a Form I-20 to eligible new students after they have been accepted to the University, have submitted their enrollment deposit, and have correctly filled out and submitted the Form I-20 application and supporting materials (copy of valid passport, and financial documents). Students currently studying at another U.S. institution must submit additional documents to have their SEVIS record transferred before MCPHS can issue a Form I-20. These documents include: Copies of all Form I-20s Copy of your visa Copies of I-94 admission record MCPHS Transfer of Schools Form (gives current institution authorization to transfer the student's Form I-20) Those students who wish to bring their dependents with them during their course of study must send copies of dependent passports, and proof of funds to support each dependent ($12,500 annually for a spouse, $3,600 annually per child). Only a spouse or child can be considered a dependent. 90 May 17, 2021 A Form I-20 cannot be issued to any international student studying at MCPHS University's Online campus. Most Online campus programs are offered entirely in a virtual environment and therefore interested international candidates may complete programs (that do not require U.S. licensure or U.S. employment in the profession) from their current country of residence. All financial documents must be in English, and less than six months old. Your financial support may come from any combination of the following sources in the United States and abroad: Sponsors (parent[s], relative[s], spouse, organization[s], government, etc.). Each of your sponsors is required to complete and sign an Affidavit of Support form. Sponsors also may provide you with support in the form of room and board. When you live with someone and do not have to pay for your room and food, you are considered to have free room and board; however, proof of residency is required. Personal funds that come from your own resources, not those of a sponsor Funds from MCPHS University, such as a scholarship, housing grant, assistantship, or fellowship As a reminder, F-1 status students are not permitted to work off-campus, but may work a limited amount of hours with authorization. Questions regarding the I-20 process should be directed to the Admission Office at 617.732.2188. 91 May 17, 2021 Student Financial Services Applying for Financial Aid The Office of Student Financial Services at MCPHS is dedicated to providing comprehensive education financing counseling to students and their families. The staff is available to assist students by answering questions regarding the aid application process, their financial aid award, and their student account. The University offers a variety of scholarships, loans, and employment opportunities to assist students in meeting the costs of education that cannot be met through the family's own resources. To apply for financial aid for the 2020-21 academic year, the current application required is the 2020-2021 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA may be completed online at www.fafsa.gov. Students who submitted a 2020-2021 FAFSA should use their FSA ID from the Department of Education to complete the online renewal application. The Office of Student Financial Services will notify students if additional information or documentation is required to complete their financial aid applications. Students should not send additional documentation unless requested to do so by Student Financial Services. Notification of award: Notification of award letters will be emailed to students once the financial aid file is complete. It is recommended that students complete the FAFSA as soon as they are available on October 1st of each year. The student's demonstrated need is recalculated each year, and award amounts are contingent upon the University's level of allocated funds. Eligibility for Financial Aid To be eligible for federal student aid, the student must be a citizen, permanent resident, or other eligible noncitizen of the United States; registered with the Selective Service System or exempt from registration; not in default on any federal student loan or owing a refund on any federal grant; not convicted of any federal or state drug offense while receiving federal student aid; and in good academic standing.

Dependency Status For the 2020-2021 school year (July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021), the U.S. Department of Education considers the following students to be independent of their parent(s) for purposes of awarding federal financial aid: Students who were born before January 1, 1997 Students who are orphans or wards of the court, or were wards of the court at any point during or after age 13 Students who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces Students who have children, if they provide more than half of the support for the child Students who have dependents (other than a child or spouse) living with them, if they provide more than half of the support for the dependent Students who are married Students who will be graduate/professional students in 2020-2021 (see Degree Standing to determine who is considered a graduate/professional student for financial aid purposes) Students who are serving in the U.S. Armed Forces or are National Guard or Reserves enlistees for purposes other than state or training Students who are or were emancipated minors as determined by a court Students who are or were in a legal guardianship on the date the student became an adult, as determined by a court Students who are or were considered an unaccompanied youth who was homeless on or after July 1, 2019 As the criteria above indicate, financial independence is not one of the criteria used in determining whether a student is considered dependent or independent. Parental data must be provided on the FAFSA for students who are unable to answer \"yes\" to any of the listed criteria. The University uses the U.S. Department of Education definition of dependency status for all federal, state, institutional, and private financial aid programs. Students should refer to the FAFSA for specific details on each of the above criteria or contact the Office of Student Financial Services for assistance in determining status. Prior Bachelor's Degree Students who are in possession of a baccalaureate degree prior to their enrollment at the University are not eligible for certain grant programs, including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and state scholarship/grant programs. Massachusetts Residency Massachusetts residency is defined as having resided in Massachusetts for purposes other than attending college for at least one year prior to the beginning of the academic year. (The beginning of the academic year is defined as July 1 by the Commonwealth.) Parents of dependent students also must have resided in Massachusetts for at least one year prior to the beginning of the academic year. Programs funded by the Commonwealth are limited to undergraduate students without a prior bachelor's degree. Yellow Ribbon Program for Veterans MCPHS University participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program. Only Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate, as determined by service requirements, or their designated transferees may receive this funding.

Enrollment is reviewed for all students receiving financial aid at the end of the official add/drop period each semester, at which time adjustments to financial aid awards are made. The following aid programs require full-time enrollment. Less than full-time enrollment will result in complete loss of the award: Massachusetts State Funds Health Professions Loan Nursing Student Loan Most other state grants The following programs are prorated based on enrollment status. For these programs, undergraduate students will receive a portion of the awarded amount if the student enrolls less than full-time for a given semester: Federal Pell Grant MCPHS Need-Based Awards MCPHS Merit-Based Awards The following programs require at least half-time enrollment. Less than half-time enrollment will result in complete loss of the award.

The University applies these standards to all federal, state, and institutional funds. The Office of Student Financial Services will disburse financial aid only to those students who are in good academic standing and are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree. Requirements A student is not making satisfactory academic progress if any of the following conditions exist: The student's cumulative grade point average (GPA) is below 2.0 at the end of the second year of their academic program. Grade point averages are reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee at the end of each semester. The student's earned credits (completed with a passing grade) are less than 67% of all attempted credits (coursework), as calculated at the end of each semester. The student has exceeded the maximum time frame of attempted credits (150%) of the published length of their degree program. Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each semester (payment period). The following describes how types of coursework are used in the SAP calculation: Dropped coursework is not included. Failing grades (F) are included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Withdrawals are included in earned and attempted credits. 95 May 17, 2021 Repeated coursework is included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Pass/fail coursework is included in earned and attempted credits. Audit coursework is not included. Colleges of the Fenway (COF) coursework is included in the GPA and in earned and attempted credits. Transfer coursework (applicable to current program) is included in earned and attempted credits. Satisfactory/unsatisfactory coursework (graduate programs only) is included in earned and attempted credits. Remedial coursework is not included. If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress, he or she will be placed on financial aid warning. A student then has one semester to make satisfactory progress. If, after one semester on financial aid warning, a student is not making satisfactory academic progress, the student becomes ineligible for aid and will be notified by email. Students who are ineligible for financial aid because they are not making satisfactory academic progress may appeal to regain eligibility for the subsequent semester to achieve the SAP standards. Students may also continue to take coursework without the use of financial assistance until eligibility is reinstated by achieving the required SAP standards, subject to the approval of the university and the student's academic department. Appeals are considered when a student can demonstrate that an extraordinary circumstance existed (for example, student illness, the illness or death of a family member) that prevented the student from achieving satisfactory academic progress. Students considering an SAP appeal should contact the Office of Student Financial Services to make an appointment to discuss the situation. Appeals are due by the posted deadline in the email notification of academic status and loss of aid eligibility; however, an appeal does not exclude the student's payment responsibility associated with the semester's bill due date. Incomplete appeals will not be reviewed. Students with an approved appeal will be placed on financial aid probation and have one semester to achieve satisfactory academic progress. If the student fails to achieve the SAP standards after probation, then they will not be eligible for aid until the standards are achieved. If MCPHS determines, based on the appeal, the student will require more than one academic semester to meet progress standards, the University may grant a subsequent appeal; if an academic plan is developed for the student, the student must successfully complete the program in the specified time. Students will be reviewed at the end of one academic semester to determine if they are meeting the requirements of the plan. If the student is meeting the requirement of the academic plan, the student is eligible to receive Title IV funds as long as the student continues to meet those requirements, and is reviewed according to the requirements detailed in the plan. Non-matriculating students are not eligible for financial aid. Process for Awarding Financial Aid In selecting financial aid recipients, primary emphasis is placed upon financial need, availability of funds, the student's academic achievement, and/or satisfactory academic progress. Determining Need To determine a student's need, the University uses the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The information provided on the FAFSA is used to determine what amount a family can be expected to contribute toward the cost of attending the University (the expected family contribution, or EFC). The University uses the standard federal formula (known as the federal methodology, or FM) in computing the expected parental and student contributions. Some of the factors used in the analysis include income, assets, family size, and number of family members in college. The student's expected contribution is added to the parental expected contribution to produce the total expected family contribution. The student's financial need is determined by subtracting the expected family contribution from the total cost of attending the University. The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees as well as an allowance for room and board, books and supplies, travel, federal loan fees, and other education-related expenses. The Financial Aid Package After the student's financial need is determined, Student Financial Services will develop a financial aid package for the student. MCPHS utilizes scholarships, loans, and employment opportunities to assist students in meeting as much of their demonstrated financial need as possible. The University makes every effort to distribute the available funds in an equitable fashion in order to assist the greatest number of eligible students. The total amount of aid a student receives may not exceed his or her total cost of attendance. The University offers a variety of scholarships, which are funded through endowments, gifts, and other monies raised by the University. Scholarships are awarded primarily based on financial need and academic achievement. Students applying for financial aid are automatically considered for each scholarship for which they may qualify. Major programs providing financial aid to students are described in the 2020-2021 MCPHS Student Financial Services handbook. 96 May 17, 2021 Merit Aid University Merit Aid is determined at the time of admission. Students are required to maintain a 2.5 cumulative GPA in order to continue receiving their merit award. Students who fail to meet the 2.5 GPA requirements will have one semester to improve their GPA to a 2.5 cumulative or the merit award will be cancelled and cannot be reinstated. Private Funding Sources In addition to the federal, state, and University programs offered through the University's financial aid application process, students also are encouraged to apply for outside aid to help meet the costs of education. Several free scholarship search services are available through the Internet (please visit the University's website at www.mcphs.edu for further information). In addition, most high school and public libraries have resources detailing private scholarship opportunities. Verification Process Each year the federal government and/or MCPHS selects students who have completed the FAFSA for verification. The verification process simply requires the University to review supporting documents to verify the information reported on the FAFSA for the parent(s), student, and spouse. Information that may be verified includes adjusted gross income, federal taxes paid, education credits, the number of individuals in the household, the number of individuals in the household who are enrolled at least half time in college, high school completion status, identity / statement of educational purpose, and other information deemed necessary for review. If you are selected for verification, you will be notified via email of additional documents that you must submit to complete your financial aid file. The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows students and parents to access the IRS tax return information needed to complete the FAFSA. Students and parents may transfer the data directly into their FAFSA if certain criteria are met. MCPHS encourages all students and families to utilize the IRS data retrieval process, which is the preferred method for FAFSA filers to report federal tax information. If the IRS data retrieval process is not used on a FAFSA transaction, then the student and/or parent may need to obtain federal tax return transcripts from the IRS. Students and/or parents may complete online requests for a federal tax return transcript at www.irs.gov. Online requests are considered the quickest approach to obtain a federal tax return transcript. The request may take up to 10 days to fulfill. MCPHS will not disburse federal, state, and institutional financial aid to a student's account until the student completes the verification process. Failure to complete the verification process will result in cancellation of federal financial aid. The University reserves the right to verify any file that appears to contain discrepant information. In addition to verifying a student's application data, MCPHS is required by federal law to resolve any conflicts of information that become evident as part of the application review process. All discrepancies must be resolved prior to disbursement of Title IV aid to a student's account. Additional Student Financial Services Appeal Process Students and parents may appeal their financial aid award if there is a significant and unforeseen change in circumstances or if there is information that was not provided on the original application materials. For additional details regarding the financial aid appeal process, refer to the 2020-2021 MCPHS Student Financial Services handbook. All appeals must be in writing and must include documentation of the reasons for requesting the reevaluation of the financial aid package as well as complete tax transcripts and W-2s (if necessary) for the student and parent (if the student is a dependent). Applying Financial Aid to Your Student Account If all necessary paperwork has been submitted by the student, financial aid will be applied to a student's account after add/drop and after attendance has been verified by the Registrar's office each semester. Failure to submit the necessary paperwork will result in the delay and possible cancellation of the student's financial aid. Refunds Students will automatically receive a refund for any excess funds (credit balance) on their student account each semester. Refunds are available as soon as administratively possible following verification of student enrollment and disbursement of financial aid funds. Students should be sure to make arrangements each semester for the purchase of books and payment of rent (if housed off campus), since refunds are not available during the first few weeks of each 97 May 17, 2021 academic term. It is highly recommended for ease in refund processing that students sign up for direct deposit though WebAdvisor. Late Payment Fees Students with outstanding student account balances will be charged a late payment fee. To avoid late payment fees, students must ensure that all financial obligations (including tuition, fees, health insurance fees, and housing charges) will be met by the dates specified in the Tuition section of this catalog. Account Placement Fee An Account Placement Fee will be applied to any student's account not paid by the scheduled due date and placed with Heartland/ECSI for assistance with the collection efforts on the outstanding balance. This fee is in addition to the Late Payment Fee and cannot be waived. Students receiving financial aid and/or private alternative loans must ensure that proper documentation is completed and aid and/or loan funds are received by the University on or before the payment due date in order to avoid a late fee. Students participating in a payment plan must ensure that the payment plan budget for each term will cover all outstanding charges. Payment plan budgets that will not result in a paid-in-full status by the end of the payment term will be assessed a late payment fee. For students with outstanding balances, the University reserves the right to refuse to release official transcripts, to release the diploma certifying graduation, to complete board examination certification, or to register the student for any other coursework to access campus wide systems such as Blackboard, WebAdvisor and University E-mail to view final grades Students wishing to appeal late payment fees are required to do the following: Pay the student account balance due in full (less the late payment fee). Submit the following in writing to the Office of Student Financial Services: Student name Student ID number The reason(s) or documentation that contributed to the circumstances of the late payment fee The student will be notified of the decision concerning the appeal of a late payment fee. Student Account Statements Student account statements are sent electronically on a monthly basis to students with a balance due. Statements include all recent account activity, including charges, payments, disbursements of financial aid and loan funds, and account adjustments. Balances due must be paid by the payment due date to avoid late payment fees. Students have the ability to view real-time charges and updates through the Student Account Center as well as grant shared access to their account. The University accepts electronic funds transfer, MasterCard, Discover, Visa, and American Express payments via the Student Account Center. Credit and Debit card payments are subject to a service fee equal to 2.75% of the payment amount (minimum $1.00 fee). The service fee will be charged and retained by the online payment provider. Service fee percentage is current as of June 2020 and is subject to change. Alternative methods of payment include wire transfers and check payments. Work-Study Students working in a Federal Work-Study Program position are paid through a weekly paycheck based on hours actually worked. These funds are not credited to the student's account. Withdrawal and Approved Leave of Absence from the University Students withdrawing or taking a leave of absence from the University who have been determined to be eligible for federal financial aid are subject to certain provisions surrounding the calculation of their federal aid eligibility. A federally determined formula is used to calculate the amount of federal aid a student is eligible to receive based on the portion of the semester completed before the withdrawal. If a student received more assistance than was earned, the unearned funds must be returned to the Department of Education. 98 May 17, 2021 The amount of aid a student is eligible to receive is based on the percentage of the semester that was completed prior to the initiation of the withdrawal process. For example, if 40% of the semester has passed when the withdrawal process is initiated, then 40% of the federal aid originally scheduled for disbursement has been earned. Once more than 60% of the semester has been completed, a student is considered to have earned 100% of the federal aid he or she was eligible to receive. If it is determined that a student received more federal aid than was earned, MCPHS will return the unearned funds based on a formula comparing institutional charges with the unearned percentage of funds. If MCPHS must return a portion of the funds, the removal of those funds from the student's account will create a balance due, which the student will be required to pay. To find out how a withdrawal during the first 60% of the semester may affect a financial aid award, students should make an appointment to discuss the situation with their Student Financial Services representative. For additional information, please review the University Withdrawal, Leave of Absence and Refund under the Tuition, Room and Board, Fees section of the catalog. 99 May 17, 2021 Academic Policies and Procedures General University policies and procedures are stated below. Students should note that within individual programs and schools there might be additional requirements or variations of these policies. The ultimate responsibility for complying with academic policies and fulfilling graduation requirements rests with the individual student. Academic Calendar The academic calendar is a live document available at https://www.mcphs.edu/academics/academic-support-and-resources/registrar. Students are required to review details of the calendar during the web check-in process at the start of each semester. Changes to the published academic calendar are communicated to students via an email sent from the Registrar. Academic Honesty The University presumes that students will assume personal responsibility and maintain personal integrity in all aspects of their education. Dishonest actions in the execution of an examination, report, academic assignment, and/or academic coursework requirement, including clinical rotations, constitute violations of the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy. Such violations are subject to specific academic sanctions, as well as to disciplinary sanctions (i.e., disciplinary warning, probation, deferred suspension, suspension, and/or expulsion). Academic Honesty and Student Discipline Procedures Academic violations or offenses include the following: 1.01 Receiving assistance, or attempting to receive assistance, not authorized by an instructor in the preparation of any assignment, laboratory exercise, report, or examination submitted as a requirement for an academic course or rotation. 1.02 Knowingly giving unauthorized assistance, or attempting to give unauthorized assistance, to another student in the preparation of any assignment, laboratory exercise, report, or examination submitted as a requirement for an academic course or rotation. 1.03 Plagiarism: Submitting another person's work (including words, images, and ideas) as one's own without the proper acknowledgment of source, or use of the words or ideas of another without crediting the source of those words or ideas. Also, submitting the same work for assignments in more than one class (copying from oneself) without permission from the instructor and/or appropriate citation, in the same semester or subsequent semesters. 1.04 Obtaining or attempting to engage another person to take one's own examination. 1.05 Selling, giving, lending, or otherwise furnishing any material that can be shown to contain the questions or answers to any examination scheduled to be given at any subsequent date in any course of study offered by the University. 1.06 Taking, or attempting to take, steal, or otherwise procure in any unauthorized manner any material pertaining to the conduct of a class, including examinations. 1.07 Falsifying or presenting fictional patient information as real to fulfill requirements for work assigned by individual faculty members or clinical preceptors. 1.08 Signing in another student or requesting to be signed in by another student on a course attendance sheet; or falsely recording another student's attendance (as with the use of \"clicker\"). 1.09 Altering, or attempting to alter, grades or information on any assignment, laboratory exercise, report, exam, or previously completed examination as a requirement for an academic course or rotation. Implementation of the Academic Honesty Policy 1. The Dean of Students or designee will review the Academic Honesty Policy, issues of dishonesty, and consequences of violating the Academic Honesty Policy during new student orientation. 2. The Academic Honesty Policy will be provided by the Office of Student Affairs to all members of the MCPHS community online through the MCPHS student handbook. All entering MCPHS students are expected to 100 May 17, 2021 acknowledge they have read the Academic Honesty Policy via an online process coordinated by the Office of Student Affairs. Refusal to do so may result in more severe sanctions should a student be found responsible for an academic honesty violation. 3. In specific testing and/or evaluation situations, students may be required to present their MCPHS ID cards to verify identity. 4. Each instructor is responsible for informing students of the standards of behavior expected of students in the classroom, laboratory, and clinical site and for consistently enforcing such standards. 5. Faculty may require that students sign an academic honesty statement for exam and written graded assignments. The statement will read as follows: Academic Honesty Statement I pledge that I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid, and will not give or receive unauthorized aid on any examination, paper and/or assignment. Student Name (printed) ______________________________________________________________ Student Signature: ______________________________ID Number: __________________________ Plagiarism Prevention Service Students are expected to abide by the University's Academic Honesty Policy as outlined. Plagiarism (see Offense 1.03 above) is considered a violation of this policy. In order to deter plagiarism and ensure appropriate use of resources in student research and learning, the University subscribes to a plagiarism prevention service. Faculty may require students to submit their written work electronically through this plagiarism prevention service in order to verify that when ideas of others are used they are cited appropriately. The course syllabus identifies student work that must be submitted electronically for such review. Academic Honesty and Exams The school deans are responsible for the proper conduct of examinations in their schools and will assign faculty and graduate assistants to serve as proctors for examinations. Support staff, under the supervision of the school deans, are responsible for maintaining confidentiality in the production and reproduction of examinations. Instructors are expected to assist in the promotion of academic honesty through the following practices: Access to and use of \"recycled\" exams should be limited. Students will be required to leave all unnecessary materials (i.e., all backpacks, notebooks, texts, calculators, PDAs, cellular phones, etc.) away from their seat assignment\u2014only required materials will be allowed at the seat assignment. All exams are to be proctored. In specific evaluation situations, students may be asked to show instructors/proctors materials being used during the exam (PDAs, cellular phones, etc.) to ensure proper use of the allowed material and adherence to the honesty policy. Instructors are encouraged to utilize the following exam seating practices whenever possible: Students entering an exam room will be randomly seated. Seating assignments will be spaced throughout the exam room, allowing for adequate spaces between students. The instructor should follow the University Policy on Academic Honesty when giving examinations and ensure that proctors are present at all examinations in compliance with this policy. At least one (1) course coordinator for each course should be present during an examination to answer questions or to clarify issues that may arise. Exceptions to this rule must be approved by the school dean. Students are expected to report violations of the Academic Honesty Policy to the instructor and/or the department/division chair or program director of the academic department for further investigation. 101 May 17, 2021 Student Discipline Procedures for Academic Honesty Policy Violations Preliminary procedure: The University maintains a policy of open communication among all members of the University community so that any misunderstanding can be minimized and any conflicts can be expeditiously resolved between the parties involved. Hence, the first step in attempting to resolve an alleged student violation shall ordinarily be a meeting between the faculty member and the accused student(s). The faculty member will schedule a meeting with the student to attempt to come to a resolution. The meeting should be scheduled within seven (7) business days of the faculty member's knowledge of the alleged academic dishonesty incident(s). The faculty member will give the student a copy of the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy and Student Discipline Procedures and offer the Office of Student Affairs as a resource to discuss student rights and responsibilities. The faculty member will provide the accused student with the information the faculty member has regarding the alleged incident and will provide the accused student(s) the opportunity to respond to the presented information. After listening to the student response, the faculty member can do one of the following: Determine academic dishonesty did not occur and not pursue the incident further OR Determine academic dishonesty did occur and discuss the academic sanction the faculty member will assign (i.e., repeat of the assignment, grade reduction, failure for the assignment or exam, failure for the course). If consequences regarding academic dishonesty are listed in the course syllabus, faculty sanctions must follow information as indicated in the syllabus. The faculty member will provide the student with the option to meet with a staff member in the Office of Student Affairs to review the student's rights and responsibilities prior to the faculty member's finalizing their decision. If the student accepts the faculty-assigned consequence, the case is closed provided the student has no prior offenses of the academic honesty policy or the violation is so severe that a hearing is deemed necessary by the Office of Student Affairs. NOTE: There is no option for appeal in a closed case. Parties (faculty and student) unable to agree shall appeal the case to the academic school dean (or designee). The academic school dean (or designee) can decide to meet individually with the student and faculty member or to conduct a three-way meeting with the student and faculty member, to be scheduled within seven business days of the initial faculty/student meeting. The academic dean (or designee) will meet with the involved parties and review the case. Subsequent to case review, the academic dean (or designee) can do one of the following: Determine academic dishonesty did not occur and not pursue the incident further. OR Determine academic dishonesty did occur and discuss the academic sanction they will assign (i.e., repeat of the assignment, grade reduction, failure for the assignment or exam, failure for the course). If consequences regarding academic dishonesty are listed in the course syllabus, academic sanctions must follow information as indicated in the syllabus. Appellate decisions should be provided to the student within five (5) business days following the final meeting. Appellate decisions are final. Students should be advised that, regardless of the academic resolution, all academic dishonesty violations will be reported to and recorded with the Office of Student Affairs. When reporting the incident to the Office of Student Affairs, subsequent to a student's accepting responsibility in discussion with the course faculty member or academic dean (or designee), the Dean of Students or designee will send a letter to the student, faculty member, and academic dean outlining the decisions reached among the involved parties (e.g., loss of points, change of grade, failure of exam, etc.), along with notification of a student conduct sanction, the minimum being disciplinary warning. Should the Dean of Students, or designee, determine that further action is required, based upon the disciplinary history of the student or severity of the violation, then the matter will be processed as outlined in the student discipline system in a hearing, as appropriate. All cases involving academic dishonesty will be recorded with the Office of Student Affairs, regardless of the resolution process utilized. Faculty and academic deans report, consult, and work collaboratively with the Office of Student Affairs 102 May 17, 2021 regarding each alleged academic dishonesty incident. Complex alleged academic dishonesty incidents that require extensive fact finding or involve a conflict of interest (i.e., the academic dean is the instructor for the course in which academic dishonesty is alleged) may be referred by the faculty member or academic dean immediately to the Office of Student Affairs for review and disciplinary procedures as outlined in the student discipline system. NOTE: A student may continue attending class during the resolution process for an academic dishonesty incident. When a final decision is made that a student has failed a course due to academic dishonesty and no appeal option exists, the student must discontinue attending the class in which the academic dishonesty incident occurred. Sanctions for Academic Dishonesty In determining a sanction, the responsible student's present demeanor and past disciplinary history, the nature of the offense, the severity of any resulting damage, injury or harm, and other factors may be considered. Students whose behavior is contrary to the Code of Conduct are subject to the maximum sanction of dismissal from the University or any lesser sanction for any act of misconduct. Academic dishonesty sanctions include, but are not limited to, the information below. Faculty and the academic dean (or designee) may assign the sanctions of repeating an assignment, receiving a score of zero on an exam/assignment, receiving a lowered assignment/exam/course grade, or failing the course. The Dean of Students (or designee) assigns the sanctions of warning, disciplinary probation, deferred suspension, suspension, or expulsion in accordance with the University Academic Honesty Policy and the University student discipline system. The Dean of Students (or designee) may also assign educational sanction(s) related to academic honesty. The Dean of Students (or designee) communicates academic honesty offenses, academic sanctions, and disciplinary sanctions to the student in writing subsequent to a case's being closed. Students are subject to academic sanctions from College of the Fenway faculty should they commit academic violations while taking a COF course, and such cases are referred to the Office of Student Affairs. MCPHS would address such offenses under the MCPHS Academic Honesty Policy and Student Discipline Procedures. Attendance and Academic Status Policies MCPHS Documented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure Absences from classes and coursework can be detrimental to students' academic progress. In an effort to help students in certain circumstances, a documented absence may be granted as a reasonable allowance; however, a documented absence does not always excuse a student from making up academic work. Each course syllabus and academic program's policy and procedure manual outline students' responsibilities related to class absences. Students are expected to abide by these instructions; students who fail to do so may be ineligible to receive an excused documented absence, regardless of reason for the absence. The procedure for seeking an approved documented absence and consideration for making up exams, coursework, clinical/rotation hours, or any other academic work for credit is outlined below: Procedure for Obtaining a Documented Absence 1. Student Notification In the case of an absence (anticipated or urgent), every effort must be made to notify course faculty or preceptor via email. A student must notify their course faculty or preceptor of the absence via email, Students must submit supporting documentation within 5 business days from the first date of absence to the Office of Student Affairs on each campus via the online Documented Absence form located on the my.mcphs.edu/student affairs website. Notification of clinical preceptors must comply with expectations outlined in clinical rotation syllabi and handbooks. For online courses, refer to course syllabus and the attendance requirements outlined by the faculty member. Anticipated absences include religious observance and immutable appointments (i.e., jury duty, court date, medical appointment, University-related conference, professional development). It is recommended that all requests for anticipated absences be made 10 days in advance of the absence date(s). Exceptions to the 5-business-day notification period are rare and can be approved only by the Office of Student Affairs on a student's respective campus. 103 May 17, 2021 With regards to travel, if you have traveled to an affected geographical area in the last 21 days and develop fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, or if you have been in contact with someone diagnosed or under evaluation for COVID-19, please seek medical advice. Call the office of your health care provider (student health services, urgent care, doctor's office, or emergency room) before you go, and tell them about your symptoms. 2. Submitting Documented Absence Request Form Students must submit a completed Documented Absence Request Form with valid documentation via the following links per campus: Worcester: http://tinyurl.com/mcphs-worcester Boston: http://tinyurl.com/mcphs-absence Manchester: http://tinyurl.com/mcphs-manchester Students with three or more documented absences in one semester in a single course may be required to meet with the Dean of Students or designee on their respective campus. 3. Notification from the Office of Student Affairs The Office of Student Affairs will notify the faculty and student within 5-7 business days via email. 4. Missed Work and Make-Up Process Once a documented absence has been approved, it is the responsibility of the student to contact the instructor within 24 hours to arrange make-up coursework. Course instructors will be asked to make reasonable arrangements (consistent with the syllabus) to assist the student in completing requirements of the missed coursework or exam. The following information is imperative to making up missed work and/or exam(s): It is expected that any missed work or assignments be submitted appropriately; however, the maximum make-up period shall be within seven business days of return or at the discretion of the faculty member. Students who anticipate an absence from clinical or lab experiences must make every effort to identify a classmate to switch hours with, in consultation with the student's clinical coordinator (not applicable for all academic programs). Students may be required to repeat a rotation due to the absence. Students may be required to take an exam before the absence or at the discretion of the faculty member. Students are responsible for obtaining class/lab notes for missed material. While a student may be granted an excused absence, some absences may not justify make-up work because faculty may not be able to replicate the experience. In such cases, this policy should be in the syllabus and the determination made by the school dean in collaboration with the instructor. If an acceptable agreement between the student and professor(s) cannot be reached regarding completion of missed work, the school dean or designee will serve as arbitrator. Required Documentation and/or Meeting Bereavement: Documentation is needed for a student absence lasting three days or fewer for the death of an immediate family member. A copy of the obituary, funeral service card, or death certificate is required. o A meeting with the Office of Student Affairs office on your campus is required for an excused absence request for bereavement lasting more than three days or where travel to another country or U.S. region is required. o Immediate family is defined as grandparent, parent/guardian, sibling, child, or spouse/partner. Religious observance: * Documentation is not needed. More information may be requested. o A meeting and/or required documentation may be requested from the Office of Student Affairs on a student's respective campus for an excused absence request for religious observance for a holy day. Family emergency: Documentation is needed for a student absence lasting three days or fewer for an immediate family member's hospitalization or other emergency. o A meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus is required for an absence lasting more than three days that is related to a family emergency. o Immediate family is defined as parent/guardian, sibling, child, or spouse/partner. 104 May 17, 2021 o Illness / medical reason: Student absence related to illness or medical care requires documentation from a healthcare provider. o Documentation includes a letter or information on letterhead from the office of a physician or medical clinic. If the student requires recovery time these dates should be included in the documentation. If a student has a contagious illness (e.g., H1N1), or has surgery, the University may require the student to present a second medical notice clearing the student to return to campus and/or a clinical site. Immutable appointment: Student absence lasting three days or fewer for jury duty, court date related to personal safety/well-being, or University-related conference (i.e., career days, ACPE professional development). Documented absences for a period of more than three days require a meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus. For a student who has three or more documented absences in one semester for a single course or clinical experience, a meeting with the Student Affairs office on your campus may be required. Documented absences for circumstances not covered above should be directed to the Office of Student Affairs office on your campus. *Religious observance: With respect to students, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 151C, section 2B, reads in relevant part as follows: Any student in an educational or vocational training institution ... who is unable, because of their religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination or study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study or work requirement which they may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided, however, that such make-up examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such school. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the said student such opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of their availing themselves of the provisions of this section. Documented absences are not granted for the following (please note this is not an inclusive list): Plane reservations after the start of the term or during midterm or final exam periods Weather conditions Transportation/commuter issues Poor time management Travel for a holiday Social Events (weddings, birthday celebrations, reunions, etc.) Special Considerations Related to COVID-19 Given the ongoing concern regarding the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Massachusetts and New Hampshire Department of Public Health (DPH) have provided guidance on precautionary measures. MCPHS is implementing revisions to this policy to provide the flexibility needed concerning absences for students who are either feeling sick, if they must self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, or if they come into contact with persons who have COVID-19. Students who are sick must stay at home or current residence and quarantine until their symptoms have resolved and are fever-free for 24 hours. Students who are symptomatic and test positive must stay at home or current residence to isolate and retest as negative without symptoms and are fever-free for 24 hours. In such cases, students must notify their course faculty or preceptor at the time of the absence (as outlined in this policy). Students must still submit a completed Documented Absence Request Form via Student Affairs on their respective campus. If documentation is not submitted when the form is completed, the student must explain the circumstances for the absence. Submissions that are related to COVID-19 symptoms will be shared with the University's COVID-19 Team. It remains the responsibility of the student to contact their instructor(s) within 24 hours to arrange make-up coursework as specified in the policy. Absences for a period of more than three days will require a conference call with the Student Affairs office on your campus. Please note that it is essential that students follow the most current CDC and DPH guidelines. Please refer to the CDC website for current information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html. Students should practice CDC and DPH precautionary measures and seek consultation and instructions from a medical provider if: they are experiencing a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing) and who have either traveled to a country/region as specified with risk by the CDC or 105 May 17, 2021 have had close contact with someone who is sick and being evaluated for COVID-19 or who has received a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Documented Absence Procedure for Students in Service MCPHS University recognizes the important contributions made by U.S. Armed Forces status consisting of Active Duty, U.S. Military, Veteran, Armed Forces, U.S. Reserves or National Guard, The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and military students in service to their home country. The University understands that students may be called into active military service for periods or be required to be absent from class for shorter durations to fulfill military obligations. Military students may have required military activities which cause a student to be absent from class for a short period. Once the student is aware of call to duty, the student must discuss their circumstances with the Dean of Students Office (DOS) and their faculty. Documentation Students must provide maximum advance notice of absences and provide copies of their official military documentation such as: Paper or electronic Orders Leave and Earning Statement a unit's Memorandum It is the responsibility of the student to notify the DOS in a timely fashion. The DOS will work with the student, faculty and other student serving offices to best support the student. Please note, if a student is fulfilling military obligations for a country other than the United States, the Center for International Studies (CIS) may be notified. Faculty Notification/Communication It is the responsibility of the student to request the opportunity to complete missed work and to complete coursework according to the terms mutually agreed upon between the instructor and the student. The instructor may award an Incomplete (I) Grade if the excused absence is near the end of the class and the student has completed all but a small portion of the coursework in accordance with the Incomplete Grade Policy. Clinical/Rotations Students must contact their preceptor and clinical coordinator if their absence(s) will impact their clinical rotations. Notification to clinical preceptors and clinical coordinators must comply with expectations outlined in clinical rotation syllabi and program handbooks. Military Families Student Affairs stands ready to support spouses or dependent children of military members or service members of the armed forces who are students. Please contact the DOS for further support. Examples of Active-Duty Military Absence include but are not limited to: Individual or unit calls to active duty for deployment Natural disaster response Receipt of military permanent change of station orders Funeral honor guard details Periodic training/drill obligations ROTC field training exercises Instructor Absence If a faculty member is unable to conduct classes as scheduled, every effort will be made to offer substitute instruction for the students. Planned absences due to professional commitments should be approved by the school dean well in advance so that suitable coverage or alternative assignments may be arranged. The school dean should be informed as soon as possible of any unplanned absences due to illness or personal emergency so that students can be notified in a timely manner. Classes can be canceled only with the approval of the school dean or, in the absence of the school dean, the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Academic Progress The academic standing of each student will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester at each campus, including summer sessions. All students will be reviewed by the school in which they are enrolled. Summer sessions are reviewed to evaluate student academic progress. 106 May 17, 2021 Each school has specific academic progress standards (e.g., minimum grade point average requirements, minimum grades for required courses) that must be met in order to progress within the degree program (see Good Academic Standing). Students who fail to meet the minimum standards required for academic progress will be notified of the decision by the school's Academic Standing Committee (ASC). Academic Warning At multiple points during each semester, faculty members submit academic warnings via WebAdvisor, which are processed by the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on each campus. Students who receive academic warnings will be notified by their academic departments/programs by email to their official MCPHS emails and provided additional instructions. Boston: Each student placed on academic warning will be encouraged to attend academic skill-building workshops and to meet with their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. These actions may be required of students who receive more than one academic warning (as stipulated in a letter from their school dean). Worcester/Manchester: Each student placed on academic warning will be required (as stipulated in his or her notification letter) to meet with an Academic Counselor in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Worcester/Manchester) and meet with a faculty advisor. There is no appeal process associated with an academic warning. Academic Probation Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester by the Academic Standing Committee (ASC) for their school, and each student's professional (if applicable) and cumulative grade point averages (GPAs) will be determined. A student with a professional and/or cumulative GPA below the requirement for his or her major shall be placed on academic probation and receive a letter from their Academic Dean or Program Director. This written notice of probationary status also will include a notice that failure to reach the required GPA by the end of the designated academic semester may result in dismissal from the University. Each student on probation is required to meet with a designated member of the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) on their home campus by the end of the second week of the probationary semester to develop and agree to\u2014in writing\u2014an Academic Success Plan (ASP). The ASP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student success. Probationary status may remain in effect for up to two consecutive academic terms, defined as two semesters or two clinical clerkships, depending upon the student's year and/or campus of enrollment. It is expected that students on probation make progress toward good academic standing at the conclusion of each academic term. Failure to demonstrate improvement at the end of the first probationary period may result in dismissal. At the conclusion of the second consecutive academic term, the student must have achieved good academic standing; failure to do so may result in dismissal. Upon completion of each academic term, a student on academic probation will receive a notice of his or her current standing in writing from the school dean. Individual programs may have specific grade point requirements that students must meet in order to enter the professional years and associated clerkships of their programs. These program-specific requirements preempt the probation process for the preprofessional years. For information about program-specific requirements for the professional years, students should contact the appropriate school dean and refer to the Good Academic Standing chart. There is no appeals process associated with academic probation. Academic Dismissal Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester by the appropriate Academic Standing Committee (ASC). Each student's professional (if applicable) and cumulative GPAs will be determined. If a student's GPA falls below the level of good academic standing, as defined by the program requirements, for two consecutive academic semesters, the ASC will submit a recommendation for dismissal from the program to the appropriate school dean. Courses may be attempted no more than two times. Grades of F and W are considered attempts for courses in which D or better is the passing grade. For those courses in which the passing grade is higher (e.g., C-, C), grades below the passing grade and W are all considered attempts. Failure to complete any course within these limits will result in an ASC recommendation for dismissal from the degree program to the school dean. 107 May 17, 2021 Individual programs may have specific grade point requirements that students must meet in order to enter the professional years and associated clerkships of their programs. These program-specific requirements preempt the dismissal process for the preprofessional years, and students failing to meet them may be subject to dismissal. For information about program-specific requirements for the professional years, students should contact the appropriate school dean and refer to the Good Academic Standing chart. A student recommended for dismissal may be continued by the school dean with or without conditions. If the school dean accepts the dismissal recommendation, the student will receive written notice of dismissal from the school dean. The notice will include procedures for appeal and will direct students to meet with an advisor to discuss a potential change of program. All change of programs must be finalized by the end of the add/drop period for the next enrolled semester. If students do not successfully appeal or meet the change of program deadline they will be administratively withdrawn from the university. Administrative withdrawal letters will include notice of loss of housing, financial aid, and registration. The following offices/individuals will be notified: Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, Dean of Students, Office of the Registrar, Residential Living and Learning, Information Services, Public Safety, Student Financial Services and Immigration Services/International Academic Services (if applicable). Students will be required to turn in their University ID and vacate University residence halls. A student whose conduct is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the University at any time. In such a case, tuition and fees paid for the current academic semester will not be refunded. Reinstatement of Dismissed Students To be considered for readmission following dismissal by a school dean, the student must petition the Provost's Office, in writing, by the date designated in the Appeals Procedure guidelines that accompany the dismissal letter. The Provost's Office may uphold the dismissal, readmit the student, or readmit the student with conditions. If readmitted, the student's academic performance will be reviewed at the end of one academic semester. If the student has failed to meet the stipulated conditions or, in the absence of stipulated conditions, failed to meet the minimum GPA required for good academic standing in that student's program, the student will be dismissed from the University. A student who has been dismissed twice is eligible for readmission to the same degree program only if (1) the student has been away from the University for a period of 12 months, and (2) the student has demonstrated academic success through coursework taken at another institution. If these conditions are met, the student may apply for readmission to the school dean. Readmission also will depend upon the availability of space in the program. Auditing Courses\u2014No Credit (Boston) A student may audit a course with the consent of the instructor. The student must register for the course through the Office of the Registrar prior to the add/drop deadline and pay two-thirds of the tuition. The student does not earn academic credit for audited courses. Students cannot audit courses that are part of their required curriculum. Change of Program (Boston) A student requesting a change of program must schedule an appointment with their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) to discuss the decision to apply for a change of program. Prior to this meeting, the student must have a printed copy (from WebAdvisor) of their most recent program evaluation and a program evaluation for the new program. These audits should be brought to the meeting with the coach. When a new program has been chosen, the student may be required to schedule an appointment with the director of the program to which he or she wishes to transfer. The student will submit to the program director a request for change of student status form, the program evaluation, and a \"what-if\" program evaluation, as well as a letter stating the reasons for transfer. All program requirements (available from the school dean's office) must be met. Once accepted, the program director will determine, if applicable, the new year of graduation (YOG). The student, the coach, the program director, and the appropriate school dean must sign the Change of Program form. All written correspondence regarding the decision must be sent to the student, program director, Office of the Registrar, Student Financial Services, CASE, and school dean(s). If students have outstanding coursework taken external to MCPHS, the official transcripts must be received in the Office of the Registrar no later than the add/drop deadline for the term of entry. The student will receive official change of status email from the Office of the Registrar notifying them of requested program change. In order to register for classes in the new program, the completed and approved request for Change of Program form must be on file in the Office of the Registrar. Once admitted to a new program, a student must adhere to the program and GPA requirements commensurate with his or her new YOG. Depending on the intended new program, first-year students may change majors only after grades have been reviewed following the fall or spring semester. Students may begin the Change of Program process early, but they must meet with a coach in the CASE to review the Change of Program procedures, petition, and timeline. 108 May 17, 2021 If a student moves from the Worcester/Manchester PharmD program to any program in Boston, he or she will receive transfer credit for any courses that would be applied to the degree program, and the secondary degree would begin with a new degree audit. In this case, the residency requirement would be waived. Students cannot transfer from the Worcester or Manchester PharmD program into the Boston PharmD program. Recalculation of the Grade Point Average Students who wish to remove courses from their grade point average that are not required for the new program should note their request on the Change of Program form. All grades will remain on the transcript (and program evaluation), with the notation that they are not included in the grade point average. These requests must be approved by the new academic dean. Students who leave a program not in good academic standing and wish to move to another degree program or be readmitted to their former program must meet the grade point requirements of that YOG and program (see Good Academic Standing). Students who leave the PharmD program not in good standing must complete the new program and meet the grade point average requirement required by the School of Pharmacy-Boston before seeking readmission into the PharmD program. An additional change of program may result in courses being added back to the GPA. Admission to Classes No student will be admitted to a scheduled class unless the student's name is on the instructor's class roster, and the student's account is in order. Attendance The University expects students to meet attendance requirements in all courses in order to qualify for credit. Attendance requirements may vary depending on the instructor, and these should be clearly stated in the syllabus available to each student during the first week of the course. Generally, students are expected to attend all classes unless they have a valid excuse. (See Documented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure). Student Conduct / Community Standards An instructor shall have the right to require a student who is disruptive during a class, laboratory, or experiential rotation to leave for the remainder of the session and shall report the incident to the Student Affairs office on their campus for further appropriate action in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct. Public Safety may also be notified. Instructional Periods Faculty members are expected not to continue any class beyond the scheduled ending time. Unless students have been informed that the faculty member will be late, class is canceled if a faculty member has not arrived within 10 minutes of the scheduled starting time of a class. Online and Distance Education The majority of courses at MCPHS are conducted in physical classrooms and labs. However, in addition to programs offered entirely online or in an executive or hybrid format, some required and elective courses may be delivered online and/or through distance education. In participating in online or distance education courses, students learn in different ways and must manage a technologically mediated environment. This learning will be of value both in the completion of degree requirements and in the workplace. Increasingly, workplaces utilize technology for training and work. Minimum Class Size By noon on the Friday of the first week of classes, the school dean will make the following decision regarding offering a class, based on enrollment: Required courses will be offered unless offered more than once in a calendar year. If five or fewer students register for a required course that is offered more than once in a calendar year, the course may be canceled (programmatic requirements considered). Elective courses will be offered provided there is a minimum of eight students enrolled. Registration It is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure that only properly registered students are allowed to attend class. If a student's name does not appear on the class roster in WebAdvisor after the add/drop period, that student shall not be allowed to attend, participate in, or take or receive exams until the instructor is notified by the Office of the Registrar that the student is officially registered. 109 May 17, 2021 Course Policies Academic Honesty (See Academic Honesty Policy under University Policies & Procedures section of the University Catalog). Credit Hour Policy The credit hour policy applies to all courses at all levels (graduate, professional and undergraduate) that award academic credit regardless of the mode of delivery including, but not limited to, self-paced, online, hybrid, lecture, research, clinical and laboratory. Academic units are responsible for ensuring that credit hours are awarded only for work that meets the requirements outlined in this policy. A lecture period of 50 minutes per week or laboratory work of 110 to 220 minutes per week, extending over one semester, constitutes one academic credit hour. For each hour of lecture, students are expected to spend a minimum of two hours outside of class preparing for the course. For research, clinical/experiential rotations and service-learning activities, actual hours may vary by program, but such activities must include an amount of work that is at least equivalent to lecture and laboratory courses. Assessment All materials, in whatever format, submitted by students for evaluation in MCPHS courses may be used by MCPHS for program or institutional assessment. To the extent possible, individual identification will be removed from these materials before they are used for assessment purposes. Colleges of the Fenway A Colleges of the Fenway (COF) student enrolled in an MCPHS course through COF cross-registration must notify the course instructor and provide them with an email address to ensure that course information is received in a timely manner. The student also should consult with the instructor regarding access to online applications that might be used in the course. Disabilities Students with documented disabilities who wish to request accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) should contact the Office of Student Access and Accommodations at 617.879.5995 and/or dss@mcphs.edu to discuss the accommodations process. Writing-Intensive Courses (for all HUM courses and others designated as writing intensive) The MCPHS faculty believes that learning in all disciplines is an integrative process, a synthesis of critical reading, thinking, and writing. Students not only must learn to write but also must write to learn. Consequently, writing-intensive courses require students to write 15 to 20 pages in two or more assignments that may take various forms as determined by the course instructor. In addition, instructors dedicate class time to the teaching of writing in their specific disciplines, provide feedback on assignments, and allow revision of at least one assignment. Writing Proficiency Requirement (Boston only) MCPHS-Boston students in all baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are expected to meet the University's standards for writing proficiency, which include the general standards for writing competency as delineated in the University's writing proficiency rubric, and specific applications of those standards by faculty in disciplines across the University curricula. Students who do not perform at a satisfactory level of writing proficiency may be referred to the Writing Center and may be required to demonstrate writing improvement to receive full course credit. (For details, see the Writing Proficiency Requirement\u2014Boston section of this catalog.) The writing proficiency rubric is available on the Writing Center Web page at https://my.mcphs.edu. Transfer Policy (Boston) MCPHS does not award transfer credit for remedial or developmental skills courses or other courses that are taught at levels below the first-year level at MCPHS. This includes English courses on sentence and paragraph structure or similar content courses below the level of LIB 111 (Expository Writing I), mathematics courses in arithmetic or algebra if below the level of MAT 141 (Algebra and Trigonometry), and biology and chemistry courses below the level of the MCPHS first-year courses required for the program to which the student seeks entrance. Transfer courses will not be accepted as fulfillment of the core curriculum requirements in the liberal arts distribution areas if they are taught in the first year of a University curriculum. Liberal arts courses acceptable for transfer credit must 110 May 17, 2021 have prerequisite requirements and must be taken during the student's second or subsequent year in a University curriculum. Transfer Credits Post Matriculation Once a student has matriculated at the University, no courses taken outside of MCPHS will be accepted for transfer credit. (NOTE: COF courses are allowed for Boston students.) Exceptions to this policy may be granted in instances involving delay of graduation or extreme hardship. Prior to taking a course for transfer credit at another institution, students must submit a Petition to Transfer Credit form to the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, which approves or denies the petition. Notification of the decision will be distributed to (1) the student, (2) the program director, (3) the school dean, (4) the Office of the Registrar, and (5) others as appropriate. The student is responsible for requesting that official transcripts be sent to the Office of the Registrar, which will verify the credit and post a grade of TR in the student's transcript. Official transcripts must be received no later than the add/drop deadline of the subsequent semester. These petitions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may take up to two weeks to receive official notification. Students are advised not to enroll in or make payments for non-MCPHS courses without official University approval. Minimum Transfer Grade The minimum grade for receiving transfer credit is C (2.0). This may vary for some academic programs, please check the good standing chart under Course Policies section for minimum grade requirements. Studio Art and Performance Courses (Boston) A maximum of one studio art or performance course may be taken for credit at another institution, including the Colleges of the Fenway. Studio art courses may be accepted for general elective credit only, not for liberal arts distribution credit. Credit by Examination Credit by examination is available to students whose previous coursework in a subject area does not meet transfer credit criteria or who feel they have achieved competency in a subject through work or life experience. Credit by examination is available to new students only during the student's first semester of matriculation at the University, no later than the add/drop deadline of the term of entry. Competency may be demonstrated through one of the following means: (1) College Level Examination Program (CLEP), (2) Advanced Placement (AP) examination, or (3) International Baccalaureate (IB) examination. The College Board administers CLEP and AP examinations. A passing score on the CLEP examination in English Composition with Essay will be accepted as credit for Expository Writing I. A passing score on the CLEP examination in Freshman College Composition with Essay will be accepted as credit for Expository Writing II. CLEP credit will be awarded only after the Admission Office has received official scores directly from the College Board. In the case of AP examinations, credit will be awarded for a score of 4.0 or higher. No AP credit will be awarded for CHE 131 Chemical Principles I, CHE 132 Chemical Principles II, CHE 110 Basic Chemistry I, or CHE 210 Basic Chemistry II. No AP credit will be awarded to students in the Premedical Health Studies program for BIO 151 Biology I or BIO 152 Biology II. AP and IB exceptions: Chemistry AP scores of 4 or better will be accepted as transfer credit for CHE 131 and CHE 132 for students who matriculate at MCPHS with existing college credit for organic chemistry. Transfer students accepted into the professional phase of an MCPHS degree program will receive transfer credit for IB courses accepted by a previous college. In both of these instances, official AP and/or IB exam documentation must be provided to MCPHS no later than the add/drop deadline of the term of entry. Students who complete IB courses must provide high school transcripts and/or IB reports that document the course, examination level, and exam score. Students must achieve a score of 5 or better on an HL (high-level) IB exam. Transfer credits are limited to exams for English, language, or the arts. Students are responsible for scheduling CLEP/AP examinations through the College Board. Results/scores of the examination(s) should be sent (by the school dean if applicable) to the Admission Office. If the student achieves an acceptable score on the examination(s), then notification will be sent to (1) the student, (2) the program director, (3) the school dean, (4) the Office of the Registrar, (5) the Academic Advising Center / advisor, and (6) others as appropriate. Credit earned by examination will not be counted toward the residency requirement. 111 May 17, 2021 Clinical Rotations and Background Screenings For some MCPHS programs, placements in clinical rotations at healthcare providers are a required part of the MCPHS curriculum. Some of those healthcare providers require background screenings, and a conviction for a criminal offense might present an issue. It is possible that certain types of criminal convictions, whether prior to being a student at MCPHS or while attending MCPHS, could preclude a student from being able to complete a required clinical rotation. For more information, please contact the MCPHS Chief Compliance Officer. Cross-Registration (Boston) Cross-registration provides full-time undergraduates of the Colleges of the Fenway with the opportunity to take up to two courses per semester (fall and spring semesters) at any of the five Colleges of the Fenway institutions at no additional charge, so long as the credit load does not exceed 18 semester hours. This opportunity provides students with the advantages of a small college but exposes them to resources similar to those of a large university. Cross-registration enables students to broaden their intellectual and social capacities, and it introduces them to faculty, research, colleagues, and curricula they would not otherwise have experienced. Courses are open to cross-registration on a seat-available basis. Each school's home students have the first option to register for courses that have been developed through joint efforts of faculty across the schools, and the goal of these courses is to attract a mix of students. A searchable database of all courses open for cross-registration may be found at www.colleges-fenway.org. Detailed information about cross-registration and associated processes and policies is highlighted on the Colleges of the Fenway website (www.colleges-fenway.org). Dean's List The dean's list recognizes full-time students seeking a bachelor's degree or Doctor of Pharmacy who have completed the required full-time semester hours of credit and earn a minimum 3.50 semester GPA. Courses that are taken pass/fail do not count toward the full-time status. Doctor of Pharmacy students in Boston, Worcester, and Manchester who are completing clinical rotations are not eligible for the dean's list. Doctor of Pharmacy students in the Worcester and Manchester programs during the six-week fall semester of Year II are eligible for the dean's list. Incomplete grades that remain beyond the first three weeks of the subsequent semester render a student ineligible for the dean's list in that term. Dean's list is not awarded to students in graduate programs (i.e., MPAS, MANP, MSN, MSDH, MS, DPT, OD, and PhD). The dean's list is published approximately one month into the following semester by the Registrar's Office. Add/Drop Procedures Any registered student who wishes to adjust his or her class schedule during the designated add/drop period can make adjustments online via WebAdvisor, with the exception of students in the School of Professional Studies who can make such adjustments via Elevate. Students cross-registered for Colleges of the Fenway courses must adhere to the add/drop procedures at their home institution. The add/drop period deadline for all programs is specified for each academic term, usually within the first week of classes. Adjustments to tuition and fees, where applicable, are made automatically through the Office of Student Financial Services. Students who wish to withdraw from a course after the designated add/drop period should refer to the Withdrawal from a Course section in Academic Policies and Procedures. No refunds are made if such changes are made after the designated add/drop period. NOTE: Simply failing to attend classes will not result in the course being dropped from the student's official registration, and students will be held financially accountable and receive a course grade of F. Email Policy All MCPHS students are required to open, utilize, and maintain an MCPHS email account. Official University communications and notices are sent via MCPHS email accounts only. All students are responsible for regularly checking their MCPHS email and for the information contained therein. Only MCPHS accounts will be used in all matters related to academics, student life, and University notifications. The University does not forward MCPHS email to personal email accounts. 112 May 17, 2021 NOTE: All MCPHS community members may voluntarily register in the MCPHS Emergency Notification System to receive text messages via cell phones and email regarding major campus emergencies and campus closings. Contact helpdesk@mcphs.edu for more information. Examinations All tests and examinations, other than final examinations, are scheduled by the instructor. Students who miss a scheduled examination (i.e., classroom examination, lab, or other graded performance) and are granted a documented absence for the missed examination (see Documented Student Absence Request Policy and Procedure) must arrange a make-up exam with the course instructor. The format of the make-up exam may vary from that of the original scheduled exam and is at the discretion of the course instructor. With respect to completion of such examinations, if an acceptable agreement between the student and professor(s) cannot be reached, the school dean will serve as arbitrator. During the fall and spring semesters for undergraduate and first professional degree students, no course examinations (worth 15% or more of the final course grade) may be scheduled during the week before final examinations. Major written assignments may be due the week before finals if the assignments were semester-long and not assigned within the last four weeks of the semester. Exceptions are granted for laboratory examinations, including practical examinations. Exceptions also may be granted for block-scheduled courses, subject to approval by the Vice President for Academic Affairs (see School of Nursing, Boston, Worcester/Manchester). NOTE: Final examinations are scheduled by the Office of the Registrar several weeks before the end of the semester. Final examinations must be given only during final exam week. The final exam schedule includes make-up times for examinations canceled due to inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances (e.g., power outages, fire alarms). Students and faculty are expected to take these dates into account when planning any travel (i.e., they should not purchase nonrefundable tickets to leave before the make-up date). Posting Examination Grades Faculty do not use student identification numbers to post exam grades. Quiz, exam, and assignment grades are posted on BlackboardTM via the use of student-specific log-ons and confidential passwords. Please remember that passwords should be kept confidential. Final Grades Students may view their final grades online. Final grades are not available to students until all grades have been submitted by all faculty. The Registrar's Office will notify students via email when all grades are posted each term. Good Academic Standing To be in good academic standing, a student's cumulative and professional grade point averages (if applicable) must meet the minimums required by the degree program in which he or she is enrolled. Any student whose cumulative or professional average falls below the minimum after an academic term is considered to be on probation. Professional grade point averages are calculated only after 12 credits have been taken in professional courses (exceptions exist for the Nursing program). Cumulative or professional grade point average minimums are listed in the Good Academic Standing table in this section. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards required for academic progression will be notified of the decisions by the school's Academic Standing Committee. In order to maintain good academic standing, students should be aware that the professional curricula of the University are rigorous and demanding. Students who must be engaged in gainful employment should balance school and work responsibilities so as not to compromise their academic success. Good Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress for Financial Aid Student Financial Services disburses financial aid only to students in good academic standing who are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degrees. Refer to Student Financial Services in this catalog for further details. 113 May 17, 2021 Grading Policies Grade Appeals A student who wishes to appeal a final grade of a course must do so within two weeks of the grade being posted by the Registrar's Office. The first appeal should be in writing to the instructor, who must make a decision to uphold or change the grade within 3 business days of the appeal. The written appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal. If a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be reached (or the instructor does not respond within 3 business days), the student has 3 business days to appeal in writing to the administrator in charge of the academic unit offering the course (Department Chair, Program Director or designee). The appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal and the result of the appeal to the instructor. The academic unit administrator must decide to uphold or change the grade within 3 business days of the appeal. If this procedure does not successfully resolve the matter (or if the administrator does not rule on the matter in 3 business days), the student has 3 business days to appeal in writing to the chief administrator (School Dean or designee) overseeing the academic unit offering the course. The appeal should contain the rationale for the appeal and the results of the appeals to the instructor and the academic unit administrator. The chief administrator will uphold or change the grade and inform the student within three business days. The decision of the chief administrator is final. Decisions on grade appeals are based solely on objective grade information. If the grade appeal affects a student's progression status, the grade appeal process must be completed on or before the first day of class/clinical rotation, prior to the start of the next semester. It is the student's responsibility to initiate the grade appeal. Grade Point Average (GPA) The total number of quality points (see Grading System section of this catalog), divided by the total number of credit hours taken, yields the grade point average. The grade point average for each semester and cumulatively is calculated to two decimal points. In some degree programs, a professional grade point average also is calculated for each student by dividing the number of professional quality points by the total number of professional credit hours taken. Grade Reports At the end of each academic term, students can view their grades online via WebAdvisor. The Office of the Registrar notifies students when grades are posted.

The instructor is responsible for notifying the Office of the Registrar regarding any student who has been granted additional time for coursework completion. The instructor also must specify the extended time period, up to one semester. No student may progress to courses for which the course with an Incomplete is a prerequisite until the work is completed and the I grade is changed. Incomplete grades render a student ineligible for the dean's list. No student can graduate with an Incomplete grade in any course necessary for graduation. 119 May 17, 2021 Pass/Fail Courses A maximum of one elective course may be taken on a pass/fail basis at another institution, including the Colleges of the Fenway. A grade of P or F will appear on the MCPHS transcript for any course taken pass/fail. A pass/fail course will not affect a student's grade point average. However, a failure in such a course may have an impact on progression through the curriculum. Repeated Courses Following completion of a course repeated at MCPHS, the earlier grade will be removed from the grade point average, and the more recent grade will be used in the calculation. Both grades remain on the transcript for future reference. If the student repeats a course outside the University (see Courses Taken at Other Colleges after Matriculation), the lower grade is dropped from the grade point average, but a substitute grade is not used in the calculation. Such courses are listed as transfer credit. Courses may be attempted no more than two times. Grades of F and W are considered attempts for courses in which D or better is the passing grade. For those courses in which the passing grade is higher (e.g., C-, C), grades below the passing grade and W are all considered attempts. Failure to complete any course within these limits will result in dismissal from the degree program or major. When a curriculum change results in a course moving from one category to another (e.g., from preprofessional to professional), and a student repeats the course in the new category, the GPA will automatically be calculated in the new category. If the student wants the GPA to be calculated in the previous category, he or she must state the justification for that request via a petition for special academic request. The request is not automatically approved, and the repeated course will not be counted in both professional and preprofessional categories. Replacement of F Grades The Registrar will automatically replace the previous grade when a student repeats a course. Students are encouraged to review their current program evaluation with the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment to determine if there are existing grades that should be replaced. The timely replacement of grades is essential in determining the academic standing of students. Recalculation of the Grade Point Average Students who wish to remove courses from their grade point average that are not required for the new program should note their request on the Change of Program form. All grades will remain on the transcript (and program evaluation), with the notation that they are not included in the grade point average. These requests must be approved by the new academic dean. Students who leave a program not in good academic standing and wish to move to another degree program or be readmitted to their former program must meet the grade point requirements of that YOG and program (see Good Academic Standing). Students who leave the PharmD program not in good standing must complete the new program and meet the grade point average requirement required by the School of Pharmacy-Boston before seeking readmission into the PharmD program. An additional change of program may result in courses being added back to the GPA. Graduation Policies Eligibility The University recognizes three graduation dates during the academic year: September 1st and dates specified on the academic calendar for December and May. A formal Commencement ceremony is held once per year for all campuses in May. A December Commencement ceremony is held for degree programs with December completion dates. In order to be eligible to receive a degree on one of the above official graduation dates, students must complete all degree requirements (including coursework, experiential education, instructional requirements, and financial clearance) by the following deadlines: May Last day of spring semester final exam period* September Last day of summer 12-week semester December Last day of fall semester final exam period* Students who have completed degree requirements by the last day of the spring semester final exam period, or who earned their degree the previous September or December, are eligible to participate in the formal May Commencement 120 May 17, 2021 ceremony. Students who will complete all degree requirements by the last day of summer-12 week semester are eligible to participate. Students are eligible to participate in the Commencement ceremony only as noted above. In the event of incomplete requirements (including outstanding financial balances), the school dean will make a change in the student's date of graduation (via the Change of Year of Graduation form). It is the responsibility of the individual student to ensure that they meet all degree requirements on schedule or risk delay in graduation. Graduation with Honors Summa cum laude 3.86-4.00 Magna cum laude 3.70-3.85 Cum laude The determination of honors is based on the graduate's final cumulative grade point average. Only students seeking a bachelor's degree or Doctor of Pharmacy who have completed at least 60 credits at MCPHS, or such number of credits that is applicable for completion of a given degree program, are eligible for honors. Honors designations appear on the student's final grade transcript but not on the diploma. First honor graduates are recognized during the Commencement ceremony. In order to be considered a first honor graduate, one must be a student in a full-time undergraduate or entry-level program with at least three years of residency (except accelerated and/or fast track degree programs) and must not have earned any graduate or other advanced degree. Petition to Graduate Students must file a Petition to Graduate form online. Deadlines for submitting the forms also are posted online. Upon determination of completed requirements, students will be approved for graduation. In the event of incomplete requirements, the school dean will make a change in the student's year of graduation (YOG) via the Program Evaluation Update form. The student will be notified of this change and encouraged to meet with his or her program director and/or the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston) to ensure satisfactory program completion within the new YOG. All tuition and fees must be paid to the University prior to graduation. Year of Graduation Whenever a student falls out of sequence in the curriculum of an academic program, takes a leave of absence, or changes program, a change to year of graduation (YOG) may occur. If requesting to change programs, a student must complete a Change of Program form as part of the request to the school dean. The program director and school dean will review the request for change of YOG as part of the acceptance process. The completed and signed Change of Program form will be distributed to (1) the school dean, (2) the student, (3) the Office of the Registrar, (4) Student Financial Services, (5) the program director, and (6) the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston, Worcester/Manchester). Leave of Absence The University recognizes that there are situations when a student may require a leave of absence (LOA). Such leaves are granted for a maximum of one academic year with the exception of leaves granted for military service. The student must meet to consult with their Academic Dean or designee regarding the reason(s) for considering, and the ramifications of, taking a leave of absence. After the initial meeting with the Academic Dean or designee, the student must return the completed Leave of Absence form within 1 week (or 5 business days) with the required signatures: a) the student, b) Academic Dean or designee, c) Student Financial Services, and d) Immigration Services representative (for international students). The Academic Dean or designee will notify the student within 1 week (or 5 business days) upon receipt of the completed form with the finalized LOA requirements via the student's MCPHS email account. Students who take a leave after the designated add/drop period will receive course grade(s) of W. *For information on a Health/Medical Leave of Absence, please see the Health/Medical Leave of Absence section in this catalog. Return from Leave of Absence Students returning from a leave of absence must confirm they are returning to MCPHS University with their Academic Dean or designee prior to the following dates: March 1-for a summer or fall semester return October 1-for a spring semester return Online students-30 days prior to the beginning of the semester 121 May 17, 2021 Students on a Leave of Absence are not eligible for University Services, with the exception of academic coaching. Students who intend to return from a LOA must also review and adhere to applicable school/program specific policies in addition to the general policy outlined herein. Students who fail to return within the designated time must reapply for admission. Double Majors (Boston) Students enrolled in selected BS degree programs (Boston) may declare a double major. Accelerated, degree completion, online, MPAS, Nursing, PharmD, Premedical Health Studies, and Health Sciences programs cannot be used in double majors. In addition, a double major in Public Health and Health Psychology is not available. Students who declare a double major cannot complete a minor. In order to be eligible for a double major, the student must have a grade point average (GPA) of 3.2 or higher and have completed at least 30 credits. Once students have been approved for a double major, they are required to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 for the remainder of their studies. Students should note that only one degree will be conferred. Due to scheduling conflicts and/or additional course requirements, students may need to take more than 18 credits per semester and/or enroll in summer semester(s) in order to graduate with their class. In cases where courses overlap between majors, general elective credit may need to apply to one of the courses. It is recommended that students check with Student Financial Services to discuss how the additional course requirements might affect their financial aid status. In order to be considered for a double major, candidates should contact their Academic Coach in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (Boston) and complete the Application for Double Major form, which requires approval of relevant program directors and deans. Minors (Boston) Students who wish to pursue a minor must complete a Declaration of Minor form, which is available in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment. The Declaration of Minor form must be forwarded to (1) the student, (2) the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment, and (3) the Office of the Registrar. Requirements for completion of some minors vary for students in the Premedical Health Studies program. These variations are outlined in the Bachelor of Science in Premedical Health Studies section of this catalog. Registration for Classes Prior to the start of preregistration for each term, the Registrar's Office will notify students (via MCPHS email) of the registration schedule. The email will indicate if students will be block registered for required courses or if students need to meet with an Academic Advisor before registering for classes. Students who register on time receive an electronic bill from Student Financial Services. Students who miss the registration period are charged a late registration fee. Students who have outstanding balances are not allowed to register or attend classes until all bills are paid in full. Nonmatriculating Students Students that have not been formally granted admission to an MCPHS academic program may take credit-bearing courses at either the undergraduate or graduate level as a non-matriculated student in the School of Professional Studies. Students may take courses for professional or personal development, to satisfy prerequisite requirements for entry to a degree program, or to transfer credits to another institution. Students must meet all prerequisites to enroll in a course. Course credits earned as a non-matriculated student do not automatically apply toward a degree program at MCPHS University. Students later admitted to an MCPHS academic program may request their non-matriculated coursework be transferred with approval of the appropriate program director or academic dean. In order for coursework to be transferred it must meet one of the following: Undergraduate degree program students may transfer a maximum of four undergraduate courses not to exceed 14 credits for courses in which students earned a C or better. Masters level degree program students may transfer a maximum of two graduate courses not to exceed 8 credits for courses in which students earned a B or better. Doctoral level degree program students may transfer a maximum of three graduate courses not to exceed 12 credits for courses in which students earned a B or better. In rare instances, exceptions may be granted for students completing prerequisite requirements with approval of the appropriate program director or academic dean. 122 May 17, 2021 Visiting Students (Boston) Visiting students (those enrolled in degree programs at institutions other than members of the Colleges of the Fenway) also may register for classes at the University. Such students must provide documentation of good academic standing from their home institution before completing their registration. Visiting students may register on a seat-available basis and only after the designated period when matriculated students have completed the registration process. Such students may obtain registration materials at the Office of the Registrar. This same policy also applies to students from other MCPHS campuses. In the case of nonmatriculated and visiting students, it is expected that such students will adhere to the academic requirements as set forth by the instructor(s) and stated in the course syllabus. Residency Requirement Students must complete (1) at least half of the required credits for a degree and (2) all professional course requirements in the respective degree program in residence at MCPHS. In special cases, the school dean may allow transfer credit for professional courses provided the student is able to demonstrate competency in the subject. If a program does not have specified professional courses, then half of all credits must be taken in residence. At least one-half of the courses required for a minor must be completed while in residence at MCPHS. \"In residence\" is defined as being registered for and enrolled in MCPHS courses, whether the courses are delivered using traditional, hybrid, distance delivery, or online methods. Colleges of the Fenway courses are credited as MCPHS courses (including the number of credits). An exception to the residency requirement is granted to those who hold licensure in a discipline and are enrolled in an MCPHS baccalaureate degree completion option. The residency requirement for such students is a minimum of 30 semester credits of MCPHS-approved courses. Bachelor of Science Completion Policy In order to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree at MCPHS University, a student must complete the final 30 credits of their degree program enrolled in MCPHS University courses or through an MCPHS approved articulation agreement. Transcripts Copies of official transcripts must be requested in writing and bear the signature of the requesting student. Current students may request transcripts online via WebAdvisor. Transcripts are furnished to designated institutions or authorized agencies only when the student submits a completed transcript authorization form. Transcripts are issued to those students whose financial status with Student Financial Services is clear. Visiting Classes A person may visit a class in which they are not officially enrolled only with prior consent of the instructor. Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Policies Administrative Withdrawal Section 1: Administrative Withdrawal An administrative withdrawal will mean that a student's preregistration or registration, housing, meal plan, and financial aid for the current semester will be canceled. The student will be unable to register or preregister for any subsequent semester until the administrative withdrawal is resolved. A student may be administratively withdrawn by the University if any of the following conditions apply: a. If, after due notice, the student fails to satisfy an overdue financial obligation to the University, consisting of tuition, loans, board, room fees, library charges, or other student charges, including student activities, health insurance, graduation fees, and other such fees as may be established by the University b. If the student fails to comply with certain administrative requirements, including, without limitation, the submission of immunization forms, satisfaction of technical standards, or completion of SEVIS registration c. If the student fails to attend classes during the first two weeks of the semester d. If the student fails to register for the coming semester Section 2: Effects of Administrative Withdrawal If a student is administratively withdrawn, their record will indicate the withdrawal date and the reason for administrative withdrawal. All courses for which a student is registered at the time of withdrawal will receive a grade of W until or unless the student is reinstated. The student shall not be allowed to preregister or register for a future semester. If a student has already preregistered at 123 May 17, 2021 the time of withdrawal, all preregistration course requests will be canceled. The student shall receive no further material or notification from the registrar concerning University affairs once administratively withdrawn. Section 3: Procedures for Implementing Administrative Withdrawal The registrar will send a letter to a student administratively withdrawn from the University. The administrative withdrawal must be based on one of the grounds set forth in Section 1. Administrative withdrawal notifications are sent to the students via MCPHS email and a hard copy is also mailed to the home address on file. Section 4: Appeals and Reinstatement Administrative withdrawal reinstatements must be resolved within two weeks of receipt of the administrative withdrawal notification letter. Appeals must be submitted by the student to the Office of Student Affairs within one week of receiving the notification by completing this online appeal form: http://tinyurl.com/yxgmjf2n. The appeal should include a description of the actions the student has taken to resolve the matter and the reasons why the student is entitled to reinstatement Appeals will be reviewed for reinstatement. The Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the Academic Dean or Program Director, Student Financial Services and Immigration Services (if applicable) will approve or deny the reinstatement within 1 week after receiving the student appeal letter. In semesters beyond those from which the student was administratively withdrawn, the student may be required to file a readmission application by the stated deadline for enrollment in the next available semester. Return from Hospitalization A student is required to meet with a representative from the Office of Student Affairs before returning to campus following treatment for a health condition that required hospitalization. Hospitalization is determined when a student has been admitted to a hospital and/or a healthcare facility. A student who has been hospitalized cannot to be on campus, return to class, or participate in any University related activity until cleared by the Office of Student Affairs. It is the responsibility of the student to contact the Office of Student Affairs to set up the Return from Hospitalization meeting. If the health condition that the student was hospitalized for is not related to mental health, a representative from the Office of Student Affairs will meet with the student and review all documentation obtained by the student. The student must obtain and have ready for the return meeting(s) the post-hospitalization discharge summary, along with any other documentation that was given to the student by the facility where the hospitalization occurred. The representative from Student Affairs will make a determination if the student is able to return to campus. The decision of the representative from Student Affairs will be delivered to the student in writing following the meeting. If the health condition is related to mental health, the student will also be required to meet with a representative from Counseling Services. The Office of Student Affairs will coordinate with Counseling Services to schedule the return meetings. The student must obtain and have ready for the return meeting(s) the post-hospitalization discharge summary, along with any other documentation that was given to the student by the facility where the hospitalization occurred. A representative from Counseling Services will meet with the student and review the documentation obtained by the student from the facility where the hospitalization occurred. After this meeting, the representative from Counseling Services will make a recommendation to the Office of Student Affairs on whether or not the student is able to return to class. A representative from the Office of Student Affairs will then meet with the student, and based on the outcome of the meeting and the recommendation from Counseling Services, the representative from Student Affairs will make a determination if the student is able to return to campus. The decision of the representative from Student Affairs will be delivered to the student in writing following the meeting. Health/Medical Leave of Absence A Health/Medical Leave of Absence may be appropriate when a student's current physical or behavioral health condition precludes successful complete of their educational program. In addition to following the steps outlined for a general Leave of Absence, a student seeking a Health/Medical Leave of Absence must submit medical documentation from the student's medical provider to the Office of Student Affairs. This documentation must indicate the medical reasons the student is unable to attend classes for the requested time period. In conjunction with submitting this documentation, the student must meet with representatives from Student Affairs on their respective campus and complete appropriate paperwork. At least one full academic semester must have passed before returning to the University under a Health/Medical Leave of Absence. 124 May 17, 2021 Return from Health/Medical Leave of Absence In addition to the general Leave of Absence steps for returning to the University, a student will provide to the Office of Student Affairs, on their respective campus, documentation from the student's medical provider that indicates the student's readiness to return to class, that includes: a diagnosis of the condition that led to the student's leave; the student's length and course of treatment; the student's current medical health status; recommendations necessary for ongoing care; recommendation that student can safely return to classes with either full-time status or a reduced course load; any noted restrictions including those related to technical requirements of the student's academic program. A student will also need to meet with a representative from the Office of Student Affairs to finalize the Return process. Involuntary Health/Medical Leave of Absence The Dean of Students or designee may issue an involuntary health withdrawal, whether or not the student's behavior violates the Student Code of Conduct. An involuntary health leave of absence must involve a strong likelihood of a. serious risk of physical harm to the student themself, manifested by evidence of threats of suicide or attempts at suicide or other serious bodily harm; b. serious risk of physical harm to other persons in the community, including an infectious condition or evidence of homicidal or other violent behavior; and/or c. reasonable risk of physical impairment or injury to the student themself because of impaired judgment that would not allow the student to live independently or protect them in the community or not allow the student to perform the essential functions of an educational program without requiring substantial modification of the program. Process for Involuntary Leave of Absence Report and Initial Meeting Upon receiving a report documenting the behavior(s) that indicate why a student should be put on involuntary health leave, the Dean of Students or designee will meet with the student regarding the report. Suspension Pending Determination The student may be suspended immediately from the University or University residence hall pending the determination of the involuntary health leave of absence when, on the basis of the information available, the University reasonably believes that the student's continued presence on campus endangers the physical safety or well-being of themselves or others or seriously disrupts the educational process of the University. Either before suspension or as promptly as is feasible, the student will be given the opportunity to be heard and present evidence as to why they should not be immediately suspended. Evaluation The Dean of Students or designee may inform the student orally or in writing that they must participate in a medical or mental health evaluation conducted by one of the following: a. MCPHS Executive Director of Counseling Services or designee (in the case of psychological disorder) b. An independent evaluator (licensed social worker, licensed mental health counselor, licensed psychologist [including psychiatrist], or licensed medical doctor) selected by the student at the student's expense The student must sign a release of information form authorizing the evaluator to consult with MCPHS staff regarding the evaluation. The evaluation must be completed within 24 hours of the date of written or verbal notice or as soon as reasonable, as determined by the Dean of Students or designee. The Dean of Students or designee may grant an extension for completion. If the student fails to complete or refuses to participate in an evaluation when referred, they may be issued an involuntary health leave of absence. 125 May 17, 2021 Determination Upon completion of the evaluation, the MCPHS staff member who conducts or consults in the evaluation will make a recommendation to the Dean of Students or designee. An opportunity must be provided for the student to discuss the recommendations with the MCPHS staff member who conducted or consulted in the evaluation and with the Dean of Students or designee. The student will be given the opportunity to be heard and present evidence as to why they should not be issued an involuntary health leave of absence. The Dean of Students or designee will make a determination and inform the student in writing. Effective Date Once the involuntary health leave of absence is issued, the terms of the leave become effective immediately. A student's record will indicate the leave date and the reason for involuntary health leave. All courses for which a student is registered at the time of leave will receive a grade of W, and the refund policy as outlined in the University catalog will be followed. Requests for special consideration regarding the refund policy (e.g., leave date beyond the refund date) may be made to the Dean of Students. The safety of the student while on campus must be assured. Advance notice of an involuntary health leave is recommended only when the safety of the student while on campus is assured. In the case of emergencies, no advance notice may be possible. Appeal A student who has been issued an involuntary health leave of absence may appeal the decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs in writing within five business days of receiving the decision. The student's reasons for the appeal and the desired resolution must be indicated in the letter. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will consider the case within five business days of the request for an appeal. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is final and will be communicated to the student in writing. Return after Leave of Absence In order to remove the conditions of the leave of absence, the student must present medical documentation that the behavior no longer precludes successful completion of an educational program. The student also must participate in an evaluation conducted by University staff, by an established deadline, and write a letter to the Dean of Students or designee detailing the student's readiness to return to the University. In most cases, at least one academic semester must have passed before readmission under an involuntary health leave may be considered. Deviations from Established Policies Reasonable deviations from this policy will not invalidate a decision or proceeding unless significant prejudice to a student may result. Withdrawal from a Course Students may withdraw from a course through the end of the 10th week of the fall or spring semester; in the summer session, withdrawal must be by the end of the 3rd week. No refunds are given after the end of the official add/drop period. After the official add/drop period, students who choose to withdraw receive a grade of W for the course. The withdrawal slip must be signed by the student's academic coach. Every registered student who remains in a course is given a grade. Simply failing to attend classes does not constitute course withdrawal. Students taking self-paced prerequisite courses in the School of Professional Studies may request to be withdrawn through the end of the 16th week. Once a final grade is given, a withdrawal will not be considered. Withdrawal requests must be submitted in the Student Gateway or by emailing professionalstudies@mcphs.edu. If the withdrawal is approved, students will be withdrawn from their course and receive a W on their transcript. No refunds will be given. University Withdrawal A student must complete an exit interview prior to withdrawing from the University. Boston and Worcester students must meet with a CASE representative; Manchester students must meet with a Student Affairs representative; and Online students must meet with their program director. The Withdrawal process includes an exit interview with a designated representative, the completion of a Withdrawal form, and acquiring signatures from Student Financial Services and Immigration Services (if applicable). Failure to complete the withdrawal process results in automatic failure in all courses in which the student is currently enrolled and forfeiture of any prorated tuition refund. Withdrawn students are not eligible for University services. 126 May 17, 2021 General Education Requirements Preprofessional, general education and liberal arts distribution requirements for all baccalaureate and first professional degree programs are summarized below. Course sequences for the preprofessional and professional curriculum in a particular degree program may be found in the specific sections pertaining to each of the University's schools and divisions. Placement in Mathematics Courses Students are placed in mathematics courses based on their math placement exam scores, SAT or ACT scores, and degree program requirements. Any changes in assigned mathematics courses must be discussed with and approved by the coordinator of mathematics, an Associate Dean or the Dean in the School of Arts and Sciences before the end of the add/drop period at the beginning of the fall semester. Oral Proficiency Requirement\u2014Boston All students who enter the University in any bachelor of science, bachelor of arts or first professional degree program must, as a requirement for graduation, demonstrate oral proficiency. In order to satisfy this requirement, students must meet the MCPHS Oral Proficiency Minimum Threshold as determined by oral communication faculty. Incoming students whose skills do not meet University standards must take LIB 253 Fundamentals of Oral Communication in Healthcare within the first year of matriculation. Placement is determined by an evaluation of their skills, using the oral proficiency rubric. Successful completion of LIB 253 Fundamentals of Oral Communication in Healthcare satisfies the oral proficiency requirement. This course carries general elective credit (but not humanities credit). OPE Exemption Students are exempt from the OPE requirement only if they are matriculated in a program that requires a baccalaureate degree as a condition of admission, or if they are in a certificate program. Writing Proficiency Requirement\u2014Boston Students who enter the University without credit for LIB 111 (primarily first-year students) will be placed in a skills-building course, LIB 110 (Introduction to Academic Reading and Writing) or in LIB 111 (Expository Writing I). To meet the writing proficiency (WP) requirement, these students must complete either the LIB 110, LIB 111, LIB 112 sequence or the LIB 111, LIB 112 sequence, and they must continue to meet WP standards as these are monitored across the curriculum. Students placed in LIB 110 will earn general elective credit. All students who have entered the University in any bachelor of science, bachelor of arts or first professional degree program and have credit for LIB 111 and LIB 112 (primarily transfer students) must meet WP standards as these are monitored across the curriculum. To ensure all students achieve and maintain WP, the School of Arts and Sciences has developed guidelines for writing-intensive (WI) courses and a system for WP referrals. In addition, faculty are encouraged to incorporate writing emphases in their classes wherever possible. In the School of Arts and Sciences, LIB 110, LIB 111, LIB 112, and all HUM courses are designated as WI. Faculty in other disciplines may offer WI courses if they meet the following criteria: The amount of required writing should be significant, approximately 3,750-5,000 words (15-20 pages) of graded writing. The total words/pages should be divided among two or more assignments, and at least one assignment should include a draft that students revise with instructor feedback. A single term paper / project is an option, but the project should include several smaller assignments (e.g., a project proposal, followed by a literature review or annotated bibliography, a completed draft, and a revised final project). Faculty should devote class time to instruction on writing practices in their disciplines (e.g., abstracts, writing style, citation conventions, and formats) and on strategies for successful completion of assignments; they should provide detailed writing assignment instructions and evaluation criteria. Faculty teaching WI courses should set aside a portion of the course grade (minimum of 40%) to be based on writing assignments (this is not grading for writing skills per se but for writing assignments that include demonstration of content learning). WI courses should have enrollments capped at 30 or fewer students. WI course faculty across the curriculum should employ shared proficiency and grading rubrics when assessing students' WP or evaluating writing assignments. 127 May 17, 2021 To continually reinforce WP standards, faculty across the curriculum use a shared WP rubric to identify students who appear to need additional skills development to meet WP standards. These students are referred to the University Writing Center, where the staff makes proficiency determinations. Based on individual situations, students may be assigned to writing tutors or workshops to address specific writing problems. Failure to complete an assigned workshop or activity could result in a grading penalty or an incomplete grade in the referring course (based on syllabus requirements). The intent of the WP referral system is to integrate writing expectations, instruction, and development in disciplinary/professional contexts that build on foundations established in the general education curriculum. Information Literacy Requirements\u2014Boston As a requirement for graduation, all undergraduate, preprofessional, and transfer students must demonstrate proficiency in information literacy by passing a series of three non-credit online courses - INF 110: Introduction to Research Essentials, INF 220: Intermediate Research Skills, and INF 330: Advanced Research Skills. INF 110 must be completed during the student's first year at MCPHS; most students will complete this course as a required part of Introduction to the Major. INF 220 is taken during either the second or third year, depending upon the student's major. INF 330 is taken during the required capstone, research methods, or other upper level course appropriate for each program. Exemptions from General Education Requirements\u2014Boston Students enrolled in a certificate program or in a degree program for which a baccalaureate degree is an admission requirement are exempted from the core curriculum, oral and writing proficiency, and library module requirements. Students in the 30-month Physician Assistant Studies program (Boston) are an exception in that they are required to complete the library module requirement though they are exempt from the core curriculum and oral and writing proficiency requirements. Exemptions from General Education Requirements\u2014Worcester/Manchester Students enrolled in degree programs on the Worcester and Manchester campuses are exempt from general education requirements, provided they have completed a baccalaureate degree at an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. (Applicants must still fulfill all prerequisite courses required for admission to their degree program.) Medical Terminology Requirement Competency in medical terminology is required of students in certain degree programs. Students usually meet this competency within their programs. A medical terminology course taken off campus is not awarded general elective credit in any program. All School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics students in accelerated baccalaureate programs are required to pass (with a grade of C+ or higher) RSC 250 Elements of Clinical Care for the Radiologic Sciences prior to progressing into their first clinical internship course (NMT 330C or MRI 402 or RAD 201C or RTT 325C). Students who are unsuccessful in their first attempt to pass RSC 250 may be delayed in progression in their curriculum while repeating the course. Note that students are allowed only two attempts to successfully complete a course. Failure to successfully achieve a grade of C+ or higher in the second attempt of RSC 250, therefore, will result in dismissal from the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics program. Medical terminology is a prerequisite for admission to all fast track School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs excluding MRI. Students may take this course online through the School of Professional Studies. Introduction to the Major All students entering the University as first-year students (including first year transfer students) must take a 1-semester-hour Introduction to the Major during the fall semester. The seminar is designed to ease the transition from high school to college by orienting students to MCPHS resources, career opportunities, and the academic skills needed for classroom success. 128 May 17, 2021 Arts and Sciences Core Curriculum All Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and first professional degree programs at MCPHS must incorporate the Arts and Sciences core curriculum through curriculum components that are equivalent to the following minimum standards. DISCIPLINE(S) MINIMUM STANDARD Science and mathematics (13 semester hours) Life Sciences One course Chemistry* One course, with laboratory Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science One course Statistics One course Liberal Arts (27 semester hours) Healthcare Ethics One course Communication Studies One course Composition (includes introduction to literature) Two courses Introduction to Behavioral Sciences One course Introduction to Social Sciences One course Liberal Arts distribution Three courses; at least one course (elective or required) must be in each of the three distribution areas (Humanities, Social Sciences, and Behavioral Sciences) * For those academic programs that do not require a chemistry laboratory as part of the degree requirement, the laboratory requirement will be replaced with any life or physical science laboratory course. See specific program curricula. Core Curriculum Rationale Preamble: The Arts and Sciences Core Curriculum and General Education In addition to education in the various Arts and Sciences disciplines and preparatory work in areas prerequisite to the curricula of the professional programs, the Arts and Sciences core curriculum promotes an integrated education. Integration facilitates liberal learning in the professional curricula through emphasis on six general ability-based outcomes: critical thinking and decision making, social interaction and citizenship, self-awareness and social responsibility, lifelong learning, communication, and value-based action. Allocation of space for distribution electives, along with the presence of required courses in interpersonal communication and healthcare ethics during the advanced and professional years, affirms the faculty's commitment to education of the whole person. Life Sciences The life sciences introduce students to fundamental biological principles that are necessary to their future studies as healthcare professionals. Courses such as Cell and Molecular Biology and Biology of Organisms establish the foundations for understanding the cellular, biochemical, immunological, and microbial mechanisms that form the basis of more advanced studies, such as microbiology, physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmaceutical biotechnology. The life sciences component of the core curriculum is designed to provide students with a breadth of basic knowledge and practice in applying that knowledge to solve complex problems. Emphasis on active learning strategies in both didactic and laboratory assignments prepares students for independent and advanced learning required by all degree programs at the University. Chemistry Chemistry introduces students to the composition, structure, and properties of substances and is fundamental to an understanding of the physical world. By gaining knowledge of the particulate nature of matter, students learn an explanatory paradigm that supports the biological and pharmaceutical sciences and illuminates the history of science and technology. Since the atomic world is not directly observable, the discipline of chemistry cultivates formal reasoning skills, such as drawing inferences from observations. By approaching knowledge through a constructivist perspective, chemistry complements the liberal arts and develops an appreciation for open-minded and dynamic learning. Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science Mathematics is the basic language of the sciences. The process of learning mathematics helps develop logical and rational habits of reasoning and acclimates students to the operation of formal systems. Physics helps students implement active learning strategies in the analysis and solution of complex problems requiring the integration of symbolic, mathematical reasoning with verbal and visual thinking skills. Laboratories cast the student in the role of researcher and emphasize the importance of careful procedure and observation in the collection and analysis of experimental data. A sound understanding of calculus and the calculus-based concepts and principles of mechanics provides a necessary foundation for advanced study in chemistry and the biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences. Computers and communication technologies have become integral aspects of scientific learning and professional practice. Computer science courses provide knowledge of critical software applications, hardware components, and Internet resources. They foster creative organization and presentation of information, enhance problem-solving and data 129 May 17, 2021 management skills, and develop abilities to track and use new information pertinent to professional learning and practice. Statistics Statistics is a core course because it provides the tools needed to accurately assess statistical analyses that are reported in both the mass media and scholarly publications. The ability to effectively interpret numerical and graphical statistics is necessary for advanced study in the health professions, and it is essential that healthcare professionals demonstrate knowledge of the statistical terminology and methodologies found in the biomedical and professional literature. The formal study of statistics complements the sciences because it also requires that students learn to formulate and test hypotheses and draw appropriate conclusions. Healthcare Ethics Ethics is a necessary component of any professional education. Healthcare ethics prepares students to identify the salient ethical issues that arise in contemporary healthcare practice (including biomedical and behavioral research). Formal instruction puts these contemporary issues in broader context by introducing students to the historical quest for a coherent and comprehensive normative ethical theory to guide personal and professional conduct. It also reviews and evaluates the strengths and limitations of competing normative ethical theories and engages students in theoretical discussion and analysis of problematic case studies. This core component forms one of the crucial general ability-based outcomes in professional education: the responsible use of values and ethical principles. Communication Interpersonal communication is also a necessary core component in the education of health professionals. Communication studies provide a theoretical model for understanding the two-way nature of communication and the various factors that influence the transmission and exchange of information and the development of interpersonal relationships, including patient-provider relationships. Communication studies help students assess their communication competencies, improve their ability to work with colleagues, and adapt to new social environments. Students learn listening and public speaking skills, assertiveness strategies, and ways of demonstrating empathy. Enhanced self-awareness and self-esteem contribute to professional development and lifelong learning. Composition Expository writing develops the ability to write clearly, concisely, and precisely. The use of writing as a tool for learning increases academic performance across the curriculum and promotes student-centered learning. Writing from sources teaches summary, synthesis, and criticism skills that are basic to all disciplines. Expository writing also develops research skills, including the use of library and online resources, location and evaluation of source materials, thesis formulation and development, and referencing and citation techniques. Attention to works of prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and student-centered exploration of moods and meanings in expressive media provide the foundation for humanistic, literary, and aesthetic analysis. Introduction to the Behavioral Sciences A foundational course in the behavioral sciences teaches students how internal factors (e.g., personality and motives) and external factors (e.g., social pressures) combine to affect behavior. Students learn to appreciate the manner in which human behavior can be studied systematically and scientifically. They also come to understand the differences between \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" behavior and how difficult it can be to distinguish these. Students learn that some of their assumptions about humans are misconceptions and stereotypes, and they learn to apply the concepts, theories, and principles of psychology and/or sociology to develop a better understanding of themselves and those around them. Introduction to the Social Sciences A foundational, interdisciplinary course in the social sciences teaches students the value of historical perspective as well as terms and concepts basic to disciplinary study in the social sciences (e.g., culture, class, ethnicity, race, gender, and social construction). Students survey historical patterns of immigration and social transformation, study themes related to the emergence of American culture and identity, and explore various forces and factors that contribute to the formation of both individual and collective identities. Students are introduced to the analysis and use of historical documents, secondary sources, and visual media. Students learn how to locate contemporary issues in historical, social, economic, and political frameworks; to identify individual, social, and cultural differences; and to express sensitivity and tolerance within a culturally diverse society. Humanities Humanities distribution electives build on prerequisite composition courses and encompass disciplines such as literature, philosophy, religious studies, media studies, advanced foreign languages and cultural studies. All humanities courses are conducted through intensive reading and writing, and they focus on the centrality of language and critical interpretation of texts in a variety of media. They develop critical reading and reasoning skills and foster esthetic, moral, and humanistic inquiry. Assignments emphasize analytical, synthetic, thematic, and/or argumentative writing and interpretation. 130 May 17, 2021 Minor Requirements For those who desire further study in specialty areas, minor are available in American Studies, Biology, Business, Chemistry, Health Humanities, Health Psychology, Nutrition, Performing Arts, Premedical Studies, Public Health, Women's and Gender Studies and Sustainability. Students complete at least three (3) courses that are only applied to one minor; these courses may not be used to fulfill requirements for the major or another minor. Students declare minors by completing a Declaration of Minor form, and they must fulfill the minor requirements defined for their program, if different from below. Requirements for completion of some minors vary for students in the Premedical Health Studies degree program.

Students who continue their education in public health at the graduate level typically pursue careers in epidemiology, biostatistics, health promotion, community health, environmental health, biomedical science, or health policy and management. The curriculum prepares students equally well for advanced studies leading to careers in environmental science, public policy, health promotion, healthcare administration, law, and medicine. The Public Health curriculum builds on general education courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and liberal arts as well as required foundational courses in social and behavioral sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, and public policy. In the third and fourth years, students continue with advanced-level courses; select public health electives from the biology, behavioral sciences, and social sciences disciplines; engage in experiential and service learning through a field placement; and design an interdisciplinary project in a senior capstone seminar. Public Health majors have elective openings that permit completion of a minor in Premedical Health Studies, Biology, Chemistry, Medical Humanities, Health Psychology, or Women's and Gender Studies, and they have opportunities for language and international studies through the Colleges of the Fenway, as well as travel courses and study abroad through MCPHS University. An additional option also exists whereby students may adopt a Pre-Health Law concentration. This concentration combines public health with the study of law and will prepare students to sit for the LSAT examination in preparation for law school to obtain the Master of Laws (L.L.M.) or Juris Doctor (J.D.) degrees. To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative 2.0 grade point average (GPA). To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Public Health, students must complete at least 62 semester hours at the University.

Conferral of that designation each semester depends on completion of either: Two different projects that each take a full year to complete. The student must complete two distinct research projects with two different professors, or two related projects with two different professors. This format allows for exploration of a variety of different topics and for an appreciation of the value of collaboration across disciplines. Successful completion of the project depends on submission of a progress report at the end of each Fall semester, and a final project and the end of each Spring semester One single project that takes two full years to complete. This option has the greatest potential for generating publishable work in a specific field. The student must complete a single collaborative project with two different professors or a single project with one professor. This format allows for deep exploration of a single research question. Successful completion of the project depends on submission of progress reports at the conclusion of each Fall semester and the first Spring semester, and a final thesis project at the conclusion of the second Spring semester, The following criteria also apply: Honors projects are completed in addition to regular coursework and do not fulfill any major or minor requirements for graduation. Projects may be conducted within any discipline and are not meant to duplicate, replace, or extend work done in capstone courses. The student must have a minimum 3.50 GPA at the time of graduation.

Sensory skills to perform the procedures of the healthcare profession in which students are enrolled are required. In any case where a candidate's or a student's ability to observe or acquire information through sensory modalities is compromised, the candidate or student must demonstrate alternative means and/or abilities to acquire and demonstrate the essential information conveyed in this fashion. Communication Candidates and students must be able to communicate effectively in both academic and healthcare settings. Candidates and students must show evidence of effective written and oral communication skills and must be able to communicate with patients in order to elicit and impart information. Motor The ability to participate in basic diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers and procedures is required. Candidates and students must have sufficient motor function to execute movements reasonably required to properly care for all patients and must be able to perform motor functions with or without assistive devices. Intellectual Candidates and students must be able to measure, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize. Problem solving, one of the critical skills demanded of healthcare professionals, requires all of these intellectual abilities. Candidates and students must be able to read and understand medical literature. In order to complete the specific Health Sciences program, students must be able to demonstrate mastery of these skills and the ability to use them together in a timely fashion in healthcare problem solving and patient care. Behavioral and Social Attributes Candidates and students must possess the emotional health and stability required for full utilization of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, and the prompt completion of all academic and patient care responsibilities. The development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and other members of the healthcare team is essential. The ability to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in clinical practice, flexibility, compassion, integrity, motivation, interpersonal skills, and concern for others are all required. Students interested in dental hygiene or medical imaging and therapeutics (diagnostic medical sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine technology, radiation therapy, or radiography) are required to meet technical standards specific to each program. Student should read the technical standards specific to the program they are interested in completing. 225 May 17, 2021 Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene In July 2002, the Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene (FSDH) became part of MCPHS University. The school was first established in 1916 by the Forsyth brothers as the second dental hygiene program opened in the United States, and today it is the oldest continuously operating dental hygiene program in the country. Students who attend the school, located on the MCPHS Boston or Worcester campus, receive clinical instruction in the state-of-the-art dental hygiene clinics to enhance delivery of high-quality oral healthcare services to the public. The FSDH is committed to providing excellence through engagement of students in a diverse learning environment, fostering community partnerships, and advancing knowledge through scholarship and lifelong learning. Forsyth's degree programs prepare students to be leaders in their professions with career options in dental hygiene education, business, research, public health, administration, and clinical practice. The school embraces a strong sense of responsibility to patients, the community, and the dental hygiene profession as well as to high standards of healthcare ethics. MCPHS offers dental hygiene students the opportunity to learn in the Dr. Esther M. Wilkins Forsyth Dental Hygiene Clinic in Boston and the Esther M. Wilkins Forsyth Dental Hygiene Clinic in Worcester. The Boston facility is equipped with 24 operatories and the Worcester facility has 16 operatories with digital radiologic imaging technology, intraoral cameras, ergonomic patient and operator chairs, digital panoramic technology, electronic records, and a dental materials laboratory with magnification and flat-screen monitors. The FSDH offers an accelerated Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene, a Bachelor of Science in PreDental Dental Hygiene, Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene, a Dual Bachelor of Science in Health Science/Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene (Fast Track), a Bachelor of Science Completion in Dental Hygiene, a Master of Science in Dental Hygiene, a bridge program to a Master of Science degree for associate degree-holding dental hygienists, Master of Science in Dental Hygiene/ Master of Public Health, and a Graduate Certificate in Oral Health Professions Education for individuals with an earned baccalaureate degree and work experience in a dental or dental hygiene setting. Each program has unique outcome objectives designed to fulfill the professional objectives or degree requirements associated with the individual academic needs of dental hygiene students. Clinical Component The clinical component of the program is supported by evidence-based information delivered in active learning and seminars. The student learns to assess risk for oral diseases and provide preventive services. In addition, considerable time is spent developing proficiency in dental hygiene procedures for patients of all ages, with a focus on building skills that support specialized care for unique populations. Dental radiology is delivered throughout the clinical portion of the program. The student develops skills necessary for exposing, processing, and interpreting both traditional and digital radiographs. Students will participate in community-based clinical rotations that enhance campus learning experiences. The campus learning experiences and rotations may be scheduled weekdays, evenings and Saturdays. Transportation is not provided to these locations; however, public transportation is available to many extramural sites. As a requirement for graduation and licensure examinations, the student must demonstrate competence by achieving a specified level of performance for each clinical skill and by completing specific patient and service assignments. The student is ultimately responsible for obtaining the patients needed to fulfill these requirements. The student must fulfill all course requirements and competencies each semester to advance within the program. Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene Policies and Professional Requirements Basic Cardiac Life Support Each student must be certified by an approved Basic Cardiac Life Support for Healthcare Providers course prior to beginning the fall semester of the first clinical year. Certification must remain current throughout the program. Licensure The student who successfully completes the academic and clinical components of the accelerated Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene or Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene program will be eligible to take licensure examinations. Successful completion of the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination and a state or regional clinical examination are necessary for licensure. MCPHS provides education to students in accordance with the regulations set forth by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Dentistry. MCPHS may not be able to provide the education and/or certification necessary for eligibility for licensure in every state jurisdiction. The student is responsible for determining eligibility requirements for dental hygiene licensure in the jurisdiction in which he or she plans to practice and to obtain any additional education necessary for licensure in that jurisdiction. 226 May 17, 2021 Policy for Reentry and Content Validation after Nonprogression or Leave of Absence Students attempting to return from nonprogression in the professional curriculum or leave of absence must be cleared to return to classes by their Academic Dean and the Office of Student Affairs (if a medical leave of absence). Students who are not continuously enrolled in the sequence of undergraduate FSDH professional clinical courses for a period of two semesters or more must validate clinical knowledge and skills before they may reenroll in FSDH professional clinical courses. Validation testing will consist of competency testing to assess clinical and radiography skills related to direct patient care. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what competencies, content, and skills the student needs to review prior to testing, but it is the student's responsibility to prepare for the testing. Students must pass validation testing at a minimum competency level of 75% in order to be eligible to reenter the FSDH professional clinical curriculum. Students may also opt to retake DHY 209/209L POC 1/Pre-clinic and DHY230/230L Radiology instead of undergoing validation testing. A student who is unable to pass the validation testing at the 75% level will be given the option of retaking DHY 209/209L Process of Care I/Pre-clinic and DHY 230/230L Radiology. If a passing grade is obtained through validation testing or successful completion of DHY 209/209L and DHY 230/230L, the student may reenter the FSDH program on a space-available basis. If the student does not pass the validation test and does not reenroll or pass DHY 209/209L and DHY 230/230L, he or she will be dismissed from the program. Reentry into the FSDH program is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee placement will be available at the student's desired time of return.) This policy applies to all undergraduate dental hygiene programs. Progression into Professional Phase of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene The minimum passing grade of C in Anatomy and Physiology (BIO 110 / BIO 210), Chemistry (CHE 110 / CHE 210), and Microbiology (BIO255) and an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.5 are required to progress into the fall of Year II (professional phase) of the program. Students who achieve the minimum passing grade of C in Anatomy and Physiology (BIO 110 and BIO 210) and Chemistry (CHE 110 / CHE 210), and Microbiology (BIO255), but do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 at the end of the Year I summer term may enroll in DHY 202 Dental Anatomy and DHY 204 Head and Neck Anatomy in the Year II fall semester but may not enroll in other professional courses. If DHY 202 and 204 are completed with C or better grades and a minimum cumulative and professional GPA of 2.5 are attained, the student may progress into the remaining Year II fall semester professional courses the following fall semester. This will result in a change in the year of graduation. Students who do not meet the minimum grade and GPA expectations at the end of the first year or after attempting DHY 202 and DHY 204 will be dismissed from the program. Dismissal from Program Three grades below C in any combination of DHY courses results in dismissal from the program. Progression within the Professional Phase of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene To progress within the didactic and clinical phase of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene program, students must achieve a final grade of C or better (> 75%). Obtaining a final grade below C in any professional course results in the student's having to repeat the course. Progression through the program will be delayed (i.e., the student will be on nonprogression status) because most professional courses are offered only once per academic year. A dental hygiene student may be placed on nonprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the Forsyth Dental Hygiene program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the dental hygiene program. Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene (Accelerated) Curriculum: Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene Program (Accelerated) The student who begins the accelerated Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene program is expected to complete the program in three years. To meet the residency requirement for the BS in Dental Hygiene degree, students must complete at least 60 semester hours at the University. 227 May 17, 2021 Year I\u2014fall COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS BIO 110 Anatomy and Physiology I (with lab) 4 CHE 110 Basic Chemistry I 3 CHE 110L Basic Chemistry I Laboratory 1 ITM 101 Introduction to the Major 1 LIB 111 Expository Writing I 3 MAT 143 Foundations of Algebra and Trigonometry 3 TOTAL 15 Year I\u2014spring COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS BIO 210 Anatomy and Physiology II 3 BIO 210L Anatomy and Physiology II Lab 1 CHE 210 Basic Chemistry II 3 CHE 210L Basic Chemistry II Laboratory 1 LIB 112 Expository Writing II 3 LIB 133 American Culture, Identity, and Public Life 3 LIB 120 Introduction to Psychology 3 TOTAL 17 Year I\u2014summer session COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS LIB 220 Introduction to Interpersonal Communication for Health Professionals 3 DHY 232 Nutrition 2 TOTAL 5 Year I\u2014summer session I COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS BIO 255 Medical Microbiology 3 BIO 255L Medical Microbiology Laboratory 1 TOTAL 4 Year I\u2014summer session II COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS MAT 261 Statistics 3 TOTAL 3 Year II\u2014fall COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS DHY 202 Dental Anatomy, Embryology, and Histology 2 DHY 204 Head and Neck Anatomy 2 DHY 209 Dental Hygiene Process of Care I (with lab) 6 DHY 230 Dental Radiology (with lab) 3 DHY 231 Dental Materials (with lab) 3 TOTAL 16 228 May 17, 2021 Year II\u2014spring COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS DHY 211 Dental Hygiene Process of Care I I 3 DHY 223 Clinical Dental Hygiene I 3 DHY 233 Periodontology 3 DHY 330 Pathology 3 Distribution Elective 3 TOTAL 15 Year II\u2014summer session COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS Distribution Elective 3 DHY 420O Oral Health Research 3 DHY 343 Pain Management (with lab) 3 TOTAL 9 Year II\u2014summer session II COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS PSB 320O Introduction to Healthcare Delivery 3 TOTAL 3 Year III\u2014fall COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS DHY 310 Dental Hygiene Process of Care III 3 DHY 323 Clinical Dental Hygiene II 4 DHY 342 Pharmacology 3 DHY 350 Community Oral Health 3 Program Elective 3 TOTAL 16 Year III\u2014spring COURSE TITLE SEMESTER HOURS DHY 311 Dental Hygiene Process of Care IV 2 DHY 324 Clinical Dental Hygiene III 4 DHY 460 Capstone Leadership in Dental Hygiene 3 LIB 512 Healthcare Ethics 3 DHY345 Practice and Career Management 2 Distribution Elective 3 TOTAL 17 Total credits to complete degree requirements: 120 semester hours Dental Hygiene Program Electives An overall grade point average and a professional grade point average will be calculated for each student in the Dental Hygiene program. Elective courses and those required for admission into the Dental Hygiene program are excluded when calculating the professional grade point average. All course electives, including program electives, count toward the student's cumulative grade point average. The program elective must be a distinct course from the distribution electives; for example, Abnormal Psychology cannot fulfill the behavioral requirement as well as the program elective requirement. Choose any higher level (300 or 400) BEH, HUM, SSC, PSB, and HSC elective course as the dental hygiene program elective. 229 May 17, 2021 Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene (Fast Track) Worcester Campus A student who holds a baccalaureate degree or higher from an accredited college or university and/or completed prerequisite course work may pursue the accelerated 16-month Fast Track Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene.

The DMS and NMT programs are completed in 36 months, and the MRI, RTT, and RAD programs in 32 months. The Bachelor of Science program integrates didactic instruction in the liberal arts, basic and applied science, and the social sciences with clinical instruction provided by the clinical affiliates. The location of the University in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, as well as its affiliations with medical institutions located in the Greater Boston area, enable students to train in hospitals with state-of-the-art facilities that are among the best in the world. Students planning to major in one of the Medical Imaging and Therapeutics programs will be expected to specify the program of choice during the formal application process to MCPHS. Students who are uncertain about their program of choice are encouraged to complete a shadowing activity for each specialty area in order to decide which discipline they wish to study. If the student has firmly decided on the concentration he or she wishes to pursue, the student should contact his or her local hospital to arrange a shadowing opportunity. If such arrangements cannot be made, the MCPHS director for that program will try to accommodate the request to establish a shadowing opportunity. All such requests will be processed on an individual basis based on available space and the specific shadowing requirements at affiliate institutions. Any request to change the major after matriculation to MCPHS will be based on availability of space in the new area of interest. For internal transfers, admission into the desired program is subject to space availability; in addition, the following must be completed: Transcript review by the appropriate program director and the dean of the school A Change of Major form signed by the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment A personal interview with the program director or designated program faculty Clinical observation in which the student will shadow a clinical supervisor in the chosen major; this requirement may be waived at the discretion of the program director Clinical Rotations A number of clinical rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. The University makes every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites at some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Medical Sonography: General and Echocardiography Tracks (Accelerated, 36 months) The Diagnostic Medical Sonography (DMS) profession uses high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to produce multi-dimensional dynamic images of tissue, organs, and blood flow inside the human body for the diagnosis of various medical conditions. The sonographer, a highly skilled imaging technologist, uses sophisticated ultrasound equipment to identify disease. In addition, the sonographer works closely with physicians in the processing of the ultrasound images to make a diagnosis. The DMS program offers a full-time, Accelerated, 36-month course of study that begins in the fall semester. The comprehensive curriculum includes primary specialties of ultrasound, plus secondary specialties, offered across two tracks; the General ultrasound track, includes training in abdominal, obstetrics/gynecology, breast, pediatric, musculoskeletal and vascular sonography; the Echocardiography track focuses on adult echocardiography with secondary specialty tracks in pediatric echocardiography, and vascular sonography.

MRI technologists use their knowledge of anatomy, physiology, patient care, and MRI physical principles to safely operate advanced MRI scanners and assist the radiologist in the diagnosis of disease and injury. Unlike most MRI programs, this is a primary pathway program that recognizes MRI as a distinct and separate imaging discipline. Hence, no prior background in a medical imaging science is required. Admission Technical Standards Technical Standards for Admission, Promotion, and Graduation Candidates for and students enrolled in health sciences professional programs must have abilities and skills in the areas of observation; communication; and motor, intellectual, and behavioral/social attributes. The following technical standards describe the nonacademic qualifications (required in addition to academic standards) that the MRI program considers essential for the successful progression in and completion of the educational objectives of its curriculum. Although the MRI program will engage in an interactive process with applicants with disabilities, it reserves the right not to admit any applicant who, upon completion of the interactive process, cannot meet the technical standards set forth below, with or without reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodation for persons with prior documented disabilities will be considered on an individual basis. Students wishing to request accommodations for disabilities should contact the Director for Office of Student Access and Accommodations. MRI Technical Standards A magnetic resonance technologist provides direct care for patients in hospitals or outpatient facilities and must be able to apply acquired knowledge to skillfully perform MRI procedures. These technical standards are based upon the minimum tasks performed by graduates of the program as recommended by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (www.asrt.org) and the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (www.arrt.org). Listed below are the technical standards that all applicants must meet in order to participate in and successfully complete the MRI program: Sufficient visual acuity to accurately administer contrast agents and to monitor imaging equipment as well as provide the necessary patient assessment and care; Sufficient ability to receive and provide verbal communication with patients and members of the healthcare team and to assess the health needs of patients through the use of monitoring devices such as intercom systems, cardiac monitors, respiratory monitors, and fire alarms; Sufficient gross and fine motor coordination to manipulate equipment such as a scan console, power injectors, and various RF receiver coils; in addition, MRI technologists must perform venipuncture on a daily basis; Sufficient communication skills (verbal, reading, writing) to interact with individuals and to communicate their needs promptly and effectively, as may be necessary in the patient's/client's interest; Sufficient intellectual and emotional function to plan and implement patient care Examples of specific technical standards the MRI student must be able to meet are as follows: Ability to lift, transfer, and/or move patients from wheelchair/stretcher to scan table; dock/release and wheel scan table to/from scan room to patient waiting area; 249 May 17, 2021 Ability to lift, move, reach, or push MRI equipment (lift MRI coils of up to 35 pounds, push/wheel docking table with patient to/from scan room); Manual dexterity and ability to bend/stretch; Ability to distinguish colors and shades of gray; Effective interpersonal communication skills in the process of interviewing patients and explaining the procedure verbally and/or in writing; Ability to read and extract information from the medical chart, patient requisitions, and doctors' orders To perform/assist with MRI procedures on patients, students must initially undergo the same screening procedures as patients, staff, and visitors in order to enter the scan room. The MRI scan room contains a region of intense magnetic field. Objects that display any form of ferromagnetism are therefore of particular concern for MRI. Contraindications for entering the MRI scan room include, and are not limited to certain biomedical implants, materials, and devices (e.g., aneurysm clips, brain clips); certain electrically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants and devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants); and certain metallic foreign objects (e.g., shrapnel, bullets, metal in eyes). The 32-month Bachelor of Science in Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an accelerated program combining online courses, courses on the Boston campus, and clinical internships throughout Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. The typical course of study begins with 16 months of core curriculum preprofessional courses and general education courses followed by 16 months of professional courses and clinical internships. Students enrolled in the MRI program receive their internship training at hospital affiliates in the Greater Boston area and southern New Hampshire. These include, but are not limited to, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Catholic Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Elliot Hospital, Mt. Auburn Hospital, and Shields MRI Centers Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

In the event a female student becomes pregnant, the student may choose to declare her pregnancy, since there is a potential risk to the developing fetus from radiation exposure. In the event a student chooses to declare her pregnancy, the student will notify the program director in writing that she is pregnant and also state the estimated date of conception. The MCPHS Declaration of Pregnancy for Radiation Workers form, available in the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics dean's office, shall be used for this purpose. A copy of this declaration will be forwarded to the Radiation Safety Officer. Choosing not to declare a pregnancy will result in exemption from the specific state radiation protection regulations limiting the exposure to the embryo/fetus. Once the student declares herself to be pregnant, the Radiation Safety Officer will issue to the student a second badge to be worn during the gestation period at waist level to serve as a measure of embryo/fetus exposure. The radiation exposure control criterion for this student will be to limit exposures to this waist-level badge to less than 50 mrem/month (0.5 millisieverts). a copy of the applicable state regulations (105CMR120.203, 105CMR120.218, 105CMR120.267) that deal with exposure to the embryo/fetus a copy of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Guide 8.13, Instruction Concerning Prenatal Radiation Exposure, and Guide 8.29, Instruction Concerning Risks from Radiation Exposure. The student will be given an opportunity to discuss this material with the Radiation Safety Officer or his or her representative. In order to adhere to Commonwealth of Massachusetts Regulation 105CMR120.218, which requires that \"the dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, does not exceed 500 mrem (5 millisieverts),\" the student is offered the following options: 1. The student may continue in the program so long as her embryonic/fetal exposures are in conformance with the requirements of 105CMR120.218. If the student chooses this option, the following procedure must be followed: a. All efforts must be made by the student to ensure that the total exposure to the waist badge does not exceed 500 mrem (5 millisieverts) for the entire gestation period. b. The student and program director are to be notified, in writing, by the Radiation Safety Officer, if more than 80% of this dose (400 mrem) is received. c. The student and program director are to be notified, in writing, by the Radiation Safety Officer if the monthly recommendation of 50 mrem is exceeded. d. The student is expected to utilize her knowledge of radiation control principles at all times to further minimize her exposure. e. If the maximum total exposure for the gestation period is reached, the student, Radiation Safety Officer, and program director must agree on an alternate option. 2. The student may request a leave of absence from the career component of the program. The student may continue with general education courses without modification or interruption. 3. The student has the option for withdrawal of the declaration of pregnancy. NOTE: Experience shows that the radiation workers in this program generally receive to the whole body well below 500 mrem per year, 50 mrem per month, and it is most unlikely that there will be any problems adhering to the fetal exposure limits. Policy for Content Validation after Nonprogression or Leave of Absence Students who have not been continuously attending courses for a period of one semester or more in an undergraduate School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics (SMIT) professional course, or who withdraw from a SMIT program via leave of absence, must validate previous knowledge and skills held prior to program exit before they may reenroll in SMIT clinical professional courses. Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: Students returning from a leave of absence must confirm their intent to return as specified in the Return from Leave of Absence section. There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) This policy applies to all undergraduate SMIT programs. The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, such as meeting established program clinical competencies, in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. This requires that students notify the program director of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return in order to make arrangements for preparing and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills 279 May 17, 2021 (competencies) need to be reviewed by students prior to the testing, but it is the student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. Students attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by the designated staff member in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) and by the Dean of Students or designee (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The designated staff member in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment will notify the Dean of SMIT when the student is eligible to take the validation test. Validation of knowledge will consist of a competency examination. A minimum grade of C on the competency examination is required. Program faculty will determine the content and skills to be included in the validation test. If a student fails the validation test, he or she must enroll in a one-semester directed study course to remediate prior to reentering the program. This will delay the student's reentry for at least one semester but likely for one year (or more if there is no clinical space available). The number of semester credits assigned to the directed study course will vary (1-3 semester credits) depending upon the number of semesters successfully completed in the program. If the student completed two or fewer semesters, 1 credit will be assigned; if three or four semesters, 2 credits; and if more than four semesters, 3 credits. Students may take general education courses concurrently with the directed study but may not take any program professional courses until the directed study has been successfully completed. If a student does not pass the directed study with a minimum of C on the first attempt, he or she will be dismissed from his or her respective program. 280 May 17, 2021 MCPHS University-Boston School of Nursing Tammy Gravel, EdD, MS, RN, Interim Dean, Chief Nurse Administrator and Associate Professor Deborah McManus, PhD, MSN, RN, Assistant Professor and Associate Dean Andrea Gauntlett, MSN, RN Assistant Professor and Assistant Dean of NCLEX Success Lorraine MacDonald, MSN, RN, PMHNP-BC, Assistant Professor and Interim Assistant Dean of BSN Clinical Education & Experiential Learning Carolyn Parker, MS, RN, Assistant Professor and Interim Director of Simulation and Laboratory Professor Street; Associate Professors Galindo; Assistant Professors Butler, DesRoches, Eichorn, Gauntlett, Mataoui, McManus; Faculty Associate Archon Degree Programs Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Accelerated) Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Postbaccalaureate) Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences / BSN (Postbaccalaureate) Dual Degree Bachelor of Science in Nursing Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Accelerated) - 32-month Curriculum Responding to the growing demand for nurses nationally, MCPHS offers an innovative accelerated 32-month nursing professional program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree.

Successful completion of both the theory and the clinical laboratory / practicum in a clinical Nursing course is required to pass the course. A minimum professional grade point average (GPA) of 2.7 is required. All Boston BSN students must achieve a minimum passing grade of 78 (C+) in each professional nursing (NUR) course and must achieve a minimal professional GPA of 2.5 in the first four sequential nursing (NUR) courses in order to progress. A professional GPA of 2.7 is then required at the end of each semester in order to progress in the nursing major and to fulfill University requirements for graduation. Students who do not achieve the required professional GPA needed to fulfill School of Nursing graduation requirements must complete a select remediation course(s) to reach the required professional GPA. Official University graduation and approval to write for the NCLEX will not occur until professional GPA and all graduation requirements have been met. Any Nursing course that is graded below a C+ may be repeated only once. A second grade below C+ in the repeated course will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. Throughout the Nursing program, a student may repeat no more than two separate Nursing courses. Three grades below C+ in any combination of Nursing courses will result in dismissal from the Nursing program. All courses must be taken sequentially. Professional courses (designated NUR) may not be taken pass/fail. Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) The TEAS measures basic essential skills in reading, English, math and science and is used to measure entry-level academic readiness of nursing program applicants. Beginning with the Class of 2019, the TEAS will be a prerequisite assessment tool for progression into the professional nursing (NUR) courses. Students must achieve a Proficient level on the TEAS. Students who do not achieve a minimum level of Proficient must complete remediation prior to retesting. Only one retake/retest is permitted (regardless of where the student tested). If a student does not achieve a Proficient level after the second attempt, they will not be allowed to progress into the professional nursing (NUR) courses and will be directed to meet with an Academic Advisor in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE) to determine an alternate plan of study/major. Class of 2019: First TEAS administered at the beginning of Year 1 summer semester. Retest/retake will be administered at the end of Year 1 summer semester for those who did not achieve Proficient on the initial administration. [Remediation is required between]. A third retake will be offered for students who have not successfully reached the Proficient level (minimum composite score of 65.3%) after remediation by arrangement Class of 2020: First TEAS administered at the end of Year 1 spring semester. Retake/retest will be administered at the end of Year 1 Summer semester for those students who did not achieve a minimum level of Proficient on the initial administration. [Remediation is required between tests]. A third retake will be offered for students who have not successfully reached the Proficient level (minimum composite score of 65.3%) after remediation by arrangement Students transferring to MCPHS [both internal and external] must comply with the TEAS requirement to progress into the professional nursing (NUR) courses. Progression and Retention Policies Students must complete the requirements for the BSN degree within five (5) years (32-month track) or three (3) years (16-month track). If this time limit from the date of admission into the major has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the School Dean, who may approve or deny the extension request. The School Dean's decision is final and not subject to further appeal. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in NUR 204: Health and Wellness I. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Healthcare Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Healthcare Provider Level card indicating active certification. (AHA requires recertification every two years.) It is recommended that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. 286 May 17, 2021 Transportation Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical and field experiences is the responsibility of the student. A number of clinical rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. The University will make every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel expenses. Licensure Students who successfully complete the program will be eligible to sit for the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). Employment Due to the rigorous nature of the Nursing program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical schedule and course requirements. It is for this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging in outside, non-program-related employment throughout the program of study. School of Nursing Professional and Technical Standards A prelicensure candidate for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree must have abilities and skills in four areas: communication, observation, motor function and endurance, and behavioral maturity.

Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: Students returning from a leave of absence must confirm their intent to return as specified in the Return from Leave of Absence section. There is no guarantee that space will be available at the student's desired return date. It may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills\u2014that is, meeting established program clinical competencies\u2014in a selected clinical facility or simulation laboratory. The student must notify the Dean of the desired date of return a minimum of 30 days prior to the anticipated return date to make arrangements for preparing for and performing validation testing. Program faculty will provide guidance as to what content and skills (competencies) the student needs to review prior to the testing, but it is student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. The student must pass the validation testing as per the outcome measures determined by the faculty. Failure to meet the required outcome(s) will result in dismissal from the Nursing program and/or the need to repeat identified courses. A student attempting to return from a leave of absence also must have been cleared to return to classes by their Academic Dean or the Student Affairs office at their campus (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The Student Affairs office and Nursing faculty will coordinate communication regarding student clearance for leave of absence return and subsequent eligibility to schedule validation testing. 288 May 17, 2021 MCPHS University-Boston School of Physician Assistant Studies Christopher Cooper, PA-C, Program Director and Associate Professor, Physician Assistant Studies, Boston John Kelly, MD, Medical Director Associate Professors Cooper, Hurwitz, Moktar, Orrahood; Assistant Professors Chiavegato, Graeff, Hurley, Jones, Kelley, McDonald, Riley, Stavroulakis, Taglieri, Vajravelu, Webb.

This geographic diversity is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. Students should expect to be assigned to clinical sites outside of Boston for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation, food, parking, housing, and other related incidentals for all clinical clerkships. Students are required to have a 2.85 professional GPA in order to enter into clinical rotations. In addition to the costs of the MPAS-Boston program delineated in the Tuition, Room and Board, Fees section of this catalog, PA students can expect to spend approximately $1,000 on medical equipment and approximately $1,500 for books during the program. Students in the MPAS program will need to complete a Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) check prior to starting clerkships. Positive CORI checks may impede or preclude a student's progression in the program and result in a student being ineligible for placement at a clinical clerkship and/or for state licensure as a physician assistant. Students are responsible for the cost of all CORI checks and for knowing the licensure requirements of the state(s) in which they intend to seek licensure. School of Physician Assistant Studies Policies and Professional Requirements Basic and Advanced Life Support All students in the Physician Assistant program must present proof of successful completion of Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers and Advanced Cardiac Life Support courses (ACLS) prior to entry into the clinical year and must maintain this certification throughout the remainder of the program. Employment Outside of the University The Physician Assistant curriculum is rigorous and requires many hours of study outside the classroom. Moreover, clinical rotations sometimes require you to be present nights, weekends, and holidays. Therefore, outside employment while in PA school is strongly discouraged. Transfer of Credit The MCPHS PA Studies program does not accept transfer credit for any PAS courses during the 30-month professional PA program. Advanced Placement The MCPHS Physician Assistant Studies program does not award advanced placement in its professional PA curriculum. 292 May 17, 2021 Performance in the Master of Physician Assistant Studies Program All PAS-designated courses (500 level and above) count toward the professional grade point average (GPA). The following are requirements for remaining in good academic standing: To progress within both the didactic and clinical phases of the PA program, students must achieve a final course grade of C (2.0) or better on a 4.0 scale. Obtaining a course grade below C results in the student having to remediate or repeat the course and progression through the program may be delayed because PA didactic courses are offered only once a year. Furthermore, poor grades have a significant impact on the student's GPA, which could jeopardize progression in the program. To remain in good standing, a cumulative professional GPA of 2.85 on a 4.0 scale must be maintained throughout the entire length of the program. A professional GPA below 2.85 may result in non-progression status or dismissal from the PA program. Successful completion of the PA summative examinations, administered near the end of the final professional year of the program, is mandatory before graduation. Students unable to pass the summative examination on the first administration will be offered one retake of the exam which must occur between 14 and 28 days following the first administration. Failure to pass the summative examination on the second attempt may result in delayed graduation and/or dismissal from the program. In order to receive the Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) degree, students must have earned a cumulative professional GPA of 2.85 or better on a 4.0 scale, have successfully completed all required courses, competencies and clerkships. Additionally, students must have demonstrated all required skills, and successfully completed the summative examination administered during the final professional year of the program. Admission for MCPHS Students\u2014Undergraduate Curriculum For MCPHS undergraduate students seeking admission into the Boston MPAS program, the prerequisite requirements for application to the PA program may be met through matriculation in the Bachelor of Science in Premedical Health Studies Pre-medical Pathway: Physician Assistant Studies program.

Postbaccalaureate Doctor of Pharmacy Pathway (PharmD) (Online) The Doctor of Pharmacy Pathway (Postbaccalaureate) is designed for qualified practitioners with a BS in pharmacy degree who wish to earn a degree on a part-time basis. It is currently offered in a Web-supported format with online lectures and group discussions, reducing required on-site meeting time to once per semester. This program helps pharmacists learn how to collect and interpret data to design a pharmaceutical care plan for their individual patients in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. Pharmacists learn how to recommend and implement a therapeutic plan; perform ongoing patient evaluations; and document and report new, unusual, or severe adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, or unexpected effects of newly marketed drugs. Admission Requests for formal admission into the pathway are obtained from and processed through the Admission Office. The PharmD Admission Committee in the School of Pharmacy-Boston is responsible for evaluating the applications and making admission decisions. All applicants to the program must: have a Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy from an accredited College/University have licensure to practice pharmacy in the United States; be employed in a patient care setting or have access to a site that provides opportunities to practice pharmaceutical care (e.g., community pharmacy, hospital pharmacy, managed care pharmacy). Applications to the Doctor of Pharmacy Pathway (Postbaccalaureate) must include official transcripts from all institutions attended as well as the institution that granted the BS in pharmacy degree, curriculum vitae/resume, a short essay of 500 words stating professional goals and objectives, and proof of current pharmacy licensure. Course-by course evaluations from World Education Services or equivalent are required of all foreign transcripts. The priority filing date for submitting application materials to the Admission Office is May 1. The program begins In September-however; a 3-day orientation is required before the start of the program. The online application is available at http://www.mcphs.edu/apply beginning in September. Because seats in the pathway are limited, it is important that applications be returned early in the application period. Academic Policies for the Doctor of Pharmacy Pathway (Postbaccalaureate) In addition to the academic policies of the Doctor of Pharmacy program, the following requirements apply to PharmD students in the postbaccalaureate pathway: The minimum overall grade point average for graduation from the Postbaccalaureate Doctor of Pharmacy program is 2.7. If the cumulative grade point average of any student falls below 2.7, the student is placed on academic probation and has two semesters to correct the deficiency. Failure to achieve a grade point average of 2.7 following the probationary period is grounds for dismissal from the pathway. For a description of the appeal process, refer to the MCPHS University student handbook. The minimum acceptable grade is C- in courses and modules in the pathway. Courses in which grades below passing are earned must be repeated until the minimum grade level is met. A student may petition to replace a maximum of one repeated course grade in his or her calculated grade point average.

More frequent meetings of the Graduate Advisory Committee and the student are encouraged in order to facilitate student-committee interaction. Meetings may be called at the discretion of the student, the research advisor, or if two or more members of the Graduate Advisory Committee request such a meeting. 317 May 17, 2021 Admission to Degree Candidacy Formal admission to candidacy occurs when the student with full graduate status actually becomes a candidate for the Master of Science or PhD degree as regulated by the Graduate Council. Such admission requires approval of the student's Advisory Committee, through formal application (Petition to Graduate in Graduate Studies form) on or before the dates stipulated by the current University regulations on file with the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Admission to candidacy depends, among other requirements, upon the maintenance of an overall \"B\" average or higher, and all grades of \"I\" must be removed. The graduate student seeking candidacy for the doctoral degree may do so following the successful completion of the qualifying examinations. The degree requirements for the PhD degree program should be satisfied within two years of satisfactorily completing the qualifying examination and within maximum time limits delineated under Degree Requirements. Change of Program Graduate students should work carefully with their major professors and advisory committees in designing their degree programs. If a change in the degree program is deemed appropriate, it must be approved by the major advisor, the Graduate Advisory Committee, and the Graduate Council, with recommendation to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Only grades of B or higher may be transferred and used towards total credit count. A change of Program form must be completed. Students are not generally allowed to change programs until completion of at least one academic year (two semesters). Probation and Dismissal Probation Policy The Graduate Academic Standing Committee will recommend a student be placed on probation in his/her graduate program for unsatisfactory performance in either the classroom or laboratory. Reasons for being placed on probation will include: Failure to achieve a minimum passing grade in either a required or elective course all as specified in the student's program. Failure to achieve and maintain the minimum cumulative GPA as specified in the student's program. Failure to achieve a satisfactory grade in seminar, lab-rotation, and/or research. NOTE: For students that are on probation but are unable to repeat a required course due to the course being closed or not available in the immediate succeeding term, the student will continue on probation but this will not be considered another violation. Thus, the probation period is extended up to the next available course offering. This is not deemed as lack of demonstrating improvement at the end of the first probationary period. Probationary status is not subject to appeal. Students are expected to complete the corrective action and return to good standing during the next regular semester (ie Fall or Spring). Dismissal Policy A graduate student may be dismissed form his/her graduate program in the following ways: 1. The Graduate Academic Standing Committee recommends dismissal to the Dean of the School of Pharmacy because: a. the student failed to return to good standing after being placed on probation for two consecutive terms or; b. the student's Graduate Advisory Committee recommends to the Graduate Academic Standing Committee that the student be dismissed because i) the student failed to meet the continuation or progression standards (eg PhD student has failed two attempts at either of the oral or written qualifying exams) or; ii) two-thirds of the student's Graduate Advisory Committee members formally vote that the student has not made satisfactory research progress in the program or; iii) the student was unsuccessful in defending his/her thesis or dissertation. If the Dean of the School of Pharmacy accepts the recommendation of the Graduate Academic Standing Committee, the Dean of the School of Pharmacy shall notify the student of the decision. 2. The Dean of Students may dismiss a student from the graduate program for other situations listed in the Student Handbook. A student whose conduct (see Student Code of Conduct in Student Handbook) is unsatisfactory may be dismissed from the University at any time. In such a case, tuition fees paid for the current academic term will not be refunded. 318 May 17, 2021 In all cases, the dismissed student will receive written notice of dismissal which will include procedures for appeal, and notice of loss of housing, financial aid, and registration. Written notices will also outline any conditions the student should meet in an effort to gain readmission (e.g., taking a specific course and achieving a specific grade). Appeal of a Dismissal Decision based upon recommendation of the student's Graduate Advisory Committee The student may appeal in writing to the Dean of the School of Pharmacy who will convene a Faculty Panel to review the appeal and make a recommendation as to the student's appeal to the Dean of the School of Pharmacy. This review should include copies of prior documents of the appeals process. The student has the right to directly address the Faculty Panel; the Faculty Panel may conduct any enquiry necessary for the review process. The Faculty Panel's recommendation shall be prepared in writing and submitted to the Dean of the School. The recommendation and all documentation is to be retained in the student's file. A negative decision by the Dean may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Provost, whose decision is final. Repeating Courses A student's Graduate Advisory Committee may permit the student to repeat a course as long as the successful completion of the course would allow the student to meet the minimum requirement of the program including cumulative GPA and progression. Credit hours from courses that were repeated are counted only once. A student is not allowed to attempt a course more than twice. Simultaneous Enrollment in another Degree Program Any student currently enrolled in the master's or doctoral degree in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Pharmaceutical Business and Administrative Sciences programs at MCPHS may not enroll simultaneously in another undergraduate or graduate degree program at MCPHS or another University or university unless permitted by the Graduate Council. Student Participation in Proprietary Research When the Faculty of the University are involved in research, some of which may be of a proprietary nature, particular care must be taken to ensure that the need for graduate students to publicly present and publicly defend the results of their thesis or dissertation research is not compromised. Graduate student advisors, and graduate students themselves, therefore, share in the responsibility to ensure that graduate students do not become involved in thesis or dissertation research that is, or has the potential to become, proprietary if participation in that research delays completion of their degree requirements or negatively affects their productivity or future employability. The policy of the Division of Graduate Studies and the University is that a faculty member or a graduate student cannot enter into an agreement that prevents or significantly delays the presentation or publication of research results. Journal publication delays not exceeding a year are acceptable, but publication of PhD dissertation materials through ProQuest is a requirement of the Division of Graduate Studies and, thus, cannot be delayed. In instances where, despite good faith efforts on the part of the research advisor, and the graduate student, the graduate student's thesis or dissertation research is later found to be of a proprietary nature, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies will be notified immediately. The Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, in turn, immediately convenes a meeting of the graduate student, the research advisor, and members of the student's thesis or dissertation committee. This group, in consultation with the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies resolves the problem. If the situation cannot be resolved through the efforts of this group, a ruling is made by the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Thesis A thesis contributing new knowledge is required on a topic in the major discipline. Prior to a student being certified as a candidate for the thesis track MS degree, s/he submits a research proposal on the proposed topic. Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy and Master of Science in Clinical Research students seeking to enroll in DRA 810 Case Study Thesis must submit a one-page proposal letter for approval by the program director or course faculty. The proposal must comply with the Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations and/or MCPHS University School of Pharmacy Division of Graduate Studies Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations as amended from time to time. This proposal should show evidence of creative integration of course material, superimposed on a sound understanding of the pertinent literature. Upon approval of the research proposal by the research advisor, Graduate Advisory Committee, school dean or department chair, and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, the latter with regard to availability and utilization of resources, the student is certified as a candidate for the thesis track Master of Science degree. The Graduate Advisory Committee critically reviews the written proposal. The student should understand that the proposal is acceptable only if it is imaginative and provides a scientifically rigorous test of a meaningful hypothesis. The proposal may be strengthened with data from preliminary experiments. Within two weeks of the submission of the written proposal to the committee, the student presents and defends the research proposal orally before the committee. The student is questioned on those methodologies and background areas needed to complete successfully the proposed research. Such admission to candidacy must occur at least three months prior to completing requirements for the degree. The 319 May 17, 2021 Division of Graduate Studies recognizes that the student's research may deviate substantially from that originally proposed. The student should be encouraged to pursue promising leads; however, long-term changes in the direction of the student's research should be in consultation with the Graduate Advisory Committee. Off-campus research is not permitted, except for unusual circumstances that require a portion of the research to be completed off-campus in the continental United States, or for students admitted into an online Master of Science degree program. If such a situation arises, the research advisor with the written approval of the Graduate Advisory Committee submits to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Graduate Council a written request for permission to conduct the research off-campus. Along with the request is a letter from the off-campus researcher agreeing to serve as the off-campus mentor and a description of the resources the off-campus site provides. A visit to the off-campus site for the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (or their designee) and the research advisor is arranged once the research commences off-campus. Such permission is not required for students admitted into an online Master of Science degree program. Following approval of the Graduate Advisory Committee that the thesis is ready for defense, one copy of the final draft of the thesis must be available to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies not less than two weeks before a date is set for the student's final examination. After making final corrections, the original and one copy of the thesis, approved by the Graduate Advisory Committee and the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, per requirements of the Library, must be in the Graduate Office two weeks prior to graduation along with a RECEIPT OF THESIS/DISSERTATION Form. The thesis must comply with the regulations contained in Handbook for the Preparation of Graduate Theses and Dissertations which is Appendix I. Students are responsible for all costs related to preparation of the thesis. Final Examination Each candidate is required to pass a general oral examination covering the major field and the thesis/dissertation (MS in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy, PEP non thesis graduate students, and Master of Science in Clinical Research students are not required to pass an oral examination). This shall begin with a formal presentation with appropriate slides and shall be at least 30 minutes in length for the MS candidate. The examination is conducted by the Graduate Advisory Committee, with the candidate's research advisor presiding as the chairperson. The Graduate Advisory Committee will have primary responsibility for evaluating the student's research, including the written thesis/dissertation, and the formal oral presentation which is open to the University community. Approval of the final examination by the Graduate Advisory Committee, with no more than one dissenting vote, is necessary to recommend the awarding of the degree. The decision of the Graduate Advisory Committee is forwarded to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies (THESIS/DISSERTATION DEFENSE Form). The graduate faculty has the authority, which it has delegated to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, to approve the candidate for the awarding of the degree. Only one opportunity for re-examination shall be given (in not less than three months and not more than one year from the time of the final examination at which this decision was made). Any candidate who is granted the privilege of re-examination shall retain the status and obligations of a graduate student until the time of such re-examination. Programs of Study Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy (Boston and Online) The University offers a Master of Science degree in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy (MS in RAHP), and two graduate certificate programs, one in Regulatory Affairs and the other in Health Policy. The MS in RAHP offers academic training in the law and regulation of healthcare, drugs, devices; and health policy to candidates having attained a prior baccalaureate degree or equivalent professional degree. Candidates for this program are those interested in pursuing careers in regulatory affairs, project/product management, clinical development, marketing, quality assurance, quality control, and manufacturing, or with federal or state healthcare regulatory agencies, clinical research organizations, managed care, or other health-related fields where knowledge of the regulatory and legal environment is a prerequisite. In addition to the general MS degree requirements described in the MCPHS University course catalog, the program may establish additional requirements. Although the primary emphasis of this program is placed on regulatory affairs, other components such as ethics, policy development, policy analysis, and law are also explored. The program aims to educate a broad range or professionals who are interested in developing expertise in regulatory and policy education. 320 May 17, 2021 Program Objectives and Outcomes Upon successful completion of this program, a graduate with a Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs and Health Policy should be able to develop a strategy for a medical product that addresses regulatory, financial, clinical, and ethical requirements; evaluate and deconstruct regulatory and policy issues concerning pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biologics, or healthcare in an industry or government workplace; provide regulatory guidance and technical support (e.g., on FDA compliance) to members of the healthcare industry and/or regulatory agencies; assist pharmaceutical companies in their efforts to gain FDA marketing approval of drugs, medical devices, and biologics by drawing on a comprehensive knowledge base of regulation and policy; assist regulatory agencies in developing, analyzing, and evaluating healthcare related policy and regulation; assist regulatory agencies in evaluating new or existing drugs and medical devices for marketing approval; develop, coordinate, and implement drug, device, or healthcare regulatory schema or policy initiatives; and demonstrate and incorporate a broad sensitivity to healthcare-related issues and their regulatory or policy implications.

The composition of molecules and their interactions in both a chemical and a physical sense are studied, with the aim of predicting the behavior and properties of new substances. A fundamental understanding of the properties of chemical substances finds application in most frontier areas of biologically related scientific research being conducted in industrial, government, and academic laboratories. Programs in chemistry lead to the MS and PhD degrees. Admission to the chemistry graduate programs requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology that includes two semesters each of general, organic, and analytical chemistry (one semester of which must include instrumental analysis); physical chemistry; calculus; and physics. Students without these prerequisites may be required to complete American Chemical Society proficiency examinations in general, organic, and/or analytical chemistry during the first semester. Medicinal chemistry is concerned with the study of those structural, stereochemical, and physical parameters that affect the biological interaction of synthetic and naturally occurring drugs at the molecular level. Research is directed toward a fuller understanding of the pharmacological actions of such substances, leading to improved drug design. Specialization in these programs requires a broad knowledge of organic and heterocyclic chemistry, pharmacy, spectroscopic instrumentation, and pharmacology. Ongoing research programs include the synthesis and evaluation of antiviral and anticancer drugs, the synthesis of new laser dyes, and the isolation and characterization of natural products from plants.

The programs are designed to provide an appropriate balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of the area of specialization, which enables the student to be immediately productive yet prepared for future growth and development. Admission to the pharmaceutics graduate programs requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology that includes two semesters each of general, organic, and analytical chemistry (one semester of which must include instrumental analysis); physical chemistry; calculus; and physics. Holders of undergraduate degrees in nonpharmacy areas are required to complete the following pharmacy courses for no credit: Physical Pharmacy, Dosage Forms, Biopharmaceutics, and Pharmacokinetics. The student is exposed to a broad range of theory and concepts, intended to promote a firm understanding of the materials and technologies associated with pharmaceutical product development, manufacture, and evaluation. The program encompasses the study of pharmaceutical dosage forms, the release of a drug from the dosage form, drug dissolution, drug absorption, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics involves the study of the rates of drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, and the quantitative relationship of these rates to drug therapy and/or toxicity. Research projects have typically involved development of new drug products, novel dosage forms, the release of a drug from new dosage forms, preformulation investigation of new drug entities, and pharmacokinetics.

Master of Science / Doctor of Philosophy in Pharmacology Pharmacology is the medical science that involves all facets of the action of drugs and environmental chemicals on biological systems and their constituent parts. This includes everything from the intermolecular reactions of chemical compounds within a cell to the evaluation of the effectiveness of a drug in the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of human disease. Pharmacology offers unique opportunities to contribute to the knowledge, well-being, and survival of mankind. Admission to the Pharmacology graduate program requires an undergraduate degree in pharmacy, chemistry, or biology. While formal training in pharmacology and human physiology at the undergraduate level is helpful, it is not required for admission. Students who are deficient in these areas are required to audit the undergraduate course sequences in pharmacology / medicinal chemistry and/or physiology. Programs leading to the degrees of Master of Science and PhD are offered for graduate study in pharmacology. Each comprises two major components: (1) coursework in specific disciplines such as pharmacology, physiology, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, and related disciplines, and (2) training in research and the scientific method. The programs prepare students for positions of leadership and responsibility in academic, industrial, and government settings. Theoretical and experiential situations in which pharmacological information may be applied are provided to help students develop an innovative and creative approach to problem solving.

The curriculum includes the elements of foundational sciences, clinical sciences, evidence-based practice, professional roles and practice issues, healthcare systems, and management competencies in the educational preparation of physical therapists. The coursework is designed to reinforce and build on each element so that the student can synthesize and apply the learned material to a variety of clinical, research, and management situations. This postbaccalaureate program builds on the knowledge acquired from an undergraduate education and has two components: didactic and clinical. Through the didactic component, students acquire the knowledge and skills and develop the attitudes and professional behaviors needed for physical therapy practice. In the clinical education component, students apply their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and professional behaviors in clinical settings away from MCPHS. The clinical education component accounts for about one-third of the curriculum. The curriculum for the entry-level Doctor of Physical Therapy program has a total of 122 semester hours with 30 weeks of full-time clinical education. The program is made up of five concentration areas: Foundations of PT Practice (32 semester hours), Evidence in PT Practice (8 semester hours), Professional Issues in PT Practice (8 semester hours), Patient/Client management (40 semester hours), and Clinical Education (35 semester hours). Application for the Doctor of Physical Therapy program is through the Physical Therapy Centralized Application Service (PTCAS) at www.ptcas.org.

Physical therapists must be prepared to conduct in a timely manner a relevant patient examination, evaluate the results of this examination, and synthesize these data to establish an accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and plan of care; implement an intervention; and use the process of reexamination to assess patient outcomes. Physical therapists must also possess the skills necessary to determine when referral of the patient/client to another healthcare professional is appropriate. Physical therapists must provide evidence that the care that they provide is effective, often through the conduct of clinically based research. Doctor of Physical Therapy students must be able to complete the following: Participation in all required aspects of classroom and laboratory activities; Participation in all required aspects of clinical experience activities; Effective communication with other students, instructors, assistive personnel, patients, family members, payors, and other healthcare professionals; Maintenance of a safe environment for other individuals and for one's self, including use of universal precautions; Provision of emergency patient care, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); Completion of elements of patient/client management, including examination, evaluation of data, formulation of physical therapy diagnosis and prognosis, intervention, assessment of outcomes, and record keeping; Completion of specific patient/client interventions and treatments, including patient and family education, application of modalities, therapeutic exercise, and functional training; Clinical agencies may have additional or agency-specific technical standards, which take precedence over MCPHS technical standards. The Commission on Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) accredits professional physical therapy programs and requires that graduates of these programs be able to deliver entry-level clinical services. Graduates of entry-level programs are required to possess a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of physical therapy. Physical therapists require the intellectual-communication, behavioral-social, observational, and motor abilities to meet the standard of practice. Certain disabilities can interfere with a student's ability to complete the program of study and acquire the essential functions necessary for the practice of physical therapy. Reasonable accommodation can be made to compensate for some limitations. However, those that interfere with patient care or safety, or require the use of an intermediary may be incompatible with independent professional practice. Technical Standards for Physical Therapy Intellectual-Communication Abilities Intellectual skills include the ability to recall and comprehend large amounts of didactic information and to apply this information to the examination, evaluation, and management of routine and complex physical therapy problems. Effective communication skills enable the physical therapist to elicit appropriate information from patients and to effectively explain examination and treatment procedures. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to communicate clearly and in a timely manner with patients, physicians, other health professionals, community or professional groups, and colleagues; report clearly, legibly, and in a timely manner through progress notes in patient charts, reports to physicians, insurance forms, and order forms; respond to such things as a patient calling from behind a curtain, warning calls from anyone, and machine alarms; and participate in group meetings to deliver and receive information and to respond to questions from a variety of sources. Behavioral-Social Attributes Students must demonstrate the ability to practice in a professional and ethical manner and possess the emotional stability to practice in a stressful work environment. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, cultural competence, and motivation are all personal attributes associated with the practice of physical therapy. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to individuals of all ages; genders; races; and socioeconomic, religious, 344 May 17, 2021 and cultural backgrounds; cope with the stress of heavy workloads, demanding patients, and life-threatening clinical situations; and recognize and respond appropriately to potentially hazardous situations. Observational Skills Observation is one of the key tools that a physical therapist possesses. To gather data on patient/client condition and to appropriately manipulate machinery are critical to being an effective physical therapist. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to observe and interpret patient movement, skin condition, safety hazards, and changes in appearance; and read and interpret equipment dials; assessment graphs; patient charts; professional literature; and notes from patients, physicians, and other health professionals. Motor Skills The practice of physical therapy requires that the practitioner possess the ability to perform basic evaluative and therapeutic procedures that require specific physical skills and stamina (e.g., palpation, transfers, gait training). A therapist must be able to use vision and somatic sensation in the evaluation and treatment of patients. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to lift, carry, and push patients (150 pounds) in beds or wheelchairs, heavy equipment, body parts, and patients transferring from bed to chair or mat, or be able to instruct others in the activity, including proper body mechanics; walk and balance well enough to help patients walk and transfer with or without equipment, and prevent injury to patient and self; palpate anatomical structures and handle injured body parts without causing injury to the subject; exhibit sufficient manual dexterity to manipulate very small equipment, provide support and resistance as needed through complex exercise movements, perform CPR, manipulate dials, and treat acutely ill patients without disturbing sensitive monitoring instruments and lines; and provide for the patient's safety and well-being in all therapeutic or transporting activities. Professional Behaviors In addition to knowledge and skill acquisition, the process of becoming a professional involves developing competence in professional behavior. Students are expected to display professional behavior at all times including during clinical education experiences. This includes displaying a professional demeanor in interactions and boundaries with patients and their families, clinical staff, peers, faculty, and the public at all times in consideration of their representation of the profession of physical therapy and MCPHS. The 10 requisite professional behaviors are defined below. Any student demonstrating unprofessional behavior will be referred to the PT Professional and Academic Review Committee. Definitions Critical thinking: The ability to question logically, identify, generate, and evaluate elements of logical argument; recognize and differentiate facts, appropriate or faulty inferences, and assumptions; and distinguish relevant from irrelevant information. The ability to appropriately utilize, analyze, and critically evaluate scientific evidence to develop a logical argument, and to identify and determine the impact of bias on the decision-making process Communication: The ability to communicate effectively (i.e., verbal, nonverbal, reading, writing, and listening) for varied audiences and purposes Problem solving: The ability to recognize and define problems, analyze data, develop and implement solutions, and evaluate outcomes Interpersonal skills: The ability to interact effectively with patients, families, colleagues, other healthcare professionals, and the community in a culturally aware manner Responsibility: The ability to be accountable for the outcomes of personal and professional actions and to follow through on commitments that encompass the profession within the scope of work, community, and social responsibilities Professionalism: The ability to exhibit appropriate professional conduct and to represent the profession effectively while promoting the growth/development of the physical therapy profession Use of constructive feedback: The ability to seek out and identify quality sources of feedback, reflect on and integrate the feedback, and provide meaningful feedback to others 345 May 17, 2021 Effective use of time and resources: The ability to manage time and resources effectively to obtain the maximum possible benefit Stress management: The ability to identify sources of stress and to develop and implement effective coping behaviors. This applies to interactions with self, patients/clients and their families, and members of the healthcare team in work/life scenarios. Commitment to learning: The ability to self-direct learning to include the identification of needs and sources of learning, and to continually seek and apply new knowledge, behaviors, and skills Adapted from L.B. Kontney, W. May, and..Z.A. Iglarsh. \"Professional Behaviors for the 21st Century.\" Manuscript in progress, University of Wisconsin-Madison Physical Therapy Educational Program, 2010. Academic Standards for the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program A minimum grade of B- is required for all physical therapy (PTH-designated) courses in the DPT curriculum. Any courses designated as pass/fail must be passed in order to progress with the DPT curriculum. The minimum passing grade for all cumulative practical examinations is 80%, or B-. All DPT courses must be taken in the specified sequence of the curriculum. An individual PTH course may be repeated only once. A second failed attempt with a grade below the B- standard will result in dismissal from the DPT program. Throughout the DPT program, failure to meet the required minimum standard (B-) in more than two separate DPT courses will result in dismissal from the DPT program. A physical therapy student may be placed on nonprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the Physical Therapy DPT program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the Physical Therapy program. Progression and Retention Progression in the DPT program is dependent upon the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a semester GPA of 3.0 as the student progresses. To progress within both the didactic and the clinical phases of the program, students must achieve a final course grade of B- or better, or a pass for a pass/fail course. A student must be in good academic standing with a professional cumulative GPA of 3.0 to progress to full time clinical education experiences (PTHC 700). In all PTH-designated courses, obtaining a course grade of less than a B- or a fail results in a student's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program (i.e., results in nonprogression status) because DPT courses are offered only once a year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the student's original cohort. Students who fail a professional course are required to repeat the course prior to progressing in the curriculum. Students who fail a clinical education experience may be required to complete PTH 685 prior to completing the clinical education experience. Progression is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) If a student is unable to progress in a professional course or clinical education after two attempts, the student will be referred to the School of Physical Therapy Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Students must complete the requirements for the DPT degree within five years from initial matriculation. If this time limit in the DPT program has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Director of the School of Physical Therapy, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs/Provost. Students must be in good academic standing with a professional cumulative GPA of 3.0 to be eligible for graduation. Policy for Reentry and Content Validation after Nonprogression or Leave of Absence Students who are not continuously enrolled in the sequence of the DPT curriculum for a period of one semester or more, or who withdraw from the DPT program via leave of absence, must validate previous knowledge and skills held prior to program exit before they may reenroll in any DPT courses. Reenrollment is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) In order to ensure that all students are competent and safe in the delivery and application of patient care, any student who has not been continuously enrolled must, at the discretion of the faculty, demonstrate identified clinical competency. The validation will occur via the student's demonstration of knowledge and skills, that is, meeting established program clinical competencies. The student must notify the Director of the School of Physical Therapy by March 1 for fall start, February 1 for May start, and October 1 for January start to make arrangements for preparing for and performing 346 May 17, 2021 validation testing. Students attempting to return from a leave of absence must also be cleared to return to classes by designated staff in the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment and the Dean of Students (if a medical leave of absence) prior to performing validation testing. The Center for Academic Success and Enrichment will notify the Director of the School of Physical Therapy when the student is eligible to take the validation test. School of Physical Therapy faculty will provide guidance as to the content and skills (competencies) to be reviewed by the student prior to the testing. The validation testing consists of testing to assess knowledge and clinical skills taught prior to the semester of anticipated reentry. It is the student's responsibility to prepare for the validation testing. If a student fails the validation test, he or she must enroll in a directed study to remediate, followed by a second validation test, prior to reentering the program. Students must pass the validation testing with a minimum grade of B-, at the 80% level, in order to reenter the DPT curriculum. Failure to pass the second validation test after a directed study will result in dismissal from the Physical Therapy program. The number of semester credits assigned to the directed study course will vary (1-3 semester credits) depending upon the number of semesters successfully completed in the program. If the student completed two or fewer semesters, 1 credit will be assigned; if three or four semesters, 2 credits; and if more than four semesters, 3 credits. Students may not take any program professional courses until the directed study and content validation testing has been successfully completed.

The sonographer, a highly skilled imaging technologist, uses sophisticated ultrasound equipment to identify disease. In addition, the sonographer works closely with physicians in the processing of the ultrasound images to make a diagnosis. The DMS program offers a full-time, Fast Track, 16-month course of study that begins in the fall semester. The comprehensive curriculum includes primary specialties of ultrasound, plus secondary specialties, offered across two tracks; the General ultrasound track, includes training in abdominal, obstetrics/gynecology, breast, pediatric, musculoskeletal and vascular sonography; the Echocardiography track focuses on adult echocardiography with an optional secondary specialty track in pediatric echocardiography. Registry Exam Eligibility Graduates of the DMS programs are eligible to sit for several registry exams offered by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) and Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI). Echocardiography and General Ultrasound graduates may apply under ARDMS exam prerequisite 2 for the adult and pediatric echocardiography, abdomen and OB/GYN credentialing exams. Echocardiography graduates may apply under CCI exam prerequisite RCS4 (adult cardiac) and RCCS5 (pediatric/adult congenital). The student must pass the ARDMS Sonography Principles & Instrumentation (SPI) registry exam in order to pass the DMS 304, Problem Solving in Physics and Instrumentation course. In addition, passing the SPI registry exam is required to continue into Year II of the program. All DMS courses during the professional phase of studies must be completed with a weighted grade 77% (C+) in order to progress in the program. Students must complete all professional coursework at MCPHS to receive their degrees in the Diagnostic Medical Sonography programs. The MCPHS graduate is well suited to work in several DMS specialties and, with the BS degree, has the comprehensive education required to become a leader in the profession. Students with a bachelor's or associate's degree, or the appropriate amount of college credits and prerequisites, may apply to the fast track program. Courses must have been completed at a regionally accredited college or university with a grade of C or better for transfer. Math and science courses taken more than ten years prior to the anticipated date of matriculation to MCPHS will not be accepted.

Up to six (6) credit hours of electives may be taken concurrently with professional DMS courses. DMS Clinical Rotation Policy Clinical experience is an integral part of the Diagnostic Medical Sonography curriculum. MCPHS University has clinical affiliations with excellent medical institutions throughout New England and beyond. We strive to meet each student's requests for clinical locations. However, to ensure all students have adequate exposure to the variety of ultrasound procedures necessary for completion of their degrees, students may be placed in a clinical site beyond their desired location for at least one semester. Students are responsible for transportation to and from all assigned clinical facilities as well any expenses incurred to complete the clinical requirements of the programs. This includes, but may not be limited to daily transportation, housing, and living expenses. DMS Technical Standards Minimum expectations of the DMS programs are to prepare competent, entry-level sonographers in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains. To meet these expectations, students enrolled in health sciences professional programs must have abilities and technical skills to be successful healthcare providers. The following technical standards describe the non-academic qualifications the DMS programs considers essential for the successful progression in, and completion of the educational objectives of its curriculum. Although the DMS program will engage in an interactive process with applicants with disabilities, it reserves the right not to admit any applicant who, upon completion of the interactive process, cannot meet the technical standards set forth below, with or without reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodation for persons with prior documented disabilities will be considered on an individual basis. Students wishing to request accommodations for disabilities should contact the Director for Office of Student Access and Accommodations. A DMS professional provides direct care for patients in hospitals or outpatient facilities and must be able to apply acquired knowledge and physical tasks to skillfully perform sonography procedures.

The four-year program uses the latest in instructional and clinical technology to assure that its graduates possess the state-of-the-art education necessary to diagnose and manage the wide variety of ocular and systemic conditions encountered in today's diverse clinical settings. The program features clinically relevant instruction and patient care; dedicated faculty who place a high importance on teaching, advising, and individual student development; and clinical experiences in selected facilities in on-campus and off-campus optometric and ophthalmologic clinics as well as Veterans' Administration Centers, community health centers, hospitals, and community agencies in and beyond the Greater Worcester region. Technical Standards In order to fully describe elements required for successful completion of its professional optometric degree program, the MCPHS School of Optometry has adopted guidelines developed and adopted by the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO). All students are expected to demonstrate each of the competencies contained within these functional guidelines: Functional Guidelines for Didactic and Clinical Optometric Education at MCPHS University To provide guidance to those considering optometry as a profession, the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry (ASCO) has established functional guidelines for optometric education. The ability to meet these guidelines, along with other criteria established by individual optometric institutions, is necessary for graduation from an optometric professional degree program. Our mission is to produce graduates fully qualified to provide quality comprehensive eye care services to the public. To fulfill this mission, each institution must ensure that students demonstrate satisfactory knowledge and skill in the provision of optometric care. Admission committees therefore consider a candidate's capacity to function effectively in academic and clinical environments as well as a candidate's academic qualifications and personal attributes. The functional guidelines in optometric education require that the candidate/student possess appropriate abilities in the following areas: (1) observation; (2) communication; (3) sensory and motor coordination; (4) intellectual-conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities; and (5) behavioral and social attributes. Each of these areas is described in this document. In any case where a student's abilities in one of these areas are compromised, he or she must demonstrate alternative means and/or abilities to meet the functional requirements. It is expected that seeking and using such alternative means and/or abilities shall be the responsibility of the student. Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, the school or college will be expected to provide reasonable assistance and accommodation to the student. Observation Abilities The student must be able to acquire a defined level of required knowledge as presented through lectures, laboratories, demonstrations, patient interaction, and self-study. Acquiring this body of information necessitates the functional use of visual, auditory, and somatic sensation enhanced by the functional use of other sensory modalities. Examples of 378 May 17, 2021 these observational skills in which accurate information needs to be extracted in an efficient manner include the following: Visual abilities (as they relate to such things as visual acuity, color vision, and binocularity): Visualizing and reading information from papers, films, slides, video, and computer displays Observing optical, anatomic, physiologic, and pharmacologic demonstrations and experiments Discriminating microscopic images of tissue and microorganisms Observing a patient and noting nonverbal signs Discriminating numbers, images, and patterns associated with diagnostic tests and instruments Visualizing specific ocular tissues in order to discern three-dimensional relationships, depth, and color changes Auditory abilities: Understanding verbal presentations in lecture, laboratory, and patient settings Recognizing and interpreting various sounds associated with laboratory experiments as well as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures Tactile abilities: Palpating the eye and related areas to determine the integrity of the underlying structures; Palpating and feeling certain cardiovascular pulses Communication Abilities The student must be able to communicate effectively, efficiently, and sensitively with patients and their families, peers, staff, instructors, and other members of the healthcare team. The student must be able to demonstrate established communication skills using traditional and alternative means. Examples of required communications skills include the following: Relating effectively and sensitively to patients, conveying compassion and empathy; Perceiving verbal and nonverbal communication such as sadness, worry, agitation, and lack of comprehension from patients; Eliciting information from patients and observing changes in mood and activity; Communicating quickly, effectively, and efficiently in oral and written English with patients and other members of the healthcare team; Reading and legibly recording observations, test results, and management plans accurately; Completing assignments, patient records, and correspondence accurately and in a timely manner Sensory and Motor Coordination Abilities Students must possess the sensory and motor skills necessary to perform an eye examination, including emergency care. In general, this requires sufficient exteroception sense (touch, pain, temperature), proprioceptive sense (position, pressure, movement, stereognosis, and vibration) and fine motor function (significant coordination and manual dexterity using arms, wrists, hands, and fingers). Examples of skills required include, but are not limited to, the following: Instillation of ocular pharmaceutical agents; Insertion, removal, and manipulation of contact lenses; Assessment of blood pressure and pulse; Removal of foreign objects from the cornea; Simultaneous manipulation of lenses, instruments, and therapeutic agents and devices; Reasonable facility of movement; Injections into the eye, lids, or limbs Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Abilities Problem solving, a most critical skill, is essential for optometric students and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. In order to be an effective problem solver, the student must be able to accurately and efficiently utilize such abilities as measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, judgment, investigation, memory, numerical recognition, and synthesis. Examples of these abilities include being able to: determine appropriate questions to be asked and clinical tests to be performed; identify and analyze significant findings from history, examination, and other test data; demonstrate good judgment and provide a reasonable assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients; retain, recall, and obtain information in an efficient manner; and identify and communicate the limits of one's knowledge and skill. 379 May 17, 2021 Behavioral and Social Attributes The student must possess the necessary behavioral and social attributes for the study and practice of optometry. Examples of such attributes include the following: Satisfactory emotional health required for full utilization of one's intellectual ability; High ethical standards and integrity; An empathy with patients and concern for their welfare; Commitment to the optometric profession and its standards; Effective interpersonal relationships with patients, peers, and instructors; Professional demeanor; Effective functioning under varying degrees of stress and workload; Adaptability to changing environments and uncertainties; Positive acceptance of suggestions and constructive criticism Candidates with questions or concerns about how their own conditions or disabilities might affect their ability to meet these functional guidelines are encouraged to meet with an admission counselor prior to submitting an application. Admission Prerequisites Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited postsecondary institution in the United States strongly recommended; a minimum of 90 semester hours or 135 quarter hours of college education must be completed prior to matriculation; Recommended minimum overall grade point average (GPA) and prerequisite GPA of 2.9 or better (on a 4.0 scale); Minimum grade of C in all prerequisite courses; Completed Optometry Centralized Application Service (OptomCAS) application; Optometry Admission Test (OAT) report; score of 300 or higher recommended or Graduate Record Exam (GRE) report; score of 150 or higher recommended; Two letters of recommendation; one professional and one academic preferred; R\u00e9sum\u00e9; Personal statement (500 to 1,000 words); Evidence of familiarity with optometry (shadowing a practitioner, volunteer work in optometric offices, etc.); Official Advanced Placement (AP) or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) scores, if applicable (transfer credit granted for AP scores of 4 or 5 and CLEP scores of 50 or higher); Official TOEFL (minimum of 213 computer-based or 79 iBT) or IELTS (minimum 6.5) scores for all applicants whose primary language is not English; Official transcripts from non-U.S. secondary schools, colleges, or universities submitted to World Education Services (WES) for a course-by-course evaluation.

To progress within both the didactic and the clinical phases of the program, students must achieve a final course grade of C or better, or a pass for a pass/fail course. In all OPT-designated courses, obtaining a course grade of less than a C or a fail results in a student's having to repeat the course, which stops progression through the program (i.e., results in nonprogression status) because OD courses are offered only once a year. The student will decelerate to a class cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the student's original cohort. An optometry student may be placed on nonprogression status only once during his or her tenure in the School of Optometry (OD) program. A student who receives a second nonprogression status in a subsequent semester will be dismissed from the optometry program. Directed study during the first three years may be required as remediation in lieu of repeating one year (1) if the student fails one course that is not sequential and/or (2) at the recommendation of the instructor of record and the Academic Standing Committee. The final decision for approval of the directed study requirement during the four-year program will be at the dean's discretion. 382 May 17, 2021 Students in their fourth professional year who fail a clinical education experience may be required to repeat a clinical externship course, or to complete a directed study course (ranging from 1 to 3 credit hours) prior to completing their clinical education experience. Progression is subject to clinical placement availability. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that space will be available at the desired time of return of the student; it may take up to two years for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.) If a student is unable to progress in a professional course or clinical education experience after two attempts, the student will be referred to the program's Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Students must complete the requirements for the Doctor of Optometry (OD) degree within five years from initial matriculation. If this time limit in the OD program has elapsed and the student has not completed degree requirements, the student must request an extension in writing and meet with the Dean of the School of Optometry, who may approve or deny the extension request. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs / Provost. Clinical Rotations At a minimum, optometry clinical rotations require background screenings. For additional information, please contact the MCPHS Chief Compliance Officer. CPR Certification All students must complete CPR training prior to beginning clinical experiences in OPT 650 Clinical Optometry. Students must be certified in Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) at the Healthcare Provider Level by the American Heart Association (AHA). Students must provide a copy of the AHA Healthcare Provider Level card indicating active certification. It is recommended that the student verify the course in advance to ensure that the course is appropriate. Transportation/Housing Reliable transportation to, from, and during all clinical experiences is the responsibility of the student. A number of clinical rotations in all years of the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and to ensure availability and quality of clinical education sites. The University will make every effort to accommodate requests regarding assignments to experiential education sites, but students generally can expect to be assigned to clinical sites some distance from the campus for at least a portion of their required clinical rotations beginning in the first year. In such instances, students are responsible for transportation and other related travel or housing expenses. Employment Due to the rigorous nature of the optometry program, the demands placed on students are extremely high, particularly with respect to their clinical rotation schedule and associated student requirements. It is for this reason that students are strongly discouraged from engaging in any outside, non-program-related employment throughout the program of study. Doctor of Optometry/Master of Public Health Dual Degree (OD/MPH) This program option enables matriculated Doctor of Optometry (OD) students to also earn a Master of Public Health degree. Students will apply to the OD/MPH in the spring of their first year, and if accepted, begin MPH courses that summer. Optometrists with training and experience in public health can provide assessment of community needs for eye care services. They are able to assist in the definition of factors that contribute to the treatment and prevention of visual system anomalies, to develop and apply quality assurance systems, to participate and provide leadership in health-related agencies, and to foster public awareness of the need for eye care. An individual qualified both in optometry and public health is expected to have the capability to develop, administer, and evaluate eye and vision health programs in research projects; design and conduct epidemiological field studies; use statistical methods in data analysis of case-control and cohort studies; develop and implement vision health education programs; and develop occupational health and eye safety programs. Students complete all credits for both degrees with one modification\u2014a total of 4 semester hours from the OD program also fulfill MPH requirements: OPT 691 (1 semester hour) and OPTC 879 (3 semester hours) fulfill the requirement for PBH 701 (2 semester hours) and PBH 890 (2 semester hours). A total of 212 semester hours are required for the dual degree. 383 May 17, 2021 MCPHS University-Worcester School of Physician Assistant Studies (Manchester/Worcester) Kristy PA-C, Associate Professor and Program Director Nicole Dettmann, DScPAS, MPH, PA-C, Associate Professor, Associate Program Director and Director of Clinical Education Craig Hricz, MPAS, PA-C, Associate Professor and Assistant Program Director Stephanie Maclary, RN, MHS, PA-C, Assistant Professor and Director of Didactic Education Laura Petriilo-Deluca, MPAS, PA-C, Assistant Professor and Director of Assessment John (Jack) Kelly, MD,Clinical Associate Professor and Medical Director Associate Professors Altongy-Magee, of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) (Accelerated) The MCPHS University Physician Assistant (PA) Studies program is dedicated to the education of clinically competent medical professionals who are prepared to deliver quality patient care in a dynamic healthcare delivery system.

The emphasis is on community-oriented primary care, and students acquire experience in the evaluation and treatment of a broad spectrum of medical problems though the program's clinical rotations. These experiential elements of the program provide training in emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, surgery, and women's health in addition to an elective specialty. Students applying to the program must submit a formal application and designate whether they are applying to the Manchester or Worcester campus. Students cannot apply to both campuses. The application must include official transcripts and an essay through the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) and must be received by March 1. CASPA, the centralized national application service of the Physician Assistant Education Association, may be contacted at www.caspaonline.org. About the Program In the spring of 2008, a two-year Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) program began on the Worcester campus. While based on the Worcester campus, the program is a satellite of the MCPHS-Manchester program with an identical curriculum\u2014both delivered with faculty on each campus via use of synchronized distance education. For both campuses, the first year is dedicated to didactic and laboratory learning and the second to supervised clinical practice experiences (clinical rotations) in a variety of patient-care settings. Students attend classes at their respective campus, with didactic courses simultaneously delivered at both campuses using technologically sophisticated interactive videoconferencing. This technology allows students at each site to interact with other students and faculty members in real time. Laboratory courses and small-group activities are facilitated by Physician Assistant Studies faculty located on each campus.

Douglas Simmons, PhD, OTR/L, FAOTA, Program Director Assistant Professor Olivia Freeman, MA, OTR/L, Academic Fieldwork Coordinator Sarah Chevrefils, MS, OTR/L, Assistant Academic Fieldwork Coordinator Assistant Professors Butler, Finch, Robertson Degree Program Master of Science in Occupational Therapy The Master of Science Occupational Therapy Program (MSOT) on the MCPHS Manchester campus prepares graduates with the advanced knowledge and skills for contemporary occupational therapy practice. The curriculum includes foundational arts and sciences, basic tenets and theoretical perspectives of occupational therapy, clinical sciences, service delivery and management, professional responsibilities and ethics, and scholarship competencies in the educational preparation of occupational therapists. The coursework is designed to reinforce and build on required elements that allow students to acquire, synthesize, analyze and apply knowledge and skills in a variety of clinical, community-based, research and management environments. The MSOT program builds on the knowledge acquired from an undergraduate arts or science education and has two components: didactic and fieldwork education. Through the didactic component, students gain knowledge and skills and develop professional behavior required for occupational therapy practice. Through fieldwork education students apply knowledge, skills, and professional behavior in clinical, school, and community-based settings both at MCPHS and off-campus. The fieldwork education accounts for about one half of the curriculum. The curriculum for the MSOT has a total of 84 semester hours with approximately 30 weeks of fieldwork education. The program consists of five areas of concentration: Basic Tenets of Occupational Therapy Theory and Practice (24 semester hours), Foundations of Occupational Practice (18 semester hours), Scholarship (12 semester hours), Management of Occupational Services (6 semester hours), and Fieldwork Education (24 semester hours). Admission Prerequisites Baccalaureate degree from an accredited postsecondary institution. Official transcripts from all colleges or universities attended. Minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 scale. Minimum prerequisite 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale. Three letters of recommendation Resume Personal Essay (Why You Selected Occupational Therapy As Your Profession) Official TOEFL (minimum of 213 computer-based or 79 iBT) or ELTS (minimum 6.5) scores for all applicants whose primary language is not English Official transcripts for international colleges or universities must be submitted to the Center for Educational Documentation (CED), Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc.

Essential Functions The practice of occupational therapy includes the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of people with physical disabilities, movement dysfunction, pain, and mental health disorders. Occupational therapists must be prepared to conduct in a timely manner a relevant patient examination, evaluate the results of this examination and synthesize these data to establish an accurate occupational diagnosis/profile, prognosis and plan of care, implement an intervention and use the process of re-examination to assess patient outcomes. Occupational therapists must also possess the skills necessary to determine when referral of the patient/client to another healthcare professional is appropriate. Occupational therapists must provide evidence that the care that they provide is effective, often through the conduct of clinically based research. Master of Science in Occupational Therapy students must be able to complete the following: Participation in all required aspects of classroom and laboratory activities; Participation in all required aspects of both level one and level two fieldwork experience activities; Effective communications with other students, instructors, assistive personnel, patients/clients, family members, payors, and other health care professions; Maintenance of a safe environment for other individuals and for one's self, including use of universal precautions; Completion of elements of patient/client management, including examination, evaluation of data, formulation of occupational diagnosis and prognosis, intervention, assessment of outcomes, and record keeping; Completion of specific patient/client interventions and treatments, including patient and family education, occupation-focused activities, application of modalities, therapeutic exercise, and functional skill training. Fieldwork agencies may have additional or agency-specific technical standards, which take precedence over MCPHS technical standards. The Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) accredits professional occupational therapy programs and requires that graduates of these programs be able to deliver entry-level generalist clinical services. Graduates of entry-level programs are required to possess a broad base of knowledge and skills requisite for the practice of occupational therapy. Occupational therapists require the intellectual-communication, behavioral-social, observational, and motor abilities to meet the standard of practice. Certain disabilities can interfere with a student's ability to complete the program of study and acquire the essential functions necessary for the practice of occupational therapy. Reasonable accommodation can be made to compensate for some limitations. However, those that interfere with patient/client care, safety or require the use of an intermediary may be incompatible with independent professional practice. Technical Standards for Occupational Therapy Intellectual and Communication Skills Intellectual skills include the ability to recall and comprehend large amounts of didactic information and to apply this information to the examination, evaluation, and management of intervention with patients/clients who have complex occupational performance problems. Effective communication skills enable the occupational therapist to elicit appropriate information from patients/clients and to effectively explain assessment and intervention processes and procedures. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include, but are not limited to, the ability to: 403 May 17, 2021 Communicate clearly and in a timely manner with patients/clients, families and care providers, physicians and other health professionals, community and professional groups, and colleagues; Document clearly, and in a timely manner in patient/client records, reports to physicians, insurance reports, and order forms; Respond to emergency situations; Participate in group meetings to deliver and receive information and to respond to questions from a variety of sources. Behavioral and Social Attributes Students must demonstrate the ability to practice in a professional and ethical manner and possess the emotional maturity to practice in a stressful work environment. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, cultural competence, and motivation are all personal attributes associated with the practice of occupational therapy. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: Recognize and respond appropriately to individuals of all ages, genders, ethnicities, socio-economic, religious, and cultural backgrounds; Cope with the stress of heavy workloads, demanding patients/clients, and life-threatening clinical situations; Recognize and respond appropriately to potentially hazardous situations. Observational Skills Observation is integral to effective occupational therapy practice. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: Observe and interpret patient/client participation in a wide variety of occupations applying a broad range of biopsychosocial knowledge and perspectives; Read and interpret patient/client records, specialized equipment, patient/client assessment data, professional literature, and notes from patients/clients, physicians, and other health professionals. Motor Skills The practice of occupational therapy requires that practitioners possess the ability to perform evaluative and therapeutic procedures, requiring specific physical skills and stamina. An occupational therapist must be able to use vision and somatic sensation in the evaluation and treatment of patients/clients. Some of the skills an individual must be able to demonstrate include but are not limited to the ability to: Lift, carry, and push patients (150 lbs.) in bed or wheelchairs, heavy equipment, and patients/clients transferring from one surface to another using proper body mechanics; Walk and balance well enough to help patients/clients walk and transfer with or without equipment, and prevent injury to patient/client and self; Exhibit sufficient manual dexterity to manipulate small equipment, provide support and resistance as needed during the performance of complex occupations, perform CPR, and treat acutely ill patients without disturbing sensitive monitoring instruments and lines; Provide for patient/client's safety and well-being in all intervention activities.

Students are expected to display professional behavior at all times including during fieldwork experiences. This includes displaying a professional demeanor in interactions and boundaries with patients/clients and their families, clinical/school/healthcare staff, peers, faculty and the public at all times in consideration of their representation of the profession of occupational therapy and MCPHS University. Academic Standards, Progression and Retention All credits in the degree must be obtained in the MCPHS program. The Master of Science in Occupational Therapy (MSOT) does not award credits for prior experiential learning and/or credits by examination. The academic progress of each student will be reviewed at the end of each academic semester. Progression in the MSOT program is dependent on the student's maintaining a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 and a semester GPA of 3.0 in all MSOT courses. To progress in the didactic phases of the program, students must achieve a final course grade of B- or better. To progress within the clinical phases of the program students must obtain a pass (P) score on Level I experiences and obtain a minimal score of 122 on the American Occupational Therapy Association Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapist for Level II Fieldwork experiences. In all MSOT courses, obtaining one course grade lower than a B- results in a student having to develop a remediation plan associated with OTH 685 Directed Study in Occupational Therapy. The student will take this remediation course in conjunction with other courses to remain in sequence. A student may only take OTH 685 once to remediate a grade below B-. If a student obtains another course grade below a B- this course(s) must be repeated, which stops progression in the program. The student is placed into a non-progression status as MSOT courses are offered only once per year. The student will be placed into a cohort that is targeted to graduate later than the students' original cohort. Students may be placed into a non-progression status once; a student who receives a second non-progression in a subsequent semester will be recommended for dismissal from the MSOT program. Students who receive a failing fieldwork grade on the American Occupational Therapy Association Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapists (below 122) or are requested to leave a fieldwork site prior to 405 May 17, 2021 completion will need to arrange with the AFWC to complete another fieldwork rotation at another site. The timing of this clinical rotation cannot be guaranteed to follow program sequence and may result in a later graduation date. Failure or dismissal from 2 fieldwork rotations will result in dismissal from the program. Level II fieldwork must be completed within 2 years of completion of all coursework that is prerequisite to fieldwork. If a student is unable to progress in the didactic portion or the fieldwork portion of the program, the student will be referred to the School of Occupational Therapy Academic Standing Committee with a recommendation for dismissal. Final appeals are to the Vice President of Academic Affairs/Provost. If there is a disruption in the sequence of the MSOT curriculum by a student for a period of one semester or more, or a student has a leave of absence, the student must validate previous knowledge and skills from previous didactic and fieldwork experiences to ensure that they are competent and safe in the delivery and application of patient care. (NOTE: There is no guarantee that fieldwork space for Level I and Level II fieldwork experience can be maintained, it could take a year or more for reentry due to lack of clinical placement availability.)

It is during this phase of training that students apply and improve their clinical and patient management skills. There are 9 required clinical rotations. Each rotation is 5 weeks in duration. In addition to clinical rotations, students participate in on-campus professional seminars during the clinical phase of training. The program has clinical affiliations with a variety of clinical sites in the North East and Mid-Atlantic regions. Additional national and international clinical sites are also available. Learning experiences occur in ambulatory and hospital-based settings and include rural, suburban and urban clinical sites. Students are encouraged to choose rural health facilities for a portion of their clinical experience. The breadth of clinical settings offers the future Physician Assistant the ability to acquire skills and competencies practices in a variety of settings. Rotations in the required curriculum may be scheduled at some distance from the campus. This is necessary to provide a range of diverse learning experiences and ensure availability and quality of clinical rotation sites. Students are responsible for providing their own housing and transportation to and from the clinical sites and campus. Housing and travel costs for the clinical year vary widely depending on the site and location. Physician Assistant students are not responsible for identifying or arranging their own clinical sites. However, the possibility exists for students to coordinate, with the program out-of-network clinical sites. To ensure quality educational training the sites must be approved by the Physician Assistant Studies Program and University and proper protocol must be followed to arrange for out- of-network clinical rotations. The School of Physician Assistant Studies reserves the right to make changes to all policies and procedures at any time. School of Physician Assistant Studies Policies and Professional Requirements (Manchester/Worcester) Students who are enrolled in the program must earn grades of C (2.0) or better in all courses and maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing in the program. Students are expected to understand and adhere to the codes and standards of the profession and to exhibit professional behavior. Students are required to be in good academic standing to enter the clinical year. Students who receive below a C in a didactic course will be required to repeat the course before progressing to the next semester. This will result in a delay of one year to complete the program. Students must receive a 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to enter the clinical year. Such repetitions will lengthen the program beyond two years (please see Program Completion Policy). Failure to achieve a cumulative 3.0 GPA at the end of the first semester of the didactic year results in being placed on probation. If the student does not demonstrate improvement by the end of the second semester of the didactic year, the student may be dismissed. If the student does not achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.0 by the end of the didactic year, the student will be dismissed. 412 May 17, 2021 MCPHS University-Manchester School of Pharmacy-Worcester/Manchester Anna Morin, PharmD, Professor and Dean of Pharmacy, Interim Chief Academic Officer - Worcester/Manchester Paul Belliveau, PharmD, Professor and Associate Dean Abir Kanaan, PharmD, Professor and Assistant Dean of Curriculum and New Programs Paula Evans, PharmD, Associate Professor and Director of Pharmacy Outreach Michael Steinberg, PharmD, Professor and Director of Assessment Karyn Sullivan, Professor and Director of Interprofessional Education Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Chase Smith, PhD, Professor and Chair Professors Acquaah-Mensah, Campbell, Cohen (Emeritus), Friel, Goldsmith, Kearney, Smith; Kaplita, Professors Mandela, Metcalf; Faculty Associates Graham, Pollano Department of Pharmacy Practice Sheila Seed, PharmD, Professor and Chair Cheryl Abel, PharmD, Professor and Vice-Chair Professors Abel, Belliveau, Cooper, Dunican, Kanaan, Lynch, Morin, Seed, Silva, Spooner, Steinberg, Sullivan, Willett; Associate Professors Aungst, Bartlett, Carey, LaMothe, Morrill, Pervanas, Towle, Professors Faculty Associate Massey Office of Experiential Education Paul DiFrancesco, EdD, MPA, RPh Associate Professor and Associate Dean of Experiential Education, Boston/Worcester/Manchester Kara Bonaceto, PharmD, Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Nicole Carace, PharmD, MS, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Gretchen Jehle, PharmD, Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Brianne Morin, PharmD, Assistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Experiential Education Coordinator Degree Program Doctor of Pharmacy (Accelerated) MCPHS-Manchester offers an accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree in conjunction with the School of Pharmacy-Worcester/Manchester. The core pharmacy curriculum is identical to that currently offered at the Worcester campus. Students attend classes in Manchester, while the instructors and other students are based in Worcester.
