If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e.

Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 54 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group co verage. i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. j.

An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 55 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1.

TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 51 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] IX. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) You or Your Covered Dependents may have insurance coverage under more than one Plan . If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e. Coverage arranged by or through any trustee, union, employer or association. f.

Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis. h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group co verage. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 52 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. j. Medical coverage under automobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law. Plan do es no t include any of the following: a. An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 53 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1. Release or obtain claim information from any Plan, individual or entity. 2. Pay Our covered benefits to any Plan or entity which has paid benefits that We should have paid. TIM14. 15.COB.

In 2015, Assurant Health will sell plans both inside and outside of the public health exchanges in this state. Coverage beyond age 65 will be secondary to Medicare. Premiums are on an attained age basis and will increase with age. Premiums also vary by plan design, tobacco status and geographic area. In 2015, only the oldest three dependents under age 21 will be charged a premium rate for a given policy. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 2 2. Proposed Rate Increase: The proposed average rate increase for this state is 24%. This increase excludes attained age increases. The rate increase does vary by plan. These adjustments are described in further detail in section 14 of this memorandum. Appendix A shows the development of base rates for this product. The remaining sections of the memorandum detail the assumptions we used to develop rates. Reasons for Rate Increase: The following list is a brief description of the significant factors driving the proposed rate change. More detailed descriptions of these factors are included later in this memorandum. 1.) Medical Trend: Our medical trend accounts for the effects on future claims due to inflation, advancing medical technology and techniques, and increased utilization and cost shifting. 2.) Additional Fees: The health insurer fee assessment is moving from $8 billion to $11.3 billion in 2015 which results in a lower target loss ratio. In addition to this, we are going on the public exchange in this state in 2015 and have added the 3.5% exchange user fee into our price. 3.) Average Morbidity: There will continue to be changes in the projected risk pool due mainly to, but not limited to, the following factors: a.) Continued group and Medicaid migration b.) Continued uninsured migration c.) Current IM consumers forgoing coverage d.) Allowance of the extension of noncompliant nongrandfathered plans (\"grand mothered plans\") e.) State high risk pool termination 4.) Paid to Allowed Ratio: The difference between our projected paid to allowed ratio in our experience versus that of the 2014 actuarial value calculator results in an increase to our price. 5.) Reinsurance: The initial ACA reinsurance program for 2014 was to reimburse carriers 80% of claim costs between $60,000 and $250,000. In 2015, the reimbursement will change to 50% of claim costs between $70,000 and $250,000. However, per recent guidance, HHS has suggested that the parameter is going to be lowered again in 2015 from $70,000 to $45,000, which we have taken into account. The rate increases vary by product primarily due to benefit leveraging differences by metal level and differences in PPO network factors. These adjustments are warranted as they result in actuarially appropriate rates that reflect the true cost differences between the plans. Please note that our rating methodology differs from that outlined in the Unified Rate Review Template. Rather, the Unified Rate Review Template represents information required by Federal Regulation to facilitate review. The following sections note any differences between the Unified Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 3 Rate Review Template and the pricing methodology we used to develop rates. Please refer to Appendix A for our rate development methodology. 3. Experience Period Premium and Claims We prepared the Unified Rate Review Template using state and legal entity specific non grandfathered experience in order to comply with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requirements. For the purpose of estimating the average risk of the 2015 market, grandfathered and nongrandfathered experience of Time Insurance Company and John Alden Life Insurance Company was reviewed together. This combined experience was used in order to develop an actuarially appropriate prediction of the market wide per member per month risk and standardized claim cost in 2015. The same experience basis is used for both the pricing methodology and the development of factors that will address the impact of our risk relative to the market and the impact this has on premium rates. This process is described in more detail below. Experience Period: The experience period is claims incurred and premium earned from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. Paid Through Date: The date through which payments have been made on claims incurred during the experience period is February 28, 2014. Premiums (Net of MLR Rebate) in Experience Period: In the Unified Rate Review Template, the earned premium prior to Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) rebates for the Calendar Year 2013 experience period was $12,850,215. Earned premium was not adjusted for any reductions prescribed when calculating the MLR, such as taxes and assessments. The MLR rebates for the experience period are estimated at $0. The financial actuarial team at Assurant Health estimates accrued premium refunds required under Federal Minimum Loss Ratio regulations for the Individual Medical and Group Medical insurance business. The team projects incurred claims, earned premiums, and other elements and applies adjustments as outlined in Federal laws and regulations. These projections are performed on a state and market level basis and recent claims experience is adjusted for estimated claims reserves on a state level basis. Allowed and Incurred Claims During the Experience Period: In the Unified Rate Review Template, the amount of incurred claims processed through our claim system for the experience period 2013 is $8,701,453. The best estimate of experience period claims incurred but not reported is $350,236. The amount of allowed claims processed through our claim system for the experience period 2013 is $14,871,903. The best estimate of experience period allowed claims incurred but not paid as of the paid through date shown above is $6,170,449. Allowed claims are developed by subtracting ineligible charges and discounts from the total provider billed amount. Assurant Health has no capitation agreements. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 4 The per member per month experience period allowed claims in our pricing methodology is based upon all Individual Medical experience within the state for Assurant Health. The methodology is demonstrated in Appendix A. Experience for limited benefit plans was not included. Furthermore, an adjustment was made in order to pool large claims across our block. Claims in excess of $50,000 for a specific member and incurred month were removed from the experience, and then a nationwide average pooling charge was applied per member. All pricing components, including the base experience period data, are applied consistently across the single risk pool in the state and market for 2015. Our financial actuarial team develops lag triangles for nationwide Individual Medical experience. These triangles are separately developed for Medical and Prescription Drug Card coverage. Specific large claims that are part of our case management program are removed from the Medical triangles and reserved for separately. Historical averages are used in order to calculate monthly completion factors for the remaining claims. 4. Benefit Categories Inpatient services are those received during a patient's hospital stay and are included in the Inpatient Hospital Category. Outpatient services (e.g. lab tests, Xrays, and some surgical services) are those rendered by a facility within an outpatient setting. Professional services include primary care, specialist, therapy and other professional charges that are not included in facility fees. Other Medical services include charges for items that do not fall into the categories above, such as ambulance and durable medical equipment. The Other category is measured based upon distinct services or items provided. Retail and mail order pharmacy claims are included in the Prescription Drug category. 5. Projection Factors Changes in the Morbidity of the Insured Population: There are two adjustments that we are using to get to an estimate of the 2015 market risk. The first is an adjustment to get Assurant specific prereform risk to the market average. The second is to get the average prereform market risk to the expected 2015 average market risk. Both are explained in further detail below. Assurant Health to Market Average: To establish this estimate, Assurant Health participated in the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Simulation Project (WNRASP). In this project the Wakely Consulting Group quantified risk using the HCCHHS model that Health and Human Services (HHS) developed for implementation in 2014. Wakely conducted risk simulations in individual and small group markets only when 75%+ of the state wide membership was represented. Health plans covering these members used claim experience to determine plan liability risk scores consistent with the HCCHHS methodology. Health plan specific liability risk scores along with allowable rating factors are compared to the scores of all market participants consistent with the methodology set forth in the Risk Adjustment Program. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 5 The WNRASP results provided to Assurant Health quantify the difference in the risk of the Assurant Health book of business relative to the state and market average risk. The estimate of the market risk was adjusted to approximate a risk score when the market includes both grandfathered and nongrandfathered experience. Since we use both grandfathered and non grandfathered experience we feel it is appropriate that the market is on this same basis. In 2012 the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Simulation Project (WNRASP) used both grandfathered and nongrandfathered data while in 2013 only nongrandfathered data was used. To calculate an adjustment to account for including grandfathered experience we used the 2013 market to 2012 market risk score. The final state result is adjusted to the extent that base period data was less than 100% credible, in order to be on a consistent basis with the index rate for the state. The final result for use in our pricing methodology was a 0.85 risk score. This indicates that Assurant Health business practices (e.g. distribution methods and underwriting) and member selection patterns have created a book of experience with 15% lower costs. Our pricing was adjusted by a factor of 1.0/0.85 to represent the average actuarial risk, as shown in Appendix A. This multiplicative adjustment is consistently applied across all plans within the state. Prereform Market to Post Reform Market: The ACA incentivizes various subpopulations of Indiana to migrate into or out of the ACA IM market, altering the average risk of the insured population. Key drivers of this migration include, but are not limited to: 1.) The dissolution of the Indiana highrisk pool, which will incentivize the highrisk pool members to enter the ACA IM market 2.) The availability of subsidies, which will incentivize lower risk, formerly uninsured persons to enter the ACA IM market 3.) The guaranteed issue environment, which will incentivize members of the uninsured population with preexisting conditions to enter the ACA IM market 4.) Employees losing group coverage, which in general will result in an increase in morbidity as the group market is less healthy than the prereform IM market 5.) The allowance of the extension of noncompliant, nongrandfathered plans past 2014, which keeps healthier lower risk members out of the market and increases the average morbidity Our final estimate is that the morbidity of the 2015 insured population in Indiana will increase by 48% over the morbidity of the preACA insured population. A number of sources were used to calculate this morbidity factor. Figures published by the Department of Health & Human Services in \"Summary Enrollment Report for the Initial Annual Open Enrollment Period\" were accepted as the definitive count of exchange applications through the end of March. We used data provided by the Wakely Consulting Group in connection with their National Risk Adjustment Reporting Project (NRAP) to determine offexchange enrollment through the end of March, the volume of earlyadopters both on and off exchange, and the number of insured on noncompliant plans scheduled to roll to a compliant plan by the end of 2014. Morbidity data Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 6 furnished by the Society of Actuaries in their \"Cost of the Future Newly Insured under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\" was used to compare the morbidity of the migrating population to the morbidity of the preACA insured population. Other industry studies were used to validate the reasonableness of our results. In addition to the expected change in the average risk of the insured population, we anticipate that there will be an increase in utilization relative to our experience period due to the pent up demand as newly insured enrollees continue to sign up for coverage. When consumers are uninsured or underinsured, they may opt to delay healthcare services. Historically, approximately 30% of our sales have been to customers who did not previously have health insurance. These previously uninsured customers have claim experience that is significantly worse than those with prior coverage. This experience discrepancy is most pronounced in the first 6 months of coverage, when the experience relativity between these two cohorts is up to 20% higher than the ultimate relativity. We expect that the mandate to purchase insurance may temper the pent up demand of the newly insured entering the market in 2015. Therefore, the 2015 utilization on newly insured individuals will not have as large of a spike as our historical experience. Our assumption is that an additional 10% of our block will be newly insured individuals, with 10% higher than typical utilization in the first 6 months of coverage. This leads to an adjustment of 0.5% within our pricing and claim projection. We are planning to go on the exchange in this state in 2015. Therefore, we will be selling silver cost sharing reduction (CSR) plans that will have lower benefits than the standard silver plan. As a result of this, we are adding an additional 1.5% for increased utilization to the assumption above. This adjustment was determined using the 12% CSR plan utilization factor used in the risk adjustment model, weighted by the expected percent of cost sharing subsidy business. Please see section 19 below for more details on the CSR plan assumptions. Changes in Benefits: There is an adjustment of 7.0% within our pricing and claim projection to include new and expanded benefits in accordance with the EHB requirements of the ACA. The table below lists the estimated additional cost associated with each new benefit. The Pediatric Dental expense was estimated using commercial group experience for 2011 and 2012 from our sister segment, Assurant Employee Benefits. The remaining estimates are based upon purchased data of experience of a standard population. Benefit Estimated Additional Cost Maternity 3.1% Mental Health and Substance Abuse 1.2% Pediatric Vision 0.4% Chiropractic 0.4% Private Duty Nursing 0.3% Pediatric Dental 1.6% GRAND TOTAL 7.0% Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 7 We also made an adjustment to account for the coverage of additional preventative items that will be paid first dollar due to updates by the USPSTF. We believe the impact of covering these additional first dollar benefits is 1.0%. This estimate was determined by evaluating the volume of these items in our historical experience. The additional first dollar preventative benefits are: 1.) Alcohol Misuse 2.) Breast Cancer Risk 3.) Hepatitis C Screening 4.) HIV Screening 5.) Tobacco Use Prevention in Children and Adolescents In addition, it is expected that the average actuarial value of our block will increase from approximately 60% to approximately 71.6% after the change to standardized Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum metallic plans. Furthermore, approximately 30% of business within our experience data is on a plan that has an actuarial value of 55% or less. We expect that richer benefits in 2015 will induce demand for healthcare services that is higher than the average utilization within our base experience. We assume that future Silver plans will have utilization that is 3% higher than our average current experience, Gold will be 8% higher, and Platinum will be 15% higher. Also, our early experience is suggesting that the utilization on the Platinum 1 is higher than 15%, so we are adding an additional 10% factor for this plan. See section 18 below for more details on this. Based upon our expected 2015 split of plans by metal level, we have adjusted our experience period claims by 4.3% in order to account for this benefit level driven increase in utilization. The projected 2015 membership was used to determine both the average actuarial value and utilization impact. The membership methodology is described in more detail below. Other Adjustments: We made an adjustment of 9.4% within our pricing and claim projection in order to account for expected improvements in Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) discounts in 2015 relative to the 2013 experience period. Our expected PPO discounts are developed by using a combination of experience and reported data from the networks that we lease. The future improvement is driven by a larger share of business expected in the Aetna Signature Administrators (ASA) network in 2015 relative to 2013. This network arrangement is more favorable for Assurant Health than other leased networks. Furthermore, our rental networks work to renegotiate and improve their contracts with providers over time which also contributes towards the improvement in discounts. The ASA network was first launched in Indiana in October 2012. Since we are going on the exchange in this state, we have made a 1% adjustment to the ASA PPO factors to account for uncertainty with regards to the discounts and utilization of the Essential Community Providers (ECP's) that are not in our historical experience. Trend Factors (cost/utilization): The effects on future claims of inflation, advancing medical technology and techniques, and increased utilization and cost shifting are accounted for by an annual secular trend assumption of 9.5%. This is an allowed claims trend factor. This trend was Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 8 developed from historical experience of our nationwide block. Our historical experience shows slightly higher trend but we are lowering it to 9.5% as we anticipate trend will be lower than our historical experience due to a more standard risk population going forward. Please see Appendix B for further detail. Experience was trended for 24 months, from the midpoint of 2013 to the midpoint of 2015. 6. Credibility Manual Rate Development The manual rate reflects the Assurant Health Individual Medical 2013 nationwide allowed claims per member per month (pmpm). This allowed pmpm value has been adjusted to address the following needs: 1. Adjust the nationwide claims to reflect the Assurant Health distribution by age and tobacco use in Indiana. 2. Remove the impact of claims experience from Indiana (to avoid double counting this experience in the rate development). 3. Adjust to reflect the specific utilization and charge level patterns of Indiana. External data, in conjunction with claims experience from 2012, is used to determine the Indiana to nationwide expected cost relativity. In order to determine this relativity for 2012, regression analysis is used holding age, gender, and smoking status constant. If 2012 experience in Indiana is not fully credible, the state relative cost factor is blended with a state relative cost factor developed using Truven Analytics MarketScan\u00ae 2011 database. Controlling for age and gender, regression analysis on the Truven database produced the state to nationwide allowed cost relativity. The 2011 and Truven blended relativity factor is referred to as the manual state factor. A regression based on nationwide 2013 allowed claims experience was used to smooth allowed claim levels by age, gender, and smoking status. From this regression, predicted allowed claims were calculated at each age and smoking status combination. These allowed pmpm claim levels are applied to the Indiana distribution of membership by age, gender, and smoking status and summed. In addition, an adjustment is applied to remove the influence Indiana claims have on the nationwide average claims. The manual state factor is multiplied by adjusted 2013 national claim levels as described in the previous paragraph to calculate the manual pmpm allowed claims in the state. The manual rate is blended with the base period rate as described in the credibility section below. The manual rate was adjusted to the 2015 pricing period using the projection factors listed in the section above. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 9 7. Credibility of Experience To develop our full credibility standard, we conducted a study to establish confidence levels at different cohort sizes. In this study, we randomly sampled cohorts from our internal block of members. We analyzed 100,000 randomly sampled cohorts at each size to establish the variance associated with a cohort of that size. The required cohort size to be considered fully credible was set at the point where we were 95% confident that claims would fall within 4% of our target. This results in a fully credible standard of 82,000 member months for experience that has had claims in excess of $50,000 per member per month level pooled across the block, as used within our pricing methodology. The Unified Rate Review Template utilizes unpooled claims. Therefore, based upon the same 95% confidence, the standard for full credibility on the Unified Rate Template is 562,000 member months. Partial credibility is assigned to the experience period data based upon the classical credibility formula listed below: Square Root ( (Experience Data Member Months) / (Full Credibility Standard) ) Based upon the above credibility methodology, our Indiana pooled experience as used within pricing is 100% credible. The unpooled base experience as used in the Unified Rate Review Template is 37% credible. The state specific experience was removed from the development of the manual rate in order to avoid any double counting of the base period experience. 8. Paid to Allowed Ratio Our projected Paid to Allowed Ratio is 71.6%. In our 2014 pricing development, the Actuarial Value (AV) calculator provided by HHS produced values that were very close to our historical paid to allowed ratios on an aggregate basis. Therefore, we determined it was reasonable to use the HHS AV calculator to develop estimates of the paid to allowed ratio of our 2014 insured population. However, our 2013 paid to allowed ratio was slightly higher than the value produced AV calculator, which is reasonable given that underlying data in the AV calculator was not updated from the prior year. Therefore, we are accounting for this difference by including a benefit leveraging factor in the pricing values of our plans. This factor will vary by metal level due to the differing leveraging effects by cost sharing level. Bronze plans will have a higher leveraging effect due to higher cost sharing and conversely, Platinum plans will have a lower leveraging effect due to lower cost sharing. To determine the leveraging factors, we used a claim probability distribution from the 2012 Milliman Health Cost Guidelines to model the leveraging effect on our metal plans. The final assumptions are as follows: Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 10 Metal Level Leveraging Catastrophic 1.035 Bronze 1.035 Silver 1.030 Gold 1.015 Platinum 1.010 The approximate average leveraging using the factors above is 3%, which is lower than our historical benefit leveraging of 4%. We believe this decrease is appropriate given the large proportion of our historical book that had AV's less than 55%. To develop the projected Paid to Allowed Ratio, we used our membership projection to determine the distribution of plans by metal level in 2015. We then applied the leveraging factors by metal level to the actuarial value's and averaged them to get a total projected paid to allowed ratio. The methodology of our membership projection is described in more detail below. 9. Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Risk Adjustment: In 2014, the ACA established a Risk Adjustment Program that will allow issuers to set premiums according to the average actuarial risk in the individual and small group market without respect to the type of risk selection the issuer would otherwise expect. The ACA establishes a standard quantification of risk with the HCCHHS risk scoring model. Until we gain further knowledge on the total Indiana market risk, we are continuing to price to the market average risk of 1.0. Therefore, no market wide adjustment for the risk adjustment program was applied when determining the market adjusted index rate. Reinsurance Recoveries: In 2015, the ACA has a Reinsurance Program that will reimburse carriers 50% of claim costs between $70,000 and $250,000 per member. However, per recent guidance, HHS has suggested that the parameter is going to be lowered again in 2015 from $70,000 to $45,000. We have made a negative 11.0% adjustment to our expected claim costs within our pricing in order to account for expected reinsurance recoveries. This projected reinsurance adjustment is applied to the index rate to develop the market adjusted index rate in accordance with Part III instructions. Our reinsurance recovery assumption was developed using Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases, which is representative of a standard population and with coverage similar to the ACA EHB package. The exposure and claim data was limited to members that had complete data and were on a noncapitated basis. In addition, the claim data for each member was trended to 2015 and a utilization adjustment was made to scale claims to the appropriate cost sharing level. The reinsurance formula was applied by member, and the result was divided by total paid claims on the same adjusted basis. This process was done to estimate a reinsurance recovery factor for each plan metal level. The final composite factor above was developed based upon our expected mix of Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum business. The reinsurance recovery estimated in 2014 was 14% for Indiana. Therefore, Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 11 this results in an estimated rate impact of 3.5% over the prior year. Reinsurance Contributions: The Reinsurance Program is funded by a fee of $3.67 per member per month. We have increased our expected claim costs within our pricing development by 0.9% in order to cover this fee. In order to maintain compliance with the required relativity of prices by age, we have applied the adjustment on a multiplicative basis. Our adjustment factor was developed by dividing $3.67 by the expected total per member per month claim costs in the state. 10. NonBenefit Expenses and Profit & Risk The table below lists the expected NonBenefit Expenses and Target Profit for Assurant Health in Indiana. The pricing load to cover these expenses is applied consistently across products and plans, as displayed in the workup of the plan adjusted index rate. These items are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Expense Category % of Premium General and Administrative 12.0% Commissions and Sales Bonus 5.0% Managed Care and Cost Containment 2.5% Quality Improvement 0.9% Net Investment Income 2.5% Taxes, Fees and State Assessments 2.2% ACA Health Insurer Fee 1.7% Federal Income Taxes 3.0% Profit and Risk Margin (After Tax) 3.0% Total 27.8% Total Used in Pricing 26.5% Our priced for loss ratio is 73.5% in Indiana, which is approximately an 80% Medical Loss Ratio as defined by the ACA. The calculation of the Medical Loss Ratio is shown in the Projected Loss Ratio section. The final priced for Total NonBenefit Expenses and Profit is 26.5%. However, as demonstrated in the table above, our projected 2015 total nonbenefit expenses and profit are 27.8%. This will result in an actual margin for risk and profit that is lower than the target shown above. In addition, please note that expenses for each functional area within the company are recorded at a nationwide level. Expense assumptions for a state and product are allocated and represented on a percent of premium basis. This percent of premium representation of expenses is consistent with our actual to expected loss ratio pricing methodology. Administrative Expense Loads: General and Administrative Expenses: This category accounts for Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 12 the expenses of administering the business, such as claim payment expenses. The assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue. In developing this expense assumption, underwriting expenses were adjusted due to the reduction of staff within the underwriting functional area that occurred in response to the 2014 market rules. Commissions and Sales Bonus: This is a variable expense that represents the cost of acquiring business. Our commission schedules and bonus campaigns will be set to 5.0% of premium. Managed Care and Cost Containment Expenses: This is a variable expense that accounts for expenses incurred in order to reduce claims costs, such as access fees paid to the Preferred Provider Organization Networks that are leased on behalf of our customers. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue. Quality Improvement Expenses: This category accounts for expenses incurred in order to improve the quality of healthcare. Quality Improvement Expenses are added to claim payments in the Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue and adjusted to account for additional QI expenses expected in 2015. Net Investment Income: This category accounts for investment income earned on reserves and surplus. This assumption was derived from our actual current net investment income ratio. Profit & Risk Margin: Our targeted after tax margin for risk and profit is 3% of premium. The pricing load for this 3% after tax margin is applied consistently across products. Taxes and Fees: Health Insurer Fee: $8 billion will be collected nationally for this fee in 2014 and $11.3 billion in 2015. The fee is based on our share of the total market premium. It is estimated that this fee will be 1.7% of premium. Furthermore, this fee is not deductible from federal income taxes. State Premium Taxes and Assessments: This is estimated at approximately 2.2% of premium based upon 2013 experience. An adjustment was made to historical experience in order to reduce any Comprehensive Health Association assessments. In addition, an adjustment of approximately 0.05% has also been made to account for the $2 per member per year PCORI fee. The minimal impact of the $0.08 per member per month Risk Adjustment Program administration fee has been removed from this section and is included in the projected risk adjustment per the Part III Actuarial Memo and Certification Instructions. Income Taxes: Federal Income Taxes are expected to be 3% of premium, calculated as ((6% + 1.7%) X 40%), where 6% is the pretax profit margin, 1.7% is the nondeductible ACA health insurer fee cost and 40% is an approximation of the federal income tax rate for Assurant Health. Please note that our effective federal income tax rate is expected to be greater than the standard 35% due to the nondeductibility of certain internal and external individual compensation. This nondeductible compensation is primarily incurred within nonhealth insurance lines of business from our parent company, Assurant, Inc. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 13 Exchange User Fees: Assurant will issue business both on and off the exchange in this state in 2015. To determine the exchange fee, we calculated the percentage of our 2015 projected membership that is expected to come from the exchange and multiplied it by the 3.5% user fee. The resulting market average user fee in this state is 1.7%. In accordance with the Part III instructions, this fee is applied to the index rate to calculate the market adjusted index rate. For template purposes, it is included in the Taxes and Fees. For further detail on our exchange membership projection methodology, please see the membership projection section below. 11. Projected Loss Ratio The projected future loss ratio for the period of 1/1/2015 through 12/31/2015 is 73.5%. Our premium rate was developed by dividing projected incurred claims by the priced for loss ratio. Our priced for loss ratio is 73.5% in Indiana, which is approximately an 80% Medical Loss Ratio as defined by the Affordable Care Act. A calculation of the projected Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) is shown below: MLR = (Claims + Quality Improvement Expense) / (Premium - Taxes and Fees) = ( A + B + C) / (D - E - F - G) = (73.5% + 0.9% 80% Where: A is Incurred Claims, net of Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment Transfers B is Expenses for Improvement in the Quality of Healthcare C is an adjustment due to the state level aggregation of the MLR calculation D is premium E is state premium taxes and other assessments and fees F is the Health Insurer Fee G is Federal Income Taxes (excluding taxes on profit due to Investment Income) The 1% adjustment due to the state level aggregation of the MLR calculation, which is labeled C above, is included because of the inherent statistical fluctuation expected in state level loss ratios. State level MLRs will vary from 80%, even if our total nationwide MLR comes in exactly as priced for at 80%. Therefore, pricing to an 80% MLR will lead to a necessity to pay rebates in certain states. This will result in a post rebate loss ratio above 80% on a nationwide basis. A hypothetical example is illustrated below.

Single Risk Pool and Index Rate The single risk pool reflects all covered lives for every nongrandfathered product/plan combination for this state and market. The Index Rate is the estimated total allowed claims per member per month for all non grandfathered plans for all essential health benefits within the state. This figure does not include adjustments for Reinsurance, Risk Adjustment transfers, or exchange user fees. There are no material covered benefits in excess of the Essential Health Benefits. Please see Appendix A for detail on the projected 2015 Index Rate calculation. Also, please see the Market Adjusted Index Rate and Plan Adjusted Index Rate Explanation Sections below for details on how rates are calculated relative to the Index Rate. The experience used to develop the projected index rate includes the experience of transitional plans. 13. Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable marketwide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). These adjustments include: Federal reinsurance program Risk adjustment Exchange user fee Please see section 9 of this memo for a description of the reinsurance and risk adjustment. Please see section 10 of this memo for a description of the exchange user fee adjustment. The calculation of the Market Adjusted Index Rate can be found in Appendix A. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 15 14. Plan Adjusted Index Rate The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the Market Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). These adjustments are described below. The calculation of the Plan Adjusted Index Rate can be found in the attached rate exhibits. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing: o Actuarial Value - Please see section 17 of this memo for a description on how the actuarial values were calculated. o Paid to Allowed Leveraging Factor - Please see section 8 of this memo for a description on how the paid to allowed leveraging factor was calculated. o Utilization - We expect that richer benefits in 2015 will induce utilization for healthcare services that is higher than the average utilization within our base experience. We assume that future Silver plans will have utilization that is 3% higher than our average current experience, Gold will be 8% higher, and Platinum will be 15% higher. These factors are the prescribed HHS induced utilization factors used in the HHS risk adjustment calculations. The Platinum 1 plan will also have an additional 10% factor applied, which is explained in further detail in Section 18 below. o Dependent Factor - The dependent factor was developed to spread the cost of covering 4 or more dependents under 21. This factor is constant across all plans. o Nontobacco User Adjustment - The nontobacco user factor is used to put the market adjusted index rate on a nontobacco basis. This factor is consistent across all plans. The tobacco calibration factor is the reciprocal of the following calculation: (Non tobacco Member Months + Tobacco Member Months * Tobacco Load) Total Member Months Provider Network - PPO factors were developed using internal company discount experience in conjunction with reported discounts from the network. The factors reflect the difference from the average discount in the state. Catastrophic Plan Adjustment For the catastrophic plan, we continue to assume the population will almost entirely consist of consumers under age 30, thus, the younger consumers on this plan will not need to subsidize older consumers. Therefore, to develop our Catastrophic Plan adjustment factor, we have estimated and removed the impact to the 1830 year old price that was specifically due to the change from our current age slope to the new state specified 3:1 age slope. We believe that the hardship exemption will have little to no effect on the catastrophic population so we have not made an adjustment for it. Administrative Costs - The administrative cost factor is the reciprocal of our projected loss ratio. Please see section 11 for a description on how our projected loss ratio was Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 16 calculated. The administrative cost factor is constant across all plans. 15. Calibration a. Age Curve Calibration The age curve calibration is used to adjust Plan Adjusted Index Rate to our projected age. The age curve calibration is calculated as: 2015 Projected Age Curve Factor 2013 Average Age Curve Factor The 2015 projected age curve factor is calculated with the state projected average age of 36. The 2013 average age curve factor is the standard age curve weighted by the 2013 membership distribution in the state. The age curve calibration is applied uniformly to all plans and is demonstrated in Appendix A. The risk pool weighted average age was determined using the membership projection, which is described in further detail below. b. Geographic Factor Calibration The rating area factors used in our 2014 pricing were used in the development of factors for 2015, with the exception of a 5% adjustment to the area factor in rating area 1. To calibrate, we first used 2013 membership and balanced the overall state area factor to a 1.0 to get the area factors on the basis of our 2013 pricing experience period. Secondly, we used the projected 2015 membership by rating area and reweighted the area factors again to determine the projected state average. The resulting state average factor in this state was 0.998. This market wide calibration factor is then applied after the determination of the plan adjusted index rates and the individual area factors are divided by it to calibrate the market average back to a 1.0. The table below shows the resulting weighted average geographic factor of 1.000 for the state along with relativity factors for each rating area within the state and their corresponding projected member distributions. Rating Area 2015 IM Member Distribution2015 Weighted IM Area Factors 1 21.0% 1.04 2 6.7% 0.92 3 2.0% 5 3.1% Memorandum - - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN 17 7 5.6% 1.07 8 Total 100% 1.00 16. Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final premium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual or family. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve and geography then applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. These rating factors are described below. The rating factors can be found in the attached rate exhibit file. Area Factors - Area factors were developed using internal company prediscounted allowed claim experience. In areas that were less than 100% credible, internal experience was supplemented with consultant data. The Area factor is constant across all plans and is balanced to equal 1.0 in total for the state, as described above. Age Factors - The age curve used to set the age factors is the standard age curve set by HHS. The age factors are set relative to the projected average age used in the age curve calibration above. Tobacco Status A regression based on nationwide 2012 and 2013 experience was used to calculate a composite smoker factor of 1.20. The nontobacco user factor is 1.0. 17. AV Metal Values The HHS Actuarial Value Calculator (AVC) was used to generate the AV values and metal values for the majority of the plans in our portfolio. There are a select number of Assurant Health plans that use an acceptable alternative methodology to generate AVs. The methodology used to develop these plans' AVs is detailed below. Please note that these are the same adjustments that were used in our prior filing, which we feel is appropriate given that the AVC has not been updated. 1. Specialty HighCost Drugs Applicable Plans: Bronze 4, Bronze 5 Specialty Drugs for Assurant Health plans with a separate Rx deductible/coinsurance will go Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 18 towards the medical deductible/coinsurance. The HHS AVC does not allow for the user to specify that specialty drugs should go to the medical deductible and coinsurance when inputting a plan design with a separate drug deductible. The following is a table detailing the average cost and scripts from the Bronze Rx continuance table in the HHS AVC: Rx Category Avg Cost per EEAvg Scripts% Since the frequency of specialty highcost drugs is very low compared to the other drug categories, I am certifying that the impact of the specialty highcost drugs being subject to medical deductible/coinsurance instead of drug deductible/coinsurance will be insignificant to the AV. 2. Rx Brand Deductible Accumulation Applicable Plans: Bronze 4, Bronze 5 Based on the documentation in the HHS AVC, services that have both deductibles and copays will be valued as though the copay is paid first, with the remainder going towards the deductible. However, for our plans with a separate drug deductible, the copays will only apply after the deductible is reached. To account for this, we have determined the equivalent coinsurance rate for the brand drugs and used that in place of the brand copays. Plan Brand Copay (pref/non pref) AV w/ 62.1% 61%/61% Bronze 5 $50/$75 62.8% 61%/61% 3. Office Visit Limits Applicable Plans: Bronze 2, Silver 2, Silver 2 CSR plans, Silver 4 Office visit copay limits for Assurant Health plans will apply to primary care and specialty care office visits in total. The HHS calculator only allows for the user to apply copay limits to primary care visits. The average frequencies for office visits from the bronze and silver copay limits are detailed below: Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 19 Avg Frequency PCPAvg Frequency SP Total PCP % of Total Bronze Combined Table 1.36 0.90 2.26 60% Silver Combined Table 1.57 0.94 2.51 63% Assumed PCP % of Total 60% Using the assumption that 60% of office visits are primary care, the table below details the number of visits that would be primary care vs. specialty for a 4 total visit limit and a 10 total visit limit. Visit Limit PCP % PCP Visits SP Visits 4 60% 2 2 10 60% 6 4 Therefore, for a plan with a 4 copay limit, a 2 copay limit was inputted for primary care, and likewise for a 10 visit limit, a 6 copay limit was inputted. The value calculated below for the Bronze 2 plan was subtracted from the HHS AV to account for the visit limits on specialty care. For the silver plans, moving from an unlimited PCP copay to a 4 copay limit has a negligible effect on the AV. Therefore, I am certifying that the AV impact of a specialist copay limit on the Silver 2 and Silver 4 plans will be insignificant. Bronze 2 AV No Copay (a) 59.0% AV Unlimited $35 PCP $35 Copay (c) 60.2% Impact of No copay to unlimited (d = ba) 2.3% Impact of No copay to X visit limit (e = ca) 1.2% Net Impact (f = (de)/d) 48% AV Unlimited $35 SP Copay (g) 60.5% Est.

In order to evaluate the actuarial value of this benefit, a new continuance table had to be created since the HHS AVC cannot calculate the impact of first dollar benefits. The claim cost basis was selected as the actuarial continuance tables of the HHS AVC. The continuance tables of the HHS actuarial tables are comprised of claim costs segregated by service category, plus an allowance for additional claim costs expected from high risk pools. Continuance tables were built to remove the additional cost of the high risk tables. The value added to the tables was a set dollar amount, without allocation to the separate service category claim costs. Two aggregate tables were built, one reflecting all service categories and the second reflecting all service categories without Lab and XRay, both of these tables excluding the high risk pool additional costs. Expected claim costs were developed for each metal level at a deductible level that generates the prescribed metal actuarial value, with an integrated medical and drug deductible. A continuance table of Lab and XRay benefits was built from data from Milliman. The table was adjusted so that total claim costs of Lab and Xray benefits were equal to the amount of claims for Lab and XRays under each metal benefit level. The continuance table was split into professional and technical by the use of a level proportion across all average claim levels. The continuance table was utilized to derive a $500 first dollar coverage benefit. Remaining claims were then applied to the base plan deductible. Each metal plan continuance table was relied on to derive this value. Below are the calculations of the $500 first dollar lab and Xray benefit resulting from the process described above: Silver 3 Silver 4 Claim Cost of Plan at Metal Level (a) $3,136 $2,889 includes all medical and pharmacy benefits Claim Cost of Plan at Metal Level (b) $2,854 $2,617 no benefits for Lab and XRay Value of Lab and XRay (c) $164 $164 first dollar benefits, up to $500 Additional Value of Lab and XRay, applied against deductible (d) $166 $154 includes an estimate of impact of deductible New Estimate of Medical Claim Cost e = (b+c+d) $3,183 $2,935 Rider Addon Cost - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 21 5. One Deductible Plans Affected plans: 1Ded Bronze 1, 1Ded Bronze 2 The One Deductible product design consists of a single family deductible for plans with more than 1 member. The scope of this product design is outside those allowed by the HHS AVC. A HHS continuance table was adjusted that replicated results of the Bronze level AV's from the HHS AVC, using an integrated deductible. This Bronzelike continuance table was conjugated with itself to represent the expected claims of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 members under a unified family deductible. Expected memberlevel AV's are then developed from an inputted plan design, for each of seven different continuance tables. An aggregate plan level Actuarial Value is developed from a business weighting by family size. The following table shows the calculation of the aggregate. Number of Members Mix of Business 1Ded Bronze 1 AV's for Assurant Health is included in Appendix C. Screenshots of the AV calculations can be found in Appendix D. 18. AV Pricing Values The AV pricing values include the AVs, calculated as described above, in addition to an adjustment for utilization differences we expect due to plan cost sharing design. While we Plan AV Impact Silver 3 1.5% Silver 4 1.6%Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 22 understand the difficulty in differentiating increased utilization from an increased risk profile, we do feel it is appropriate to adjust lower member cost sharing plans for increased utilization. In the Actuarial Value Calculator Methodology document released by HHS, HHS states that spending is affected by plan design through induced demand, and they in turn have explicitly differentiated and estimated the impact of induced utilization by metal level. An internal study has confirmed that induced utilization is relevant and suggests that the HHS defined induced utilization factors may be conservative. Results from the internal study are as follows. Bronze Plan Liability Risk Score Allowed Per Member Per Year LOB < $5,000 Ded (a) >= $5,000 Ded 2,897 $ 2,059 41% 20% Therefore, we are applying the prescribed HHS induced utilization factors used in the HHS risk score to our plans. Also, due to early metallic experience concerns, we are applying an additional 10% load to the Platinum 1 plan. The metallic loss ratio on this plan is close to two times that of the Platinum 2 plan. The Platinum 1 plan has a very low out of pocket, which we believe is driving the unfavorable loss ratio. We understand that the experience is still not complete but given the magnitude of the difference in experience between the two plans, we feel it is prudent to include this adjustment at this time. The other values used in determining the plan adjusted index rate are explained in the applicable section above. Please see the attached rate exhibits for the portion of the value that is due to the allowed plan modifiers. 19. Membership Projections Please see Appendix E for projected experience in 2015. Our projection of 2015 member months was developed by combining the following pieces of information: 2014 open enrollment sales and expected 2015 open enrollment sales Policies that have rolled to an ACA compliant plan through 4/1/2014 Policies that we expect to roll to an ACA compliant plan through the end of 2014, including those that may keep their current NonACA complaint plan in 2014 and roll to an ACA compliant plan in 2015 Qualified Life Event sales outside of open enrollment expected each year We modeled the membership on a monthly basis through the end of 2015 using our monthly lapse rates by metal level and expected roll date for every policy within the state that is not yet on an ACA compliant plan. The expected member count during 2015 for each month is then Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 23 added up to arrive at the total member months expected in 2015. Any differences between the current distribution of projected member months and current metallic membership distribution would be attributed to any metallic rolls during the year and additional exchange sales, if applicable. The projected percentage of total membership in IN for cost sharing subsidies in 2015 is 55%. The table below outlines the specific member projection for each subsidy level. We relied on data from the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Reporting Project regarding exchange enrollment to develop the percentage of projected membership within each metallic/subsidy level. After determining the total expected exchange sales/members within IN in 2015, we then multiplied that amount by exchange experience reported to Wakely to arrive at the expected members within each metallic/subsidy level. Plan Type Member Projection % of Total Exchange Business Silver - 100% Products Nongrandfathered products on forms TIM.CER.IN, 227, 244, and 554 are being discontinued beginning 1/1/14. These products are included in the experience period data. In this state, policyholders have the option to continue their plan under the President's transitional memorandum, except those on Form 554. These products are included in the experience period data. 21. Plan Type All 2014 Individual Medical Plans will be PPO plans. 22. Warning Alerts A description of the warning alerts from the unified rate review template is below: 1. A warning appears because the index rate for the projection period that we entered in worksheet 1 cell V44 is greater than the projected allowed experience claims calculated in worksheet 1 cell V32 of the URRT. We feel that this difference is justified because the index rate is using our actual pricing data and methodology, which is slightly different than that used on the unified rate review template. These differences are explained above in the actuarial memorandum. 2. Warnings appear in rows 80 and 82 of the URRT worksheet 2 because the plan adjusted Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 24 index rate and total premium do not equal the totals on worksheet 1. The difference exists because we filled out the plan adjusted index rate for each plan based on our pricing data and methodology, which does not exactly match the data and methodology used on the unified rate review template. These differences are explained above in the actuarial memorandum. 3. A warning appears because historical rate increases were not entered for our terminated products. The instructions for the unified rate review template specifically state that these are not required. 23. Effective Rate Review Information Time Insurance Company's Risk Based Capital Ratio for 2013 is 519.7%. 24. Reliance In developing this rate filing I relied upon information provided by others within my department, as well as on information provided by other departments within the organization. I have reviewed this information for reasonableness, and I consider it to be reliable. 25. Actuarial Certification I am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries. To the best of my knowledge and judgment, 1. This rate filing is in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations concerning premium rate development in this state and the benefits are reasonable in relationship to premiums. 2. The projected index rate is: a. In compliance with all applicable State and Federal Statutes and Regulations. b. Developed in compliance with the Actuarial Standards of Practice. c. Reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered. d. Neither excessive nor deficient. 3. The index rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level rates. 4. The percent of total premium that represents essential health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV were calculated in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. To the best of my knowledge, the percent of total premium that represents EHB's is 100%. 5. The HHS AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values for all plans shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Template except for those documented in this memorandum. The AV values for those documented in the memorandum were developed based on one of the acceptable alternative methods and are in accordance with Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 25 generally accepted actuarial principles and methodologies. 6. Premium charged is identical for same rating characteristics both on and off the exchange. Identical rate exhibits are used for calculating the premium. 7. Plans offered off the exchange are not eligible for a Premium Tax Credit. Beth Schmitz, FSA, MAAA Director - IM Actuarial 6/2014 TIM14. 15.QHP.

If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e.

Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 54 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group co verage. i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. j. Medical coverage under automobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law. Plan do es no t include any of the following: a. An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 55 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1.

TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 52 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] IX. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) You or Your Covered Dependents may have insurance coverage under more than one Plan . If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provid ed by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided . All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non-group (individual) , blanket or franchise insuran ce that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other pr epayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e.

Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis. h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group co verage. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 53 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. j. Medical coverage under automobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law. Plan do es no t include any of the following: a. An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 54 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree . b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured . However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1. Release or obtain claim information from any Plan, individual or entity. 2. Pay Our covered benefits to any Plan or entity which has paid benefits that We should have paid. TIM14. 15.COB.

You may request a review while claims are being applied to the Deductible by calling Our Home Office or writing to Us .

June 13, 2014 Re: Rate Revision, Individual Major Medi cal Form TIM14.POL.IN, TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Time Insurance Company, NAIC Filing ID: ASPC-129497806 Dear Mr. Knable, We are sending a follow up to your objection letter sent on May 30, 2014. Please note that we have updated assumptions on reinsurance, platinum 1 plan utilization, and updated the actuarial memorandum, rate exhibit and rate data template with these impacts. Section 15.b. of the actuarial memorandum has also been updated. We have also updated which plans we wish to offer on the exchange. Affected exhibits have been updated. The initial ACA reinsurance program for 2014 w as to reimburse carriers 80% of claim costs between $60,000 and $250,000. In 2015, the reimbursement will ch ange to 50% of claim costs between $70,000 and $250,000. Ho wever, per recent guidance, HHS has suggested that the parameter is going to be lowered again in 2015 from $70,000 to $45,000, which we have taken into account. This and the change to platinum 1 utilization result in a revised rate increase of 24%. 1 On page 5 of the actuarial memorandum, you calculate an adjustment to account for including grandfathered experience, please de scribe this a little more and provide the adjustment factors. Response: The 2013 Wakely Risk Adjustment simulation only used non-grandfathered claims experience. However, since our baseline experience includes grandfathered experience, we had to make an adjustment to the risk scores to make sure it was reflective of our grandfathered and non-grandfathered business. Furthermore, we developed our change in market risk a ssumption relative to the total IM current market, not relative to the non- grandfathered current market 501 West Michigan PO Box 3050 Milwaukee, WI 53201-3050 T 800.800.1212 F 414.299.8904 www.assurant.com Indiana Department of Insurance 311 West Washington Street Suite 300 Indianapolis, IN 46204 Page 2 To make the adjustment, we looked at raw risk scores from the Wakely Study in 2012 and compared them to the raw Wakely risk scores from 2013, since the 2012 Wakely study included both grandfathered and non-grandfathered claim experience. The average decrease in risk scores from 2012 to 2013 was 8%. Therefore, we applied a 0.92 factor to the Wakely Risk score to arrive at a final estimate of a 0.85 risk score for Indiana. 2 Also on page 5, you indicate your business practices created a book of business with 17.6% lower costs. Does this account for the Medicaid Spend Down population? Response: No, we didn't explicitly make an adjustment to account for the Medicaid Spend Down population. 3 From page 6, please demonstrate how you have determined that 30% of your sales have been to customers that were previously uninsured. Response: This was developed from historical sales experience as we were able to track the percentage of our business that previously had or didn't have prior healthcare coverage. 4 On page 6, you say that the silver CS R plans will have lower benefits than the standard silver plan, can you explain or provide examples. Response: To clarify, the CSR plans will have lower cost sharing. Please see Appendix C for the cost sharing reduction plans. These plans have lower deductibles and out of pocket limits compared to the standard silver plan. 5 Do all of your plans include pediatric dental as part of the policy? Response: Yes, all plans include pediatric dental as part of the policy. This is described beginning on page 25 of the policy submitted on the forms schedule within this same filing (SERFF #: ASPC-129497806). Page 3 6 Please provide documentation as to where the increased utilization factors for the different metal levels came from on page 7. Response: These are the prescribed HHS utilization factors used in the risk adjustment model. This is also explained further in section 18 of the Memorandum. Also, due to early metallic experience concer ns, we are applying an additional 10% load to the Platinum 1 plan. The metallic loss ratio on this plan is close to two times that of the Platinum 2 plan. The Platinum 1 plan has a very low out of pocket, which we believe is driving the unfavorable loss ratio. We understa nd that the experience is still not complete but given the magnitude of the difference in experience between the two plans, we feel it is prudent to include this adjustment at th is time. Therefore, the platinum 1 utilization factor has been revised to 1.27 (=1.15*1.1). 7 With regard to the 2.7% adjustment to the experience period claims, please show the calculations for this. Response: This has been updated and is now a 4.3% adjustment. We inadvertently were using a state specific assumption for CSR plan exchange business but had meant to use a nationwide average. This was calculated based on our projected distribution of business and utilization. Please see table below. Metal Level Percent of Business Expected Utilization Increase Bronze 30% 1.00 Silver 49% 1.03 Gold 12% 1.08 Platinum 1 6% 1.27 Platinum 2 2% 1.15 Catastrophic 1% 1.00 Total 100% 1.043 Page 4 8 I will also need to see how the -9.4% adjustment was determined under Other Adjustments. Response: The negative 9.4% adjustment for network impact was determined by reviewing historical average network discounts and projected average network discounts. = (1 + Projected State Average Discount) / (1 + Historical State Average Discount) = (1+ (-39.6%)) / (1+ (-33.3%)) = -9.4% 9 You show a trend assumption of 9.5%. Is this impacted by the improved PPO discounts mentioned in Other Adjustments? Response: We value trend and PPO discounts separately. PPO discounts are valued in Section 5 of the actuarial memorandum under Other Adjustments. More detail is given in the objection response number 8. 10 In the Credibility Manual Rate Development section, you mention a number of adjustments, what is the actual impact of all of these adjustments? Please step through from 2012 to 2013 showing the factors for each of age, gender and smoking. Response: Per our credibility methodology, the IN experience is 100% credible. Therefore, the Manual Rate Development is not applicable for IN. 11 Under Section 8, please provide a demonstration of how the 1.035 was determined for the Bronze plan. Response: The leveraging impact was based off of Milliman Continuance tables. We assumed our base trend assumption of 9.5% on allowed claims and determined the cost sharing impact on of each of our bronze plans. The bronze leveraging impact is the average of all bronze plans listed in Appendix C. The same approach was used for other metal levels. Please see the attached Bronze Benefit Leveraging as for a demonstration. Page 5 12 With regard to the leveraging mentioned, w hat is your historical deductible and OOP maximum. Response: Our pre-2014 historical cost sharing was le ss rich than the expected metallic cost sharing. Historically, a large proportion of our book had an actuarial value below 55%. Using the actuarial value calculator, the estimated average AV of our historical book was approximately 65%. However, we are expecting our metallic block to have an average AV closer to 72%, which is driven by sales of richer metallic plans. 13 Please provide the distribution assumed by metal level for 2015. Response: Please see table below. Metal Level Percent of Business Bronze 30% Silver 49% Gold 12% Platinum 8% Catastrophic 1% Total 100% 14 Please consider if, due to the high risk pool and the Medicare Spend Down program and the fact that your current business is at a lower cost level, do you think that your pool would owe risk adjustment? Response: It is still very early to make assumptions on what our risk score will be. We do not believe that making an assumption using our inforce plans as a basis is appropriate since our metallic book will be a much different mix of business due to sales during open enrollment. We are determining our rates on a 1.0 market average risk score basis and believe it is prudent to do so until further experience with the risk score program is gained. Page 6 15 I see a 7.5% adjustment for reinsurance. How did you determine this and follow this through to the $24.12 in the URRT? Response: As described above, the reinsurance assumptions have been updated. Reinsurance is now 10.2%, which is $38.57 in the URRT. Reinsurance of 10.2% is calculated to a PMPM number by taking 10.2% multiplied by incurred claims before reinsurance, which is $378.05 in the URRT. . 16 For the General and Administrative cost in the expense category, please break the 12% into the components along with a PMPM. Response: Please see table below for General and Administrative expense breakout. Expenses 2015 PMPM % of Premium Salaries, Wages, Employment Taxes & Other Benefits 17.52 4.7% Cost Depreciation: equipment, software, furniture, etc. 0.04 0.0% Rent (Occupancy) 0.33 0.1% Marketing & Advertising 1.77 0.5% General Office Expenses: sundries, supplies, telephone, printing, postage, etc. 0.40 0.1% Third Party Administration Expenses or Fees or Other Group Service Expense or Fees 14.54 3.9% Legal Fees and Expenses & Other Professional or Consulting Fees 9.33 2.5% Traveling Expenses 0.29 0.1% Total Expenses Incurred 44.21 11.8% 17 How are the Managed Care and Cost Containment of 2.5% and the quality improvement of .9% determined? Page 7 Response: Managed Care and Cost Containment Expenses: This is a variable expense that accounts for expenses incurred in order to reduce claims costs, such as access fees paid to the Preferred Provider Organization Networks that are leased on behalf of our customers. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue. Quality Improvement Expenses: This category accounts for expenses incurred in order to improve the quality of healthcare. Quality Improvement Expenses are added to claim payments in the Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue and adjusted to account for additional QI expenses expected in 2015. 18 With the taxes and insure fee, please provide a concise development of each piece. Response: Health Insurer Fee: $8 billion will be collected nationally for this fee in 2014 and $11.3 billion in 2015. The fee is based on our share of the total market premium. Our estimate is that this fee will be 1.2% of premium in 2014. Therefore, applying the 41% ($11.3/$8) increase in the fee, the resulting 2015 expected percentage is 1.7% (1.2%*1.41). State Premium Taxes and Assessments are estimated at approximately 2.2% of premium. State premium taxes are approximately 1.2%, while other regulatory and other miscellaneous fees (includes FICA , FUTA, SUTA, licensing fees, etc.) account for about 0.9%. The SCHE was used as the basis for these assumptions: Page 8 19 there was a reduction in staff that reduced some expenses, do you have an estimate of this impact? Response: Reduction in underwriting and pre-ex conditions staff accounts for approximately 1.1% of revenue. 20 Are commissions paid on exchange only business? Response: Commissions are paid on all business, both on and off the exchange. 21 Please split the 2.2% into the parts. Hove your reduced assessment assumptions since ICHIA is going away? Response: 2015's state premium taxes and assessments are approximately 2.2% and are as follows: state premium taxes are approximately 1.2%, while other regulatory and other miscellaneous fees (includes FICA, FUTA, SUTA, licensing fees, etc.) account Page 9 for about 0.9%. The PCORI fee is approximately 0.05%. We are not including any assessment for ICHIA as we assume it is going away in 2015. 22 I don't see the 1.7% in Exchange User Fees as part of the taxes and fees in the table. Response: The Exchange User Fee is included in the Market Adjusted Index Rate as per the HHS Memorandum guidance. Market Adjusted Index Rate Issuers are required to include the Market Adjusted Index Rate. The Market Adjusted Index rate is calculated as the Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market-wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). The following market-wide adjustments to the Index Rate are allowable under these rules: Federal reinsurance program adjustment (market-wide adjustment) Risk adjustment (market-wide adjustment) Exchange user fee adjustment (market-wide adjustment) 23 Have you paid rebates in recent years? Please provide experience. Response: Please see table below for previous 3 years rebates paid. Year Rebate Paid 2011 $666,462 2012 $0 2013 $0 24 With regard to the quality improvement exp ense, can you show the experience from the supplemental health care exhibit that validates this? Response: Quality improvement expenses were calculated on a nationwide basis, though this closely ties with the 2013 Indiana specific supplemental health care exhibit (attached), Part 1 line 6.6 divided by line 1.12 (10,465 / 1,207,048 = 0.9%). The Page 10 nationwide quality improvement expense number was adjusted slightly for additional QI expenses expected in 2015. 25 I may be missing something, but I don't see where the 2.1% for FIT is coming from. Response: The 2.1% for FIT is based on a 6% pre-tax profit margin. We are assuming that we will have a 40% federal income tax in 2014. The 2.1% also accounts for the ACA fee not being tax deductible and net investment income of negative 2.5%. The exact calculation is (6% + 1.5% - 2.5%)*40% = 2.1%. 26 Please explain how the population risk morbidity of 1.776 was determined. Response: The population risk morbidity of 1.776 in the URRT was calculated by multiplying rows G, H, and K of Appendix A together. Those rows represent the adjustments to 2013 market risk, adjustments to 2015 market risk and the adjustment to account for the pent up demand of uninsured's. Please see the attached morbidity support for more details on the change in the average market risk pre-reform vs. post reform. 27 What are the dependent factor and the Non-Tobacco user adjustment factor and how are they determined? Response: These factors are listed in section 14 of the actuarial memorandum, and are included in the rate exhibit. We are unable to rate more than 3 dependents, which means that for families with more than 3 children, the premium will only include the 3 oldest dependents. The Dependent Factor listed in the Rate Exhibit (1.004) is used to spread the cost of dependents which we are not allowed to rate for under ACA regulations. Tobacco Surcharge Factor is calculated by taking number of Indiana member months by age/tobacco status multiplied by the Time Insurance Company Tobacco Factor. This sum is then divided by the total Indiana member months for the 2013 calendar year. Page 11 28 Please provide the detailed calculations for the age curve calibration calculation. Response: Appendix A Lines R though U show more detail on the age curve calibration factor. Line R - Adjustment to 21 Year Old (1.0 Age Curve Factor) is calculated by taking number of Indiana member months by age multiplied by the HHS Age Factor. This sum is then divided by the total Indiana member months for the 2013 calendar year. The sum of the age factors, using the standard age curve, for the 2013 IN membership is 199,297. The sum of the 2013 members is 139,763. 199,297/139,763 = 1.426 Line S - Projected average age is calculated by taking the average age of current metallic inforce and any policies that are rolling to a metallic policy. Line T - Projected Age Curve Adjustment Factor is the federal age curve factor for age 36, which is the projected average age for Indiana. Line U - Age Curve Calibration Factor is calculated by taking Line T divided by Line R (1.230/1.426 = 0.863). 29 Have you included the Unique AV calculation forms? Response: Please see the Rx Brand Deductible_AV_Pl an, Specialty Rx_AV_Plan. 30 I see you mention Rider Add-on cost on page 20, I just want to make sure that this is not done via a rider as all benefits must be contained in the policy. Response: The Rider Add-on cost is not a rider, but is the additional AV for the DXL benefit that is contained in the policy. 31 Please provide plan ID in the context of Appendix C? Response: Plan ID's are now listed in Appendix C. Page 12 32 In Section 20, is this correct? Are you not going to follow the transitional policy bulletin? Does this include all non-grandfathered products? Is 1/1/14 the correct date? Response: We plan to offer transitional policies on all products except those on Form 554. The actuarial memorandum has been updated to reflect this. Your prompt attention to this filing is appreciated. Please contact me should you have any questions regarding this filing.

I may have missed this so pleas e indicate where the explanation is located. Response: This is located in Section 22 of the Actuarial Memorandum. Please view the actuarial memo randum that was updated June 13th. 3 In review of the plans benefit template, we have the following question s. a. Private duty nursing ranges up to 200 which is above EHB. Is this consistent with the plans that were filed? If so, please adjust row 83 of the URRT to indicate the EHB % of total premium correctly. Response: We have revised the Plans & Benefits Tem plate to indicate 82 visits. A revised Plans & Benefits Template has been resubmitted under the Plan Management Binder SERFF # ASPC -IN15 -125019086. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. b. Home Health Care Services has 100 visits which is above EHB. Is thi s consistent with the plans that were filed? If so, please adjust row 83 of the URRT to indicate the EHB % of total premium correctly. Response: We have revised the Plans & Benefits Template to indicate 90 visits. A revised Plans & Benefits Template has b een resubmitted under the Plan Management Binder SERFF # ASPC -IN15 -125019086. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. c. Pre -natal care comments that only 1 visit is allowed at 100%. Do you cover more than 1 pre -natal visit during pregnancy? Response: Yes w e cover more than 1 prenatal visit. We have removed the 1 visit limitation and added a note to the Plans & Benefits Template to indicate \"Prenatal Visits in accordance with the A and B recommendations under the United States Preventive Services Task Force are covered at 100%\". A revised Plans & Benefits Template has been resubmitted under the Plan Management Binder SERFF # ASPC -IN15 -125019086. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. d. Outpatient Rehabilitation Services should indicate 60 visits in column G. Page 3 Response: We have revised the Plans & Benefits Template to indicate 60 visits and in the Benefit Explanation column, we added a note that there are 20 visits for OT, 20 visits for PT and 20 visits for ST. A revised Plans & Benefits Template has been resu bmitted under the Plan Management Binder SERFF # ASPC -IN15 -125019086. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. e. Habilitative Services should show 60 visits in column G. Response: We have revised the Plans & Benefits Template to indicate 60 visits and in th e Benefit Explanation column, we added a note that there are 20 visits for OT, 20 visits for PT and 20 visits for ST. A revised Plans & Benefits Template has been resubmitted under the Plan Management Binder SERFF # ASPC -IN15 -125019086. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. f. Rehabilitation Occupational and Rehabilitative Physical Therapy should have 20 OT plus 20 PT for 40 visits in column G. Response: We have revised the Plans & Benefits Template to indicate 40 visits for these benefits. A revised Plans & Benefits Template has been resubmitted under the Plan Management Binder SERFF # ASPC -IN15 - 125019086. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. g. You show Diabetes Education, Prosthetic Devices, Treatment of TMJ and Nutritional Counseling as above EHB, thes e should be = EHB. Response: Per our phone conversation with Bobbi Henn, I explained that when we pull ed over the Indiana EHB information on the Plans & Benefits Template, the EHB column is blank for these benefits, therefore, we originally selected \"Abov e EHB\" for the EHB variance reason. Per your request, we have revised the EHB variance reason to \"Additional EHB Benefit\" which more accurately represents these benefits. Therefore, the URRT is not impacted. Also, please note, based on revisions made to the Plans & Benefits Template, we also revised the benefit summary. Please see the revised co py under the Forms Schedule. 4 Can you provide a list for each formulary showing the number of drugs in each of the 4 tiers? Please show this by class and categ ory. If some don't fit the standard list, group those at the end as other. I would expect this to look like: Category:Class:Tier 1:Tier 2:Tier 3:Tier 4 Page 4 Response: Our master formulary file has the Therapeutic Category and Therapeutic Class fields partially populated with Medispan descriptions. For those rows with blank fields we manually populated the cells with \"OTHER\" as directed per your instructions for the response. The category and class names are not always an exact match to what the USP Count Tool Output generated, so we were unable to reclassify with an exact match to the output tool reporting. We have attached a file with each of our Drug Lists to provide the drug level detail and tier levels. The Tier information is in column E (NA was used fo r drugs covered under medical; the highest tier [3 for 2Tier, 4 for 3Tier] was used for Preventive Meds covered at first dollar). Since we were unable to produce exactly what was requested, we are hoping this detailed level of information along with a hig h level count of the number of drugs in each tier level for each Drug List will be adequate for this response. We used the USP Drug Count Tool from CMS Zone and the results are attached, which show \"All RXCUIs Submitted\" on tab 3, some of which were \"Not In Crosswalk\" based on the output results. We have an \"open\" formulary for both the 2Tier and 3Tier, therefore all drugs are covered under medical or drug card benefits, unless excluded by contract. We have also provided additional RXCUI information for categories where we are deficient based on the USP Count Tool Output (this is the same for both Drug Lists 1 & 2, so the RXCUIs by category are only listed once using the Inadequate Formulary Justification form format). Please see the attached Master Formul ary, Drug Count by Tier, Drug List ID -1, Drug List ID -2 and Class Count Form with RXCUI attached in Supporting D ocumentation. 5 Please review the attached excel file and indicate which drugs are covered under the medical benefit, formulary or not at all. Response: Please see column A (Coverage) on the revised Deficient drug list document attached in Supporting Documentation. 6 One of the CCIIO tools indicates that all EHBs must be subject to the deductible. The following plans kicked out for the followin g reasons. Routine Eye Exam for Children and Dental Check -up for Children should be subject to deductible for the following plans: 00. Cost sharing for In Network Tier 1 should read \"No charge after deductibl e\" for the mentioned benefits and plans. Please address this issue. Response: All the above mentioned plans are the Catastrophic plans and pursuant to ACA, are all paid with 0 cost sharing once the deductible is met except for the 3 office visits and prev entive. Routine Eye Exam for Children and Dental Check -Up for Children are preventive benefits and are always covered at No Charge in -network (as well as out -of-network for Dental Check -Up for Children). 7 One of the CCIIO tools indicated the following: the combination of copay and coinsurance data entry for the benefit must indicate that the consumer does not have any out of pocket charges after meeting the deductible. For the same plans mentioned above, Emergency Room Services only says \"$100 copay befo re deductible\". Please address this issue Response: We have removed the $100 copay for emergency room services. Your prompt attention to this filing is appreciated.

If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c.

Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 54 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1. Release or obtain claim information from any Plan, individual or entity. 2. Pay Our covered benefits to any Plan or entity which has paid benefits that We should have paid. TIM14. 15.COB.

It is the Covered Person's responsibility to determine if a provider is a Participating Provider or a Non - Participating Provider before any services are rendered . Please see the Benefit Summary for specific benefit levels that apply to each type of p rovider . Non -Participating Providers may bill more than We determine to be a Maximum Allowable Amount and the Covered Person is responsible for payment of any amount billed above the Maximum Allowable A mount. The Covered Person is not responsible for payment of amounts billed by a Participating Provider in excess of the Maximum Allowable Amount for Covered Charges received within the Covered Person's network. Payment of Participating Provider Benefits A Covered Person may receive a higher benefit level for Covered Charges received from a Participating Provider . The Participating Provider benefit levels are shown in the Benefit Summary . Network services and supplies for which We have a Contracted Rate are not subject to Maxim um Allowable Amount reductions. The Covered Person's cost sharing under this plan is based on the Contracted Rate for the covered goods or services provided. Using a Participating Provider is not a guarantee of coverage. All other requirements of this plan must be met for Covered Charges to be considered for payment. Deductibles may vary based on whether the provider is a Participating Provider or not. See the Benefit Summary for applicable Plan Deductibles. It is the Covered Perso n's responsibility to verify a provider's status within the Participating Provider Network at the time of service to ensure the Participating Provider benefit is received. Information on Participating Providers will be made available to You . If You or Your Covered Dependents are having trouble locating a Participating Provider, please call the network's phone number on the directory website or on Your identification (ID) card for assistance. The Covered Person's benefits may also be affected based on the following factors: 1. Providers and/or networks may join or leave the Participating Provider Network from time to time . The Covered Person is responsible for verifying the participation status of a provider at the time of service. Prior to treatment, the Cov ered Person should call the Network Manager to verify whether a provider's participation in the network has terminated. 2. If the Covered Person Incurs Covered Charges after a Participating Provider's participation in the Participating Provider Network has t erminated, Covered Charges will be processed at the Non -Participating Provider benefit level. 3. We will pay Covered Charges at the Participating Provider benefit level under certain circumstances, such as if the Covered Person begins treatment with the Part icipating Provider prior to the provider's date of termination as a Participating Provider. TIM14. 15.QHP. PAR. XX Page 9 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] 4. If the Covered Person Incurs Covered Charges after a Provider's status within the Participating Provider Network has changed, Covered Charges will be processed acc ording to the participation level of the Provider as of the date the service or supply is received. Maximum Allowable Amou nts for Participating Providers For goods and services provided by a Participating Provider, facility or supplier, the Maximum Allowa ble Amount is the lesser of billed charges or the Contracted Rate.

Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b.

An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 55 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1.

General Policy Description: This rate filing is for non-grandfathered individua l major medical plans which cover the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) as required under t he Affordable Care Act (ACA). These plans are guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewable as defined under the ACA and HIPAA. Plans are marketed through general agencies, brokers, wholesale arrangements, and direct-to-consumer. In 2015, Assurant Health wi ll sell plans both inside and outside of the public health exchanges in this state. Cover age beyond age 65 will be secondary to Medicare. Premiums are on an attained age basis and will increase with age. Premiums also vary by plan design, tobacco status a nd geographic area. In 2015, only the oldest three dependents under age 21 will be ch arged a premium rate for a given policy. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 2 2. Proposed Rate Increase: The proposed average rate increase for this state i s 28%. This increase excludes attained age increases. The rate increase does vary by plan. The se adjustments are described in further detail in section 14 of this memorandum. Appendix A shows the development of base rates for this product. The remaining sections of the memorandum d etail the assumptions we used to develop rates. Reasons for Rate Increase: The following list is a brief description of the si gnificant factors driving the proposed rate change. More detailed des criptions of these factors are included later in this memorandum. 1.) Medical Trend: Our medical trend accounts for the e ffects on future claims due to inflation, advancing medical technology and techniques, and in creased utilization and cost shifting. 2.) Additional Fees: The health insurer fee assessment is moving from $8 billion to $11.3 billion in 2015 which results in a lower target loss ratio. In addition to this, we are going on the public exchange in this state in 2015 and have adde d the 3.5% exchange user fee into our price. 3.) Average Morbidity: There will continue to be change s in the projected risk pool due mainly to, but not limited to, the following factors: a.) Continued group and Medicaid migration b.) Continued uninsured migration c.) Current IM consumers forgoing coverage d.) State high risk pool termination 4.) Paid to Allowed Ratio: The difference between our p rojected paid to allowed ratio in our experience versus that of the 2014 actuarial value calculator results in an increase to our price. 5.) Reinsurance: The initial ACA reinsurance program fo r 2014 was to reimburse carriers 80% of claim costs between $60,000 and $250,000. In 2015, the reimbursement will change to 50% of claim costs between $70,000 and $250,000. The rate increases vary by product primarily due to benefit leveraging differences by metal level and differences in PPO network factors. These adjus tments are warranted as they result in actuarially appropriate rates that reflect the true cost differences between the plans. Please note that our rating methodology differs fro m that outlined in the Unified Rate Review Template. Rather, the Unified Rate Review Template represents information required by Federal Regulation to facilitate review. The following sect ions note any differences between the Unified Rate Review Template and the pricing methodology we used to develop rates. Please refer to Appendix A for our rate development methodology. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 3 3. Experience Period Premium and Claims We prepared the Unified Rate Review Template using state and legal entity specific non- grandfathered experience in order to comply with De partment of Health and Human Services (HHS) requirements. For the purpose of estimating t he average risk of the 2015 market, grandfathered and non-grandfathered experience of T ime Insurance Company and John Alden Life Insurance Company was reviewed together. This combined experience was used in order to develop an actuarially appropriate prediction of th e market wide per member per month risk and standardized claim cost in 2015. The same exper ience basis is used for both the pricing methodology and the development of factors that wil l address the impact of our risk relative to the market and the impact this has on premium rates . This process is described in more detail below. Experience Period: The experience period is claims incurred and premiu m earned from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. Paid Through Date: The date through which payments have been made on claim s incurred during the experience period is February 28, 2014. Premiums (Net of MLR Rebate) in Experience Period: In the Unified Rate Review Template, the earned premium prior to Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) re bates for the Calendar Year 2013 experience period was $12,850,215. Earned premium w as not adjusted for any reductions prescribed when calculating the MLR, such as taxes and assessments. The MLR rebates for the experience period are estimated at $0. The financial actuarial team at Assurant Health est imates accrued premium refunds required under Federal Minimum Loss Ratio regulations for th e Individual Medical and Group Medical insurance business. The team projects incurred clai ms, earned premiums, and other elements and applies adjustments as outlined in Federal laws and regulations. These projections are performed on a state and market level basis and rec ent claims experience is adjusted for estimated claims reserves on a state level basis. Allowed and Incurred Claims During the Experience Period: In the Unified Rate Review Template, the amount of incurred claims processed t hrough our claim system for the experience period 2013 is $8,701,453. The best estimate of exp erience period claims incurred but not reported is $350,236. The amount of allowed claims processed through our claim system for the experience period 2013 is $14,871,903. The best est imate of experience period allowed claims incurred but not paid as of the paid through date s hown above is $6,170,449. Allowed claims are developed by subtracting ineligible charges and dis counts from the total provider billed amount. Assurant Health has no capitation agreements. The per member per month experience period allowed claims in our pricing methodology is based upon all Individual Medical experience within the state for Assurant Health. The methodology is demonstrated in Appendix A. Experien ce for limited benefit plans was not Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 4 included. Furthermore, an adjustment was made in or der to pool large claims across our block. Claims in excess of $50,000 for a specific member a nd incurred month were removed from the experience, and then a nationwide average pooling c harge was applied per member. All pricing components, including the base experience period da ta, are applied consistently across the single risk pool in the state and market for 2015. Our financial actuarial team develops lag triangle s for nationwide Individual Medical experience. These triangles are separately developed for Medica l and Prescription Drug Card coverage. Specific large claims that are part of our case man agement program are removed from the Medical triangles and reserved for separately. Hist orical averages are used in order to calculate monthly completion factors for the remaining claims . 4. Benefit Categories Inpatient services are those received during a pat ient's hospital stay and are included in the Inpatient Hospital Category. Outpatient services (e .g. lab tests, X-rays, and some surgical services) are those rendered by a facility within a n outpatient setting. Professional services include primary care, specialist, therapy and other professional charges that are not included in facility fees. Other Medical services include charg es for items that do not fall into the categories above, such as ambulance and durable medical equipm ent. The Other category is measured based upon distinct services or items provided. Ret ail and mail order pharmacy claims are included in the Prescription Drug category. 5. Projection Factors Changes in the Morbidity of the Insured Population: There are two adjustments that we are using to get to an estimate of the 2015 market risk . The first is an adjustment to get Assurant specific pre-reform risk to the market average. The second is to get the average pre-reform market risk to the expected 2015 average market ris k. Both are explained in further detail below. Assurant Health to Market Average: To establish this estimate, Assurant Health partici pated in the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Simulation Proj ect (WNRASP). In this project the Wakely Consulting Group quantified risk using the HCC-HHS model that Health and Human Services (HHS) developed for implementation in 2014. Wakely conducted risk simulations in individual and small group markets only when 75%+ of the state wide membership was represented. Health plans covering these members used claim expe rience to determine plan liability risk scores consistent with the HCC-HHS methodology. Hea lth plan specific liability risk scores along with allowable rating factors are compared to the s cores of all market participants consistent with the methodology set forth in the Risk Adjustme nt Program. The WNRASP results provided to Assurant Health quan tify the difference in the risk of the Assurant Health book of business relative to the st ate and market average risk. The estimate of Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 5 the market risk was adjusted to approximate a risk score when the market includes both grandfathered and non-grandfathered experience. Si nce we use both grandfathered and non- grandfathered experience we feel it is appropriate that the market is on this same basis. In 2012 the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Simulation Proj ect (WNRASP) used both grandfathered and non-grandfathered data while in 2013 only non-g randfathered data was used. To calculate an adjustment to account for including grandfathere d experience we used the 2013 market to 2012 market risk score. The final state result is adjusted to the extent th at base period data was less than 100% credible, in order to be on a consistent basis with the index rate for the state. The final result for use in our pricing methodology was a 0.85 risk score. This indicates that Assurant Health business practices (e.g. distribution methods and underwriti ng) and member selection patterns have created a book of experience with 17.6% lower costs . Our pricing was adjusted by a factor of 1.0/0.85 to represent the average actuarial risk, a s shown in Appendix A. This multiplicative adjustment is consistently applied across all plans within the state. Pre-reform Market to Post Reform Market: The ACA incentivizes various subpopulations of Indiana to migrate into or out of the ACA IM market , altering the average risk of the insured population. Key drivers of this migration include, but are not limited to: 1.) The dissolution of the Indiana high-risk pool, whic h will incentivize the high-risk pool members to enter the ACA IM market 2.) The availability of subsidies, which will incentivi ze lower risk, formerly uninsured persons to enter the ACA IM market 3.) The guaranteed-issue environment, which will incent ivize members of the uninsured population with pre-existing conditions to enter th e ACA IM market 4.) Employees losing group coverage, which in general w ill result in an increase in morbidity as the group market is less healthy than the pre-re form IM market Our final estimate is that the morbidity of the 201 5 insured population in Indiana will increase by 48% over the morbidity of the pre-ACA insured po pulation. A number of sources were used to calculate this morbidity factor. Figures publis hed by the Department of Health & Human Services in \"Summary Enrollment Report for the Init ial Annual Open Enrollment Period\" were accepted as the definitive count of exchange applic ations through the end of March. We used data provided by the Wakely Consulting Group in con nection with their National Risk Adjustment Reporting Project (NRAP) to determine of f-exchange enrollment through the end of March, the volume of early-adopters both on- and of f -exchange, and the number of insured on non-compliant plans scheduled to roll to a complian t plan by the end of 2014. Morbidity data furnished by the Society of Actuaries in their \"Cos t of the Future Newly Insured under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\" was used to compare the morbidity of the migrating population to the morbidity of the pre-ACA insured population. O ther industry studies were used to validate the reasonableness of our results. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 6 In addition to the expected change in the average r isk of the insured population, we anticipate that there will be an increase in utilization relat ive to our experience period due to the pent up demand as newly insured enrollees continue to sign up for coverage. When consumers are uninsured or underinsured, they may opt to delay he althcare services. Historically, approximately 30% of our sales have been to custome rs who did not previously have health insurance. These previously uninsured customers hav e claim experience that is significantly worse than those with prior coverage. This experien ce discrepancy is most pronounced in the first 6 months of coverage, when the experience rel ativity between these two cohorts is up to 20% higher than the ultimate relativity. We expect that the mandate to purchase insurance may temper the pent up demand of the newly insured ente ring the market in 2015. Therefore, the 2015 utilization on newly insured individuals will not have as large of a spike as our historical experience. Our assumption is that an additional 10 % of our block will be newly insured individuals, with 10% higher than typical utilizati on in the first 6 months of coverage. This leads to an adjustment of 0.5% within our pricing and cla im projection. We are planning to go on the exchange in this state in 2015. Therefore, we will be selling silver cost sharing reduction (CSR) plans that will have l ower benefits than the standard silver plan. As a result of this, we are adding an additional 1.5% for increased utilization to the assumption above. This adjustment was determined using the 12% CSR plan utilization factor used in the risk adjustment model, weighted by the expected percent of cost sharing subsidy business. Please see section 19 below for more details on the CSR pl an assumptions. Changes in Benefits: There is an adjustment of 7.0% within our pricing a nd claim projection to include new and expanded benefits in accordance wit h the EHB requirements of the ACA. The table below lists the estimated additional cost ass ociated with each new benefit. The Pediatric Dental expense was estimated using commercial group experience for 2011 and 2012 from our sister segment, Assurant Employee Benefits. The rem aining estimates are based upon purchased data of experience of a standard population. Benefit Estimated Additional Cost Maternity 3.1% Mental Health and Substance Abuse 1.2% Pediatric Vision 0.4% Chiropractic 0.4 % Private Duty Nursing 0.3% Pediatric Dental 1.6 % GRAND TOTAL 7.0 % We also made an adjustment to account for the cover age of additional preventative items that will be paid first dollar due to updates by the USP STF. We believe the impact of covering these additional first dollar benefits is 1.0%. This est imate was determined by evaluating the volume of these items in our historical experience. The ad ditional first dollar preventative benefits are: Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 7 1.) Alcohol Misuse 2.) Breast Cancer Risk 3.) Hepatitis C Screening 4.) HIV Screening 5.) Tobacco Use Prevention in Children and Adolescents In addition, it is expected that the average actuar ial value of our block will increase from approximately 60% to approximately 70% after the ch ange to standardized Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum metallic plans. Furthermore, approxima tely 30% of business within our experience data is on a plan that has an actuarial value of 55 % or less. We expect that richer benefits in 2015 will induce demand for healthcare services tha t is higher than the average utilization within our base experience. We assume that future S ilver plans will have utilization that is 3% higher than our average current experience, Gold wi ll be 8% higher, and Platinum will be 15% higher. Based upon our expected 2015 split of plans by metal level, we have adjusted our experience period claims by 2.7% in order to accoun t for this benefit level driven increase in utilization. The projected 2015 membership was used to determine both the average actuarial value and utilization impact. The membership method ology is described in more detail below. Other Adjustments: We made an adjustment of -9.4% within our pricing a nd claim projection in order to account for expected improvements in Prefe rred Provider Organization (PPO) discounts in 2015 relative to the 2013 experience period. Our expected PPO discounts are developed by using a combination of experience and reported data from the networks that we lease. The future improvement is driven by a larger share of b usiness expected in the Aetna Signature Administrators (ASA) network in 2015 relative to 20 13. This network arrangement is more favorable for Assurant Health than other leased net works. Furthermore, our rental networks work to renegotiate and improve their contracts wit h providers over time which also contributes towards the improvement in discounts. The ASA netwo rk was first launched in Indiana in October 2012. Trend Factors (cost/utilization): The effects on future claims of inflation, advancin g medical technology and techniques, and increased utilizatio n and cost shifting are accounted for by an annual secular trend assumption of 9.5%. This is an allowed claims trend factor. This trend was developed from historical experience of our nationw ide block. Our historical experience shows slightly higher trend but we are lowering it to 9.5 % as we anticipate trend will be lower than our historical experience due to a more standard risk p opulation going forward. Please see Appendix B for further detail. Experience was trended for 24 months, from the mid-point of 2013 to the mid-point of 2015. 6. Credibility Manual Rate Development The manual rate reflects the Assurant Health Indivi dual Medical 2013 nationwide allowed claims per member per month (pmpm). This allowed pmpm valu e has been adjusted to address the following needs: Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 8 1. Adjust the nationwide claims to reflect the Assuran t Health distribution by age and tobacco use in Indiana. 2. Remove the impact of claims experience from Indiana (to avoid double counting this experience in the rate development). 3. Adjust to reflect the specific utilization and char ge level patterns of Indiana. External data, in conjunction with claims experienc e from 2012, is used to determine the Indiana to nationwide expected cost relativity. In order to determine this relativity for 2012, regression analysis is used holding age, gender, and smoking s tatus constant. If 2012 experience in Indiana is not fully credible, the state relative cost fact or is blended with a state relative cost factor developed using Truven Analytics MarketScan\u00ae 2011 d atabase. Controlling for age and gender, regression analysis on the Truven database produced the state to nationwide allowed cost relativity. The 2011 and Truven blended relativity factor is referred to as the manual state factor. A regression based on nationwide 2013 allowed claim s experience was used to smooth allowed claim levels by age, gender, and smoking status. Fr om this regression, predicted allowed claims were calculated at each age and smoking status comb ination. These allowed pmpm claim levels are applied to the Indiana distribution of membersh ip by age, gender, and smoking status and summed. In addition, an adjustment is applied to re move the influence Indiana claims have on the nationwide average claims. The manual state factor is multiplied by adjusted 2 013 national claim levels as described in the previous paragraph to calculate the manual pmpm all owed claims in the state. The manual rate is blended with the base period rate as described i n the credibility section below. The manual rate was adjusted to the 2015 pricing pe riod using the projection factors listed in the section above. 7. Credibility of Experience To develop our full credibility standard, we conduc ted a study to establish confidence levels at different cohort sizes. In this study, we randomly sampled cohorts from our internal block of members. We analyzed 100,000 randomly sampled cohor ts at each size to establish the variance associated with a cohort of that size. The required cohort size to be considered fully credible was set at the point where we were 95% confident th at claims would fall within 4% of our target. This results in a fully credible standard o f 82,000 member months for experience that has had claims in excess of $50,000 per member per mont h level pooled across the block, as used within our pricing methodology. The Unified Rate Re view Template utilizes unpooled claims. Therefore, based upon the same 95% confidence, the standard for full credibility on the Unified Rate Template is 562,000 member months. Partial credibility is assigned to the experience p eriod data based upon the classical credibility formula listed below: Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 9 Square Root ( (Experience Data Member Months) / (Fu ll Credibility Standard) ) Based upon the above credibility methodology, our I ndiana pooled experience as used within pricing is 100% credible. The unpooled base experie nce as used in the Unified Rate Review Template is 37% credible. The state specific experience was removed from the development of the manual rate in order to avoid any double counting of the base period experi ence. 8. Paid to Allowed Ratio Our projected Paid to Allowed Ratio is 70%. In our 2014 pricing development, the Actuarial Valu e (AV) calculator provided by HHS produced values that were very close to our historical paid to allowed ratios on an aggregate basis. Therefore, we determined it was reasonable to use t he HHS AV calculator to develop estimates of the paid to allowed ratio of our 2014 insured po pulation. However, our 2013 paid to allowed ratio was slightly higher than the value produced A V calculator, which is reasonable given that underlying data in the AV calculator was not update d from the prior year. Therefore, we are accounting for this difference by including a benef it leveraging factor in the pricing values of our plans. This factor will vary by metal level due to the differing leveraging effects by cost sharing level. Bronze plans will have a higher leveraging e ffect due to higher cost sharing and conversely, Platinum plans will have a lower levera ging effect due to lower cost sharing. To determine the leveraging factors, we used a clai m probability distribution from the 2012 Milliman Health Cost Guidelines to model the levera ging effect on our metal plans. The final assumptions are as follows: Metal Level Leveraging Catastrophic 1.035 Bronze 1.035 Silver 1.030 Gold 1.015 Platinum 1.010 The approximate average leveraging using the factor s above is 3%, which is lower than our historical benefit leveraging of 4%. We believe thi s decrease is appropriate given the large proportion of our historical book that had AV's les s than 55%. To develop the projected Paid to Allowed Ratio, we used our membership projection to determine the distribution of plans by metal level in 2015. We then applied the leveraging factors by metal level to the actuarial value's and averaged them to get a total projected paid to Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 10 allowed ratio. The methodology of our membership pr ojection is described in more detail below. 9. Risk Adjustment and Reinsurance Risk Adjustment: In 2014, the ACA established a Risk Adjustment Pro gram that will allow issuers to set premiums according to the average actuarial risk in the individual and small group market without respect to the type of risk selection the i ssuer would otherwise expect. The ACA establishes a standard quantification of risk with the HCC-HHS risk scoring model. Until we gain further knowledge on the total Indiana market risk, we are continuing to price to the market average risk of 1.0. Therefore, no market wide adju stment for the risk adjustment program was applied when determining the market adjusted index rate. Reinsurance Recoveries: In 2015, the ACA has a Reinsurance Program that wi ll reimburse carriers 50% of claim costs between $70,000 and $25 0,000 per member. We have made a negative 7.5% adjustment to our expected claim cost s within our pricing in order to account for expected reinsurance recoveries. This projected rei nsurance adjustment is applied to the index rate to develop the market adjusted index rate in a ccordance with Part III instructions. Our reinsurance recovery assumption was developed using Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Research Databases, which is representative of a standard po pulation and with coverage similar to the ACA EHB package. The exposure and claim data was li mited to members that had complete data and were on a non-capitated basis. In addition, the claim data for each member was trended to 2015 and a utilization adjustment was made to scale claims to the appropriate cost sharing level. The reinsurance formula was applied by membe r, and the result was divided by total paid claims on the same adjusted basis. This process was done to estimate a reinsurance recovery factor for each plan metal level. The final composi te factor above was developed based upon our expected mix of Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platin um business. The reinsurance recovery estimated in 2014 was 14% for Indiana. Therefore, t his results in an estimated rate impact of 7.6% over the prior year. Reinsurance Contributions: The Reinsurance Program is funded by a fee of $3.67 per member per month. We have increased our expected claim cos ts within our pricing development by 0.9% in order to cover this fee. In order to maintain co mpliance with the required relativity of prices by age, we have applied the adjustment on a multipl icative basis. Our adjustment factor was developed by dividing $3.67 by the expected total p er member per month claim costs in the state. 10. Non-Benefit Expenses and Profit & Risk The table below lists the expected Non-Benefit Expe nses and Target Profit for Assurant Health in Indiana. The pricing load to cover these expenses i s applied consistently across products and plans, as displayed in the work-up of the plan adju sted index rate. These items are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 11 Expense Category % of Premium General and Administrative 12 .0% Commissions and Sales Bonus 5.0 % Managed Care and Cost Containment 2.5 % Quality Improvement 0.9 % Net Investment Income -2.5% Taxes, Fees and State Assessments 2.2 % ACA Health Insurer Fee 1.7 % Federal Income Taxes 3.0% Profit and Risk Margin (After Tax) 3.0% Total 27.8 % Total Used in Pricing 26.5 % Our priced for loss ratio is 73.5% in Indiana, whic h is approximately an 80% Medical Loss Ratio as defined by the ACA. The calculation of the Medic al Loss Ratio is shown in the Projected Loss Ratio section. The final priced for Total Non-Benef it Expenses and Profit is 26.5%. However, as demonstrated in the table above, our projected 2015 total non-benefit expenses and profit are 27.8%. This will result in an actual margin for ris k and profit that is lower than the target shown above. In addition, please note that expenses for each fun ctional area within the company are recorded at a nationwide level. Expense assumptions for a st ate and product are allocated and represented on a percent of premium basis. This per cent of premium representation of expenses is consistent with our actual to expected loss ratio pricing methodology. Administrative Expense Loads: General and Administrative Expenses: This category accounts for the expenses of administering the business, such as claim payment expenses. The assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative t o actual revenue. In developing this expense assumption, underwriting expenses were adjusted due to the reduction of staff within the underwriting functional area that occurred in respo nse to the 2014 market rules. Commissions and Sales Bonus: This is a variable expense that represents the cos t of acquiring business. Our commission schedules and bonus campai gns will be set to 5.0% of premium. Managed Care and Cost Containment Expenses: This is a variable expense that accounts for expenses incurred in order to reduce claims costs, such as access fees paid to the Preferred Provider Organization Networks that are leased on b ehalf of our customers. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue. Quality Improvement Expenses: This category accounts for expenses incurred in or der to improve the quality of healthcare. Quality Improvem ent Expenses are added to claim payments in the Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. This expense assumption was derived from actual expenses in 2013 relative to actual revenue and adj usted to account for additional QI expenses expected in 2015. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 12 Net Investment Income: This category accounts for investment income earne d on reserves and surplus. This assumption was derived from our actua l current net investment income ratio. Profit & Risk Margin: Our targeted after tax margin for risk and profit i s 3% of premium. The pricing load for this 3% after tax margin is applie d consistently across products. Taxes and Fees: Health Insurer Fee: $8 billion will be collected na tionally for this fee in 2014 and $11.3 billion in 2015. The fee is based on our shar e of the total market premium. It is estimated that this fee will be 1.7% of premium. Furthermore, this fee is not deductible from federal income taxes. State Premium Taxes and Assessments: This is estimated at approximately 2.2% of premium based upon 2013 experience. An adjustment was made to historical experience in order to reduce any Comprehensive Health Association assessm ents. In addition, an adjustment of approximately 0.05% has also been made to account f or the $2 per member per year PCORI fee. The minimal impact of the $0.08 per member per mont h Risk Adjustment Program administration fee has been removed from this secti on and is included in the projected risk adjustment per the Part III Actuarial Memo and Cert ification Instructions. Income Taxes: Federal Income Taxes are expected to be 3% of prem ium, calculated as ((6% + 1.7%) X 40%), where 6% is the pre-tax profit margin , 1.7% is the non-deductible ACA health insurer fee cost and 40% is an approximation of the federal income tax rate for Assurant Health. Please note that our effective federal income tax r ate is expected to be greater than the standard 35% due to the non-deductibility of certai n internal and external individual compensation. This non-deductible compensation is p rimarily incurred within non-health insurance lines of business from our parent company , Assurant, Inc. Exchange User Fees: Assurant will issue business both on and off the e xchange in this state in 2015. To determine the exchange fee, we calculated the percentage of our 2015 projected membership that is expected to come from the exchan ge and multiplied it by the 3.5% user fee. The resulting market average user fee in this state is 1.7%. In accordance with the Part III instructions, this fee is applied to the index rate to calculate the market adjusted index rate. For template purposes, it is included in the Taxes and Fees. For further detail on our exchange membership proje ction methodology, please see the membership projection section below. 11. Projected Loss Ratio The projected future loss ratio for the period of 1 /1/2015 through 12/31/2015 is 73.5%. Our premium rate was developed by dividing projected in curred claims by the priced for loss ratio. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 13 Our priced for loss ratio is 73.5% in Indiana, whic h is approximately an 80% Medical Loss Ratio as defined by the Affordable Care Act. A calculatio n of the projected Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) is shown below: MLR = (Claims + Quality Improvement Expense) / (Pr emium - Taxes and Fees) = ( A + B + C) / (D - E - F - G) = (73.5% + 0.9% + 1%) / - 2.1%) = 80% Where: A is Incurred Claims, net of Reinsurance and Risk Adjustment Transfers B is Expenses for Improvement in the Quality of He althcare C is an adjustment due to the state level aggregat ion of the MLR calculation D is premium E is state premium taxes and other assessments and fees F is the Health Insurer Fee G is Federal Income Taxes (excluding taxes on prof it due to Investment Income) The 1% adjustment due to the state level aggregatio n of the MLR calculation, which is labeled C above, is included because of the inherent statisti cal fluctuation expected in state level loss ratios. State level MLRs will vary from 80%, even i f our total nationwide MLR comes in exactly as priced for at 80%. Therefore, pricing to an 80% MLR will lead to a necessity to pay rebates in certain states. This will result in a post rebate l oss ratio above 80% on a nationwide basis. A hypothetical example is illustrated below. State Premium Claims Loss Ratio Credibility Adjustment Rebates Post Rebate Loss Ratio A 100 75 75% 3% 2 77% B 100 85 85% 0% 0 85% Total 200 160 80% 2 81% In order to mitigate this situation, we made a 1% a djustment to our priced for loss ratios. If applicable, rebates will be paid to customers in ac cordance with federal regulations and based upon actual experience. 12. Single Risk Pool and Index Rate The single risk pool reflects all covered lives for every non-grandfathered product/plan combination for this state and market. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 14 The Index Rate is the estimated total allowed claim s per member per month for all non- grandfathered plans for all essential health benefi ts within the state. This figure does not include adjustments for Reinsurance, Risk Adjustmen t transfers, or exchange user fees. There are no material covered benefits in excess of the E ssential Health Benefits. Please see Appendix A for detail on the projected 2015 Index Rate calcu lation. Also, please see the Market Adjusted Index Rate and Plan Adjusted Index Rate Explanation Sections below for details on how rates are calculated relative to the Index Rate. The experien ce used to develop the projected index rate includes the experience of transitional plans. 13. Market Adjusted Index Rate The Market Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as th e Index Rate adjusted for all allowable market-wide modifiers defined in the market rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(1). These adjustments include: Federal reinsurance program Risk adjustment Exchange user fee Please see section 9 of this memo for a description of the reinsurance and risk adjustment. Please see section 10 of this memo for a descriptio n of the exchange user fee adjustment. The calculation of the Market Adjusted Index Rate can b e found in Appendix A. 14. Plan Adjusted Index Rate The Plan Adjusted Index Rate is calculated as the M arket Adjusted Index Rate adjusted for all allowable plan level modifiers defined in the marke t rating rules, 45 CFR Part 156, \u00a7156.80(d)(2). These adjustments are described below. The calcula tion of the Plan Adjusted Index Rate can be found in the attached rate exhibits. Actuarial Value and Cost Sharing: o Actuarial Value - Please see section 17 of this memo for a descrip tion on how the actuarial values were calculated. o Paid to Allowed Leveraging Factor - Please see section 8 of this memo for a description on how the paid to allowed leveraging f actor was calculated. o Utilization - We expect that richer benefits in 2015 will indu ce utilization for healthcare services that is higher than the average utilization within our base experience. We assume that future Silver plans will have utilization that is 3% higher than our average current experience, Gold wi ll be 8% higher, and Platinum will be 15% higher. These factors are the prescribed HHS induced utilization factors used in the HHS risk adjustment calculations. o Dependent Factor - The dependent factor was developed to spread the cost of covering 4 or more dependents under 21. This facto r is constant across all plans. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 15 o Non-tobacco User Adjustment - The non-tobacco user factor is used to put the market adjusted index rate on a non-tobacco basis. This factor is consistent across all plans. The tobacco calibration factor i s the reciprocal of the following calculation: (Non tobacco Member Months + Tobacco Membe r Months * Tobacco Load) Total Member Months Provider Network - PPO factors were developed using internal compan y discount experience in conjunction with reported discounts f rom the network. The factors reflect the difference from the average discount in the sta te. Catastrophic Plan Adjustment - For the catastrophic plan, we continue to assume the population will almost entirely consist of consumer s under age 30, thus, the younger consumers on this plan will not need to subsidize o lder consumers. Therefore, to develop our Catastrophic Plan adjustment factor, we have estimated and removed the impact to the 18-30 year old price that was specifi cally due to the change from our current age slope to the new state specified 3:1 ag e slope. We believe that the hardship exemption will have little to no effect on the cata strophic population so we have not made an adjustment for it. Administrative Costs - The administrative cost factor is the reciprocal of our projected loss ratio. Please see section 11 for a description on how our projected loss ratio was calculated. The administrative cost factor is cons tant across all plans. 15. Calibration a. Age Curve Calibration The age curve calibration is used to adjust Plan Ad justed Index Rate to our projected age. The age curve calibration is calculated as: 2015 Projected Age Curve Factor 2013 Average Age Curve Factor The 2015 projected age curve factor is calculated w ith the state projected average age of 36. The 2013 average age curve factor is the standa rd age curve weighted by the 2013 membership distribution in the state. The age curve calibration is applied uniformly to all plans and is demonstrated in Appendix A. The risk p ool weighted average age was determined using the membership projection, which i s described in further detail below. b. Geographic Factor Calibration The rating area factors used in our 2014 pricing we re used in the development of factors for 2015. To calibrate, we first used 2013 membersh ip and balanced the overall state area factor to a 1.0 to get the area factors on the basis of our 2013 pricing experience Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 16 period. Secondly, we used the projected 2015 member ship by rating area and re- weighted the area factors again to determine the pr ojected state average. The resulting state average factor in this state was 0.998. This market wide calibration factor is then applied after the determination of the plan adjuste d index rates and the individual area factors are divided by it to calibrate the market a verage back to a 1.0. The table below shows the resulting weighted averag e geographic factor of 1.000 for the state along with relativity factors for each rating area within the state and their corresponding projected member distributions. Rating Area 2015 IM Member Distribution 2015 Weighted IM Area Factors 1 21.0 % 0.9 6 2 6.7 % 0.9 4 3 2.0 % 0.9 1 4 2.4 % 1.01 5 3.1 % 0. 97 6 1.6 % 0.9 6 7 5.6% 1.08 8 3.3% 0.96 9 3.0% 1.07 10 21.6% 1.09 11 7.4% 1.04 12 3.9% 0.91 13 6.6% 1.04 14 2.8% 0.9 3 15 3.3% 0.9 0 16 2.3% 1.03 17 3.4% 0. 99 Total 100% 1.00 16. Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is the final pre mium rate for a plan that is charged to an individual or family. The Consumer Adjusted Premium Rate is developed by calibrating the Plan Adjusted Index Rate to the age curve and geography then applying the rating factors specified by 45 CFR Part 147, \u00a7147.102. These rating factors are de scribed below. The rating factors can be found in the attached rate exhibit file. Area Factors - Area factors were developed using internal compa ny pre-discounted allowed claim experience. In areas that were less than 100% credible, internal experience was supplemented with consultant data. The Area factor is constant across all plans and is Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 17 balanced to equal 1.0 in total for the state, as de scribed above. Age Factors - The age curve used to set the age factors is the standard age curve set by HHS. The age factors are set relative to the projected a verage age used in the age curve calibration above. Tobacco Status - A regression based on nationwide 2012 and 2013 e xperience was used to calculate a composite smoker factor of 1.20. The no n-tobacco user factor is 1.0. 17. AV Metal Values The HHS Actuarial Value Calculator (AVC) was used t o generate the AV values and metal values for the majority of the plans in our portfolio. The re are a select number of Assurant Health plans that use an acceptable alternative methodology to g enerate AVs. The methodology used to develop these plans' AVs is detailed below. Please note that these are the same adjustments that were used in our prior filing, which we feel i s appropriate given that the AVC has not been updated. 1. Specialty High-Cost Drugs Applicable Plans: Bronze 4, Bronze 5 Specialty Drugs for Assurant Health plans with a se parate Rx deductible/coinsurance will go towards the medical deductible/coinsurance. The HHS AVC does not allow for the user to specify that specialty drugs should go to the medical deduc tible and coinsurance when inputting a plan design with a separate drug deductible. The followi ng is a table detailing the average cost and scripts from the Bronze Rx continuance table in the HHS AVC: Rx Category Avg Cost per EE Avg Scripts % of Total Scripts Generics $178.03 5.94 59.2% 10.04 100% Since the frequency of specialty high-cost drugs is very low compared to the other drug categories, I am certifying that the impact of the specialty high-cost drugs being subject to medical deductible/coinsurance instead of drug dedu ctible/coinsurance will be insignificant to the AV. 2. Rx Brand Deductible Accumulation Applicable Plans: Bronze 4, Bronze 5 Based on the documentation in the HHS AVC, services that have both deductibles and copays will be valued as though the copay is paid first, w ith the remainder going towards the Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 18 deductible. However, for our plans with a separate drug deductible, the copays will only apply after the deductible is reached. To account for thi s, we have determined the equivalent coinsurance rate for the brand drugs and used that in place of the brand copays. Plan Brand Copay (pref/non -pref) AV w/ no Rx /$ 75 62. 61%/61% Bronze 5 $50 /$ 62. 8% 61%/61% 3. Office Visit Limits Applicable Plans: Bronze 2, Silver 2, Silver 4 Office visit copay limits for Assurant Health plans will apply to primary care and specialty care office visits in total. The HHS calculator only all ows for the user to apply copay limits to primary care visits. The average frequencies for office vis its from the bronze and silver copay limits are detailed below: Avg Freq uency - PCP Avg Frequency - SP Total PCP % of Total Bronze Combined Table 1.36 0.90 2.26 60% Silver Combined Table 1.57 0.94 2.51 63% Assumed PCP % of Total 60% Using the assumption that 60% of office visits are primary care, the table below details the number of visits that would be primary care vs. spe cialty for a 4 total visit limit and a 10 total visit limit. Visit Limit PCP % PCP Visits SP Visits 4 60% 2 2 10 60% 6 4 Therefore, for a plan with a 4 copay limit, a 2 cop ay limit was inputted for primary care, and likewise for a 10 visit limit, a 6 copay limit was inputted. The value calculated below for the Bronze 2 plan was subtracted from the HHS AV to acc ount for the visit limits on specialty care. For the silver plans, moving from an unlimited PCP copay to a 4 copay limit has a negligible effect on the AV. Therefore, I am certifying that t he AV impact of a specialist copay limit on the Silver 2 and Silver 4 plans will be insignificant. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 19 Bronze 2 59.0% AV Unlimited $35 PCP Copay (b) AV 2 Visit $35 Copay (c) 60. 2% Impact of No copay to unlimited (d = b -a) 2.3% Impact of No copay to X visit limit (e = c -a) 1.2% Net Impact (f = (d -e)/d) 48% AV Unlimited $35 SP Copay (g) 60. 5% Est. AV Impact of 2 Visit SP Limit (h = -(g -a)*f) -0.7% Plan AV Impact Bronze 2 -0.7% Silver 2 0.0% Silver 4 0.0% 4. $500 First Dollar D/X/L Benefit Applicable Plans : Silver 3, Silver 4 Assurant Health will have two silver plans that hav e a $500 first dollar Lab and X-Ray benefit. In order to evaluate the actuarial value of this benef it, a new continuance table had to be created since the HHS AVC cannot calculate the impact of fi rst dollar benefits. The claim cost basis was selected as the actuarial continuance tables of the HHS AVC. The continuance tables of the HHS actuarial tables are comprised of claim costs segregated by service category, plus an allowance for additional claim costs expected from high risk pools. Continuance tables were built to remove the additio nal cost of the high risk tables. The value added to the tables was a set dollar amount, withou t allocation to the separate service category claim costs. Two aggregate tables were built, one r eflecting all service categories and the second reflecting all service categories without Lab and X -Ray, both of these tables excluding the high risk pool additional costs. Expected claim costs were developed for each metal level at a deductible level that generates the prescribed metal actuarial value, with an integ rated medical and drug deductible. A continuance table of Lab and X-Ray benefits was b uilt from data from Milliman. The table was adjusted so that total claim costs of Lab and X-ray benefits were equal to the amount of claims for Lab and X-Rays under each metal benefit level. The continuance table was split into professional and technical by the use of a level pr oportion across all average claim levels. The continuance table was utilized to derive a $500 first dollar coverage benefit. Remaining claims were then applied to the base plan deductibl e. Each metal plan continuance table was relied on to derive this value. Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 20 Below are the calculations of the $500 first dollar lab and X-ray benefit resulting from the process described above: Silver 3 Silver 4 Claim Cost of Plan at Metal Level (a) $3,136 $2,889 - includes all medical and pharmacy benefits Claim Cost of Plan at Metal Level (b) $2,854 $2,617 - no benefits for Lab and X-Ray Value of Lab and X-Ray (c) $164 $164 - first dollar benefits, up to $500 Additional Value of Lab and X-Ray, applied against deductible (d) $166 $154 - includes an estimate of impact of deductible New Estimate of Medical Claim Cost e = (b+c+d) $3,183 $2,935 Rider Add-on Cost Plans Affected plans: 1-Ded Bronze 1, 1-Ded Bronze 2 The One Deductible product design consists of a sin gle family deductible for plans with more than 1 member. The scope of this product design is outside those allowed by the HHS AVC. A HHS continuance table was adjusted that replicate d results of the Bronze level AV's from the HHS AVC, using an integrated deductible. This Bronze-like continuance table was conjugated w ith itself to represent the expected claims of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 members under a unified fami ly deductible. Expected member-level AV's are then developed from an inputted plan design, for each of seven different continuance tables. An aggregate pl an level Actuarial Value is developed from a business weighting by family size. The following ta ble shows the calculation of the aggregate. Plan AV Impact Silver 3 1.5% Silver 4 1.6% Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 21 Nu mber of Members Mix of Business 1-Ded Bronze 1 AV's for Assurant Health is included in Appendix C. Screenshots of the AV calculations can be found in Appendix D. 18. AV Pricing Values The AV pricing values include the AVs, calculated as described above, in addition to an adjustment for utilization differences we expect du e to plan cost sharing design. While we understand the difficulty in differentiating increa sed utilization from an increased risk profile, we do feel it is appropriate to adjust lower member cost sharing plans for increased utilization. In the Actuarial Value Calculator Methodology docum ent released by HHS, HHS states that spending is affected by plan design through induced demand, and they in turn have explicitly differentiated and estimated the impact of induced utilization by metal level. An internal study has confirmed that induced utilization is relevant and suggests that the HHS defined induced utilization factors may be conservative. Results fr om the internal study are as follows. Bronze Plan Liability Risk Score Allowed Per Member Per Year LOB < $5,000 Ded (a) >= $5,000 Ded (b) Increase (c=a/b-1) < $5,000 Ded (d) >= $5,000 Ded (e) Increase Induced 17% $ 2,897 $ 2,059 41% 20% Since we don't have enough credibility to determin e separate induced utilization factors for each metal level, we are applying the prescribed HH S induced utilization factors used in the HHS risk score to our plans. The other values used in determining the plan adjus ted index rate are explained in the applicable section above. Please see the attached r ate exhibits for the portion of the value that is due to the allowed plan modifiers.

Our projection of 2015 member months was developed by combining the following pieces of information: 2014 open enrollment sales and expected 2015 open e nrollment sales Policies that have rolled to an ACA compliant plan through 4/1/2014 Policies that we expect to roll to an ACA compliant plan through the end of 2014. Qualified Life Event sales outside of open enrollme nt expected each year We modeled the membership on a monthly basis throug h the end of 2015 using our monthly lapse rates by metal level and expected roll date f or every policy within the state that is not yet on an ACA compliant plan. The expected member count during 2015 for each month is then added up to arrive at the total member months expec ted in 2015. Any differences between the current distribution of projected member months and current metallic membership distribution would be attributed to any metallic rolls during th e year and additional exchange sales, if applicable. The projected percentage of total membership in IN for cost sharing subsidies in 2015 is 42.0%. The table below outlines the specific member projec tion for each subsidy level. We relied on data from the Wakely National Risk Adjustment Repor ting Project regarding exchange enrollment to develop the percentage of projected m embership within each metallic/subsidy level. After determining the total expected exchang e sales/members within IN in 2015, we then multiplied that amount by exchange experience repor ted to Wakely to arrive at the expected members within each metallic/subsidy level. Plan Type Member Projection % of Total Exchange Business Silver - 100% - 150% Products Non-grandfathered products on forms TIM.CER.IN, 227 , 244, and 554 are being discontinued beginning 1/1/14.

Warning Alerts A description of the warning alerts from the unifie d rate review template is below: 1. A warning appears because the index rate for the pr ojection period that we entered in worksheet 1 cell V44 is greater than the projected allowed experience claims calculated in worksheet 1 cell V32 of the URRT. We feel that this difference is justified because the index rate is using our actual pricing data and methodolo gy, which is slightly different than that used on the unified rate review template. These dif ferences are explained above in the actuarial memorandum. 2. A warning appears because historical rate increases were not entered for our terminated products. The instructions for the unified rate re view template specifically state that these are not required. 23. Effective Rate Review Information Time Insurance Company's Risk Based Capital Ratio f or 2013 is 519.7%. 24. Reliance In developing this rate filing I relied upon inform ation provided by others within my department, as well as on information provided by other departm ents within the organization. I have reviewed this information for reasonableness, and I consider it to be reliable. 25. Actuarial Certification I am a member of the American Academy of Actuaries . To the best of my knowledge and judgment, 1. This rate filing is in compliance with the applicab le laws and regulations concerning premium rate development in this state and the bene fits are reasonable in relationship to premiums. 2. The projected index rate is: a. In compliance with all applicable State and Federal Statutes and Regulations. b. Developed in compliance with the Actuarial Standard s of Practice. c. Reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and the population anticipated to be covered. d. Neither excessive nor deficient. 3. The index rate and only the allowable modifiers as described in 45 CFR 156.80(d)(1) and 45 CFR 156.80(d)(2) were used to generate plan level r ates. 4. The percent of total premium that represents essent ial health benefits included in Worksheet 2, Sections III and IV were calculated in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. To the best of my knowledge, the percent of total premium that represents EHB's Actuarial Memorandum - Indiana - Forms TIM14.POL.IN , TIM14.15.POL.IN, TIM14.15.QHP.POL.IN Page 24 is 100%. 5. The HHS AV Calculator was used to determine the AV Metal Values for all plans shown in Worksheet 2 of the Part I Unified Rate Review Templ ate except for those documented in this memorandum. The AV values for those documented in the memorandum were developed based on one of the acceptable alternativ e methods and are in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and methodo logies. 6. Premium charged is identical for same rating charac teristics both on and off the exchange. Identical rate exhibits are used for calculating th e premium. 7. Plans offered off the exchange are not eligible for a Premium Tax Credit.

If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e. Coverage arranged by or through any trustee, union, employer or association. f.

Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 55 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group co verage. i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. j. Medical coverage under automobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law. Plan do es no t include any of the following: a. An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. TIM14. 15.QHP. COB. XX Page 56 [01/2015 EHB Plan ] [v4.21] 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1.

If benefits are available through any other Plan, We will take those benefits into account in calculating the amount of Covered Charges that may be payable by Us so that benefits from both Us and any other Plan are limited t o the actual charges Incurred. If a Covered Person is entitled to benefits provided by another Plan but does not claim them, We will consider the benefits to which a Covered Person is entitled as benefits that were provided. All claims should be submitted to Us and all other Plans at the same time so that proper benefits can be determi ned and paid. Definitions In addition to any specific terms that are defined under the Definitions section, the following capitalized terms are used in this section and have the meanings given below: 1. Allowable Charge: An Allowable Charge is any charge w hich is a Covered Charge under this plan and is, at least in part, covered under any other Plan . If a Plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, We will determine a reasonable cash value for each service that is provided and that cash value will be considered the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the other Plan . The difference between an Acute Medical Facility's semi -private room rate and private room rate is not an Allowable Charge unless the private room is Medically N ecessary. Benefit reductions due to failure to comply with Plan provisions of the Primary Plan are not an Allowable Charge . If both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan have contractual discount arrangements, the Allowable Charge will be determined by applying the greater of the two discounts. 2. Coordination of Benefits (COB): Coordination of Benefits (COB) means that benefits are paid so that no more than 100% of the Allowable Charges for which the Covered Person is liable will be covered under the combi ned benefits received from all Plans. 3. Insured: The person in whose name the Plan is in force. 4. Plan: Any Plan which provides medical or dental benefits or services including, but not limited to: a. Group, non- group (individual) , blanket or franchise insurance that provides major medical benefits. b. Group -type insurance which can be obtained and maintained only as the result of membership in or connection with a specific group or organization. c. A service plan or contract, group or individual practice or other prepayment plan. d. Any employer or employee self -insurance plan. e. Coverage arranged by or through any trustee, union, employer or association. f.

Health coverage, whether issued or administered on a group or individual basis. h. Group Blue Cross, group Blue Shield, group practice or prepaid group co verage. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 52 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] i. Coverage under trust or association plans or plans sponsored by unions, employer groups, or employee benefit groups. j. Medical coverage under automobile or no fault insurance, if coordination of benefits with such coverage is allowed by law. Plan do es no t include any of the following: a. An accident insurance plan. b. Medicaid. c. A group hospital indemnity insurance plan of $500 per day or less. d. A plan covering only ancillary benefits. e. A limited benefit insurance plan. 5. Primary Plan: A Plan in which benefit s must be determined without considering the benefits of any ot her Plan. A Plan is primary if: a. The Plan either has no rules for determining the order of benefits or has rules which differ from the rules in this plan ; or b. According to the Order of Benefit D etermination provision, the Plan considers its benefits first. 6. Secondary Plan: A Plan in which benefits are determined after the benefits of the Primary Plan have been determined. How Benefits Are Paid If We are the Primary Plan, according to the Order o f Benefit Determination provision in this section, We will pay benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. If We are the Secondary Plan, according to the Order of Benefit Determination provisi on below, We will pay the lesser of: 1. The difference between the Allowable Charge and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or 2. Benefits for Covered Charges that would have been paid under this plan without regard to this COB section. When We are the Secon dary Plan, the benefits payable under this plan will be reduced to the extent necessary so that when Our benefit payments are added to the benefits payable under all other Plans, they do not exceed the total Allowable Charge for any services or equipment. Order of Benefit Determination The Primary Plan and Secondary Plan are determined by using the following rules . Whichever rule below is the first to apply to the Covered Person's situation is the rule that will be used to determine which Plan is the Prima ry Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. 1. A Plan that does not have a COB provision, or has a provision that differs from this one, pays its benefits first. TIM14. 15.COB. XX Page 53 [01/2014 EHB Plan ] 2. A Plan that covers the person as the Insured pays its benefits before a Plan that covers the perso n as a dependent. 3. For a child whose parents are not divorced or separated: a. The Plan of the parent whose birthday (month and day only) falls earlier in the year pays its benefits first . It does not matter which parent is older. b. If both parents have the same birthday (month and day only), the Plan covering the parent for the longer time period pays its benefits first. c. If one Plan has this birthday rule and the other Plan does not and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, t he Plan that does not have the birthday rule pays its benefits first. 4. For a child whose parents are separated or divorced: a. If a court decree establishes which parent is responsible for the child's medical or dental expenses, the Plan of that parent pa ys its benefits before any other Plan that covers the child as a dependent . This applies only if the Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. b. Otherwise, the Plan of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Pl an of the spouse of the parent with custody; and the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays its benefits before the Plan of the parent without custody. c. If a court decree establishes joint custody, without stating which one of the parents is responsible for the medical or dental expenses of the child, the Plans covering the child will follow the rules in item 3 above. 5. A Plan that covers the person as the I nsured, who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such an Insured pays i ts benefits before those of a Plan covering the person as a laid off or retired Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured. However, if the other Plan does not have this rule and, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule does not apply. 6. If a person is covered under a right of continuation pursuant to federal or state law and is also covered under another Plan, the Plan covering the person as the Insured or as a dependent of such an Insured pays its benefits before the Plan providing the continued coverage. 7. If none of the above rules apply, the Plan covering the person for the longer time pays its benefits first. Rights Under This Section We have the right to: 1. Release or obtain claim information from any Plan, individual or entity. 2. Pay Our covered benefits to any Plan or entity which has paid benefits that We should have paid. TIM14. 15.COB.
