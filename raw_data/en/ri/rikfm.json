I think we both agree the story of transformation that our guest shares is nothing short of miraculous, but not because of some random happenstance, but because of a desire to live beyond her circumstances and cultivate an environment for her and her family to thrive. We invited Marilee Nelson, co-founder of [Branch Basics](http://branchbasics.com/partner/caroline/), to join us on the podcast and share her incredible story of healing. Marilee shares her journey from a very ill young adult told there was no hope for her unknown condition and she'd never conceive, to overcoming the odds using food as medicine and finding the healing power of a non-toxic environment. With a child damaged by illegal pesticides, Marilee shares how she learned first hand how chemicals and pesticides in the home and daily environment impact the growth and behavior of a child and how making proactive changes to decrease exposure changed their lives forever. It's really hard to put into words just how impactful this episode will be on those who listen. Her story embodies courage, bravery and what can be done when you challenge the status quo and dig deeper to find answers and understanding to the health problems (both known and unknown) that are plaguing families today. Whether you are a college student, pregnant woman, new mom, career woman, empty nester or anyone living in today's world, this episode is for you. As we uncover in today's episode, ignorance is far from bliss, especially when it comes to your and your family's health. We hope that Marilee's story and passion will serve to inspire you to make simple, yet life changing actions that will positively impact your health and those of generations to come.
