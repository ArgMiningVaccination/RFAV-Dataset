Presentation of HUMEX TOUX DRY OXOMEMAZINE SUGAR-FREE SYRUP 150ML 150 ml syrup. advice Usually occurring in the context of respiratory infections, coughing is one of the frequent reasons for consulting a doctor. Defined as an expiration reflex allowing to clear the respiratory tract of secretions, coughing can also be accompanied by annoying, even aggravating symptoms. Unlike the fatty cough which is accompanied by mucus or sputum loaded with infectious agents, the dry cough does not reject anything. However, it reflects inflammation in the lungs. Propolis as a natural cough suppressant Propolis is an excellent natural cough suppressant. Indeed, this dietary supplement which exists in the form of syrup, chewing gum or spray is both naturally anti-infectious and antioxidant. Very often, food supplements based on propolis also combine essential oils against cough (Eucalyptus, Scots pine and thyme in particular) and plants (plantain, white broth, marshmallow, agrimony, etc.).

[GLOSSARY] [(summary)] eye, allowing clear vision close up. Presbyopia is the most common disorder of accommodation; some drugs such as atropine may cause passenger accommodation problems. [adenoma of the prostate]Increase in the volume of the prostate gland located under the bladder of man. This increase in volume is benign, has no relationship to cancer, but can interfere with the passage of urine into the urethra through the gland. Symptoms that suggest the presence of a prostate adenoma are: - difficulty urinating (slowness, weakness of the spray); - the need to get up several times at night to urinate; - urges to urinate imperiously and difficult to control. [agranulocytosis]Disappearance of white blood cells. This serious condition prevents the body from reacting to infections. It is most often due to the toxicity of a drug on the bone marrow, where the blood cells are made. [alcohol]General name designating a family of substances that have the property of being able to be mixed with water and fatty substances. The most common alcohol is ethyl alcohol (ethanol), but there are many other alcohols: methanol, butanol, etc. The degree of alcoholic solution corresponds to the volume of pure alcohol present in 100 ml of solution, knowing that 1 glass of wine or 1/2 of beer (25 cl) contains about 8 g of alcohol. When alcohol is used as an antiseptic, an unpleasant odor denaturant is often added to prevent drinking. Contrary to a widespread belief, alcohol at 70o (or even 60o) is a better antiseptic than alcohol at 90o. [allergy]Skin reaction (itching, pimples, swelling) or general discomfort occurring after contact with a particular substance, use of a medication, or ingestion of food. The main forms of allergy are eczema, urticaria, asthma, angioedema and allergic shock (anaphylactic shock). Food allergy can also result in digestive disorders. [antecedent]Affection healed or always in evolution. The antecedent may be personal or family. The background is the history of a person's health. [antidepressants]Medication that works against depression. Some antidepressants are also used to combat obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety, certain rebellious pain, enuresis, etc. Depending on their mode of action and adverse effects, antidepressants are divided into different families: imipraminic antidepressants, selective or non-selective MAOIs. Finally, other antidepressants do not belong to any of these families, because they possess original properties. The mode of action of antidepressants has two main aspects: the relief of moral suffering and the fight against inhibition which removes all will to action from the depressed. There may be a time lag between these two effects: moral suffering may persist, while the capacity for action reappears. During this short period, the risk of suicide in some depressed people can be increased. The physician takes it into account in its prescription (possible association with a tranquillizer) and it must imperatively be respected. [antihistamine]Medication that opposes different effects of histamine. Two main types exist: antihistamines type H1 (antiallergic) and type Some antihistamines of type H1 are sedative, others do not alter vigilance. [atropine]Medication with effects similar to those of atropine. Atropinics fight spasms and diarrhea. Adverse effects of atropinic drugs include: thickening of bronchial secretions, dry mouth and membranes, constipation, risk of urine blockage and acute glaucoma in susceptible persons, accommodation disorders, abnormal sensitivity to light by dilation of the pupil. Taking several atropine medicines increases the risk of adverse effects. In the event of overdose or accidental ingestion, the following signs may also appear: red and warm skin, fever, acceleration of breathing, fall or, on the contrary, elevated blood pressure, agitation, hallucinations, poor coordination of movements. Emergency care should be given to your doctor or, if not available, call 15, 112 or an emergency medical service. In addition to atropine and its derivatives, other drugs have atropine effects: imipraminic antidepressants, some antihistamines, antispasmodics, antiparkinsonian and neuroleptic. [epilepsy]A chronic seizure disorder associated with abnormal electrical activity of a group of brain cells. Its manifestations, varying in intensity, range from the sudden drop in attention (absences, or small evil) to loss of consciousness accompanied by abnormal muscle movements (convulsions, or great evil). Partial epilepsy, as its name implies, does not concern the whole body: the jerky movements only touch one or more muscle groups. [glaucoma]Disease characterized by increased pressure of the fluids contained in the eye (intraocular hypertension). This general term covers two totally different affections: - Open angle glaucoma or chronic glaucoma is the most common; it is generally symptom-free, detected by the measurement of intraocular tension in the ophthalmologist. It does not cause acute seizures, and treatment relies primarily on beta-blocking eye drops. People with open-angle glaucoma should not use cortisone derivatives without prior ophthalmologic advice. - Closed-angle glaucoma or acute glaucoma is more rare. Between seizures, intraocular tension is normal. But the inadvertent use of atropine medicines (especially eye drops) causes an acute crisis of intraocular hypertension which can permanently damage the retina in a few hours. It is an ophthalmological emergency that is recognized by a brutally red eye, horribly painful, hard as a glass ball, and whose vision becomes blurred. Contraindications for atropine medicines are limited to those who have already had closed-angle glaucoma or have been detected by an ophthalmologist. Those who suffer from chronic open angle glaucoma are not affected by these contraindications. [Orthostatic hypotension]Reduced blood pressure when changing from elongated to standing. Due mostly to drugs, orthostatic hypotension results in dizziness with risk of fall, especially in the elderly. These disturbances can be prevented by avoiding sudden changes of position: sit for a few moments at the edge of the bed before standing, slowly rising from a seat, keeping a support before moving. Wearing compression stockings, which prevents blood from flowing back to the legs while standing, is also used to treat orthostatic hypotension. [Hepatic insufficiency]Inability of the liver to perform its function, which is essentially the elimination of some waste, but also the synthesis of many biological substances essential to the body: albumin, cholesterol and coagulation factors (vitamin K, etc.). [renal failure]Inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste or medicinal substances. Advanced renal insufficiency does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine excreted. Only a blood test and creatinine dosage may reveal this disease. [neuroleptics]Family of medicines used in the treatment of certain nervous disorders or various symptoms: digestive disorders, menopausal disorders, etc. [new born]Child less than one month old. [blood count]The count measures the number of red blood cells (red blood cells), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets in the blood. The blood formula specifies the percentage of different white that includes opium and its derivatives. In addition to drugs such as opium or heroin, the opiate family includes morphine (strong analgesic), codeine (antitussive and analgesic) and many other substances. [palpitations]Abnormal perception of irregular heartbeat. [photosensitivity]Abnormal sensitivity of the skin to light or ultraviolet rays due to a drug or a natural or chemical substance. [Allergic reaction]Reaction due to hypersensitivity of the organism to a drug. Allergic reactions can take a wide variety of aspects: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, eruption of pimples resembling measles, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. [sedative] - Quiets, calms down. - sedative can be responsible for drowsiness and increase the effects of alcohol. [symptom]Trouble felt by a person with an illness. The same symptom can translate different diseases and the same disease does not necessarily give the same symptoms in all the patients. [symptomatic treatment]Treatment that suppresses or alleviates the symptoms of a disease without addressing its cause. [dizziness]Symptom that can mean an impression of loss of balance (common sense) or, more strictly, a sense of rotation on oneself or the environment (medical sense).
