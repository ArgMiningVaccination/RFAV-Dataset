Essential oils are highly concentrated natural compounds extracted from plants. They are generally steam distilled from leaves, stems, flowers, bark, roots and other elements of plants. In the distillation process, the most powerful healing compounds of the plant are captured in oil form. Citrus oils are cold pressed from the peels, where most of the nutrients of the fruit are held. HOW TO USE ESSENTIAL OILS Wild Herb Essential Oils are full strength and must be diluted for use. However, our exclusive blends offer the choice of full strength or already diluted spray or roll-on forms.
