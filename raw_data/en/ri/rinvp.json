Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized trial compar- ing an expert-panel-validated, multimodal chiropractic care(CC) intervention plus enhanced usual care (EUC) to EUC alone among 61 adult women with episodic migraine. EUC was comprised of usual medical care and migraine educa-tion literature. Individuals assigned to CC \u00feEUC received up to 10 sessions of CC over 14 weeks. Primary aims assessed feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherenceto the protocol, and adverse events. Secondary aims eval- uated changes in number of migraine days (our main clinical outcome) using daily self-report logs, Migraine DisabilityAssessment (MIDAS), Headache Impact T est (HIT -6), and Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQL).Results: Of the 29 individuals randomized to CC \u00feEUC, 24 individuals (82.8%) attended of chi- ropractic visits. Fifty-seven (93.4%) participants completed daily migraine logs. We observed 98 nonserious adverseevents of which 35 were musculoskeletal complaints and 45 were related to migraine attacks. Those in CC \u00feEUC were more likely to report musculoskeletal complaints(31.0%) compared in EUC (6.3%). Those random- to CC \u00feEUC experienced a change in number of days with migraine from run-in to (meanchange\u00bc/C02.90, /C01.76) 95% MIDAS, HIT -6, and MSQL.Conclusion: Recruitment, retention, and adherence to the interventions are feasible. In addition, we observed prelim- inary evidence of clinically meaningful reductions in migrainefrequency, and improvements in disability and QOL among those assigned to CC \u00feEUC that were greater those assigned to EUC alone. OA01.02 Cost-effectiveness of Spinal Manipulation, Supervised Exercise, or Home Exercise forSpinal Pain in the United States Using anIndividual Participant Data Meta-analysisApproach Brent Leininger 1, Gert Bronfort1, Roni M Kuntz1, and John A Nyman1 1University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota Contact: Brent Leininger, lein0122@umn.edu Abstract Purpose: The aim is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation (SMT), supervised rehabilitation exer- cise (SRE), and home exercise and advice (HEA) for spinal pain.Global Advances in Health and Medicine Volume 9: 1-204!The Author(s) 2020 Article reuse guidelines: sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/2164956120912849journals.sagepub.com/home/gam Creative Commons Non Commercial CC BY -NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distributi on of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.c om/en- us/nam/open-access-at-sage). Methods: We estimated incremental societal and health-care perspectivesusing 8 randomized trials performed in the United States.We used a 2-stage approach to individual participant datameta-analysis with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as theeffectiveness measure. Costs and QALYs from trials com-paring similar interventions were combined, and bootstrapmethods were used to calculate cost-effectiveness accept-ability curves. Results: The analyses included 1739 participants (60% females) with pooled analyses ranging from 380 to 650participants (2-4 trials depending on the comparison). Onaverage, SRE led to higher societal costs relative to HEA($3390; and ICERs above $400 000/QALY. Adding SRE to HEA resulted in a similar ICER.SMT resulted in higher societal costs compared to HE($677; 95% CI: /C0$601 to . Adding SMT costs ( /C0$931;95% CI: /C0$3667 to CI: /C00.005 to 0.020). The SMT to HE is cost-effective is above0.80 if society is willing to pay $100 000 or more per QALY .Adding SMT to SRE led to an additional $340 in societalcosts (95% CI: $214 Results from the health-care perspective were sim-ilar and the only important difference was the ICER for SMTcompared to HEA from decreased to $87 000/QALY. Conclusion: Adding spinal manipulation to home exercise or supervised rehabilitation exercise is likely cost-effectivefor spinal pain. Supervised rehabilitation exercise alone or inaddition to home exercise is not likely cost-effective. OA01.03 Migraineurs' Perceptions of Chiropractic Care: A Qualitative Controlled Trial Migraineurs'Perceptions of Care: AQualitative of RandomizedControlled Center for Integrative Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 2Osher Clinical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts3John Graham Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 4School of Special Education, School Psychology, and Early Childhood Studies, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 5Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston,Massachusetts 6Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 7Osher Clinical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 8Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Julie Connor, jconnor5@bwh.harvard.edu Abstract Purpose: Migraine is a leading cause of disability world- wide. While medications remain the standard of care for migraines, many can have side effects, leading patients to seek complementary and integrative medicine options,including chiropractic care. Preliminary studies suggest chi-ropractic care is a promising nonpharmacologic option formigraineurs as it may address co-occurring neck pain and muscular tension. We sought to understand migraine patients' perceptions of and experience with chiropracticcare. Methods: The parent study was a 2-arm pilot pragmatic randomized controlled trial (N \u00bc61) investigating a com- prehensive multimodal model of chiropractic care for women with episodic migraine (4-13 migraines permonth). Women were randomly assigned to chiropracticcare (10 sessions over 14 weeks) plus enhanced usual care(UC) versus enhanced UC alone. Semistructured interviews were conducted at baseline and 14-week follow-up with 15 randomly selected participants from the 29 participants ran-domized to the chiropractic group. Qualitative analysis wasperformed by 2 independent reviewers using a constantcomparative method of analysis for generating grounded theory.Results: Integrating baseline and follow-up interviews, 3 themes emerged: (1) over the course of treatment withchiropractic care, participants became more aware of the role of musculoskeletal tension, pain, and posture in trig- gering migraine; (2) participants revised their prior concep-tions of chiropractic care beyond \"back-cracking\"; and (3)participants viewed the chiropractor-patient relationship asan essential and valuable component to effectively managing their migraines. These qualitative perspectives on chiro- practic care aligned with results from the main trial whichobserved increases in quality of life and less migraine-related disability. Conclusion: In our pilot study, women with episodic migraine reported learning about musculoskeletal migrainetriggers and ways to manage their migraines through a com-prehensive chiropractic intervention. Combined with the2 Global Advances in Health and Medicineresults from our main trial, these findings suggest chiroprac- tic care as a promising complementary and integrativeapproach for women with episodic migraine. OA01.05 Experiences and Attitudes About Chiropractic Care Versus PrescriptionDrug Therapy Among Patients With SpinalPain Serena Bezdjian 1, James Justin Goehl2, and Contact: Serena Bezdjian, serenabezdjian@scuhs.edu Abstract Purpose: The present study examined spine pain patients' experiences and attitudes toward chiropractic care and pre-scription drug therapy within a primary care setting. Wewere interested in examining whether being treated by a chiropractic doctor (DC) for back pain had an influence on a patient's beliefs and behaviors regarding prescription drugtherapy. Methods: Patients with spine pain (n \u00bc150) were admin- istered an institutional review board-approved patient survey assessing their experiences, beliefs, and attitudes regarding chiropractic care and prescription drug therapy.T wo cohorts of patients were assembled: (1) 75 patientstreated by DC and (2) 75 treated by a primary care physi-cian (PCP). The 30-item patient survey was conducted at anacademic medical center from February 2019 to January2020. Between-group comparisons were examined using v 2analyses and ttests to determine differences in the rates of reporting. Results: Although we observed high rates of satisfaction with chiropractic care received within a primary care set-ting, our results demonstrated that seeing a chiropractordid not change patient attitudes regarding prescription medication. Of note, 79% of DC patients and 45% of PCP patients \"agreed\" that chiropractic care would be a suitabletreatment for back pain (overall between-group differenceswere significant; v 2\u00bc19.65; P<.001). Additionally, 25% of the DC patients \"agreed\" that taking prescription medica-tions for back pain \"made sense\" compared to 41% 7% PCP patients and 23% of the DC patients \"agreed\" that a chiropractor wasthe first health-care provider that they would like to see fortheir general health needs (these rates were also significant-ly different v 2\u00bc7.69; P\u00bc.02).Conclusion: Although patient satisfaction regarding chiro- practic care received for back pain was high, patients\"disagreed\" that seeing a chiropractor changed their beliefsor behaviors toward prescription drug therapy. OA02.01 A Mind-Body Resiliency Intervention for Fear of Recurrence Among CancerSurvivors Daniel Hall 1, Elyse Park1, and Gloria Yeh2 1Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 2Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts Contact: Daniel Hall, hall@mgh.harvard.edu Abstract Purpose/Background: Interventions for fear of recur- rence (FOR) have nominal effects, perhaps due to limitedintegration of empirically supported skills for treating FOR.This trial tested the acceptability and feasibility of anadapted multimodal, mind-body intervention for FORamong survivors of various cancers and assessed longitudi-nal changes in key FOR and coping variables. Methods: Early stage cancer survivors 3 to 30 months posttreatment were recruited to participate in an 8-sessionin-person group program that taught relaxation skills, cog-nitive-behavioral techniques, healthy lifestyle behaviors,mindfulness meditation, and positive psychology skills.Feasibility (enrollment rate, session attendance, surveycompletion, and skills practice) and acceptability (enjoyable-ness, convenience, helpfulness, and relevance) wereassessed. Exit interviews assessed survivors' perceivedchanges. Measures of FOR (FOR, uncertainty intolerance,and cancer-related uncertainty) and coping (perceivedstress, resiliency, positive affect, and coping skills) were col-lected at baseline, postintervention, \u00fe1 month, and \u00fe3 months. Results: Participants (N \u00bc23, response rate 58%) included survivors of 7 common cancer types (M \u00bc12 months post- treatment). Attendance was high (M \u00bc6.1 sessions), and 96% of survivors completed all surveys. Sustained increasesin skills practice were reported (16% to 76% baseline topostintervention, 71% by \u00fe3 months). Survivors rated most sessions (87%) as highly acceptable. Exit interviews revealedcognitive, behavioral, emotional, and existential benefits.Moderate-to-large improvements in FOR severity wereobserved postintervention main- tained over time ( P<.01), with similar changes observed in other FOR and coping outcomes. Conclusion: The adapted mind-body intervention shows promising acceptability, feasibility, and favorable changes inAbstracts 3FOR and coping that persist by 3 months. T esting in a ran- domized trial is warranted. OA02.02 Impact of Integrative Medicine in Patients With Cancer in the BraveNetCollaborative: Results From PRIMIER Donald Abrams 1, Qi Gao2, Jennifer Carroll3, Chris D'Adamo4, Lauren Grossman3, and Jeffery Dusek5 1University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York 3University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado 4University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 5University Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Donald Abrams, donald.abrams@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Patients living with and beyond cancer frequently seek care at integrative medicine practices. Demographics, services utilized and outcomes associated with an integra-tive approach have not been well described. Methods: T o evaluate the real-world utilization and effec- tiveness of integrative interventions in patients with cancer,we analyzed data from the Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Interventions Effectiveness Registry (PRIMIER), a prospective longitudinal study embedded in the BraveNetpractice-based research network. Cancer patients were identified by chief complaint reported on the baseline survey or an ICD code in the electronic medical record.PROMIS-29 was administered at baseline and over 12 months of follow-up. We used linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept to account for repeated measures to estimate changes from baseline on PROMIS-29. Results: A total of 4954 participants were enrolled into PRIMIER from 17 sites over 5 years; 258 (5.2%) unique cancer cases (mean age \u00bc53, 84% female, 89% white) were identified with 3 sites contributing 147 of the partic-ipants. The most frequently reported services received were integrative medicine consult (41%), acupuncture (27%), nutritionist (11%), supplements/botanicals/vitamins(11%), and massage (10%). Significant improvements in anx- iety were seen at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months with significant reduction in fatigue at 2 and 12 months. The perceivedstress score was significantly improved at all evaluated time points. Participants also had significant increases in their patient activation measure levels at 6 and 12 months.Nonsignificant improvements in sleep, depression, and social function were also appreciated. There was no signif- icant change in overall quality of life score.Conclusion: Cancer patients receiving care at integrative medicine clinics experience significant improvements in anx- iety, stress, and fatigue with trends toward benefits in sleep, depression, and social functioning. In view of the difficulty inconducting a randomized, sham-controlled trial, this obser- vational cohort analysis suggests that integrative medicine modalities improve patient-reported outcomes in cancer patients. OA02.03 Mindfulness Mediates the Relationship Between Negative Mind-Body Experiencesand Engagement in Physical Activity in aSample of Young Adult Cancer Survivors David Victorson 1, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 2Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 3Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina Contact: David Victorson, d-victorson@northwestern.edu Abstract Purpose: T o highlight the role of mindfulness as a mediator in the relationship between negative mind-body experien-ces (eg, anxiety, self-judgment, sleep disturbance) and engagement in physical activity in a sample of young adult cancer survivors. Methods: Sixty-three young adult cancer survivors partic- ipated in an institutional review board-approved random- ized clinical trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and were either randomized to the 8-week inter-vention or to a wait list. This analysis pooled baseline to 8- week data from both arms of participants who received MBSR (eg, time 1 and time 2 data for the treatment group; time 3 and time 4 data for wait-list participants). There were no significant differences between each group's respective baseline. Change scores were created for all variables used in the analysis. Mediation analyseswere conducted by first establishing a predictive relation- ship between negative mind-body independent variables (eg, anxiety, self-judgment, sleep disturbance) and the dependent variable, self-reported engagement in physical activity. Next, mindfulness was included as an independent variable to test its hypothesized mediating role. Results: All independent variables significantly predicted engagement in physical activity (self-judgment beta \u00bc/C0.32 P\u00bc.02; anxiety beta \u00bc/C0.31, P\u00bc.01; sleep disturbance beta\u00bc/C0.31,P\u00bc.01). However, all became statistically insig- nificant when mindfulness was included in the model as a mediator. Mindfulness significantly predicted engagement in4 Global Advances in Health and Medicinephysical activity with beta weights ranging from .31 to .36, P<.05. Conclusion: In this analysis, mindfulness mediated the inverse relationship between negative mind-body experien-ces and engagement in physical activity. This supports pre-vious findings that mindfulness may facilitate increased reg- ulation of negative experiences during physical activity through nonreactive tolerance or acceptance of uncomfort-able bodily sensations, emotions, or thoughts, or throughintensifying positive aspects of physical activity (eg, enjoy-ment, satisfaction). Mindfulness may in part contribute toboth short-term increases in physical activity and readiness for longer term positive health behavior change. OA02.04 Suffering in Advanced Cancer: A Randomized Control Trial of a NarrativeIntervention Lucille Meg Wise2, Linda Roberts2, and Ming-Yuan Chih2 1University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 2University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin Contact: Lucille Marchand, lrm19@uw.edu Abstract Purpose: Advanced cancer often engenders existential angst and psychological suffering. Our prior pilot research suggested that seriously ill patients benefited from a narra- tive intervention. It tested miLivingStory, which included atelephone interview to elicit the life and illness story andonline tools to support revising and sharing the narrativemanuscript. 9Our current study (1) tested the effects of miLivingStory, compared to miOwnResources, an active control resources-only website and (2) explored the partic-ipants' use of and satisfaction with miLivingStory comparedto miOwnResources. Methods: Randomized control trial of 86 primarily white, female patients with Stage III or IV cancer. Interventiongroup: miLivingStory with narrative intervention andresources. Control group: miOwnResources with onlinecancer resources only. Measures: Primary outcomes, mea- sured by surveys at baseline, 2 and 4 months, included the peace and meaning subscales of the FACIT -Sp anddepressed, anxious, and angry mood subscales of POMS-SF . Website use and satisfaction data were collected auto-matically and by survey. Analysis: Linear mixed modeling, controlling for baseline primary outcome scores, tested for group comparisons. Pair-wise comparisons tested forwithin- and between-group differences. Descriptivestatistics.Results: At 4 months, miLivingStory had a direct and pos- itive effect for peace (2.86 vs 2.57, P\u00bc.029), a trend effect for lower depressed mood (0.55 vs 0.77, P\u00bc.097). miLivingStory appeared to protect against the controlgroup's steeper decline in well-being between 2 and4 months. The miLivingStory story was assessed as helpfulto quite helpful. Conclusion: This telephone-based narrative intervention with online tools improved advanced cancer patients' well-being and sense of peace, accompanied with their satisfac-tion of the intervention. OA02.05 Acupressure to Reduce Nausea and Vomiting in Youth in Treatment for Canceror Receiving Hematopoietic Stem CellTransplant: A Randomized TrialdespiteImproved Pharmacologic and Vomiting, These SymptomsRemain a Problem for Children,Adolescents, and Young Adults inTreatment for Cancer or Receiving aHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant.

Acupuncture/acupressure is promising nonpharmacologic treatment based on adult data, but there are very few stud- ies in the pediatric setting. Methods: We performed a pragmatic randomized con- trolled trial in participants being treated for cancer orreceiving a HSCT. Participants aged 5 to 24 years at 2 teach- ing hospitals in California were randomized to receive daily acupressure \u00feusual care or usual care alone. Patient- reported symptoms were assessed. A composite scale was created for nausea/vomiting (range: 1-8). Electronic medical record (EMR) data on vomiting, and antiemetics use was collected. Linear mixed models were used to ana- lyze differences, and mixed effects negative binomial regres- sion models were used with log transformed outcomes where needed for linearity assumptions. Results: We enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse sample, n\u00bc95. The composite nausea/vomiting score difference between /C02.3% (95% CI: /C016.5% to \u00fe14.4%, 1.46% (95% used was /C00.001 (95% CI: /C00.38 to \u00fe0.38, P\u00bc1.00). EMR nurse reports on daily vomiting showed the mean difference was 0.033 (95% CI: /C00.52 to \u00fe0.59, P\u00bc.91). Conclusion: We find statistically significant benefits from acupressure for nausea/vomiting for pediatric cancertreatment or HSCT. The decrease in vomiting episodes and the 95% CI for nausea/vomiting score include clinically sig- nificant benefits, suggesting that larger clinical trials are needed to further define potential benefit.OA03.01 Improvement in Depressive Symptoms Following a 12-Week Yoga Intervention Predicts Decreased Inflammation at 24 Weeks: Findings From a NonrandomizedTrial With Obese, Monolingual Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 2Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 3Alas-Wings: Latina Association for Breast Cancer, Chicago, Illinois Contact: David Victorson, d-victorson@northwestern.edu Abstract Purpose: This study examined the association between inflammatory biomarkers and self-reported outcomes of quality of life in a nonrandomized yoga trial with obese, monolingual Spanish-speaking Thirty-five overweight and obese monolingual Spanish-speaking breast cancer survivors completed an institutional review board-approved community-based 12- week yoga intervention. Participants completed Spanish lan- guage PROMIS short forms at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks of physical function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interfer- ence, depression, anxiety, social role satisfaction, and posi-tive affect. We also collected whole blood spots at all time points, which were analyzed using a validated ELISA proto- col. Data analyses included calculation of descriptive statis- tics, Kendall's Tau B correlation, and linear regression. Results: After adjusting for biomarker data outliers, improvements in PROMIS anxiety and sleep disturbance scores at 12 weeks were significantly associated ( P<.05) with decreases in IL-6 at 24 and /C0.26, respec- tively). Improvements in PROMIS anxiety and depression scores at 12 weeks were significantly associated ( P<.05) with decreases in CRP at 24 and /C0.34, respec- tively). Holding previous biomarker change values constant, single linear regression models were examined with 24- week biomarker values as dependent variables, and 12- week PROs of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance as predictor variables. Of these predictors, only improve- ment in 12-week depression scores significantly predicted in 24-week CRP values (Beta Coefficient \u00bc/C0.42, P<.01). Conclusion: This study examined the association between PROMIS short forms and biomarkers of inflammation in a community-based yoga study. We observed small negative associations between improvement in depression, anxiety,6 Global Advances in Health and Medicineand sleep disturbance at 12 weeks and decreased inflamma- tion at 24 weeks. Improvement in depression at 12 weekspredicted decreased CRP at 24 weeks, with a moderate-sized effect. While interpretive caution should be exerciseddue to the study design, this is a positive step toward better understanding the longer term biological effects of yoga in non-English-speaking cancer survivors. OA03.02 Yoga for Chronic Low Back and Neck Pain in Military Personnel Erik Groessl1, 1University of California San Diego/VA San Diego, La Jolla, California 2University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 3University of California San Diego, San Diego, California 4University of Connecticut, Mansfield, Connecticut Contact: Erik Groessl, egroessl@ucsd.edu Abstract Purpose: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) and chronic neck pain (cNP) are prevalent conditions that are leading causesof disability among active-duty military personnel. Y oga is anevidence-based nonpharmacological intervention withdocumented benefits in community samples. However,yoga has not been well-studied among military personnel.We conducted a pilot RCT examining the feasibility/accept-ability of 2 types of yoga for military personnel with CLBP/cNP . Methods: Military personnel with cLBP and/or cNP were recruited at a large military medical facility. Participantswere randomized to either active yoga or restorativeyoga. Participants were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks,and 6 months; were asked to attend 1 to 2 classes weeklyfor 12 weeks; and to conduct daily yoga home practice. Theprimary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rates, inter-vention attendance, retention for assessments includinghealth outcomes, and satisfaction/acceptability. Results: In 7 months, 49 participants were enrolled. Approval to locate a research staff member at the military pain clinic was key to recruitment. Of the 49 randomized, 39 (80%) attended 1 or more yoga classes. An additional 7people participants informed study staff they could notattend further yoga sessions because of deployment,injury, or other health problems. Among those whoattended and did not drop out (65%), the average numberof weeks attended at least 1 /C2was 8.9 (74%). Of all partic- ipants randomized, 57% attended yoga in for 50% or moreof the weeks offered; 42 (86%) participants were assessedat 12 weeks and 39 (80%) were assessed at 6 months. Satisfaction ratings were high, with 80% to 90% stronglyagreeing on \"enjoyed outcomes improved over time. Conclusion: In conclusion, data suggest that researchers can feasibly conduct a larger RCT comparing styles of yogafor cLBP/cNP with active-duty military personnel to confirmhealth benefits and understand what type of yoga ispreferred. OA03.03 Results of Multiple Iterations of a Yoga- Based Training Program for Education andHealth-care Professionals on PsychologicalHealth Natalie Dyer 1, Sara Borden1, Jeffery Dusek2, and Sat Bir Khalsa3 1Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health, Stockbridge, Massachusetts 2University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio 3Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Natalie Dyer, natalieleighdyer@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Our purpose was to assess changes in psycho- logical health in education and health-care professionals that attended separate versions of a yoga-based training program. Methods: The RISE (Resilience, Integration, Self- awareness, Engagement) program includes yoga, meditation,and didactic/experiential activities. We examined results from 4 separate studies of RISE: (1) a single arm trial of a 3-day residential RISE program for New Y ork educationprofessionals (N \u00bc74); (2) a waitlist controlled trial of a 3-day residential RISE program for Massachusetts educationprofessionals (N \u00bc30); (3) a single arm trial of a 6-week on- site program for Harvard attending physicians (N \u00bc12); and (4) a waitlist controlled trial of a 6-week programfor Harvard resident (N MBI, PFI, and PROMIS-ED) were completed before (baseline), immediately after (post), and 2 months after RISE (follow-up). Results: Participants from all 4 studies reported improve- ments in stress from baseline to post and improvements in mindfulness from baseline to follow-up (all P<0.05). Within-group analyses in the two 3-day RISE programs foreducation professionals revealed that participants fromboth studies showed improvements in stress, mindfulness,empowerment, and self-compassion from baseline to post;Abstracts 7and improvements in negative affect, mindfulness, empow- erment, and self-compassion from baseline to follow-up (allP<.05). Within-group analyses in the 6-week RISE pro- grams for health-care professionals revealed that RISE par-ticipants from both studies showed improvements in stress, anxiety, depression, interpersonal disengagement and burn- out from baseline to post; and improvements in interper-sonal disengagement and mindfulness from baseline tofollow-up (all P<.05). Conclusion: Overall, results from all 4 studies suggest that RISE improves education and health-care professionals' psy-chological health. On-going research continues to investi-gate RISE in different populations and programming lengths,intensities, and venues. OA03.04 Perceived Stress Mediates the Effect of Yoga on Quality of Life and Disease Activity in Ulcerative Colitis. Secondary Analysis ofa Randomized Controlled Trial Anna a.koch@kliniken-essen-mitte.de Abstract Purpose: Y oga positively affects health-related quality of life and disease activity in ulcerative colitis. The underlyingmodes of action remain unclear. Within the present study,we hypothesized that patients' perceived stress mediatesthe effects of yoga on health-related quality of life and dis-ease activity. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of yoga to writtenself-care advice in patients with inactive ulcerative colitisand impaired quality life (ClinicalT rials.gov registrationnumber: Perceived stress was assessedusing the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, health-relatedquality of life was measured using the Inflammatory BowelDisease Questionnaire and disease activity captured usingthe Clinical Activity Index. Outcomes were assessed atweeks 0, 12, and 24. Results: Seventy-seven patients participated. Thirty-nine patients attended the 12 supervised weekly yoga sessions(71.8% women; 45 /C613.3 years) and 38 patients written (78.9% women; 46.1 /C610.4 years). Perceived with of life ( r\u00bc/C0.61,P<.001) and disease activity (r\u00bc.33, P<.01) at week 24. Perceived stress at week 12fully mediated the effects of yoga on health-related quality of life (B \u00bc16.23; confidence interval [CI] [6.73, 28.40]) and disease activity (B \u00bc/C0.28; CI [ /C0.56,/C0.06]) at week 24. Conclusion: Our findings confirm the importance of per- ceived stress in reducing disease activity and increasinghealth-related quality of life in patients with ulcerative coli-tis. Practitioners should keep psychosocial risk in mind as arisk factor for disease exacerbation and consider yoga as anadjunct intervention for highly stressed patients with ulcer-ative colitis. OA04.01 Changes in Self-Compassion and Mindfulness in Response to the MARIGOLD Online, Self-PacedIntervention for Adults With DepressiveSymptoms Stephanie Schuette 1, Elizabeth Addington2, and Judith Moskowitz2 1Duke University, Durham, Carolina Chicago, Illinois Contact: Stephanie Schuette, stephanie.schuette@duke.edu Abstract Purpose: Previous work has demonstrated that low self- compassion may serve as a vulnerability factor for depres-sion. The MARIGOLD study comprises an online, self-guided intervention for adults with elevated depressivesymptoms. MARIGOLD incorporates skills to build positive emotion such as formal and informal mindfulness practice, savoring, and gratitude. Herein, we examine whether theintervention increased self-compassion and mindfulness. Methods: Participants were randomized to the interven- tion (n \u00bc539) or an emotion-reporting control group (n\u00bc63) and completed a subset of questions from the 5 Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Short-Form NeffSelf-Compassion Scale at 4 time points: baseline, post inter- vention, 1 month, and 3 months post intervention. We assessed changes in self-compassion using mixed modelregression. Analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 26. Results: Independent samples ttests demonstrated that there were not significant differences in mean self-compassion or mindfulness scores between the interven-tion and control group at baseline t(568)\u00bc.881, P\u00bc.236); t (568)\u00bc.937, P\u00bc. 165. For self-compassion, the interaction between group assignment (intervention vs control) andtime was significant F(3, 984.66) \u00bc5.834, P\u00bc.001. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the intervention showedsignificant increases in self-compassion from baseline topost intervention, P<. 001. Scores were maintained a 1-8 Global Advances in Health and Medicinemonth post and increased slightly again at 3-month follow- up,P\u00bc.03. The control group showed a marginally signifi- cant increase in scores between baseline and 3 months postintervention, P\u00bc.05. For mindfulness, there was a significant effect for time but not group assignment. Significant increases in mindfulness occurred between baseline and post assessment in both the intervention and control groups ( P<.001; P\u00bc.002) but no other time points. Conclusion: Online, self-guided interventions have the potential to increase self-compassion. Further testing may determine whether changes in self-compassion mediate reduction of depressive symptoms. OA04.02 A Pilot Study of Mind-Body Skills Groups for Adolescents With Depression Julie Staples1, Jennifer Garabrant2, Lindsey Jones2, and Michelle Salyers2 1Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, District of Columbia 2Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana 3Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 4The Center for Mind-Body Medicine, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: Julie Staples, julie.k.staples@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: While 13% of adolescents have had at least 1 major depressive episode in the last year, 60% of these youth are untreated. T o increase access and engagement, there is a need for an innovative treatment that can be delivered by a variety of health-care professionals. The pur-pose of this study was to evaluate a Mind-Body Skills Group (MBSG) program for reducing depression symptoms in ado- lescents in primary care clinics. Methods: Adolescents who screened positive for depres- sion in primary care clinics participated in a 10-week MBSGprogram. Participants practiced several skills including med- itation, biofeedback, guided imagery, and mindful eating. The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI-2), Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and the rumination subscale of the Children's Response Styles Questionnaire were adminis-tered at baseline, post intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models that account for clustering of the MBSG participants and repeated measures over time. Results: Participants included 43 adolescents, 79% females, aged 13 to 17 years. The total CDI-2 depression score sig- nificantly improved following the intervention ( /C010.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] [ /C013.6,/C06.5]) of negative ( /C01.4; 95% CI [ /C02.1,/C00.8]). All depression improvements [/C012.3,/C04.6] also significantly improved following the intervention, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. Conclusion: The MBSG intervention resulted in decreased depression and rumination and increased mindfulness. Thisapproach may be an innovative treatment option for depressed adolescents in primary care because it can be delivered in a group setting by a variety of health-care pro-fessionals, thereby increasing access and engagement in treatment. OA04.03 Mind the (Racial) Gap: Considerations for Culturally Adapting Mindfulness-BasedInterventions for Depression Among Blackor African Americans Sarah Sperber 1and Amanda Shallcross1 Purpose: Evidence suggests that mindfulness-based inter- ventions (MBIs) can effectively treat depression. Unfortunately, studies of MBIs for depression have focused predominantly on White samples. Thus, it is unclear wheth- er existing MBIs are culturally relevant or effective for Black or African Americans (AAs). This is a critical question giventhe prevalence of depression and need for effective treat- ment in this community. T o justify culturally adapting evidence-based interventions, at least one of these key con-ditions should be met (1) ineffective clinical engagement, (2) unique risk/resilience factors, and (3) unique symptoms of a common disorder. We aimed to quantitatively ascertain whether these conditions are met in the context of MBIs among Black or AAs at risk for depression. Methods: Black and White adults with elevated stress levels (n \u00bc143) completed inventories to assess domains relevant to each of the above conditions (ie, engagement with and perceptions of mindfulness, depression stigma, coping styles, and depressive symptom profiles). tT est andv 2analyses were conducted to identify whether any of these domains differed by race. Results: Compared to White Americans, Black or AAs (1) were less likely to have heard the term \"mindfulness\"Abstracts 9(P\u00bc.001), had less experience with mindfulness ( P\u00bc.034), and were more likely to perceive mindfulness as a religiouspractice ( P\u00bc.026); (2) scored higher on depression risk factors including depression stigma ( P\u00bc.006), experience of discrimination ( p\u00bc.008), emotion suppression (P\u00bc.005), and rumination ( P\u00bc.004); and reported higher levels of somatic depressive symptoms ( P\u00bc.001), suggesting unique symptomatic experience of depression.Overall, 3 key conditions for cultural adaptation weresupported.Conclusion: This study offers quantitative evidence in sup- port for cultural adaptation of MBIs for Black or AAs with depression. Results highlight misconceptions of mindfulness, depression stigma, unique sociocultural stressors, maladap-tive emotion regulation strategies, and somatic depressivesymptoms as potential targets for adaptation to improve the approachability and clinical relevance of MBIs for depression. OA04.4 Engaging Stakeholders in Research on a T elephone-Delivered MindfulnessIntervention for Rural, African AmericanFamilies Isabel Lathren1, and Susan Gaylord1 1University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina Contact: Isabel Roth, iroth@email.unc.edu Abstract Purpose: Rates of Alzheimer's disease and related demen- tias are projected to triple by 2050 and many of those impacted will be African Americans (AAs). AA familieswho live in rural areas have unique cultural, geographic, health-related and socio-economic needs, including relative- ly less access to, and willingness to engage with, formalsupports and resources, and poorer health outcomes; how-ever, there have been few interventions targeted to rural AA caregivers of persons with dementia. One effective intervention, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR),has been found to be culturally acceptable in AA popula- tions; however, no studies have assessed feasibility, accept- ability, and impact of an adapted mindfulness interventiontargeting rural AA dementia caregivers.Methods: T o complement an ongoing feasibility study on a telephone-delivered MBSR intervention with AA families,we convened a Community Advisory Board to inform early-, mid-, and late-stage study activities. The Community Advisory Board was convened in July of 2019and will continue to meet every 2 to 3 months for the 18 month feasibility study period. Surveys will be conducted following each meeting to assess impact of meeting activities. Results: In the early stage, input was sought on terminol- ogy used in the intervention, a local resource guide for study participants, training needed to engaging participants in technology, and recruitment strategies. In the mid stage, we will seek input on challenges that may arise during study recruitment and implementation of the intervention. This will also include seeking feedback on interpretation of find- ings. In the late stage, we will seek stakeholder input on dissemination of findings. We will also seek participation in planning the next phase of research activities. Conclusion: Engaging stakeholders as study partners may be crucial to successfully adapting mind-body interventions to local contexts. Local community input may lead to enhanced feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of tai- lored interventions and improved outcomes for families impacted by ADRD. OA05.01 Integrative Group Gardiner2 1University of California, San 2Boston Medical Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Ariana Thompson-Lastad, ariana.thompson-lastad@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Integrative group medical visits (IGMVs) have been implemented for treatment of chronic pain and other conditions, particularly in primary care settings. IGMVs combine mindfulness, acupuncture, or other modal- ities with biomedical care, peer support, and health educa- tion. However, little research has focused on the clinician experience of IGMVs. Qualitative research exploring the experience of clinicians in GMVs can help assess whether GMVs should be considered among workplace-based inter- ventions to improve clinician well-being, given high rates of clinician burnout in many settings. Methods: Qualitative methods were used to examine how IGMVs and integrative medicine are combined and imple- mented for low-income people with chronic conditions in the United States. Data include observation of 20 IGMVs at 4 organizations and interviews with IGMV staff (n \u00bc28) and patients (n \u00bc25). Field notes and interviews were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory methods including inductive coding and memowriting.10 Global Advances in Health and MedicineResults: IGMVs can benefit clinician well-being in 4 ways: (1) extended time with patients. In IGMVs, clinicians and patients typically spend 1 to 3 hours together; (2) increased ability to provide team-based care, including interprofes- sional collaboration that can increase CIH access; (3) under- standing patients' social context and addressing social deter- minants of health through referrals and follow-up with clinic or community resources; and (4) opportunity to practice CIH in a biomedical setting. IGMV clinicians described these 3 elements of IGMV as facilitating opportunities to provide CIH in ways that were not possible in individual primary care. Some identified IGMVs as their primary reason for continuing in their current jobs and their only opportunity to practice \"the kind of medicine I want to practice.\" Conclusion: IGMV programs with adequate institutional support may be beneficial for preventing clinician burnout and improving retention, with particular benefits in the con- text of safety-net primary care. OA05.02 Engaging Patients in their Health Care: Lessons From a Qualitative Study onInterpersonal Processes Health CoachesUse to Support an Active LearningParadigm Ruth 1, Karen Delia Vicidomini2, and Reese Wells2 1Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee 2Appalachian State University, Boone, North Carolina Contact: Ruth Wolever, ruth.wolever@vanderbilt.edu Abstract Purpose: While a number of health-care trends rely on informed and activated patients, few studies have reported on direct observation of what processes engage and acti- vate patients to be full participants in their own health care. The interpersonal processes and communication strategies used in integrative health coaching (IHC) may offer impor- tant insight into how clinicians can help patients step into a more active learning model rather than more typical passive patients roles. This qualitative study uses verbatim tran- scripts of medical patients' first few iIHC sessions to identify the processes used to engage patients in a more active learning role. Methods: Verbatim transcripts (72) from coaching sessions of 26 patients were qualitatively analyzed for themes. The patients received 6 months of coaching as part of a larger integrative intervention in a randomized, controlled pilot study designed to assess feasibility for a larger randomizedcontrolled trial on the clinical effectiveness of an integrative medicine intervention for those with severe dysfunction from tinnitus. Results: Themes that emerged from the coding include (1) Describing the Health Coaching Process; (2) Key Procedures for Action Planning\u2014optimal health visualiza- tion, Wheel of Health, exploration of gaps between current and desired states; (3) Supporting Action & Building Momentum; and (4) Active Listening & Inviting the Patient to Articulate Learning\u2014reflection, clarifying questions,turning patient questions back to patients, highlighting values, identifying potential barriers and resources, and inviting patients to articulate what they were learning. Exemplar interactions will be shown. Conclusion: The processes identified in IHC incorporate key principles of adult learning theory and utilize innate resources of goal-orientation, self-direction, and intrinsic motivation. The interpersonal processes that coaches use help patients embrace a more active learning role to become full participants in their health care. Use of these processes has implications for patient engagement in other clinical contexts. OA05.03 Developing an Integrative Health and Wellness Program of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio Contact: Julie Hancock, hancocju@mail.uc.edu Abstract Purpose: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neuro- degenerative disease with characteristic symptoms of rest- ing tremor and rigidity. Current pharmacologic treatments have the ability to improve some, but not all, symptoms. The purpose of this study was to develop an evidence-based and community-informed integrative health program for PD that incorporates integrative/lifestyle therapies to improve functioning and quality of life for patients with PD. Methods: A scientific literature review and 14 semi- structured interviews with key stakeholders (ie, health- care providers, patients, care providers, community advo- cates) were conducted to inform program development. Interviews addressed: current care pathway and treatment offerings, primary symptoms, feedback on specific integra- tive/lifestyle therapies, and potential barriers to utilization.Abstracts 11Interviews were transcribed and coded using thematic analysis. Results: Scientific evidence most supports the incorpora- tion of aerobic exercise, mind-body therapies, and musictherapy for improved motor and non-motor outcomes.Interviewees emphasized apathy and depression as poten-tially targetable sources of disability. There was high interest in integrative/lifestyle therapies that address stress, sleep- deprivation, and motor symptoms in particular, with themost enthusiasm reported for (1) music therapy, (2) nutri-tion, including teaching kitchens and group nutrition educa-tion, and (3) mind-body therapies, specifically mindfulness and stress reduction. Transportation difficulty was highlight- ed as a major access barrier. Conclusion: Based on the scientific literature, current offerings, patient and family preferences, and input fromhealth-care providers and PD community leaders, an Integrative Health PD program that will include Tai Chi, yoga, mindfulness and stress reduction, nutrition group edu-cation, a possible teaching kitchen, acupuncture, massagetherapy, and music therapy will be developed. Due to trans-portation barriers, telehealth options will be explored. The program will be fully integrated within a new Neuroscience Institute alongside conventional treatment to promoteoverall wellness of PD patients and families with an integra-tive evidence-based approach. OA05.4 Health-care Innovation Meets Sleep Hygiene: Designing a T ool That ReducesBlue Light Exposure and Chronic Snoozing King John Pascual 1and Mikhail Kogan1 1George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: King John Pascual, king_pascual@gwu.edu Abstract Purpose: Sleep hygiene is an often overlooked dimension of wellness. Among the younger generation, poor sleephygiene is commonplace. According to the AmericanPsychological Association, millennials are more likely tofeel stressed due to lack of sleep compared to baby boom- ers. Experts agree that technology plays a role, notably cellphone usage before bedtime and chronic snoozing inthe morning. T o provide a solution, we developed a noveltool, called EarlyBirdy, that aims to reduce blue light expo-sure from cellphone usage before bedtime while preventing snoozing after waking up. Methods: EarlyBirdy was conceptualized as a modified lockbox where a user can lock their cellphones insidebefore going to bed. The design includes holes on both sides that allow for charging and sound amplification. Users are instructed to set up their alarms on their cell- phones before locking them in the box. Once placed inside, the user will lock the box and place the key, along with its key stand, somewhere outside of their room (eg, kitchen or bathroom). When the alarm goes off, the user will then leave their bed and room, take the box to the location ofthe keystand, unlock it, and turn off the alarm. After final- izing the design, we prototyped EarlyBirdy using a 3-dimen- sional printer and administered a survey on MT urk. Results: The prototype was built out of ABS plastic. T en university students volunteered to try the device for 1 night. Based on feedback, the holes had to be widened to accommodate a variety of chargers and increase the alarm's sound. All 10 of them, as well as 50% (n \u00bc12) of Mturk participants, aged 19 to 29 years, expressed that they will likely use EarlyBirdy. Conclusion: EarlyBirdy is a novel tool that can potentially promote sleep hygiene among millennials. Its unique method for reducing blue light exposure while preventing snoozing has been shown to be feasible. OA06.01 Acupuncture History, Expectations, and Postoperative Experience Among CardiacSurgery Patients: The ACU-Heart Pilot Trial Allison 1, Judy Davidson3, McCarthy3, Melinda Ring3, and Kim Feingold3 1Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 2Northwestern University Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 3Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Allison Carroll, acarroll@nm.org Abstract Purpose: Cardiac surgery patients suffer high rates of depression, somatic sequelae, and medical complications (eg, atrial fibrillation). Although acupuncture is an effective treatment for these conditions, no trials have tested acu-puncture among cardiac surgery patients. It is unknown whether cardiac surgery patients would be receptive to acupuncture. In this study, we assessed cardiac surgery patients' history of, expectations for, and experience with acupuncture. Methods: These data are part of a randomized, controlled, feasibility trial of daily acupuncture (ACU) or treatment as usual (TAU) following isolated valve surgery via sternotomy. ACU patients received up to 6 acupuncture sessions during12 Global Advances in Health and Medicinehospitalization. TAU patients had no intervention. Before randomization, all patients reported history of and expect-ations for acupuncture. At follow-up (3-months postsur- gery), their experience of erative acupuncture. Results: In total, 100 patients were randomized (51 ACU, 49 TAU), mostly males (71%), Caucasian (86%), and 59 yearsold on average (standard deviation [SD] \u00bc11 years). At baseline, 27% of patients had previous experience with acu- puncture, of which 82% had only undergone 1 session.Patients' expectations for postoperative acupuncture wereneutral: most patients agreed \"a little\" or \"moderately\" that acupuncture would help them with cardiac surgery (66%), postsurgical symptoms (58%), and energy level (65%), allACU vs TAU Ps >.20. During hospitalization, ACU patients underwent 3.8 acupuncture sessions on average (SD \u00bc1.1). Among ACU patients at follow-up, many it was \"not helpful\" (8%). Conclusion: One in 4 cardiac surgery patients had previ- ous, limited experience with acupuncture. Most patients had moderate expectations that acupuncture would benefitthem. Nonetheless, the majority of patients who received acupuncture during postoperative hospitalization found acupuncture to be helpful. Future analyses will assess theimpact of acupuncture on depressive symptoms, somatic sequelae, and atrial fibrillation. OA06.02 Long-term Exercise After Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Exploratory Results of a Pilot Randomized Trial of Tai Chi and Cardiorespiratory Function Stephen Maris1,Y a nM a2, Peter Wayne5, and Gloria Yeh3 1Department of Exercise Science and Athletic Training, Springfield College, Springfield, Maryland 2Center for Dynamical Biomarkers, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 3Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 4Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Section, Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts 5Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Stephen Maris, smaris@springfieldcollege.eduAbstract Purpose: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease (COPD) often lose improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality-of-life after pulmonary rehabilita- tion (PR) when exercise is not maintained. In the context ofa randomized controlled trial, the goals of this analysis were to (1) explore longitudinal changes in respiratory function after a 24-week post-PR T ai Chi (TC) intervention and (2)characterize response to TC versus walking (WLK). Methods: Cardiorespiratory data were available on a total of 85 adults (41% females) randomized (2:1:2) to a 24-week TC \u00bc16), or standard care (SC, n\u00bc35). Respiratory function was assessed at baseline and 24 weeks using spirometry. Acute in-class cardiorespiratory responses during TC and WLK at 24 weeks were assessed using standard cardiorespiratory measures from a portable metabolic cart. Continuous heart rate data during in-classtesting was analyzed for conventional heart rate variability (HRV) indices. Questionnaires assessed quality-of-life, phys- ical function, and dyspnea. Results: After 24 weeks, SC experienced a declined forced vital capacity (FVC) while TC baseline (post-PR)values ( /C00.24/C60.03 P<.05). TC was less intense than WLK with reduced heart rate, oxygen con- sumption (VO 2), expired carbon dioxide (VCO 2), respira- tory rate, and ventilation (VE) ( P<.05). TC demonstrated a more vs changes in FVC were significantly correlated to improvements on the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire-Dyspnea scale in TC ( r\u00bc.47, P<.05) but not in the WLK or SC. There were trends in increased HRV in both time and frequency domains in the recovery phase after TC. Conclusion: TC attenuated the decline in FVC seen in SC. Although TC was of lesser aerobic intensity than WLK, TCwas associated with more favorable ventilatory efficiency during exercise, suggesting that TC could be a viable exer- cise option in COPD to maintain benefits seen after PR. OA06.03 \"It Gave Me Hope\" Experiences of Diverse Safety Net Patients in a GroupAcupuncture Intervention for PainfulDiabetic Neuropathy Rhianon Liu 1, and Maria T Chao2 1Sutter Santa Rosa Family Medicine Residency, Santa Rosa, California 2UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, San Francisco, CaliforniaAbstracts 133UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, California 4University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California Contact: Maria T Chao, maria.chao@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Neuropathy is one of the most disabling and costly complications of diabetes, and it disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities and low-income patients. First-line treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) consists of analgesic medications with limited efficacy and significant side effects. Acupuncture is a proven treatment for chronic pain and is a promising emerging alternative. The purpose of this analysis is to explore low-income and minority patients' experiences living with PDN and with a group acupuncture treatment intervention. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a subsample of participants from a randomized clinical trial of a group acupuncture intervention for PDN. Eligible par- ticipants were English- or Spanish-speaking adults recruited from a public hospital (70% racial/ethnic minorities, 80% publicly insured/uninsured) with type 2 diabetes and neuro- pathic pain. Interview transcripts were analyzed using an inductive thematic framework. Results: We conducted 27 in-depth qualitative interviews. Participants identified that PDN added significant sufferingand disability to the multiple challenges of poverty they were already facing, including housing instability, lack of transportation, and limited access to healthy food. In gen- eral, they found acupuncture not only alleviated many dif- ferent types of neuropathic pain (burning or aching, sensa- tions of heat or cold, numbness) but also reduced their reliance on medication. They noted improvements in sleep, stress management, and mood. Some found that they grew more engaged in caring for their diabetes through study participation. They strengthened their understanding of diabetes and PDN as well as their awareness of its effect on well-being. Finding a beneficial treatment also renewed their hope and motivation. Conclusion: Diverse safety net participants with PDN found group acupuncture helpful in treating their pain and improving overall well-being. More research is warranted to explore the ways in which acupuncture or other comple- mentary therapies could bolster patient empowerment to improve health outcomes in marginalized populations.OA06.4 Moving the Needle in Frequent Hospitalizations: Using Integrative Medicine to Reduce Hospitalizations in Patients With Complex Medical Conditions Alan Chu1, Annie Zhang2, Sun Yoo2, and Andrew Shubov2 1UCLA East West, Los Angeles, California 2University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California Contact: Alan Chu, aschu@mednet.ucla.edu Abstract Purpose: T o determine whether integrative medicine involvement can reduce hospitalization frequency and dura-tion for patients with complex medical conditions and fre- quent hospitalizations. Methods: The UCLA East-West Medicine clinic is an inte- grative medicine specialty service which uses TraditionalChinese Medicine (TCM) to form an integrative medical assessment\u2014utilizing acupuncture, trigger point injections, and TCM dietary modifications to improve health and well-being. Recently, a smaller clinic was established in partner-ship with the UCLA Extensivist Program to provide hightouch care for high utilizers of health care, as defined by at least 2 hospitalizations in the past year; 29 patients had 6- month follow-up data available and were included in thisanalysis. We used the Epic electronic medical record todetermine the total number of hospitalizations and hospi-talization days for the year preceding their initial visit. These patients were then followed for 6 months by integrative east-west medicine physicians. The number of hospitaliza-tions and hospitalization days were determined at 6 monthspostenrollment and normalized to 1 year. One and 2-tailedpaired ttests were used for statistical analyses. Results: Patients had an average of 3.76 hospitalizations and 28.21 hospitalization days per year prior to interven-tion. After 6 months of treatment, patients had an averageof 1.21 fewer hospitalizations per year ( P\u00bc.034; 2-tailed t test) and had an average of 9.86 fewer hospitalization days per year ( P\u00bc.026; 1-tailed ttest). Subgroup analysis of patients who had received 6 or more integrative medicinevisits over the trial period suggested greater improvementthan those who received fewer visits ( P\u00bc.042; 1-tailed t test). Conclusion: Integrative medicine specialty care was effec- tive in reducing hospitalization frequency and total hospital-ization days among high utilizers of care. This supports fur- ther exploration into using integrative medicine as a cost saving measure among the sickest and most complexpatients in the health-care system.14 Global Advances in Health and MedicineOA07.01 Culinary Medicine Education in Core Medical School Curriculum Improved Medical Student Nutrition Knowledge and Confidence in Providing NutritionCounseling to Patients Chris Berman3 1Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Laurel, Maryland 2University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 3The Institute for Integrative Health, Baltimore, Maryland 4Maryland University of Integrative Health, Laurel, Maryland Contact: Chris D'Adamo, cdadamo@som.umaryland.edu Abstract Purpose: Culinary medicine education has become increas- ingly popular at medical schools across the United States. Medical students electing to participate in experiential culi- nary medicine education have demonstrated improvementsin nutrition knowledge, skills, and attitudes for both self-care and patient care. However, data on the effectiveness of culi- nary medicine in core medical school curriculum are limited since this education is typically offered only on an elective basis. We will describe the process of obtaining approval for culinary medicine in core curriculum and pro- vide outcomes from the inaugural cohort of first- and second-year medical students who completed this training. Methods: Culinary medicine education featuring evidence- based nutrition instruction, practical methods to overcome barriers to healthy eating, and a focus on evidence and cooking of paleolithic and vegan diets was piloted in 2018 to 2019 academic year as a noncredit elective among med-ical students at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Student advocacy, positive course reviews, and improvements in nutrition knowledge, skills, and attitudes compelled medical student education leadership to include a culinary medicine session in core first- and second-year medical student curriculum beginning in Fall 2019. The ses- sion included evidence supporting numerous popular diets with a focus on practical implementation and cooking of Mediterranean diets. Paired ttests were employed to esti- mate mean differences in presession/postsession outcomes. Results: All medical students in the 2019 to 2020 first-year class, and most students in the second-year class have com- pleted the culinary medicine training, with the remainingstudents completing training by January 2020. Presession/ postsession outcomes data were collected from 251students. Statistically significant improvements were noted in all nutrition knowledge and patient counseling outcomes assessed. Conclusion: A single session of culinary medicine including evidence on numerous popular diets and experiential cook- ing instruction is feasible in core medical student curricu-lum, well-received by students, and offers improvements in nutrition knowledge and confidence in nutrition counseling. OA07.02 East-West Culinary Medicine Shared Medical Appointments: BlendingTraditional and Modern Nutrition\u2014A PilotFeasibility Study Isabella Lai 1, Ka-Kit Hui1, and Felicia Yu1 1UCLA East West Medicine, Los Angeles, California Contact: Isabella Lai, isabellangalai@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Shared medical appointments (SMAs) offer an innovative method to provide education while increasingphysician face-time with patients. Covered by third-party payers, our SMAs model promotes optimal self-care through educating patients about East-West nutrition, culi- nary skills, and mindfulness. Here, we present data from our pilot study to assess feasibility and patient satisfaction of thisparticular model. Methods: Adult patients at the UCLA Center for East- West medicine were recruited to attend 1 SMA on the topic relevant to their diagnosis of obesity, cancer, or auto- immune disease. The session centered on educating patients about East-West culinary medicine, integrating Western and Eastern healing food traditions. Each SMAoccurred over 90 minutes and included a lecture, cooking demonstration, mindfulness practice, and group discussion. E&M code 99213 was billed per patient. Results: Fifty patients attended the East-West culinary medicine SMAs, in one of the following subject matters: weight management, inflammation, or cancer. The pilot con- sisted of 6 individual classes and occurred over a 6-monthperiod. Patients were surveyed after their visit. Patients had an average of 20% subjective improvement in their knowl- edge of traditional and modern nutrition after 1 session. One hundred percent of patients stated that they would like to expand the informational session into a series. Fivepatients stated in the comments that they thoroughly enjoyed group discussions and learning about lifestyle mod- ifications from peers. One patient suggested forming an online forum to share healthy recipe ideas and gain support to make better lifestyle choices.Abstracts 15Conclusion: This pilot demonstrated that East-West culi- nary medicine SMAs were cost-effective, covered by third-party payers, and improved patients understanding of the role of nutrition on health and wellness. Follow-up studies will be performed to study long-term outcomes of SMAs on weight loss, reducing inflammatory symptoms, and improv- ing quality of life in cancer patients. Financially, SMAs suggesta sustainable and effective approach to integrative medicine. A07.03 Findings From an Annual Follow-up Assessment of a Culinary Medicine Elective in Medical Students: Examining theDurability of Effects up to 2 Years AfterCourse Completion Elaine Cheung 1, Melinda Ring2, Rupa Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 2Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 3Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 4Common Threads, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Elaine Cheung, elaine-cheung@northwestern.edu Abstract Purpose: Physicians are the frontline of advising patients on nutrition; however, physicians report feeling ill-prepared to counsel patients on nutrition. Since 2016, the CookingUp Health (CUH) culinary medicine elective has been implemented at the Feinberg School of Medicine to expand medical students' comfort in counseling patients in behavior change around nutrition and cooking. This elec- tive has demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and prelimi-nary efficacy for increasing students' confidence in nutrition counseling and increasing their fruit and vegetable consump- tion (Ring et al., 2018). We administered a follow-up survey to previous students who participated in the CUH elective to examine whether these improvements were sustainedover time. Methods: In Fall 2018, we administered a follow-up survey to 2 previous cohorts of medical students who participatedin the CUH elective to examine the durability of effects over time. Fourteen students (67%) who previously partic- ipated in CUH completed the follow-up survey, which assessed their confidence in nutrition counseling and their diet. Results: Students reported increased confidence in nutri- tion counseling from baseline to postelective that were sustained through the follow-up assessment ( Ps<.001).Although students reported increased fruit and vegetable consumption from baseline to postelective ( P\u00bc.02), these increases were not sustained over time, and students' fruit and vegetable consumption returned to baseline levels by the follow-up assessment ( P\u00bc.20). Conclusion: The current study suggests that the CUH elective has demonstrated efficacy in improving medical stu- dents' confidence in counseling patients in nutrition care, and these effects are sustained up to 2 years after comple- tion of the elective. However, students' increased fruit and vegetable consumption after taking the elective were not sustained over time. Future research should identify poten- tial barriers to healthful cooking and eating in medical train- ing that may interfere with sustained healthful behavior change. Ultimately, this research may provide evidence to support widespread integration of the CUH elective into medical education. OA07.04 Feasibility of a Train-the-Trainer Model for Dissemination and Uptake of CulinaryMedicine Education Melinda Ring 1, Rupa Mahadevan2, Elaine Cheung2, and Stephanie Folkens3 1Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 2Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 3Common Threads, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Melinda Ring, mring@nm.org Abstract Purpose: The aim of this project is to increase the ability of faculty to deliver a culinary medicine and service-learning education program to medical trainees. In 2016, an academic-community partnership between Northwestern Osher Center and Common Threads led to the develop- ment of a unique elective (Cooking Up Health) in which trainees learn about nutrition and cooking and then go into underserved communities to teach elementary school children about healthy habits. Previously reported data show that participants note increased confidence in and attitudes toward nutrition and obesity counseling. Requests from other sites led to our creation of a training through which attendees can bring culinary medicine totheir home institution. By sharing this work, we believe we can impact on the nutrition-competence of future health-care providers, the wellness of students during their training, and improve the health of children and fam- ilies in communities.16 Global Advances in Health and MedicineMethods: Our goal was to provide other institutions access to a well-researched and vetted course and thetools needed to maximize likelihood of successful imple-mentation. T o see whether this was feasible, we hostedworkshops in 2018 (13 faculty from 8 institutions) and2019 (12 faculty from 7 institutions). Workshops were coc-urated and taught by academic and community partners.The agenda consisted of participation in a mock culinarymedicine class including hands-on cooking, interactive activ-ities, and brainstorming steps to completion. Evaluation ofthe workshops was conducted using presurvey and post-survey in Qualtrics and follow-up surveys 6 and 12 months later. Results: Postworkshop evaluations showed participants gained confidence in ability to implement the elective andhigh likelihood of recommending the course and the train-ing. Perceived barriers to success were financial resourcesand time in the curriculum. Conclusion: It is feasible to use a Train-the Trainer model to disseminate culinary medicine education content.Additional follow-up is needed to assess success of imple-mentation efforts. OA08.01 Effectiveness of Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Low Back Pain in 17 U.S.-Based Integrative Medicine Clinics Eric Roseen 1, Robert Saper2, Dusek8 1Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 2Department of Family Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 3University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 4Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 5Albert Einsein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 6VA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, Washington, District of Columbia 7University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts 8University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio Purpose: Nonpharmacologic treatments are recom- mended by clinical practice guidelines for low back pain(LBP) and randomized trials support their effectiveness.However, studies on whether nonpharmacologic treat-ments are effective when implemented in real-world multi-disciplinary clinical settings are needed. Methods: We analyzed data from the Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Interventions Effectiveness Registry, aprospective longitudinal study embedded in a practice- based research network. Cases of LBP were identified bychief complaint reported on the baseline survey or an ICD- 9/10 code for LBP in the electronic medical record. With the widely used, validated PROMIS-29, we evaluatedchanges in pain intensity, pain interference, and physical function. We used linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept to account for repeated measures to(1) assess 2- and 12-month PROMIS-29 changes from base- line and (2) whether change over 1 year varied by cumula- tive dose quartiles, characterized as: none (0 visits), low (1-4 visits), moderate (5-15 visits), or high (15-82 visits). Results: From August 2013 to November 2018, 4954 par- ticipants were enrolled from 17 clinical sites. We identified489 (10%) unique LBP cases (mean age \u00bc52, 78% Three-fourths of the sites (13/17) enrolled >10 LBP patients. The most frequently reported nonpharmaco-logic treatments received were acupuncture (39%), chiro- practic care (36%), and massage (15%). Modest 2- and 12- month improvements were observed for pain intensity(mean difference [MD] \u00bc/C00.46, P<.001; and /C00.55, P<.001, respectively). Improvements in pain interference were not statistically significant at 2 months (MD \u00bc/C01.46, P\u00bc.15) but reached significance by 12 months (MD\u00bc/C01.59, P\u00bc.01). Physical function appeared to improve over 12 months only among participants receivinga low (MD \u00bc0.91, P\u00bc.02) or moderate (MD \u00bc0.53, P\u00bc.14) dose. Similarly, 12-month improvements in pain interference and intensity appeared largest among partici-pants receiving low or moderate dose (all P<.001). Conclusion: Participants with LBP who received 1 to 15 nonpharmacologic visits experienced modest improve-ments in pain and function over 1 year. OA08.02 Pilot Trial of Orally Administered Fatty Acid-Derived Resolvins on Quality of Lifeand Pain in Adults With Chronic Pain Ryan Bradley 1, Nini Callan1, and Doug Hanes1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: Ryan Bradley, rbradley@nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: T o assess the impact of 4 weeks of oral supple- mentation with on health-related quality of life and pain in adults with chronic pain. Methods: This study was a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial. Forty-four men and women with aAbstracts 17minimum of 3 months of pain of at least a 4 on the PROMIS- 43 pain intensity scale at baseline were recruited from thecommunity and asked to take 6 softgels/day for 4 weeks.Each softgel contained: 150 mg DHA, 50 mg EPA, 12.5 lg 17-HDHA and 10 lg 18-HEPE. The primary outcomes were health-related quality of life measured by thePROMIS-43 Profile and the American Chronic PainAssociation Quality of Life Scale. Exploratory outcomesassessed safety and tolerability, changes in anxiety anddepression (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and PROMIS-43 anxiety anddepression subscales) as well levels of pain (Brief PainInventory and the PROMIS-43 subscales), patient satisfac-tion and impression of change, plus blood biomarkers asso-ciated with inflammation (hs-CRP and ESR). All instrumentswere administered electronically and separately from trialvisits. Results: All forty-four participants completed the trial without any moderate or serious adverse events. Multiplequality of life domains, including Physical Functioning,Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance and Social Functioning, showedstatistically significant improvements ( P<.05), with consis- tent, but borderline changes also evident by changes in theACPA Quality of Life ( P\u00bc.051). Exploratory analyses revealed statistically significant parallel changes in all meas-ures of pain intensity and pain interference, as measured byBPI and the PROMIS-43 subscales. Conclusion: Oral supplements with resolvins may improve quality of life, reduce pain intensity and interference, andimprove mood within 4 weeks in people with chronic pain.The biologic plausibility, consistency between outcomes,and the magnitude of the results of this trial support theneed for placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral resolvins. OA08.03 Peeling Back the Layers: The Role of Massage and Acupuncture in an IntegrativePain Management Program in a Safety NetClinic Theo Slomoff Maria Chao3 1University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 2San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, California 3Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California Contact: Theo Slomoff, theo.slomoff@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: While there is strong evidence to support the use of multimodal integrative chronic pain management,programs providing this service can be particularly complexto implement in resource-limited settings. We examined how each component of a multimodal, integrative programchanged patients' pain-related outcomes in a public safetynet clinic. Methods: We analyzed data from the Integrative Pain Management Program (IPMP) at a community-based prima-ry care clinic in San Francisco. IPMP is a 12-week coreprogram that provides pain education, movement, andtools for pain self-management with optional additional ses-sions of acupuncture and massage. Patients were surveyedabout pain-related outcomes at the program's initiation, atthe end of the program, and 3 months following the end ofthe program. We used mixed linear models to compareIPMP participants who received acupuncture and massage treatments during the program with those that did not. Results: Data were collected for105 patients with initial surveys, 75 patients at the end of the study period and 28patients at the 3-month follow-up. For patients whoreceived acupuncture and massage (n \u00bc88), scores of pain self-efficacy and pain catastrophizing trended down over thestudy period and reached significance prior to the 3-monthfollow-up. Between-group analysis indicated a statisticallyand clinically significant decrease in pain interference (D4.08, P\u00bc.02) and increase in pain self-efficacy ( D5.14, P\u00bc.023) among patients who received massage and acu- puncture. Although there were decreased scores fordepression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, they did notmeet our threshold for clinical significance. No significantimprovements were observed for global physical health,physical functioning, or social satisfaction among patientswho attended acupuncture and massage sessions. Conclusion: While the core integrative pain management program provided benefit to patients in an underserved setting, participation in additional acupuncture and massagesessions was associated with improvement in the domainsof pain catastrophizing, pain interference, and self-efficacy. OA08.04 Effectiveness of Multidisciplinary Shared Medical Appointments (SMAs) for theTreatment of Chronic Pain Opioid Ohio dombros@ccf.org18 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: T o evaluate the effectiveness of a multidiscipli- nary, nonpharmacological, integrative approach using chron- ic, pain.Methods: Our Center for Integrative & Lifestyle Medicine \"Living Well with Chronic Pain\" SMA is a weekly group visitprogram including eight 3-hour sessions. All participantswere referred to the program by their primary care physi- cian, and each cohort was limited to 10 patients. Participants experienced self-care education as well asboth cognitive/behavioral and physical pain relief techniquesincluding but not limited to meditation, chair yoga, dia-phragmatic breathing, auricular acupuncture and massage.Opioid use (morphine in milligrams equivalent [MME])was tracked weekly via the patients' electronic medicalrecord. Body mass index (BMI) was measured and patients completed the PROMIS-57 health-related quality-of-life questionnaire during visits 1 and 8. Results: A total of 178 patients over 282 cohorts have par- ticipated in the \"Living Well with Chronic Pain\" SMA to-date.Most patients (170/178; 96%) attended 6 or more of the 8 weekly group visits. Overall, SMA intervention resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement for alldomains measured: physical functioning, anxiety, depression,fatigue, social satisfaction, ( P<.001), and ( P<.05) comparing opioid use decreased over the8-week intervention ( /C049.8 MME change) and was sustained at 6-month follow-up ( /C07.5 MME change), representing a clinically significant decrease. When opioid users were ana-lyzed separately from nonusers, pain interference decreasedsignificantly increased SMA attendance ( P\u00bc.023). Conclusion: Cleveland Clinic's multidisciplinary shared medical appointment model may be an effective approach to chronic pain treatment via its unique combination of education and integrative treatment modalities. OA08.05 Integrative Approaches to Pediatric Chronic Pain in an Urban Safety-NetHospital: Cost Savings, Clinical Benefits,and Safety Elizabeth Sommers 1, Paula Gardiner2, Salvatore D'Amico2, Laura Goldstein2, and Caitlin Neri2 1Boston Medical Center\u2014Integrative Medicine, Massachusetts Medical Center, Boston, MassachusettsContact: Elizabeth Sommers, elizabeth.sommers@verizon.net Abstract Purpose: Chronic pain experienced by children and ado- lescents represents a significant burden in terms of health, quality of life, and economic costs to U.S. families. In 2015, the Boston Medical Center (BMC) Interdisciplinary Pain Clinic initiated an Integrative Medicine (IM) team model to address chronic pain in children. T eam members included a pediatrician, child psychologist, physical therapist, acu- puncturist, and massage therapist. Children were referred to the pain clinic from primary care and specialty services within BMC, which is the largest safety-net hospital in the northeastern U.S. For this observational assessment, con-sent and assent were obtained from parents and pediatric patients. Individualized treatment plans were recommended by the IM team. Methods: Self-reported survey and electronic medical record data were collected about socioeconomic demo- graphics, pain, use of medical and IM services, and quality of life. We compared health and quality of life indicators and costs of care for each participant from the year before entering our study with these same indicators for the sub- sequent year. Results: Eighty-three participants were enrolled. Participants ranged in age from 4 to 22 years (mean 14.7 years). Eighty percent of the group were females. Forty-two percent of the sample were White; 30% were Hispanic/Latino and 28% were African American. Primary types of pain were abdominal (52%), headache (23%), mus- culoskeletal (18%), and other (7%). Quality of life improved ( P\u00bc.049) and pain interference decreased (Wilcoxon P\u00bc.040). Major economic drivers of cost were Emergency Department (ED) visits, in-patient hospitaliza- tions, and consultations with medical specialists. For the46 participants who completed the project, the following cost savings were noted: $27 819 (surgical procedures), $17 638 (ED visits), $25 033 (hospitalizations), and $42 843 (specialist consults). No adverse events were reported by any of the participants. Conclusion: Our experience demonstrated that the use of IM approaches in an interdisciplinary team approach is safe, feasible, and acceptable to families.Abstracts 19OA09.01 Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Intervention Efficacy Registry: BraveNet Study Focusing on a Chronic Pain Cohort Using Patient Activation Measure Scoring Jeffery Dusek1, Donald Abrams2, Kathryn Hansen3, Qi Diane McKee6 1University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio 2University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 3Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 4Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York 5Veterans Administration, New York, New York 6University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts Contact: Jeffery Dusek, jeffery.dusek@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: vational evaluation conducted at 17 BraveNet clinics. PRIMIER was designed to collect patient-reported outcomemeasures (PROMs) at specified time periods to examine (1)if specific clinical populations (eg, chronic pain) and (2) IMinterventions are associated with improved outcomes overtime. Methods: PRIMIER participants received nonstandardized, personalized, multimodal IM approaches for various medicalconditions. Using REDCap, participants electronically con-sented and then completed Patient Reported OutcomesMeasurement Information System (PROMIS)-29, Perceived Stress Scale-4, and the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Linear mixed-models anal-yses were performed on data to assess change from base-line through 12 months. Results: Overall, 4954 patients enrolled in PRIMER from August 2013 to October 2017, and 1047 met the criteriafor chronic pain, completed at least 2 surveys, and hadevaluable Electronic Health Record data. Chronic Pain par-ticipants were white (81%), females (79%), with a mean ageof 51.7 (standard deviation [SD] 14.0). On Anxiety, Fatigue, Physical Functioning, and Pain Interference scales, partici- pants reported elevated levels (0.5 SD) relative to nationalnorms. Significant reductions were observed at 12 monthson all 7 PROMIS-29 subscales and across all 4 time periodsexcept Physical Functioning at 2 and 4-months. Using estab-lished scoring, 3 PAM groups emerged from lowest to high-est activation (stage 1 and 2: n \u00bc315, stage 3: n \u00bc270, stage 4: n\u00bc457). Subsequent analyses reveal differing patterns of responses on Anxiety, Depression, and Fatigue by PAM groups. On Pain Interference, all PAM groups improvedbut sex differences emerged.Conclusion: T o-date PRIMIER results indicate a profound improvement across all of the tested PROMs. Further hier-archical clustering analyses (including heatmaps) will provideinsights as to whether timing and dose of specific IM inter-ventions and combinations are associated with largerimproved outcomes in the chronic pain cohort. OA09.02 Can Interdisciplinary Models That Promote Nonpharmacological Pain ManagementActually Decrease Opioid Dose and Risk?Evaluation of the Integrated Pain T eamModel Karen Seal 1, Tessa Rife1, Yongmei Li1, and Jennifer Tighe1 1San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, California Contact: Karen Seal, karen.seal@va.gov Abstract Purpose: National guidelines advise clinicians to decrease opioids for chronic pain management in favor of nonphar- macological modalities, yet we lack evidence for effective strategies. The Integrated Pain T eam (IPT) consists of a col-located medical provider, psychologist, and pharmacistembedded in VA primary care to optimize veterans' chronicpain and decrease opioid use. We evaluated the effective-ness of the IPT model to decrease opioid use and risk. Methods: New IPT patients (N \u00bc147) were matched to similar veterans with chronic pain prescribed opioidsreceiving Usual Primary Care (UPC, N \u00bc147) on visit date, age, gender, psychiatric diagnoses, and baselineopioid dose (as morphine equivalent daily dose [MEDD]).Veterans were assessed prospectively from baseline to 3 and 6 months for change in opioid dose and risk. Results: Among all 294 veterans, mean age was 63 years deviation [SD] \u00bc12 years); and average baseline MEDD was 124 mg. Veteranswith chronic pain followed by IPT versus UPC had a mean MEDD decrease of 56 mg versus 18 mg after 6 months (P\u00bc.03). An adjusted mixed-effects linear regression showed significant average treatment effects of the IPTand time interaction. At 3 months, the reduction ofMEDD in the IPT group was 33.6 mg (95% CI: 12.2-55.0 mg) greater than UPC ( P\u00bc.002), and at 6 months, reduction of opioid dose in the IPT group was 38.2 mg (95% CI: 13.0-63.5 mg) greater than UPC ( P\u00bc.003). This was independent of race, baseline pain severity, opioid usedisorder, and other factors. There were also significant20 Global Advances in Health and Medicineimprovements in opioid risk: urine drug screen monitoring and naloxone kit distribution at 6 months (all P<.001). Conclusion: Interdisciplinary models that promote a mul- timodal approach to pain care, including complementary and integrative health, can lead to sustained reductions in opioid use and risk. OA09.03 Comparative Effectiveness of Mind-Body Interventions for Knee Abstract Purpose: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem and a leading cause of long-term pain and disabilitywith substantial health-care costs. No effective medical treatments for the disease currently exist. Recently, mind-body exercises (Tai Chi and Y oga) are recommendedas Core T reatment options for knee OA patients. However, no studies have directly compared mind-body interventions with standard therapies for knee OA using an individual-participant data network meta-analysis approach. This is the first study to examine the efficacy of mind-body ther- apies for knee OA using this approach, which estimates relative effects of all treatments against each other. Methods: Randomized controlled trials evaluating at least 8 weeks of Tai Chi, or Y oga compared with Physical Therapy, Exercise, Attention Control, and Usual Carewere selected. Primary outcomes were pain (0-100) and function (0-100), as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. We syn-thesized individual participant data and performed a 2-stage analysis using an extension of multivariable Bayesian hierar- chical random effects models for multiple treatmentcomparisons. Nine studies (794 participants, mean age 66 years; 65% women) were included in this analysis. T ai Chi was as effective as Exercise (mean difference: 0.68, 95% credible inter- val:/C016.3, 17.0) or Physical Therapy (6.0 [ /C04.7, 16.1] in reliev- ing pain. Y oga achieved pain relief comparable to Exercise (10.5 [/C00.8, 22.2]) and Physical Therapy (15.7 [ /C00.6, 32.6]). For function, T ai Chi was as effective as Exercise (1.4 [ /C011.0, 13.8]) and Physical Therapy (7.8 [0.01, 15.5]. Y oga had higher benefits on function compared to Exercise (9.3 [0.7, 18.4]) and Physical Therapy (15.6 [3.1, 28.4]).Conclusion: Mind-body interventions produced beneficial effects similar to those of standard physical therapy and exercise in the treatment of knee OA. Therefore, standard- ized mind-body interventions should be considered as effective therapeutic options for knee OA, highlighting the importance of holistic well-being of the individuals. OA09.04 A Preoperative Mind-Body Intervention Improves T otal Joint Arthroplasty Patients'Postoperative Physical Function: Primary Outcomes and Mechanistic Explorations From a Randomized Controlled Trial Adam Hanley 1, Jeremy Gililland2, Jill Erickson2, Jamie Rojas1, and Eric Garland1 1Center on Mindfulness and Integrative Health Intervention Development, Salt Lake City, Utah 2University Orthopaedic Center, Salt Lake City, Utah Contact: Adam Hanley, adam.hanley@utah.edu Abstract Purpose: T o better support patients' recovery after total joint arthroplasty (TJA), we introduced evidenced-based, preoperative behavioral pain management strategies to our existing multimodal pain management protocol. This study examined the effect of 3 different adjunctive interven- tions (mindfulness meditation, hypnotic suggestion, and cognitive-behavioral psychoeducation) on preoperative pain and anxiety as well as physical function in early recov- ery following primary TJA. Methods: This was a 3-arm, prospective randomized con- trolled trial conducted in a university-based practice. Patients (N \u00bc288: knee \u00bc185, hip \u00bc103) attend- ing a preoperative education class were randomized to of 3, 15-minute mindfulness (n \u00bc108), hypnosis (n\u00bc90), A brief survey mea- sured pain-at-rest, desire for pain medication, and anxiety immediately before and 15 minutes after the preoperative intervention. Additionally, preoperative and 6-week postop- erative PROMIS Physical Function (PF) scores were compared. Results: Linear mixed modeling revealed mindfulness and hypnosis significantly reduced preoperative pain intensity by 24% and 26%, unpleasantness to and psychoeducation which showed no significant change from preoperative to 6 weeks.Abstracts 21Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that a single 15-minute, mindfulness, or hypnosis intervention immedi- ately reduced preoperative pain intensity, pain unpleasant- ness, and anxiety in patients preparing for TJA. Historically, we have found no significant improvement in PROMIS PF scores 6 weeks after TJA, whereas with preoperative mind- fulness training, we found clinically and statistically signifi- cant improvement in self-reported physical function 6 weeks after surgery. These findings suggest that brief, pre- operative mindfulness training may be an effective adjunct that can be easily disseminated in clinical settings, provide immediate preoperative pain and anxiety relief, and may improve postoperative physical functioning. OA10.01 Implementation Strategies used in a Pediatric Integrative Pain Management Pilot Consult Service: Findings from an Ethnography Isabel Roth1and Joan Engebretson2 1University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 2University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Nursing, Houston, Texas Contact: Isabel Roth, iroth@email.unc.edu Abstract Purpose: With the co-occurring opioid and chronic pain epidemics bringing focus to the need for nonpharmacolog- ical pain management, there is a pressing need to develop and implement Integrative Pain Management (IPM) models. IPM brings together professionals who are typically under- represented in biomedical health-care settings: acupunctu- rists, mindfulness-based stress reduction teachers, and music therapists, among others. Many of these IPM modal- ities are not currently covered under health insurance, one of several reasons that garnering administrative buy-in to support hiring and credentialing IPM providers may be chal- lenging. An ethnography was conducted in the spring of 2017 at a large urban pediatric hospital in the southern United States where an IPM consult service was being pilot tested. In the current analysis, we aimed to identify implementation strategies used to overcome barriers to implementation of IPM services. Methods: Approximately 200 hours of fieldwork were conducted, including participant observation, field notes, document review, and semistructured interviews and infor- mal interviews with 12 caregivers, 7 patients, 5 administra- tors, and 10 health-care providers. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis on ATLAS.TI datamanagement software. Detailed methods have been reported elsewhere. Results: Themes related to implementation strategies included Gathering Embedded Dually-Trained Providers,Building Philanthropic Support, and GarneringAdministrative Buy-In. Of the 6 members of the IPM ser-vice, 5 had dual training in both a complementary therapyand a biomedical profession. Working with developmentprofessionals to build philanthropic support for the IPMservice was crucial to getting the pilot off the ground.T o garner administrative buy-in, clinicians worked withhigh-profile patients offered complementary therapies totheir supervisors, built mentoring relationships, and lever-aged their non-IPM clinical work to gather support for IPM. Conclusion: The current analysis identified implementa- tion strategies that may be tested and replicated in futureimplementation studies of IPM. Identifying effective imple-mentation strategies will be crucial to future IPM implemen-tation efforts. OA10.02 Integrative Medicine in a Dutch Clinic Julia von Children's Hospital, the Hague, The Netherlands 2HagaZiekenhuis, the Hague, The Netherlands 3Rijnstate Ziekenhuis, Arnhem, The Netherlands Contact: Els Peeters, e.peeters@hagaziekenhuis.nl is an increasing demand for complemen- tary and integrative medicine (CIM) in adults and children inthe Netherlands. In 2017, the first Integrative MedicinePediatrics Outpatient Clinic was created in a large teachinghospital in the Hague .The integrative approach addressing awide range of neurological complaints among pediatricpatients is transforming health care. The collaborationwith CIM therapists by implementation a network of refer-rals is described. The purpose of this study was (1) to char-acterize the children and parents making use of the pediat- ric neurology clinic and (2) to determine the perceived effectiveness of CIM in these children using a referral circuitof CIM therapists. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of patients attending the integrative medicine outpatient clinic ofchild neurology in the Juliana Children's betweenNovember 2017 and September 2019. Patients' character-istics, their child's neurological illness, and the integrative22 Global Advances in Health and Medicineapproach and suggested CIM therapies were recorded. Caregivers and patients experience with CIM treatmentswere evaluated. Results: 79 Patients data were recorded. The mean age of the neurology patients was 11.5 years. Main complaintswere headaches 28 (35%), epilepsy 25 (32%), fatigue 16 (20%), and insomnia 10 (13%). All patients received 1 or more types of CIM, with the most common types beingbiochemical remedies (61), mind-body therapies (41), bioenergetic remedies (31), and biomechanical therapy (24);61% of CIM users reported benefits, and 25% experienced no effects. Personal experience of the integrative approach was positive in 83%. Conclusion: A majority of the families reported benefits from CIM and appreciate the collaboration with the referral circuit. Pediatric neurologists should initiate discussion onCIM helping patients and parents to make informed deci-sions about using CIM and ameliorating the well-being ofthese children. Further studies should address the specific role of CIM in children with neurological disorders. OA10.03 Mindfulness-Based Stabilization of Primary School Children: A Longitudinal Cluster- Randomized Trial on the Effect of Mindfulness Training on ClassroomClimate Dennis Anheyer 1, Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany 2Department of Health, Faculty of Medicine, Witten-Herdecke University, Witten, Germany 3Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany Contact: Dennis Anheyer, d.anheyer@kem-med.com Abstract Purpose: Increasing demands on teachers and students lead to an increase of distress on both sides. Studies have shown positive effects of mindfulness-based interventions on, for example, executive functioning. The aim of thiscluster-randomized trial was to gain more insight in theefficacy of a mindfulness-based training in primary schools. Methods: A total of 482 children from 13 primary schools were cluster-randomized either to participate in the pro-gram immediately or to wait for half a school year. All chil- dren filled in standardized questionnaires for capturing the classroom climate (FEES3-4), and health-related quality oflife for children (Kidscreen10), and completed aconcentration performance test (d2) at baseline, after 6, 12, and 18 months. During the first 6 months, teachers par-ticipated in a 20-hour mindfulness-based training and prac- ticed for themselves. Afterward, teachers integrated mind- fulness techniques in their daily school routine. For thewait-list group, this program was postponed by 6 months. Results: Analysis of covariance revealed significant between-group differences in 3 scales of the FEES3-4 after 6 months (classroom climate [ P\u00bc.02], willingness to make efforts [ P\u00bc.01], and joy of learning [ P\u00bc.03]). While the score for concentration performance significantly increased from baseline to 18 months in both groups, no significant between-group difference was found. Also no significantdifference in the health-related quality of life index scorewas found. Nevertheless, a significant better general sense of health was observed in the experimental group com- pared to the wait-list at 6 months. However, this differencedid not sustain long term. Conclusion: The learning and practice of mindfulness by teachers alone has a positive influence on students' social interaction and sense of health. Due to nonsignificant group differences at the other time points measured, it can beconcluded that the integration of mindfulness exercises in the classroom does not contribute much to the already existing effects. However, the compliance of the teachersplays a decisive role. OA10.04 Integrating Massage Therapy and Physical Therapy in an Outpatient PediatricOncology Setting Tiffany Silliman Cohen 1, Stacey Caviston1, Tracey Jubelirer1, and Maria Mascarenhas1 1Children's Hospital of Contact: Tiffany Silliman Cohen, sillimanct@email.chop.edu Abstract Purpose: Nonpharmacological-based pain therapies including massage therapy (MT) and physical therapy (PT) are an important component of integrative care models for pediatric cancer patients. The objective is to integrate MTand PT with standard treatment in order to improve func- tion, reduce pain, and alleviate stress in pediatric cancer patients. Methods: In September 2018, a pilot initiative offering MT half a day a week in the outpatient pediatric oncology clinicwas implemented. Through multidisciplinary collaborationsparticularly with nursing and PT, the certified pediatric MT determined patients who would benefit from both therapies to optimize pain control, muscle strength, balance, andAbstracts 23physical functioning. Massage interventions included mas- sage, caregiver education, and instruction on self-massage. Follow-up encounters included assessment of symptoms,reinforcement of techniques, and need for additional support. Results: Fifty-one patients aged 24 months to 24 years; 209 total encounters, 3 to 10 patients per day. \u0081Indications: body pain, muscle tightness, nausea, stress, relaxation, and supportive care. \u0081Patient/family feedback: \" ...helped her calm her anxiety about treatment and helped her back paingo away. I (mom) was happy to learn this technique so I can use it at home;\" \"It feels great, almost puts me to sleep. I look forward to them.\" \u0081Clinical staff feedback: \"I think having massage therapy in clinic has been extremely bene- ficial for our patients and their families. Many of our patients are in clinic for multiple hours ...it has been extremely easy to incorporate massage therapy into this structure.\" \u0081 31/31 evaluations collected indicating massage therapy was a very supportive intervention. \u0081No adverse events. Conclusion: This pilot has shown that it is feasible and beneficial to add pediatric MT into an outpatient oncology clinic. Integrating a complementary therapy such as MTwithPT can help to improve pain, stress, and tight muscles. In addition, it is well received by patients, families and medical team.

Tai Chi (TC) exercise has been shown to improve balance and reduce falls in older adults; however, the neuromuscular mechanisms underlying these benefits are not well understood. This study evaluated the impactof both long- and short-term TC training on lower limb muscle cocontraction and gait characteristics during both single-task (ST) and cognitively-distracted dual-task (DT) overground walking. Methods: Long-term effects of TC training were assessed via cross-sectional comparisons of adult TC-experts (aver- age 24.5 /C612 years of experience) and age- and gender- matched TC-naive adults. Short-term training impact was assessed by randomly assigning TC-naive adults to a 6- month TC training program or a wait-list usual care (UC) control. A cocontraction index (CCI) was quantified from surface electromyography (EMG) of the anterior tibialis and lateral gastrocnemius during preferred walking speed under ST and DT conditions. Stride time was calculated from foot-switch sensors. CCI was calculated for both walking tasks. Results: T wenty-six TC-experts and 60 TC-naive adults were recruited. After baseline testing, 31 TC-naive adults were randomized to TC and 29 to UC. Adjusted linear regression models indicate that TC experts had lower CCI during both ST and DT walking, with differences being greater and statistically significant in DT walking (ST:mean difference (95% CI) \u00bc4.69 (/C01.9, 11.3), (95% CI) \u00bc7.01 (0.6, 13.4), P\u00bc.033). At baseline, a significant negative correlation between CCI and gait speed was also observed in the DT condition (P\u00bc.005) across TC-experts and naives. TC-naive adults randomized to 6 months of TC did not show improvements in CCI, relative to UC controls. Conclusion: Long-term, but not short-term TC training was associated with improved lower extremity neuromus-cular coordination. Understanding how lower extremity EMG dynamics contribute to TC's positive effects on gait and balance warrants further investigation.24 Global Advances in Health and MedicineOA11.02 Mindfulness Training-Based Changes in Fear Processing During AssociativeLearning\u2014A Randomized ControlledFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Investigation Sara Lazar4 1Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 2Department of Neuroradiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany 3Dalhousie University, Dalhousie, New Brunswick, Canada 4Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 5NYU School of Medicine, New York, New York Contact: Gunes Sevinc, gsevinc@mgh.harvard.edu Abstract Purpose: Mindfulness-based interventions to ameliorate anxiety and stress-related symptoms; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these improvements are still largely unknown. Mindfulness meditation provides a basis for enhanced attentional skills and nonjudgmental awareness of sensory experience. Here, we propose that the changes in these attentional and sen- sory systems may modify context-based stimulus-response associations, and that these changes may underlie improve-ments in anxiety and stress-related symptoms following mindfulness-based interventions. Methods: We tested this hypothesis using a well- established contextual fear-learning protocol and a random- ized longitudinal stress reduc- tion (MBSR) (n \u00bc41) or stress management education (SME, n \u00bc25) programs. Behavioral changes and alterations in neural activation patterns associated with fear learning from pre- to postinterventions were assessed using func- tional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A comparison of self-report measures demon- strated that while both interventions decreased stress levels, MBSR resulted in further improvements in anxiety and emotion regulation. Critically, compared to the SME, MBSR intervention was associated with significant increases in connectivity between the amygdala and primary sensory cortex during fear learning. Moreover, while SME was asso- ciated with enhanced BOLD response in superior frontal cortex, MBSR was associated with enhanced activity in pos- terior insula, as well as in primary visual cortices during associative learning.Conclusion: These results indicate that mindfulness train- ing may improve anxiety related symptoms predominantlythough alterations in context-based stimulus-responseassociations of the threat-related stimuli. While stress- management education predominantly leads to changes in top-down modulation of threat, MBSR interventionresulted in neuroplastic changes in sensory associationareas during associative learning. Considering that altera-tions in threat processing have been implicated in the etiology of anxiety and stress-related symptoms, these alterations during associative learning may be a key mecha-nism through which mindfulness-based interventions alterfear learning and foster stress resilience. OA11.03 Impact of MBSR on Brain-Computer Interface James Stieger1, Cline2, Mary Jo Kreitzer2 1Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 2University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota Contact: James Stieger, stieg030@umn.edu Abstract Purpose: Roughly 5 million patients in the United States suffer from paralysis resulting in impaired mobility and com-munication challenges that significantly impact quality of life.Through noninvasively decoding user intent in real-time, brain computer interfaces (BCIs; devices that establish a direct connection between brains and computers) holdthe potential to bypass neuromuscular pathways andrestore mobility and communication. One promisingapproach attempts to decipher motor imagery from the electroencephalogram by recording sensorimotor rhythms, which predictably change in response to real and imaginedmovements. However, major challenges such as long train-ing times and variable proficiency prevent the widespreadclinical adoption of this technology. Methods: We trained individuals in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; a widely accessible mindfulnessintervention) and compared performance and brain activitybefore and after training between randomly assigned trained (n \u00bc33) and untrained control (n \u00bc29) groups. Results: We found significantly greater improvements in BCI control in the MBSR group in tasks that involved com-paring brain activity during motor imagery and to their ability to up-regulate alpha band activ-ity during intentional rest 25t58\u00bc2.61, practice ( r33\u00bc.43,P\u00bc.012). Conclusion: The dose-dependent response of this effect in the MBSR group suggests the recorded patterns are related to meditation practice, however the strongest patterns of alpha upregulation were observed after BCI training.Whether this finding is a direct result of mindfulness prac- tice or represents some interaction between meditation and BCI training could be explored by examining the effectsof neurofeedback on traditional mindfulness training. The strategy of cultivating meditative states during BCI control through MBSR training could have major clinical implicationsincluding better BCI performance, the design of more advanced BCI systems, improved functional health status, and higher quality of life. OA11.04 Differences in Subjective and Physiologic Measures of Anxiety Among ExpertMeditators and Nonmeditators During andAfter Acute Stress Deena Richard Lee1 1Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 2University of Texas, Houston, Texas 3University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Richard Lee, rtlee1@yahoo.com Abstract Purpose: Clinical research has shown the benefit of med- itation techniques to help reduce symptoms of stress. We explored how expert mediators (EMs) differ from nonme- diators (NMs) in their response to acute stress.Methods: We recruited EM (defined as /C213000 h of medi- tation practice) and healthy controls with no meditation experience. Subjects were asked to rest, relax/meditate, undergo the T rier Social Stress T est (TSST), and relax/med-itate again. We collected heart rate (HR), at each stage.Results: Of the 42 people recruited, 6 subjects were removed due to incomplete data or ineligibility. In total, 16 NM and 20 EM were included in this analysis. Subjects had a median age of 40 (20-72) years with 17 females. EMhad an average of 25 000 hours of meditation practice. EM generally had a lower HR throughout the study (64.4-65.9 vs 71.0-73.7, P<.01) with the most significant change duringthe TSST of 8.1% increase for NM vs 0.4% increase in EM (P\u00bc.049). Although SBP was higher among EM, the percent- age change from baseline during the TSST for EM was less than for NM (3.1% vs 7.2%, P\u00bc.03). The STAI-state scores was significantly lower at all stages among EM, especially after the TSST (30.9 vs 45, P\u00bc.002). SAA increase an aver- age of 200% in response to the TSST versus only 16.1% for EM ( P\u00bc.001). Additionally, both SAA and SC were signifi- cantly lower after post-TSST meditation /C018.0% versus 59.1% ( P\u00bc.02). No significant differences were found in the BIS scores and EEG analysis is ongoing. Conclusion: EMs demonstrate smaller changes in both subjective and objective measures of stress during and after the TSST. These data support the benefits of medita- tion to reduce the effects of stress for patients. OA12.01 Long-term Effects of a Cardiovascular Health Supplement on Blood Pressure Classification: A Secondary Analysis Jennifer Ryan1, Douglas Hanes1, and Ryan Bradley1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: Jennifer Ryan, jryan@nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: A secondary analysis was performed to evaluate whether intake of an herbal-mineral supplement that is fre- quently recommended by integrative medicine providers was associated with categorical shifts in blood pressure (BP) classification, according to consensus guidelines. The primary study was designed to prospectively evaluate the safety of the supplement over a 6-month time frame. Methods: Participants (n \u00bc30) with screening BP readings consistent with Joint National Committee (JNC 7) criteria for pre-hypertension (PH) or stage 1 hypertension (S1H) took an herbal-mineral supplement for up to 6 months. The investigated supplement and diastolic BP were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. For the sec- ondary analysis, participants who completed all study visits (n\u00bc19) were individually categorized as normotensive, prehypertensive, stage 1 hypertensive, or stage 2 hyperten- sive according to JNC-7 BP classification at each time point. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate the sig- nificance of differences in BP classification between the 3 time points.26 Global Advances in Health and MedicineResults: Mean systolic BP decreased by 15.0 /C613.2 and mean diastolic BP decreased by 10.5 /C68.4 mmHg between baseline and the 3-month study visit. At the 3-month and 6- month study visits, the percentage of participants catego-rized as normotensive increased and those categorized as hypertensive decreased compared to baseline. Differences in BP classification were significant from baseline to 3 months ( P\u00bc.001) and baseline to 6 months ( P\u00bc.02) but not from 3 months to 6 months. Conclusion: Intake of the herbal-mineral supplement was associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in BP classification. These findings may serve to inform health-care providers who recommend this for- mula to their patients and further justify additional research on the studied formula. OA12.02 Cannabidiol Use by Integrative Medicine Clinic and Cannabis Dispensary Clients inSan Francisco, San Diego, and Chicago: ABraveNet Pilot Study Donald Abrams 1, Claudia Lechuga2, Mariel Connolly3, and Michelle Sexton5 1University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York 3Albert Einstein School of Medicine, New York, New York 4Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 5University of California San Diego, San Diego, California 6Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Donald Abrams, donald.abrams@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Cannabidiol (CBD) has catapulted to the top of the most-favored cannabinoid charts without data from controlled clinical trials to support its use. This survey was designed to assess who was using CBD-dominant can- nabis products, what product type they were using, fre- quency of use, for what conditions and the perception of its effectiveness. Methods: Patients at 3 integrative medicine clinics and clients of 10 partner dispensaries in San Diego, San Francisco, and Chicago who used CBD-dominant products within the past month were recruited to participate in an institutional review board-approved, anonymous onlinesurvey (REDCap). Results: A total of 430 surveys were completed from June 2018 to May 2019. Respondents were white (82%) women (68%) with a mean age of 52.5 years. They were well edu- cated and in a high socioeconomic bracket; 93% reportedno tobacco use and 45% reported no were prescribed opioids. The CBD (2.5%). A CBD:THC ratio of 18:1worked best 25.3% of the participants followed by 1:1for 17.1%. 55.4% used CBD daily. Conditions for whichCBD was used were chronic pain (44.9%), anxiety(44.9%), acute pain (37.0%), stress (29.3%), arthritis(28.1%), insomnia (26.7%), and depression (23.5%). The impact of CBD on conditions was rated on a 0 (not effec- tive) to 10 (highly effective) scale. The mean ratings for 36conditions ranged from 6.0 to 8.4, with 28 greater than 7.5.Information about CBD was obtained from the internet(43.6%), dispensary staff (43.1%), or a physician (8.6%). Conclusion: Despite the fact that information about the use of CBD is not emanating from health-care providers, CBD is being used for a wide range of conditions with self-report of therapeutic benefit as assessed by this 1-timeobservational survey. OA12.04 No Improvement in Disclosure of Natural Health Product Use to Primary Care Physicians in the Last 15 Years: A Survey of Naturopathic Patients Jeremy Y Ng1, Kieran Cooley2, Anna Garber2, Michelle Luong3, and Jason Busse3 1Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada 2The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 3McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Contact: Kieran Cooley, kcooley@ccnm.edu Abstract Purpose: The use of natural health products (NHPs) is common in North America, with many consumers believingthey are safe despite the potential for drug interaction. In2003, we conducted a survey of 198 naturopathic patientsand found that while 93% used NHPs, 42% of users had notdisclosed this information to their primary care physicians.We repeated our survey in 2018/2019 to explore if the rateof NHP use disclosure had improved. Methods: From November 2018 to February 2019, a 21- item survey about NHP use and disclosure was adminis-tered to adult patients who visited the Robert SchadNaturopathic Clinic in T oronto, Canada. MultivariableAbstracts 27logistic regression models were created to explore factors associated with patients' disclosure of NHP use with their primary care physicians and factors associated with physi- cians asking about NHP use. Results: A total of 1112 patients were approached; 277 completed the survey (25% response rate). Almost all were using NHPs (99%, 274 of 277); 46% (126 of 277) were using NHPs and prescription medication concurrently. Similar to our 2003 findings, 42% of respondents who used NHPs (114 of 269) did not disclose this information to their primary care physician, primarily because of concerns that their doctor would not approve of complementary and alternative medicine use (21%, 27 of 131). In the adjusted model, physician inquiry about NHP use was most strongly associated with disclosure by patients (odds ratio, 5.27; 95% confidence interval, 2.57 to 10.78); however, 75% of respondents (201 of 268) indicated their physician did not ask about NHP use. Conclusion: Disclosure of NHP use to physicians by natu- ropathic patients is limited and has remained unchanged over the past 15 years. Future research should explore pri- mary care physicians' hesitancy to inquire about patient NHP use and the effectiveness of quality improvement or implementation strategies to address this persistent issue. OA13.01 The Effect of a 10-Hour Mindfulness Skills- Based Curriculum on the Clinical Practiceof Multispecialty Resident Physicians: A Qualitative Analysis Vincent Minichiello 1, Maureen Goss2, Sarah Webber3, Chris Smith2, Chris Vandivort4, and Bruce Barrett2 1University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 2Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 3Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 4Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin Contact: Vincent Minichiello, vincent.minichiello@fammed.wisc.edu Abstract Purpose: Over the course of 2 academic years, a 10-hour mindfulness skills-based curriculum (Supportive Training for Residents through Education in Mindfulness) was facilitated with resident physicians within the departments of family medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology, and ophthalmology. The intention of the study was to assess the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention on residents' clinical practices.Methods: The 10 hours of mindfulness training was facili- tated during didactic time over the course of 3 months perresidency program on average. Within 2 months posttrain- ing, residents were invited to participate in a voluntary, semistructured phone interview that was subsequentlytranscribed and deidentified. A team of 6 reviewers inde-pendently read the transcripts, identifying themes, and over- arching categories. The reviewers then met to discuss and establish common language regarding these themes. Results: Sixty-nine residents participated in the trainings, and 36 interviews were completed. Although residents received the same mindfulness training and curriculum, many viewed and internalized the training in unique ways.Some residents referred to mindfulness as a tool to be wielded in certain situations, others viewed it as a way to relax and decompress, a method for self-exploration, or asa lens with which to view the world differently. Residentsreported using mindfulness practices most frequently between patient encounters and prior to entering a patient room. These brief practices included mindful walking, deepbreathing, and body scan exercises. Residents found thesemindfulness practices helped them better cope with patient- related frustrations, be less distracted and more present with each of their patients, and maintain an awareness oftheir own stress levels and competing emotions. Conclusion: Across specialties resident physicians found that a 10-hour mindfulness training was influential in their clinical practices. While their perspectives of mindfulnesspractice varied, residents commonly agreed that they were able to apply brief mindfulness interventions to sup- port themselves and patients in clinic. OA13.02 Exploring Effects of Exercise and Mindfulness Training on Cognitive Functionin Adults at Risk of Dementia: The Snyder4 1Miriam Hospital, Brown University School of Medicine, Providence, Rhode Island 2The Miriam Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island 3Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, Rhode Island 4University of Rhode Island, Providence, Rhode Island Contact: Elena Salmoirago-Blotcher, elena_salmoirago-blotcher@- brown.edu28 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore whether mindfulness training (MT),alone or in combination with aerobic exercise training (AT),may improve cognitive function in individuals at risk ofdementia. Methods: Participants with at least 2 risk factors for dementia were randomized to AT (3 sessions/week for12 weeks), MT (1 session/week for 8 weeks), both interven-tions (MT \u00feAT), or usual care (UC). Assessments of cogni- tive function including attention (Digital Symbol SubstitutionT est), executive function (F-A-S verbal fluency test), andepisodic memory (International Shopping List T est) wereconducted at baseline, end of treatment (EOT\u20143 monthssince baseline), and 6 months since baseline. Scores fromeach measure were used to calculate a composite score(Z-scores of Attention, Verbal fluency, and Episodicmemory for Non-demented adults\u2014ZAVEN). Mixedeffects longitudinal models were used to estimate effectson ZAVEN scores at EOT controlling for baseline. Results: Of the 160 screened participants, 87 were eligible and 37 (13 M, 24 F , mean age \u00bc70.0 years (SD 6.9)) were randomized (UC \u00bc7; AT\u00bc10; MT \u00bc10; MT \u00feAT\u00bc10). Retention 94.6%. had significantlyhigher ZAVEN scores (b \u00bc.43, SE\u00bc.18, P\u00bc.03) compared to UC, and nearly significantly higher scores compared to AT(b\u00bc.26, SE\u00bc.17,P\u00bc.10). Similar trends were seen at follow- up, with higher scores in MT versus UC and MT versus AT(P\u00bc. 10). Findings were driven mostly by effects of MT on executive function (b \u00bc9.05, SE \u00bc3.53, P\u00bc.01), and episodic memory (b \u00bc3.99, SE \u00bc2.16, P\u00bc.07). No differences were found with the MT \u00feAT group at EOT or follow-up. Conclusion: These results suggest a possible effect of MT on cognitive function in older individuals at risk of dementia.AT did not improve cognitive function and may require alonger intervention duration to show an effect. Thesepromising findings need to be confirmed in a larger RCT. OA13.03 Mindfulness Instruction Shows Benefit Among HIV-Infected Youth: A Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 2Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 3University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland 4American University, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: Erica Sibinga, esibinga@jhmi.eduAbstract Purpose: Individuals 13 to 24 years old are an alarming 21% of new HIV diagnoses. This age-group is less engagedin care and only 25% achieve HIV viral suppression. Wehave found that mindfulness-based stress reduction(MBSR) for urban youth improves psychological functioning and decreases trauma symptoms. Additionally, our NCCIH- funded pilot study of MBSR with HIV-infected youth sug-gested psychological, cognitive, and HIV viral load benefit.This NCCIH-funded mixed-methods RCT aimed to furtherexplore the effect of versus health education (HT) onHIV medication adherence in HIV-infected youth. Methods: Participants 13 to 24 years old with HIV were recruited from 2 academic medical centers. In-depth inter- views were conducted with 20 individuals at baseline and follow-up, finding perceived MBSR benefit related to partic-ipants' enhanced capacity to observe nonjudgmentally andaccept difficult thoughts, feelings, and experiences associat-ed with living with HIV , which facilitated greater medicationadherence. Quantitative data reported here were collectedat baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Linear additive modelingwas used to compared study arms, accounting for baselinedifferences. Results: Ninety-seven 13-24-year-old participants con- sented and 74 data collection andwere randomized to MBSR or HT. At baseline, the MBSRparticipants had higher HIV viral load, mindfulness, and pos-itive coping ( P<.05). Following programs, MBSR partici- pants had greater increase in medication adherence(P\u00bc.001) and greater decline in HIV viral load ( P\u00bc.052) than HT at 3-month follow-up. Higher at baseline, MBSR participants reported decreased mindfulness at all follow- up time points ( P<.05) and lower positive coping at 12 months ( P\u00bc.009). Conclusion: In this mixed-methods RCT, data suggest that MBSR confers benefit for HIV medication adherence andviral load suppression among HIV-infected youth. Giventhe significant vulnerability of this population and the impor-tance of achieving higher rates of HIV viral suppression to reduce transmission, MBSR remains a promising approach to enhance treatment of HIV-infected youth in effort to endthe HIV epidemic.Abstracts 29OA13.04 Mindfulness Is More Effective at Reducing Affective Pain, Disability, and Depression Than Headache Education for Migraine: A Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial Rebecca and Tim Houle3 1Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina 2University of California-San Diego, San Diego, California 3Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Rebecca Wells, rewells@wakehealth.edu Abstract Purpose: Evaluate 8 weekly classes of a standardized course in mindfulness meditation/yoga (mindfulness-basedstress reduction [MBSR]) versus headache (HA) educationfor migraine, evaluating and affective experimentalpain using quantitative sensory testing (QST). Methods: We conducted a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of MBSR versus HA education for migraine.Participants were blinded to course content; principal inves-tigator/data analysts to group assignment. Eligibility con-firmed with HA specialist evaluation and 4 week HA log.Key completed 12 weeks, 6 months, and9 months. Primary outcome: change in migraine day fre- quency from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes: changes in disability, self-efficacy, pain HA education n \u00bc47), 91 attended 1 \u00feclass over 7 cohorts; analyses conducted on those with follow-up data (n \u00bc76). Most participants were women (92%), Caucasian (88%),46.7 years (SD \u00bc13.01), with 7.9 migraine days/month (SD\u00bc2.92). Both groups reduced migraine days at 12 without significant differences (MBSR Compared to education, MBSR participants had statistically significant improvements ( P<.05) at all follow-up visits compared unpleasantness (butnot intensity) ( /C01.04; [0.056, 2.024]). No adverse events or side effects were reported.Conclusion: MBSR and HA education both decreased migraine frequency, but only mindfulness improved disabil- ity, depression, self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, and pain unpleasantness, with effects persisting 9 months, suggesting a mechanism of affective pain resilience with mindfulness. OA14.01 Comprehensive Lifestyle Modification and Fasting in Patients With the MetabolicSyndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial and Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany 2Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit /C19e-Universit \u20acatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universit \u20acat Berlin, Humboldt-Universit \u20acat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany 3Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Sozialstiftung Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany 4Institute for Medical Sociology, Health Services Research, and Rehabilitation Science at the Faculty of Human Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany 5Department of Integrative and Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany 6Chair of Research Methodology and Statistics, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Health, University Witten/Herdecke, Witten,Germany 7Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Cramer, h.cramer@kliniken-essen-mitte.de Abstract 80% of cardiovascular risk fac- tors can be influenced by the patients' behavior, lifestyle modification is increasingly used as a treatment option for patients with the metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a comprehensive mind-body medicine program for lifestyle modificationincluding a fasting period in patients with the metabolic syndrome compared to a standard lifestyle program. Methods: One hundred forty-five patients with the years) were ran- domly assigned to 10 weeks of (a) comprehensive lifestyle modification (CLM; n \u00bc73) or (b) the DASH diet combined with exercise and relaxation (n \u00bc72). CLM included an30 Global Advances in Health and Medicineinitial 5-day fasting intervention followed by 10 weekly 6- hour group meetings focusing on nutrition, aerobic exer- cise, mindfulness, yoga, and cognitive restructuring. Coprimary outcome measures were 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure and the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) Index. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric, laboratory, and self-report measures. Outcomes were assessed at weeks 1 (after the fasting week), 12 (after the lifestyle programs), and 24 (follow-up). Results: After the fasting week, effects favoring CLM over DASH occurred for the HOMA Index ( P\u00bc.047), body mass ( P\u00bc.014). Few significant group differences were found at week 12 and 24. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusion: Fasting induced positive short-term effects in patients with the metabolic syndrome; however, these effects were not maintained in the longer term. Fasting can thus be considered a treatment option for this patient group, although it remains to be investigated whether and how the effects of fasting can be maintained in the longer term. OA14.02 How to Capture Clinical Experience\u2014An Example From Case Reporting in ViscumAlbum Extract Therapy Paul G Werthmann 1, Helmut Kiene1, and Gunver Kienle2,3 1Institute for Applied Epistemology and Medical Methodology at the University of Witten/Herdecke, Freiburg, Germany 2Center for Complementary Medicine, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Medical Center\u2014University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg 3IFAEMM at the University of Witten/Herdecke, Werthmann, have been inten- sively investigated preclinically and clinically, particularly with regard to antitumoral activity, immunomodulation, quality of live, survival, and safety. Doctors with high expe- rience in VAE therapy describe treatment regimens and clinically significant outcomes not reported in published studies of VAE. Similar to the NCI Best Case SeriesProgram, we investigated these additional experiences in high-quality CARE guideline compliant case reports. Methods: We asked doctors for cases of VAE therapy in cancer patients which they regarded to show a clinicallysignificant outcome connected to VAE therapy. The recruit-ment strategy included requests via e-mail lists and meet-ings as well as contacts from a qualitative study with expertdoctors in VAE therapy. We assessed the cases for rele-vance (clinically significant outcome in comparison withthe literature) and ran them through a validation process:check for data completeness; triangulation of reevaluation of crucial diagnostic andfollow-up tests; and discussion with experts. All patients/relatives gave informed consent. Results: A total of 111 cases were recruited; 91 cases were excluded in the assessment process, mainly for relevanceand validity; 9 cases were published in peer-reviewed med-ical journals; and 11 are still being investigated. Olderpatient data often were incomplete and made validationimpossible. The published case reports cover the tumorsites: skin, pancreas, kidney, ovary, pleura, skull, and lym-phatic tissue. VAE was administered subcutaneously, intra-venously, and intralesionally. In some of the cases, unusuallyhigh dosages of VAE were used. Outcomes were long-termsurvival, tumor regression, improvement of quality of life,and reduced side effects from cancer treatment. Conclusion: Significant clinical observations of VAE thera- py could be captured, elaborated scientifically, and publishedas case reports in peer-reviewed medical journals. Oursearch and elaboration procedure could be a model ofhow to capture relevant clinical experience. OA14.03 Public Feedback on the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association GuidingPrinciples for Letter Writing: A Mixed-Methods Study Janet Nguyen 1, Jennifer Hunter2, Lorraine Smith1, and Joanna E Harnett1 1University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia 2Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia Contact: Janet Nguyen, jngu0475@uni.sydney.edu.au Abstract Interprofessional communication optimise the safe deliv-ery of patient-centred care. In response to calls from HCP ,the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association (AIMA)established an interdisciplinary working group to developan IPC Guiding Principles for Letter Writing that includedAbstracts 31letter templates for medical practitioners, pharmacists, nurses, allied health and complementary medicine practi- tioners. Development included stakeholder consultation on the draft document. This study aimed to analyse thepublic consultation feedback; explore respondents' atti-tudes toward, and perceptions of IPC; and ascertain HCPneeds and preferences for further education. Methods: A mixed-methods study design was used to ana- lyse the results from an online public consultation surveyand paper questionnaires from AIMA IPC workshop partic-ipants. Quantitative and qualitative data from the 2 datasetswere merged utilising the principles of triangulation to iden- tify meta-themes. Results: The 117 respondents (64 from the public consul- tation survey and 53 workshop participants) were repre-sentative of the Australian health-care sectors and the laycommunity. There was a consensus amongst respondents that formal communication, such as letters of correspon- dence, between HCP is important (n \u00bc96/117; 82%), the content presented in the guiding principles document orworkshop was informative (n \u00bc61/117; 52%) and easy to understand (n \u00bc49/117; 42%), and the letter templates were relevant to clinical practice (n \u00bc56/117; 48%). The key themes relating to IPC were the importance of conti- nuity of care, clarity of communication, professionalism, andongoing education. Results from the 2 samples were con-gruent with no significant statistical nor qualitative differ-ences identified. Conclusion: The AIMA IPC Guiding Principles for Letter Writing document was deemed valuable to HCP . Feedbackfrom respondents will be used to revise the document priorto AIMA endorsement. The findings highlight the role offormal communication pathways in providing multidiscipli- nary care that is safe, coordinated, and patient centred, and the need for further IPC training and education.

A 2015 survey of undergraduate and graduate nurs-ing programs indicated that few programs fully incorporatedan integrative, whole-person approach to care, and symp- tom management (Miller & Linck, 2019). A transformed high-quality health-care system requires that nursing facultyand academic leaders be prepared to transform nursing education to prepare our workforce. This presentation highlights the program and outcomes of the University of Arizona College of Nursing's 12-month Integrative Nursing Fellowship. Methods: Personal attributes for fellows (n \u00bc53) were evaluated by pre/posttest self-report methods using the Integrative Medicine Attitude Questionnaire, Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Arizona Lifestyle Inventory, and Bandura-style self- efficacy inventories. A 6-month post-Fellowship open- ended survey and focused interviews evaluated curricularoutcomes (eg, new/revised programs, changes in teaching/ learning methods, revised clinical practice competencies).Results: One new entry BSN and 1 new graduate (MSN/ CNL) program were developed, approved, and launched. Curricular changes included application of complex adaptivesystems thinking across didactic and clinical settings; model- ing student-centered, relationship-based teaching/learning (T/L) methods, incorporation of aesthetics and humanities across courses and programs, required skill development in mind and body therapies, and integration of self-care modal- ities requirements and competencies with time appropriat- ed for these activities. Significant results from paired ttest on personal attributes indicated: increased depth of knowl- edge about integrative nursing content P\u00bc.002); well-being ( P<.001). Conclusion: T ransforming care requires faculty proficient in developing, implementing, and evaluating curricula based on the concepts and principles of integrative care delivery. This immersive experience resulted in positive changes in both curricular/program design and T/L strategies thatreflect integrative concepts and principles. OA15.01 Cochrane Risk of Bias T ool 2.0: Assessing Performance and Detection Bias inSystematic Reviews of Unblinded Trials L Susan Wieland 1and Joel Gagnier2 1Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland, Laurel, Maryland 2University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan Contact: L. Susan Wieland, lswieland@gmail.com32 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: Cochrane systematic reviews are considered the gold standard for evaluating the evidence on interventions. A core component of Cochrane methodology is the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1.0), which is used to assess the quality of included trials and contributes to the overall assessment of certainty for review outcomes. In 2019, RoB 1.0 was updated to RoB 2.0. It is important to evaluate how RoB 2.0 assesses quality in trials where blind- ing is difficult, impossible, or inappropriate. Methods: RoB 2.0 covers selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias, and reporting bias. We assessed the criteria and rating instructions for each bias domain and considered whether these had changed since RoB 1.0 and if so how this might impact the overall assess- ment of evidence from unblinded trials. Results: RoB 2.0 criteria and rating instructions for selec- tion bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias have been elab- orated but have not substantively changed from RoB 1.0. Criteria for performance bias and detection bias in unblind- ed trials have changed. Unblinded trials are no longer auto- matically rated at high risk of performance bias, but subjec- tive outcomes (eg, pain) in unblinded trials are now automatically at high risk of detection bias, even if obtained through a blinded assessor. New RoB 2.0 criteria for assess-ing overall risk of bias mean that subjectively experienced outcomes from unblinded trials cannot be at low risk of bias in systematic reviews. Conclusion: According to RoB 2.0, it is not possible to have low risk of bias and high certainty of the evidence for important patient-relevant outcomes from reviews of unblinded trials. We question the appropriateness and util-ity of these judgments, particularly in pragmatic trials, which should not be blinded. We suggest some alternative approaches to assessing the risk of detection bias for these outcomes and propose collaboration to develop rec- ommendations on this topic. OA15.02 The eMCCTM: A Validated Taxonomy of Skills Learned Through MindfulnessPractice Ruth Wolever 1, Joel A Kahn2, Jennifer Davis3, Denise Shields4, and Poppy Schoenberg1 1Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee 2First Line Software Inc., Boston, Massachusetts 3Duke-National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore 4eMindful, Orlando, Florida Contact: Ruth Wolever, ruth.wolever@vanderbilt.eduAbstract Purpose: Along the lines of the Precision Medicine Model, the purpose of this presentation is to describe the 2-phase content validation process used for a taxonomy of skills learned from mindfulness practice that will allow more tar-geted interventions to address skill-deficits in defined clin- ical conditions. Methods: Phase I (development) utilized 11 subject matter experts (SMEs) over 5 months. Phase II (judgment) enrolled 60 international SMEs from 116 invited through snowballsampling. Per American Association for Public Opinion Research guidelines, participation rate for this nonprobability, targeted SME sampling was calculated at 52% for the primarytier, and 42 SMEs also rated the secondary tiers. SMEs were mostly white (80%) or Asian (15%) women (70%) with long- standing personal mindfulness practices (M \u00bc20 years; SD\u00bc9.6) and extensive 59% >50 years; 88% had graduate degrees. SMEs rated the relevance and clarity to calculateIndividual Content Validity Indices (I-CVIs) for each category per tier, and Average CVIs (ave-CVIs) for entire tiers. Results: I-CVIs ranged from 0.57 to 0.97, suggesting the removal of 1 category from the primary tier, leaving an ave- CVI for relevance of 0.92 (range 0.73-0.97). Clarity tier (ave-CVI \u00bc0.75; of I-CVI \u00bc0.52- 0.88) necessitated exploration of the subcategories of Awareness (second tier; N \u00bc42) to refine description (ave-CVI \u00bc0.80 for clarity; range 0.64-0.93) while showing excellent content validity for both relevance and fit (ave- CVI\u00bc0.95; range 0.88-1.0 for both). Conclusion: The eMCC TMis the first validated taxonomy of skills learned through mindfulness practice, created tosupport development of more precise mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) that target skill-deficits associated with clinical conditions. Further research will validate sub-categories, associate specific practices per category, andassess Mindfulness Based Interventions designed to target specific skills from the eMCC TM. OA15.03 Use of Network Meta-analysis to Assess Complementary Medicine Interventions:A Scoping Review Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Alberta, Canada 2University of Maryland, Center for Integrative Medicine, Laurel, Maryland Contact: L. Susan Wieland, lswieland@gmail.comAbstracts 33Abstract Purpose: In the last decade, network meta-analysis (NMA) has become a well-established knowledge synthesis tech- nique used in systematic reviews (SR) to compare multiple treatments based on all available direct and indirect evi- dence. Its extent of use to compare therapies in the realm of complementary medicine (CAM) intervention has not been assessed. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was per- formed to identify reviews with NMAs involving 1 ormore CAM interventions. An information specialist execut- ed a multidatabase search, and 2 reviewers performed study selection and data collection. Information on publication characteristics, diseases studied, interventions compared, reporting transparency, outcomes assessed, and other parameters were extracted from each review. Results: A total of 90 SR/NMAs were included. The largest number of NMAs was generated from China (40%), fol- lowed by the United Kingdom (12.2%) and the United States (8.9%). Reviews were published between 2010 and 2018, with the majority published between 2015 and 2018 (85.6%). More than 90 different CAM therapies appeared atleast once, and the median # per NMA was 2 (interquartile range 1-4); 20% of reviews consisted of only CAM thera- pies. Dietary supplements (51.1%) and vitamins and miner- als (42.2%) were the most commonly studied therapies, followed by electrical stimulation (31.1%), herbal medicines (24.4%), and acupuncture and related treatments (22.2%). A diverse set of conditions was identified, the most common being various forms of cancer (11.1%), osteoarthritis of the hip/knee (7.8%), and depression (5.9%). Most reviews ade- quately majority of the PRISMA NMA exten- sion items; however, there were limitations in indication of an existing review protocol, methods to explore network geometry (and related findings), and exploration of risk of bias across studies such as publication bias. Conclusion: Use of NMA to assess CAM interventions is growing rapidly worldwide. Efforts to identify priority topics for future CAM-related NMAs and enhance methods for CAM comparisons with conventional medicine are needed.OA15.04 Mind-Body Medicine for Chronic Pain: Engaging Stakeholders in Establishing Priorities for Development and Dissemination of Cochrane ReviewEvidence L Susan Wieland 1, Claudia Witt2, and Brian Berman3 1Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland, Laurel, Maryland 2University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland 3The Institute of Integrative Health, Baltimore, Maryland Contact: L Susan Wieland, lswieland@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The systematic review evidence for effective mind-body therapies for chronic pain is fragmentary anddissemination of information from existing reviews could be improved. T o guide the development and dissemination of such evidence, the Cochrane Complementary MedicineField (CAM Field) sought to question stakeholders (clini-cians, researchers, and patients/carers) about needs for information on mind-body therapies for chronic pain. Methods: We developed and tested a survey with the CAM Field Advisory Board in 2018 and then disseminateda revised and expanded online questionnaire through a range of social media channels in 2019. We collected dem- ographics and desires for more information on topics sur-rounding 6 chronic pain conditions (eg, chronic back pain)and 12 mind-body therapies (eg, mindfulness) defined by our funder. We extracted the top 3 information needs over- all and among respondents who were patients/carers onlyand compared these topics to available evidence in theCochrane Library. Results: There were 619 respondents from all continents, with the majority from North America or Europe (85%).Respondents self-identified as patients/caregivers (n \u00bc250), researchers (n \u00bc138), CAM clinical practitioners (n \u00bc136), or conventional clinicians (n \u00bc121). Information was most often desired on acupuncture/acupressure (n \u00bc6 condi- tions), meditation/mindfulness (n and yoga (n \u00bc3). Relevant Cochrane acupuncture reviews were published between 2005 and 2018 and updates of 2010 and 2016 reviews are ongoing. There is 1 relevantCochrane yoga review being updated and 1 at protocolstage. Only 1 relevant Cochrane review exists for mindful- ness or for massage. Conclusion: There is a need to update most Cochrane reviews of acupuncture for chronic pain and to producenew reviews of mindfulness/meditation, massage, and yoga. The CAM Field is working with Cochrane review groups to produce or update reviews, developing strategiesto disseminate the results of these reviews when34 Global Advances in Health and Medicinecompleted, and looking at how best to use non-Cochrane evidence in the meantime. OA16.02 A Novel Porcine Model to Study the Impact of Active Stretching on Inflammation:Preliminary Findings Dennis Mu ~noz Vergara 1, Lisbeth 3BWH, Boston, Massachusetts 4Harvard University/BWH, Massachusetts Contact: Dennis Vergara, dmunozvergara@bwh.harvard.edu Abstract Purpose: Active stretching targeting connective tissues is integral to mind-body therapies including yoga and Tai Chi.These therapies show promise in relieving musculoskeletalpain, but the biological mechanisms underlying therapeuticeffects remain largely unknown. We have previously studied the impact of active stretching on inflammatory processes in a rat model. Here, we extend this work to a porcine modelwhich closer resembles the human musculoskeletal system.We tested the feasibility of an active stretching paradigm inpigs and report preliminary findings on the impact ofstretching on local tissue inflammation by measuring inflam-matory lesion size, granulocyte and macrophage infiltration,and systemic inflammatory markers. Methods: We trained 12 pigs to stretch before subcuta- neous bilateral Carrageenan injection in the back at the L3vertebrae, 2 cm from the midline. We randomized them toNo-Stretch (NS) or Stretch ((S); 2 /C2/day for 5 min over 48 h)); 72 hours post-injection, animals were anesthetizedfor blood collection. Lesion area was measured in situ with calipers and cells harvested and stained with CD-45, granulocyte, and CD163 mAbs. RvD1, the serum and lesion by ELISA. Results: Active stretching was well tolerated. On average, lesion size was significantly smaller in the S versus NS (1058 mm 2/C6SEM78.41 vs 678.6 mm2/C6SEM106.9; P\u00bc.009). On average, S lesions contained fewer granulocytes and macro-phages than the NS group. While in serum, resolvin RvD1and LXA4 levels were increased on average, and PDG2 levelwas decreased in the S compared with NS, but these differ-ences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: A porcine model shows promise for studying the impact of active stretching on inflammation and muscu-loskeletal health. Active stretching twice a day for 48 hresulted in reduced inflammatory lesion size, consistent with previous studies of active stretching in rodents. Future studies with larger samples and higher stretching doses are warranted. OA16.03 Electroacupuncture at Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 2Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China Contact: EunMee Yang, eunmeeyang@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Excessive inflammation in myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with exacerbated myocardial injury. Attenuating inflammation has been proposed as a potentialstrategy for improving myocardial repair in MI. In previous studies, electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to mod- erate inflammation and exert beneficial effects in various heart-related conditions, but its efficacy and immune- modulating effects on MI are unclear. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to undergo MI induction (ie, surgical ligation of the left coro- nary artery) (MI; n \u00bc10), MI induction followed by electro- acupuncture \u00bc10) or control sham surgery (SO; n\u00bc10). EA was administered 30 minutes post-MI at bilater- al PC6 for 20 minutes at 1 mA and 2/15 Hz. Serum and myocardial tissue samples were collected at 4-hour post-MI and evaluated by ELISA for myocardial injury (cTnT, MK) and cytokines (TNF- a, and by treated with EA showed enzymes compared of CD86, pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages (SO vs MI, P<.005) and reduced CD206, anti-inflammatory M2-macrophages (SO vs MI, P<.005), EA significantly induced macrophage polarization from the M1 to M2 subtype.Abstracts 35Conclusion: This study demonstrates that EA can attenu- ate myocardial injury and inflammation in the postinfarctedheart. The findings also provide new insight about the ability of EA to regulate macrophage polarization in MI. While these findings suggest that acupuncture is cardio-protective, potentially through its immune-modulatingeffects, more research is needed to better understand themechanisms and clinical implications of acupuncture for MI. OA16.04 Therapeutic Effect of Mantidis Ootheca Extract in Radiation-Induced T Yun Cheol Moon1, Joong Sun Kim1 1Korea Naju-si, Republic Joong Sun Kim, centraline@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: Mantidis Pharmacopoeia, is an importantherbal material that has been traditionally used for treatingseveral medical conditions including spermatorrhea andpediatric enuresis in Korea. We evaluated the effect ofMO on testicular injury in mouse after radiation exposure. Methods: MO (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) was orally administrat- ed to male C57BL/6 mice by for 3 weeks pelvic irradiationexposure, and histological parameters were assessed at 8 hand 35 days postirradiation. Results: The MO attenuated radiation-induced apoptosis in germ cells after 8 hours after irradiation. MO protectedtesticular morphological changes, such as changes in semi-niferous epithelial height after radiation exposure. In addi-tion, the remaining proliferating germ cells were higher inthe MO-treated group than in the radiation group. MOtreatment significantly increased testis weight comparedwith irradiation controls at 35 days. The decrease in the sperm count in epididymis caused by irradiation was coun- teracted by MO. Conclusion: The present study suggests that MO protects form radiation induced testicular injury via an anti-apoptoticeffect and recovery of spermatogenesis.Poster Abstracts P01: Basic Science P01.01 Caffeic Acid and II (F2): Possible Mechanism of Lonicerae japonicae Flos(Jinyinhua) Beijing, China Contact: Chen Bai, bc@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: At present, the clinical treatment of pneumonia is mainly anti-infective and late hormone shock therapy. Asa kind of traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Lonicerae japo- nicae Flos (Jinyinhua) can effectively reverse the progress of pneumonia and has low toxic side effects. This study looksat finding its core small molecules and related biological mechanisms. Methods: We confirmed the therapeutic effect of Lonicerae japonicae Flos on pneumonia by animal experiments and identified the significant substances by liquid chromatogra-phy. Using bioinformatics methods, we carried out target fishing and text mining for these small molecules and clus- tered and enriched the target proteins related to pneumo-nia. We use molecular docking to find the most prominent binding pattern of small molecular ligands to protein receptors. Results: The treatment of rat pneumonia with Lonicerae japonicae Flos has the effect of close to dexamethasone, which can reduce the inflammation of lung tissue. A total of 31 compounds were identified in the aqueous extract, which mapped to 366 pneumonia-associated proteins andenriched 46 pathways. The core mechanism factor 2- energy of caffeic acid to coagulation factor is/C06.0 kcal/mol, and the molecule is tightly bound to the groove portion of the protein receptor. Conclusion: Caffeic acid participates in the interaction of neuronal receptor ligands on the plasma membrane by bind- ing to coagulation factor 2 and exerts the therapeutic effectofLonicerae japonicae Flos on pneumonia. The results have36 Global Advances in Health and Medicineexperimental value for further synthesis and exploration, and related research methods can be applied to the explo- ration of other small molecules of traditional Chinese medicine. P01.05 Auricular Acupuncture Modulates Elevated Blood Pressure Through Neural Abstract Purpose: Auricular acupuncture (AA) is used empirically to manage cardiovascular disorders, including elevated blood pressure (BP). However, precise mechanisms under- lying its effects remain unclear. One previous study showed that AA applied at the \"heart acupoint\" (CO15, the center of the inferior concha) activates neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) through vagal inputs, but its actions on NTS processing and downstream influence on the nucle- us regulating cardiovascular function have not been studied. The present study evaluated medullary processing during modulation of elevated BP by the AA. We hypothesized that manual AA (MAA) activates the NTS and ultimately inhibit rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM), a critical region controlling cardiovascular function, through opioid and GABA mechanisms. Methods: In Sprague-Dawley rats subjected gastric distension (GD) under anesthesia, MAA was per- formed at a frequency of /C242 Hz for 4 minutes every 10 minutes during a 30-minute period, 2 minutes in each side of the ear. During sham-MAA, the needle was inserted into the same acupoint without subsequent mechanical stimulation. Unilateral microinjection of the chemical (50 nL) was conducted in the NTS and rVLM. Results: We observed that GD-induced elevation in BP was significantly attenuated by MAA at CO15 (n \u00bc8; was markedly (P<.05) reversed by microinjection of kynurenic acid (25 mM; n \u00bc7) into the NTS as well as naloxone (1 mM; a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist; n \u00bc8) into the rVLM, but not by their vehicles, 0.9% normal saline. Conclusion: Our data suggest that AA at CO15 excites the NTS through a glutamatergic mechanism, which, in turn,attenuate excitatory cardiovascular reflexes evoked by vis- ceral stimulation through and opioids in the rVLM. Research on Immunoregulatory Mechanisms of Xilei Powder Treating OralUlcer Based on Methods of NetworkPharmacology Ling Huang 1and Mei Jiang1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Ling Huang, j8k9lh@126.com Abstract Purpose: Xilei powder (XP) is a traditional Chinese med- icine for treatment of oral ulcer. Based on the methods of network pharmacology, the authors aim to explore the potential targets and immunoregulatory mechanisms of XP and provide a scientific basis for the further explanationof the mechanism for treating oral ulcer. Methods: A database of XP correlated targets was estab- lished based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database with Lipinski's Rule of Five as a filter condition. The screened proteins were searched inthe Universal Protein Database (Uniprot) for the corre- sponding gene names, which were matched with the genes related to oral ulcer retrieved from the Comparative T oxicogenomics Database. And the interac- tions between identical targets were analyzed by Retrievalof interacting Genes/Proteins website. Moreover, the immunoregulatory signaling pathways of XP treating oral ulcer were screened on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the network of molecular-target- pathway was constructed by Cytoscape. Results: We obtained 52 molecular compounds from XP with 39 targets of treating oral ulcer. By analyzing the enrichment of biological process and KEGG pathways, we can found that mechanism of XP for oral ulcer is related to immune inflammatory, small molecule metabolism, hor-mone level regulation of hormone and neurotransmitter, by regulating interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, T oll-like receptor signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and other inflammatory-related pathways. Conclusion: Complex regulation of IL-17 signaling path- receptor signaling pathway, Th17 differen- tiation, TNF signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling path- way may play vital roles in the treatment of XP for oral ulcer.Abstracts 37P01.07 Analysis on Mechanisms and Medication Rules of Prescriptions for Female Urogenital Diseases Based on Methods of Data Mining and Network Pharmacology Ling Huang1and Mei Jiang1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Ling Huang, j8k9lh@126.com Abstract Purpose: Based on the methods of data mining and net- work pharmacology, the authors aim to explore the medi-cation rules of prescriptions for female urogenital diseases (FUDs) and provide a scientific basis for the further expla- nation of the mechanism of prescriptions for FUD. Methods: New prescriptions were extracted by entropy clustering analyzing the literatures of case reports aboutFUD treated by Traditional Chinese formula. A databaseof new prescriptions correlated targets was established based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database with Lipinski's Rule of Five. Thescreened proteins were searched in the Universal ProteinDatabase (Uniprot) for the corresponding gene names,which were matched with the genes related to FUDretrieved from the Comparative T oxicogenomics Database. And the interactions between identical targets of new prescriptions and FUD were analyzed by Retrievalof interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) website for biolog-ical processes and Kyoto of andGenomes pathways enrichments. Cytoscape. Results: T wenty-one prescriptions were included, contain- ing 54 herbs, 1192 herbal targets and 52 disease targets. T endrug-disease intersection targets predicted 6 mainly relatedpathways and relevant biological processes (FDR <0.05). In the network comprised with those functioning targets, there were signaling pathways associated with hormoneresponse and immune response, namely, oxytocin path-way, GnRH signaling signaling pathway,T cell receptor signaling pathway, T oll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and so on. The medication rules of was coordinating heart Yang andkidney Yin on the early stage, and nourishing liver andkidney on the advanced stage. It was affected by complexmultitargets and multipathways related with phagosome andNOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Conclusion: The mechanism of new prescriptions for FUD might be the hormone response and immune response.It was affected by complex multitargets andmultipathways related with hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary reproductive axis. P01.08 Digital Gene Expression Profiling Analysis of A549 Cells Cultured with PM10 in MoxaSmoke Xin Hui 1, Hao Wang1, and Baixiao Zhao1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Xin Hui, jeshui@126.com Abstract Purpose: Digital gene expression profiling (DGE), a next- generation gene sequencing technology, was used to observe the effect of moxa smoke PM10 on the geneexpression profile of human lung expressed genes (DEGs) iden- tified after PM10 treatment were screened, and their expression patterns were analyzed by cluster analysis, gene ontology (GO) function significance enrichment anal- ysis, and pathway significance enrichment analysis. The DEGs during PM10 intervention in A549 cells and their biological processes and major signal transduction pathways were screened. The relationship between the DEGs and the A549 cell cycle and apoptosis was analyzed. Results: The main results are as follows: (1) compared with the control group, there were 1109 DEGs after 4 hours of intervention and 3565 DEGs after 20 hours of intervention. Compared with 4 hours of smoking interven- tion, there were 2149 DEGs after 20 hours of intervention. (2) There were 316 DEGs identified over the course of the intervention (4 h, 20 h). These genes were mainly upregu- lated after 4 hours of intervention and downregulated after 20 hours of intervention. (3) The biological functions of the differentially expressed genes showed significant enrich- ment. (4) Some pathways showed significant enrichment. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that moxa smoke PM10 has many types of biological activities and can lead to differentially expressed genes in A549 cells involved in var- ious biological processes. Moxa smoke PM10 is both posi- tive and harmful to the body, so it is necessary to carry out further research on moxa smoke.38 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP01.09 Antidementia Effects of Herbal Formulas Bojungikgi-Tang and Hwangryunhaedok- Tang in Animal Models: Correlation Between Korean and Western Medicines inthe Concept of T ypes Soo-Jin Republic of Korea Contact: Soo-Jin Jeong, sjijeong@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: Pattern identification, also known as syndrome differentiation, is an essential part of diagnosis in Korean medicine (KM). The treatment of dementia in KM is based on the pattern identification theory including excess and deficiency syndromes. We hypothesized that each pat- tern of dementia in KM is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease in Western medicine. Methods: The effects of Bojungikgi-tang, a herbal formula for deficiency syndrome, and Hwangryunhaedok-tang, a herbal formula for excess syndrome, were investigated byapplying to Alzheimer's and vascular dementia-like animal models, respectively. Results: Our data revealed that Bojungikgi-tang has neuro- protective effects and ameliorates memory on memory impairment by reducing cholinergic system dysfunction in a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion rat model. Conclusion: Overall, our findings may provide the scien- tific evidences for application of herbal formulas for the dementia treatment based on the pattern identification theory in KM. P01.10 Pharmacodynamic Basis of Bushencuyun Decoction in Treatment of FemaleInfertility Based on LC-MS and MolecularDocking Strategy Mei Jiang 1, Ling Huang1, and Jia Kang2 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing,, China 2Gulou Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical School, Beijing, China Contact: Mei Jiang, lhuang@bucm.edu.cnAbstract Purpose: Bushencuyun decoction (BCD) is a formula con- Chinese herb such as Lycium barbarum . BCD has been shown to be effective in the clinical treatment of female infertility. T o explore the pharmacodynamic materialbasis of BCD in the treatment of female infertility based on liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) and molecular docking strategy. Methods: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to identify the chemical compounds of BCD. The disease targets of female infertility were screened from the ComparativeT oxicogenomics Database (CTD). And the protein-protein interactions were analyzed by Retrieval of interacting Genes/Proteins online. The molecular docking technologywas used to verify the relationship between the chemical compounds and common targets of BCD for female infer- tility, so as to find out the potential pharmacodynamic basis. Results: Based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, 12 active compounds were identified in BCD, including types of flavonoids, triter- penoid, saponins, and so on. Based on molecular docking technology, we certified that flavonoids, triterpenoid, and saponins were potential pharmacodynamic material basis ofBCD for female infertility. We found that estrogen receptor (ESR1), estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), progesterone receptor (PGR), and vascular endothelial growth factor A(VEGFA) were identified as the key targets of BCD for female infertility by CTD database and topological analysis. Conclusion: LC-MS and molecular docking strategy can find the potential pharmacodynamic substance basis of BCD for female infertility. BCD may treat female infertility due flavonoids, P01.11 Analysis on Mechanisms and Medication Rules of Prescriptions for Uterine FibroidsBased on Methods of Data Mining and Network Pharmacology Mei Jiang 1and Ling Huang1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Mei Jiang, lhuang@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: Based on the methods of data mining and net- work pharmacology, the authors aim to explore the medi- cation rules of prescriptions for uterine fibroids and provide a scientific basis for the further explanation of the mecha-nism of prescriptions for uterine fibroids. Methods: New prescriptions were extracted by entropy clustering analyzing the literatures of case reports aboutAbstracts 39uterine fibroids treated by T raditional Chinese formula. A database of new prescriptions correlated targets were established based on the T raditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database with Lipinski's Rule ofFive. The screened proteins were searched in the Universal Protein Database (Uniprot) for the corresponding gene names, which were matched with the genes related touterine fibroids retrieved from the Comparative T oxicogenomics Database. And the interactions between identical targets of new prescriptions and uterine fibroids were analyzed by Retrieval of interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) website for biological processes and KyotoEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways enrich- ments. Moreover, the network of herb-compound-target- signaling pathway was showed by Cytoscape. Results: Sixty-seven prescriptions were included, contain- ing 145 herbs, 2531 herbal targets, and 46 disease targets. Fifteen drug-disease intersection targets predicted 75 relat- ed pathways and relevant biological processes (FDR <0.05). In the network comprised with those functioning targets, there were signaling pathways associated with hormone response and immune response, namely, oxytocin signalingpathway, ovarian steroidogenesis, estrogen signaling path- way, GnRH signaling pathway, porolactin signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, T oll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and so on. Conclusion: The mechanism of new prescriptions for uterine fibroids might be the hormone response and immune response. It was affected by complex multitargetsand multipathways related with female abdominal neo- plasm's pathways, yet specific regulatory mechanism still need further studies to explore and verify. P01.12 Research on Endocrine Mechanisms of Wuziyanzong Pill Treating Male InfertilityBased on Methods of NetworkPharmacology Mei Jiang 1and Ling Huang1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Mei Jiang, lhuang@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: Based on the methods of network pharmacology, the authors aim to explore the potential targets and endo- crine mechanisms of Wuziyanzong Pill (WP) and provide a scientific basis for the further explanation of the mechanism for treating male infertility. Methods: A database of WP correlated targets was estab- lished based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine SystemsPharmacology Database with Lipinski's Rule of Five as a filter condition. The screened proteins were searched in the Universal Protein Database (Uniprot) for the corre- sponding gene names, which were matched with the genes related to male infertility retrieved from the Comparative T oxicogenomics Database. And the interac- tions between identical targets were analyzed by Retrieval of interacting Genes/Proteins website. Moreover, the endo- crine signaling pathways of WP treating male infertility were screened on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the network of molecular-target-pathway was constructed by Cytoscape. Results: We obtained 58 molecular compounds, 230 tar- gets of WP , and 32 340 targets of male infertility. The common targets of WP treating male infertility were 129. The Pvalue of protein-protein interactions enrichment is under 1.0e /C016. In the network comprised with those func- tioning targets, there were 53 key targets proteins and 168 KEGG pathways and relevant biological processes (FDR<0.05). Among them, 10 KEGG pathways were asso- ciated action, naling pathway, prolactin signaling pathway, estrogen signal- ing pathway, insulin signaling pathway, progesterone- mediated oocyte maturation, oxytocin signaling pathway, GnRH ovarian steroidogenesis, oocyte meiosis. Conclusion: The endocrine mechanisms of WP treating male infertility is probably concerned with complex signal- ing pathways, yet specific regulatory mechanisms still need further studies to explore and verify.

We evaluated the effect of MO on testicular injury in mouse after radiation exposure. Methods: MO (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) was orally administrat- ed to male C57BL/6 mice by for 3 weeks pelvic irradiationexposure, and histological parameters were assessed at 8 hand 35 days post irradiation. Results: The MO attenuated radiation-induced apoptosis in germ cells after 8 h after irradiation. MO protected tes-ticular morphological changes, such as changes in seminifer-ous epithelial height after radiation exposure. In addition, the remaining proliferating germ cells were higher in the MO-treated group than in the radiation group. MO treat-ment significantly increased testis weight compared withirradiation controls at 35 days. The decrease in the spermcount in epididymis caused by irradiation was counteractedby MO. Conclusion: The present study suggests that MO protects form radiation induced testicular injury via an anti-apoptoticeffect and recovery of spermatogenesis. P01.16 Acceptance Skills Training Reduces Loneliness and Increases Social Contact:Dismantling Mindfulness Training in aRandomized Controlled Trial Emily Lindsay 1, Shinzen Young2, Kirk Brown3, Joshua Smyth4, and J David Creswell5 1University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 2Unified Mindfulness, Burlington, Vermont 3Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Vermont 4Penn State University, State College, Pennsylvania 5Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Contact: Emily Lindsay, ekl24@pitt.edu Abstract Purpose: Loneliness (ie, feeling alone) and social isolation (ie., being alone) are among the most robust known riskfactors for poor health and accelerated mortality. Yet mit-igating these social risk factors is challenging, as few inter-ventions have been effective for both reducing lonelinessand increasing social contact. Accumulating evidence sug-gests that mindfulness interventions can improve socialrelationship processes. Less is known about the activemechanisms underlying these improvements. Developing mindfulness-specific skills\u2014namely, (1) monitoring present-moment experiences with (2) an orientation ofacceptance\u2014may change the way people perceive andrelate toward others. We predicted that developing open-ness and acceptance toward present experiences is criticalfor reducing loneliness and increasing social contact andthat removing acceptance skills training from a mindfulness intervention would eliminate these benefits.Methods: In this dismantling trial, 153 community adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 structurally matched14-lesson smartphone-based interventions: (1) mindfulness training in both monitoring and acceptance (Monitor \u00feAccept), (2) mindfulness training in monitoring only (Monitor Only), or (3) active control training. For 3 days before and after the intervention, ambulatory assess- ments were used to measure loneliness and social contactin daily life.Results: Consistent with predictions, Monitor \u00feAccept training reduced daily life loneliness by 22% (d \u00bc0.44, P\u00bc.0001) and increased social contact by 2 more interac- tions each day (d \u00bc0.47, P\u00bc.001) and 1 more person each day (d\u00bc0.39, P\u00bc.004), compared with both Monitor Only and control trainings.Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a 2- week smartphone-based mindfulness intervention for reducing loneliness and increasing social contact in daily life. Importantly, developing acceptance toward present-moment experiences is a critical mechanism for mitigating these social risk factors. By fostering equanimity with feel- ings of loneliness and social disconnect, acceptance skillstraining may allow loneliness to dissipate and encourage greater engagement with others in daily life.

However, the effect of radiotherapy does not seem quite satisfying. Therefore,how to increase radiosensitivity is an important topic. Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction, a Chinese herbal formula, has been shown to be effective in increasing radiosensitivity of NSCLC. In this study, we analyzed Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction with the method of network pharmacology, inorder to explore the potential targets and mechanism of Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction in increasing radiosensitivity of NSCLC and provide targeted guidance for the following study. Methods: The T raditional Chinese Medicine System Platform database, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Database@Taiwan, and The T raditional Chinese Medicines Integrated Database were adopted to establish the database of Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction's effective ingredients. Furthermore, the Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction's target points database was set up. The Cancer RadiosensitivityRegulation Factors Database were used to build the radio- sensitivity regulation factors database of NSCLC, which was matched with Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction's target points database. Based on the matching results, String database was applied to analyze the interactions among target42 Global Advances in Health and Medicinepoints and DAVID bioinformatics resources was utilized for the enrichment analysis on GO_BP and KEGG. Results: A total of 32 significant targets of Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction in increasing radiosensitivity ofNSCLC were found, 14 cellular biological processes were processed through GO_BP enrichment analysis (false dis- covery rate [FDR] <0.01) and 19 related pathways were carried on by KEGG (FDR <0.01), which mainly including HIF-1 signaling pathway, Apoptosis, p53 signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and so on. Conclusion: The intervening of a complex multiple-target points pathway may account for the effect of Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction in increasing radiosensitivity ofNSCLC. This study not only makes a contribution to a better understanding of the mechanism of Fuzheng Zengxiao Decoction in increasing radiosensitivity ofNSCLC but also proposes a strategy to develop new TCM candidates at a network pharmacology level. P01.20 Hewei Liu, jialiliu2014@163.com Abstract Purpose: Nonerosive reflux diseases (NERD) is a type of chronic digestive disorder with a high morbidity in the clin- ical; however, its therapy remains a great challenge due tothe lack of effective drugs. In this study, the feasibility of Hewei Jiangni Granule (HWJNG) for NERD treatment was demonstrated by investigating its underlying effectson tissue histological changes, neuropeptide releases, and visceral hypersensitivity-related receptor expressions in NERD model rats. Methods: SPF male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups, including the normal control group, NERD model group, HWJNG group (high dose, medium dose, and low dose) and Omeprazole group. The NERDrat model was established through the combination of basal sensitization and acid perfusion, followed by consec- utive gavage administration of water or different drugs for14 days. The pathological changes of esophageal mucosa, expansion of esophageal squamous cell space, expression of tryptase, and degranulation of mast cells in esophaguswere investigated by different techniques. The serum levels of esophageal visceral hypersensitivity-related neuro- peptides were measured using enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay. In addition, the gene and protein expressions of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) in esophageal and dorsal root ganglia were investigated, respectively. Results: Increased histological score of esophageal mucosa, expansion of esophageal squamous cell gap, high expression of tryptase in mast cells, increased serum levels of neuropeptides, and abnormal expression of TRPV1 and TRPM8 were observed in NERD model rats, which were compromised after treatment of HWJNG or Omeprazole. Conclusion: HWJNG at a medium dose was able to atten- uate the expansion of intercellular space and regulate the expression of visceral hypersensitivity-related receptors (TRPV1/TRPM8) and secretion of neuropeptides and thus permitted a certain treatment for NERD rats. This study provides meaningful guidance for treatment of NERD in the clinic. P01.21 Network Pharmacology-Based Strategy to Investigate Pharmacological Mechanismsof ShenfuTang Liu1, and Xiaohong Gu1 1Beijing China Contact: Changyong Luo, 15652608472@163.com Abstract Purpose: T o study the mechanism of ShenfuTang and Shengmaiyin on the \"same disease with different treatments\" of septic shock by using network pharmacology. Methods: The components of ShenfuTang and Shengmaiyin were obtained by Traditional Chinese Medicine System Platform and Batman-Traditional Chinese Medicine, respec- tively. The compounds were searched by PubChem. The drug targets were predicted on the Swiss Target Prediction website. The septic shock-related proteins were screened by CTD, GeneCards, OMIM, and DrugBank databases. String constructs a protein interaction network, selects key genes through Cytoscape's Cytohubba, uses MCODE for cluster analysis, and uses FunRich to per- form path enrichment analysis on each protein network. Results: The key genes and pathways in the common target network of ShenfuTang and Shengmaiyin Intervention in septic shock were mainly related to inflammatory reaction and neuro-endocrine-immune system. The specific target of Shenfutang was mainly related to adrenaline and its insulin secretion. Relatedly, the specific target of Shengmaiyin isAbstracts and ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling pathway. Conclusion: ShenfuTang and Shengmaiyin can treat septic shock through common targets. The unique targets are also focused on the treatment. At a certain level, the microscop- ic mechanism of Chinese medicine \"Yiqi, Huiyang andJiuyin\" is embodied. P01.22 Utilising Network Pharmacology the Underlying Mechanism ofYinqiao-San Formula (YQS) in regulatingCD8\u00feT cell of Pediatric Acute Respiratory Changyong Luo 1, Tiegang Liu1, and Xiaohong Gu1 1Beijing Luo, 15652608472@163.com Abstract Purpose: Yinqiao-san formula (YQS), a classic herbal for- mula, has been widely used to treat pediatric acute respi-ratory Infection in clinical practice in China. However, the pharmacological mechanisms of YQS still remain unknown. Methods: We used a network pharmacology and GEO DataSets method to predict its underlying complex mech- anism of treating CD8 \u00feT cell of Pediatric Acute Respiratory infection. First, we collected putative targets of YQS based on Integrative Pharmacology-basedResearch Platform of Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCMIP v2.0 databases. Then, we obtained the CD8 T cells from PBMCs of Pediatric Acute Respiratory Infection target data by GEO DataSets analyzed by GEO2R. Based on the matching results between YQS potential targets and Tcell from PBMCs of Pediatric Infection targets, we built a PPI network to analyze the interactions among these targets and screen the hub targets by CytoHubba software. Furthermore, the major hubs were imported to the KEGG resources to perform pathway enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 91 nodes putative targets were picked out as major hubs in terms of their topological importance.The results of KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that YQS mostly participated in the various pathways associated with Phospholipase D signaling, AGE-RAGE Rap1 T (APP , NXA1, ADCY2, ADCY5, CXCL8, GRM4 and so on), were recognized as potential targets of treatments, implying the underlying mechanisms of YQS acting on pediatric acute respiratory Infection.Conclusion: YQS could alleviate pediatric acute respirato- ry infection through the molecular mechanisms predictedby network pharmacology, and this research demonstratesthat the network pharmacology approach can be an effec-tive tool to reveal the mechanisms of traditional Chinesemedicine from a holistic perspective.

P01.33 Photosensitivity as a Marker for Pain in Patients With TBI and PTSD and Mist1 1Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 2Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, Portland, Oregon 3Linfield College, Portland, Oregon Contact: Nadir Balba, balba@ohsu.edu Abstract disorder (PTSD) are neurobiological conditions inde- pendently linked to increases in chronic pain and self- reported photosensitivity. Chronic pain is associated with sensitization of pain-processing circuits in the brain. The additional report of photosensitivity suggests a multisenso- ry sensitization. Therefore, we tested whether chronic pain and photosensitivity are linked to one another in individuals with a history of TBI and/or PTSD. Methods: Subjects completed a battery of self-report sur- veys related to chronic pain and TBI/PTSD symptomology before being tested for pressure pain thresholds and visual photosensitivity thresholds. Participants were categorized into 1 of 4 groups based on a validated diagnostic interview for TBI and the PTSD Checklist for DSM 5. Groups includ- ed (1) controls: subjects with no TBI or PTSD (n \u00bc104); (2) TBI: subjects with TBI, no PTSD (n \u00bc142); (3) PTSD: subjects with but no TBI (n \u00bc9); and (4) TBI with both TBI and PTSD (n \u00bc69). Results: Control subjects reported lower levels of chronic pain compared to subjects in our photosensitivity thresholds compared to controls. Lastly, there was a strong correlation between photosensitivity thresholds and chronic pain com- These results suggest that photosensitivity could be used as a marker for individuals in whom central sensitization drives chronic pain and could be applied to other chronic pain populations. Future studies will useAbstracts 47neuroimaging to see whether these behavioral results relate to differences in cortical activity response to pressure pain and light stimuli. P01.34 Complexity of Whole Body Movement Differentiates Central and Peripheral Pain Michael Finn1, Lindsey McKernan1, and Leslie Crofford1 1Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee Contact: Michael Finn, michael.t.finn@vumc.org Abstract Purpose: While self-report measures of pain and function are available, there is also a need for objective performance-based measures of patients with chronic pain, such as fibro- myalgia (centralized pain) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; peripheral pain). Assessing movement dynamics may allow for measures of multifactorial functioning in chronic pain. Methods: Using behavioral imaging, participants under- went a movement assessment. We estimated the total amount of kinetic energy (J) from movement and the com- plexity of whole body movement as an interconnected system. Movements captured included free walking, swaying in place as much as feels comfortable, following along to a video-recorded T ai-Chi-informed form, and metronome- controlled walking. We analyzed whole body movementcomplexity, assessing for group differences using linear mixed effects models allowing a random slope of complex- ity time scale and intercepts of participant allowing for auto- correlated errors. Results: T wenty participants diagnosed with fibromyalgia, 8 with RA, and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy con- trols completed the protocol. We found that there was no main effect of groups in complexity, Ps>.4. Instead, com- plexity differentiated groups by kinds of movement. The Tai Chi-informed form demonstrated higher complexity in fibromyalgia versus healthy controls, B \u00bc/C00.08, SE \u00bc0.01 t(4415)\u00bc/C05.80, P<.0001, while free walking differentiated fibromyalgia from RA, B \u00bc0.09, SE \u00bc0.02, t(4415)\u00bc4.54, P<.0001. Swaying in place differentiated all 3 from one another; from largest to smallest: fibromyalgia, healthy con- trols, then RA, Ps<.01. These effects were independent of total amount of kinetic energy. Conclusion: We show that there may be meaningful differ- ences in how the whole body moves as a complex system comparing centralized and peripheral pain conditions and behavioral imaging may be sensitive to these differences. We examine possibilities for objective measurement of systemicdynamics of whole body movement for diagnosis and out- come assessment in chronic pain conditions. P01.35 Exploration Study of Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Blood Stasis: A Multicenter Observational Study in South Korea Soobin Jang1 1Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Soobin Jang, soobeenee2@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: stasis (BS) is a morbid state of blood stag- nancy in a certain area of the body caused by sluggish flowof qi, deficiency of qi, or trauma. Even though several ques-tionnaires for diagnosing BS exist, biomarkers that detectBS have not been found. The objective of this study was tofind out the biomarkers which are different between BS and non-BS by analyzing blood parameter data and immunolog- ical profile data.Methods: BS patients (n \u00bc250) and non-BS patients (n\u00bc226) were enrolled through 7 centers in this study. After collecting 14 mL of blood from each patient, analysisof blood indicators and a multiplex-based plasma proteinassay were conducted twice. The relationship between clin-ical symptoms of BS and plasma protein was also analyzed. The statistical analyses were performed by SAS 9.1.3. This study has been approved by the institutional review boardof Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine.Results: Of the 46 kinds of blood BS group and non-BS group(P<.05). As a result of protein assay, A2M, SAP , IL-8, and P<.05). Platelet, RDW, and BSX were significant in both 2 times of analyzes. Among those biomarkers, it was found thatCRP was correlated with pain symptoms (nocturnal pain,traumatic injury, sharp pain, and chronic pain) of BS(p<0.001) and SAP was correlated with color symptoms (dark facial complex, dark red lip and tongue, dark lumps inmenses period, dark rings around eyes) of BS ( P<.01). Conclusion: This study suggests that CRP and SAP are meaningful biomarkers to diagnose BS. However, these bio- markers should be validated through large-scale data collec-tion in order to be used for diagnosis and prognosis.48 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP01.36LB Combined Effect of 2 Nutraceuticals, Curcumin, and Resveratrol, on the Activation of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2- Related 2 Institute, Western Sydney University, Penrith, Australia 2NICM Health Research Institute and School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Penrith, Australia 3School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Penrith, Australia 4South Western Sydney Clinical School, University of New South Wales and NICM Research Health Institute, Western Sydney University,Sydney, Australia Contact: Valentina Razmovski-Naumovski, v.naumovski@unsw.edu.au Abstract Purpose: Combination therapy presents a systematic approach in tackling complex pathological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Curcumin (a polyphenol found in Curcuma longa) and resveratrol (a stilbenoid found in strongly pigmented vegetables and fruit) are 2 popular nutraceuticals known for their powerful antioxidant activi- ties. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that responds to oxidative stress by binding to antioxidant response element (ARE). As isolatedcompounds, curcumin and resveratrol, are common Nrf2 activators; however, their combined effect has yet to be determined.Methods: AREc32 cells were culture and coincubated with individual or combined curcumin and resveratrol (0- 100mM). After 24 h co-incubation, the cells were washed and replaced with luciferin buffer, and the expression of Nrf2 was analyzed using bioluminescence. Alamar blue assay was used to determine the cell viability. Results: Our results suggested that curcumin-resveratrol, at both 50 and 25 mM, significantly upregulated Nrf2 expres- sion compared to negative control (cells with medium only) (P<.05), without causing any cytotoxicity. Conclusion: The combined activity of curcumin and res- veratrol against oxidative stress provides early evidence of a combination therapy that will assist in the management of various chronic conditions such as CVD.P01.37LB Acupuncture Improves Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampal Glutamate Levels by Regulating the Expression of Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 1/2 in ChronicRestraint Stress of Beijing, China Contact: Yahuan Li, liyahuan@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: This study intends to determine the effects of acupuncture on the concentrations of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAK) 1/2 in the prefrontal cortex and hip- pocampus of rats, and whether the mechanism of acupunc-ture in antidepression involves regulations of glutamate levels. Methods: A total of 24 rats were assigned into control, model, model \u00feacupuncture(Acu), and model \u00fefluoxetine (FLX) groups at random, with 6 rats in each group. In thepresent study, we used a 28-day chronic restraint stress ratsas a model to investigate how acupuncture could alleviate depression. In the Acu group, Acu pretreatment at Baihui (GV and (SP 6) were per-formed daily prior to restraint. Open-field test was carried out to evaluate the depressive symptoms at selected time points. The protein levels of EAAT1/2 in the prefrontalcortex and hippocampus were examined by using Western blot. Results: Compared with the C group, the squares crossed and rears of rats in the M group reduced in open-field test (both P<.05); While compared with the M group, the squares crossed of rats in the Acu group and FLX groupincreased obviously (all P<.05); the rears of rats in the Acu group and FLX group increased obviously (all P<.001). The expression of EAAT1/2 in the prefrontal cortex and EAAT2level in the hippocampus was significantly lower in the M group than that in the control group (all P<.001); The level of EAAT1/2 in the prefrontal cortex, both in the FLX andAcu group, was increased significantly (all P<.01), while EAAT2 has a significant increase in the hippocampus of FLX and Acu groups ( P<.05, P<.001) when compared with those in the M group. Conclusion: We found that chronic restraint stress signif- icantly decreased behavioral activities, whereas acupunctureaugmented the levels of EAAT1/2. These findings certificate that acupuncture could alleviate depression through regu- lations of glutamate levels.Abstracts 49P01.38LB and NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia 2South Western Sydney Clinical School, University of New South Wales and NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia Contact: Valentina Razmovski-Naumovski, v.naumovski@unsw.edu.au Abstract Purpose: The increased prevalence of diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications has been linked to nonenzy-matic protein glycation due to the over consumption of highfructose and/or glucose-containing diets. In the presentstudy, andglucose-mediated protein and of myo-globin investigated Methods: The antiglycation activity of curcumin was eval- uated via the formation of advanced glycation end products(AGEs) fluorescence intensity, iron released from the hememoiety of myoglobin, and the level of fructosamine. Theprotein oxidation was examined using the levels of proteincarbonyls and thiols. Results: The results revealed that curcumin (10, 20, and 30mM) significantly inhibited the formation of fluorescent AGEs in myoglobin-fructose and myoglobin-glucose glyca-tion models during the 30-day study. Furthermore, curcu-min decreased the levels of fructosamine and free ironrelease from myoglobin which is attributed to protec- myoglobin protein oxidation ofmyoglobin as indicated by decreased protein carbonylslevels and protein thiols modification in both the glycationmodels. Conclusion: These studies suggest that curcumin is capa- ble preventing fructose and glucose-induced glycationand oxidative modification of myoglobin. Hence, provide new insights into the antiglycation propertiesof curcumin for an efficacious treatment option of AGE-mediated diabetic complications.P01.39LB The Brachial Plexus: Anatomic Variation ravell and schematics are relied heavily upon by osteopathic physicians, physicaltherapists, and massage therapists when using specific treat- ment techniques for pain management, including those addressing myofascial trigger points. Neural anatomic devel-opment is highly individualized challenging the utility andaccuracy of Travell and Simon's referral pattern schematics,which were developed independently from consideration ofsubjects' anatomic differences. For example, commonly occurring variance rates of the brachial plexus are between 4% and 60% dependent on study sample size. Some upperlimb variations show distinct clinical presentation whendiagnostic procedures or noninvasive and surgical treat-ments have failed to identify or supply relief of functionaland/or sensory symptoms. The role of peripheral nervevariance in pain perception and recognition lacks investiga- tion. This study's purpose was to identify brachial plexus variations through cadaveric dissection that could increaseatypical clinical case T wenty-five formalin embalmed limbs were dis- sected in the Missouri Southern State University humandissection laboratory from 2016 to 2019. Routine grossdissection techniques were utilized with focus on smallnerve fibers remaining intact. Fascicle dissection was com-pleted on 1 brachial plexus. Results: Common and rarely cited variations were revealed through dissection at macro and micro scales.Variations were found connecting the anterior and posteri- or innervation pathways of the upper limb in both gross and micro dissections. Conclusion: Research in myofascial trigger points is leading to better detection and identification. Specific variations inter- fere with diagnosis and treatment planning by all medical andrehabilitation professionals. Anatomic differences may serve asa reasonable explanation for inconsistent myofascial triggerpoint treatment outcomes while also leading to an understand-ing of common variation dependent injury risks. Understanding the commonality and potential role of individual anatomic dif- ferences between patients is crucial to providing personalized,least invasive treatment options for those who are suffering.50 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP01.40LB Acupuncture Produces Antidepressant Response in Chronic Unpredictable MildStress Rats via Inhibiting c-Jun N-termunalSignaling Pathway Xingzhou Gao 1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China the neuropathological process of depres- sion has been identified as the crucial factor involved in the antidepressant response of acupuncture. The objective was to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti- depressant response of acupuncture in chronic unpredict- able mild stress (CUMS) rats by employing the JNK signaling pathway inhibitor SP600125. Methods: A total of 64 Sprague-Dawley rats were allocat- ed into 8 experiment groups: control group, CUMS group, DMSO group, SP600125 group, SP600126 \u00feFluoxetine group, Acupuncture group, and SP600125 \u00feAcupuncture group. Body weight and open- field test were carried out at the end of experimental period to assess the depressive behavior. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were utilized to examine the JNK signaling pathway-related protein levels. Results: Here, we found that the expression of hippocam- pal p-JNK was significantly upregulated by the CUMS pro- cedures. Importantly, both acupuncture and fluoxetine reversed the upregulation of p-JNK in accord with JNK inhibitor SP600125. But there was no difference about the expressions of upstream regulators p-MKK4 and p-MKK7 among all groups. Conclusion: These findings indicated that JNK signaling pathway could be a potential target in acupuncture treat- ment for depression, which may provide a new perspective for the antidepressant response of acupuncture.P01.41LB Immunomodulating Effects of Oplopanax horridus in Washington 2University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada 3University California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California deciduous shrub of the Araliaceae or Ginseng family native to the Northwestern United States.Native Americans of British Colombia and theNorthwestern United States regard Devil's Club as animportant medicinal plant. T raditional medicinal uses of OH include its use as an antibacterial, antifungal, antimyco- bacterial, antiviral, and as an immunomodulator for rheu-matism and diabetes. Previously, it has been shown thatextracts of OH have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, andantimycobacterial properties. The mechanisms of action of OH's effects have not been established and there are few studies that have presented chromatographic profiles of OHextracts, although we are conducting a thorough phyto-chemical study. Previously, we demonstrated a decrease intumor necrosis factor alpha and nitric oxide production in a LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cell line, which may partially explain the traditional use of OH as an immuno-modulator for both rheumatism and diabetes. Methods: T o further characterize the immunomodulatory effects of OH, LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cellswere treated with OH extracts and a cytokine array wasperformed. T o elucidate potential mechanisms of action(s), we exposed BMDM to LPS and OH extract and analyzed using cytological profiling and Functional Signature ofOntology (FuSiOn) platforms. Results: The cytokine array that was performed demon- strated a significant decrease in 15 cytokine/chemokines,including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 (IL-1),IL-6, and IL-10. Prostaglandin E2 levels were also evaluatedafter OH treatment and demonstrated a significant decrease. We also found a unique signature using CP and FuSiOn platforms. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that OH extract has significant immunomodulatory activity in both RAW264.7macrophage cell line and murine BMDM. Future studiesAbstracts 51will include determination of biomarker(s) that could be measured in animal and human studies. P02: Clinical Research: Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine P02.01 Feasibility and Effectiveness of Acupuncture Combined With Opioid forCancer Initial Clinical Experience Yihan He 1and Haibo Provincial Hospital of Guangzhou, China Contact: Yihan He, yihanhe@gzucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: Pain is a common and intractable symptom expe- rienced by cancer survivors. Given the existing evidence forthe analgesic effect of acupuncture, this study aims to eval- uate the feasibility of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT) for the effectiveness of acupuncture as adjunc-tive therapy to opioid for cancer pain. Methods: Thirty patients with cancer admitted to the oncology department with moderate or severe pain wererecruited and randomized to the adjunctive acupuncture group or the control group which receives opioid without acupuncture. The acupuncture protocol consisted of2 sections: the standardized acupuncture points and theindividual acupuncture points based on the situation ofeach participant. Four generalized linear mixed-effectsmodels were established to analyze the effects of the treat- ment and time on the pain intensity and opioid dose during the treatment and follow-up. Results: During 1 month of the trial period (05/15/2019- 06/13/2019), around 30% (54 of 183) of the oncology inpa-tients met the selection criteria and more than half of themwere enrolled. In the control group, 1 participant did not start the treatment due to receiving surgery and 1 required to receive acupuncture. The duration and frequency of acu-puncture treatment sessions were well tolerated sincethere were no acupuncture-related adverse events. Noone dropped out in the treatment phase, and 1 participantin the acupuncture group was lost to follow-up due to death. The overall positive trends toward the acupuncture group were observed in both NRS and opioid consumptionduring the treatment and the differences still remained inmore than 1 week after the end of the treatment.Conclusion: Findings from the pilot trial suggest that a full- scale pRCT is feasible and manageable. However, future studies are needed to confirm the effects of adjunct acu- puncture for cancer pain because a statistically meaningful result was not obtained in this study. P02.02 Effect of Electric Moxibustion for Patient With Hwa-Byung (Anger Syndrome): ARandomized, Sham-Controlled, PatientBlinded, Clinical Jeong1, Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea 2Department of Korean Medicine, Sangji University, Wonju-si, Republic of Yeong Eun Jeong, jyev@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: Electric moxibustion is the newly developed medical device which produces heat stimulation by electric device. Hwa-byung (anger syndrome) is a culture-bound syndrome in Korea, and moxibustion has been used for relieving various symptoms of indigestion, anxiety, and depression in patient with Hwa-byung. The aim of this study was to explore the safety and efficacy of electric mox-ibustion for Hwa-byung. Methods: T wenty-four participants with Hwa-byung were randomly divided into either an electro-moxibustion or sham group. Patients received a total of 8 sessions over the treatment period of 4 weeks. The electro- moxibustion was applied at 4 acupuncture points, CV12, CV4, ST36 and LR3 for 30 minutes. The sham moxibustion with lower temperature was applied at the nonacupuncture points for 30 minutes. Assessments were carried out at the baseline, the end of the treatment (after 4 weeks), and the follow-up (after 8 weeks). The primary outcome was change in Hwa-byung symptom scale after the treatment periodcompared to the baseline. Results: T wenty-four patients with Hwa-byung were ran- domly assigned including 12 to moxibustion group and 12 to placebo group, and 20 patients completed the study. Changes in Hwa-byung symptom scale after treatment period showed no significant difference between moxibus- tion and placebo group (8.0 [ /C02.0 to 16] in the electric moxibustion group and 5.0 [ /C01.0 to 9] in the sham group; P\u00bc.838). At the follow-up assessment, the changes were 11.0 [3.0 to 17.0] in the experiment group and 7.0 [4.0 to 11] in sham group. No serious adverse event was reported in both groups.52 Global Advances in Health and MedicineConclusion: In this pilot trial, we could see the possible but not statistically significant effect of electric moxibustion on Hwa-byung symptoms compared to placebo. The results from this sham-controlled pilot study may provide informa- tion for the further researches with a larger number of participants. P02.03 Evaluation of Acupuncture in the Prevention of Chemotherapy-InducedPeripheral Neuropathy: A RetrospectiveCase Series Melissa Jordan 1, Dawn Mussallem1, Chumsri1, and Cindy Tofthagen1 1Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida Contact: Melissa Jordan, jordan.melissa@mayo.edu Abstract Purpose: The aim is to demonstrate the efficacy of acu- puncture when initiated prior to chemotherapy and before chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptom presentation and continued throughout treat- ment course to delay or prevent presentation and escala- tion in patients at a high risk of occurrence and to demon- strate the value and benefit of this individualized and preventative treatment model in order to create a founda- tion and groundwork for future studies. Methods: This is a case series of 5 patients with breast or gynecological cancer seeking the support of acupuncture with CIPN prevention as well as with other side effects of cancer treatment. At each visit, the patient was assessedutilizing diagnostic methods of Traditional Chinese medicine and an individualized acupuncture treatment intervention was developed and administered. Outcomes were based on separate evaluation by the oncological care team, patient self-report, and overall treatment effect. Results: The incidence of grade 2 of higher CIPN in this series of 5 patients was zero. Patients either did not develop symptoms of CIPN or experienced delayed mild onset that resolved completely after a series of 2 to 8 acupuncture treatments. All patients self-reported perceived benefit in the following: pain, digestive system symptoms, anxiety, cancer-related-fatigue, memory loss, facial flushing post- chemotherapy, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, hotflashes, sinus congestion, perceived stress level, and depres- sion. All patients described positive effects on psychological and physical well-being. No adverse events were noted or reported. Conclusion: The expected incidence of grade 2 or higher CIPN in patients at a high risk of CIPN is /C2468% within thefirst month, in this series of 5 patients the incidence was zero. Our results suggest that an individualized approach toassessment and treatment planning is effective in the pre- vention and/or mitigation of CIPN in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. The use of acupuncture to preventCIPN seems to be a worthy treatment strategy for further study. P02.04 The Study of Indices of T ongue Images From Patients With Upper Respiratory Tract Infection Keun Ho Kim1, Woosu Choi1, and Jihye Kim1 of Korea Contact: Keun Ho Kim, rkim70@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: The objective of this study is to observe the tongue indices that were changed with treatment of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) patients. We pro- posed 2 hypotheses as follows: (1) the tongue parametersof patients with URTI differ significantly from those of healthy controls and (2) the tongue parameters of patients with URTI may be significantly different before and aftertreatment. Methods: Subjects were recruited to obtain tongue images for hypothesis testing. T ongue images were obtained in aconstant lighting environment and were preprocessed to correct the color of the tongue and segment the tongue area. The mean value of the color in each region and thetongue coating ratio were calculated, and the differences between the URTI patients and the normal controls and the changes of the groups between before and after treat-ment were extracted, as tongue indices. Results: Data from a total of 78 subjects (39 URTI patients and 39 normal controls) were analyzed. The average differ- ences in the tongue indices between visit 1 and visit 2 for the patients and the controls were computed, respectively.The differences in values between visit 1 and visit 2 did notchange in the tongue body but contrastively did change in the tongue coating-related indices. In particular, the results showed that the coating ratio reduced and that the CIE a*value of the tongue coating increased through treatment. In summary, the tongue coating of the patients was broader. The density of the tongue coating was lowered due to thecoating ratio decreasing according to the treatment. Conclusion: We analyzed the tongue characteristics of the URTI patients and normal subjects through tongue image analysis. The results showed that the patients had different changes of tongue image before and after treatment. Finally,Abstracts 53it is expected that the tongue characteristics could provide the public the preventive health-care easily. P02.05 Morphological Analysis of the Liver and Kidney of Wistar Rats After the Administration Abstract Purpose: herbal medicine is one of the most com- monly used complementary and integrative treatments fordepression, especially in Chinese culture. Ganmai Dazaodecoction (GMDZ decoction) is a herbal medicine widely used in formulations for depression. Most of the phytother- apics currently used either by self-medication or by pre-scription do not have a known toxic profile. There is aconsensus in the medical literature that improper use of aproduct, even a low toxicity one, can induce serious prob-lems as long as there are other risk factors such as contra- indications or concomitant use of other medicines. These animals were used in an experimental model of depressionusing the sensitization of rats by ovoalbumin and weretreated with GMDZ. The objective of this study is to ana-lyze the liver and kidneys of the animals in order to char-acterize some toxicity pattern and adverse effects on the use of GMDZ decoction (Animal Comitee: CEUA-FMABC # 07/2017). Methods: Sixteen male Wistar rats were used and were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was treated with 1 mL saline(control group) and group 2 was treated with GMDZ (10 mg/kg aqueous extract) orally for 30 days. The animals were euthanized with anesthetic overdose and the kidneysand livers were collected, processed, and stained with hem-atoxilin eosin for histopathological analysis. Results: The livers of the treated animals presented dis- ruption in the hepatic parenchyma, the lobes and grade I hepatic steatosisthroughout the parenchyma. The kidneys of the treatedanimals showed areas of necrosis in the cortical region.Conclusion: GMDZ used at current therapeutic doses showed hepatic and renal toxicity. Futher studies will be necessary to establish a non-toxic dose. P02.07 Pediatric Tuina for the Treatment of Anorexia in Children Under 14 years: ASystematic Review and Meta-analysis 2Beijing University of TCM, Beijing, China 3London South Bank University, London, UK Contact: Shibing Liang, zyi20126185@163.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to evaluate the benefits and safety of pediatric T uina as a nonpharmaceutical therapy for anorexia in children under 14 years. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pediatric T uina alone with medicine for anorexia wereincluded in this review. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to June 30, 2019. T wo authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Significant effective rate was used as the primary out- come. \"Significant effective\" being defined as the appetite improved and food intake returning to 3/4 or more of normal intake. Secondary outcomes included food intake, adverse events, and compliance. T rial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to calculate the required information sizein a meta-analysis and to detect the robustness of the results. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool. Results: Of the included 28 RCTs involving 2650 children, the majority had a high or unclear risk of bias in terms ofallocation concealment, blinding, and selective reporting. All trials compared pediatric T uina with western medicine or Chinese herbs. For significant effective rate, meta-analysis showed that pediatric T uina was superior to western med- icine (risk ratio [RR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) (RR 1.36, 95% CI [1.19, 1.55]). Meta-analysis also showed pediatric T uina was supe-rior to western medicine (mean difference (MD) /C00.88, 95% CI [ /C01.27,/C00.50]) and Chinese herbs (MD /C00.69, 95% CI [ /C01.00,/C00.38]) on improving food intake. T wo trials reported compliance and 7 trials reported adverse events data. TSA for significant effective rate demonstrated that the pooled data had insufficient power regarding both numbers of trials and participants.54 Global Advances in Health and MedicineConclusion: Evidence suggested that pediatric T uina may be potential beneficial for the treatment of anorexia in chil- dren under 14 years. Safety of pediatric T uina is unclear due to insufficient reporting. Further well-designed RCTs with adequate sample sizes are needed. P02.08 Chinese Herbal Remedy T ongxie Yaofang Versus Pinaverium 2Beijing University of TCM, Beijing, China 3London South Bank University, London, UK Contact: Shibing Liang, zyi20126185@163.com Abstract Purpose: T o evaluate the benefits and harms of T ongxie Yaofang or its modified formula (m-TXYF) for Irritable Bowel (IBS)-D compared with pinaverium or m-TXYF with PB for IBS-D were included in this review through searching from 8 major English and Chinese electronic databases. T wo authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcome was global improvement of IBS-D symptoms. Data were summa- rized using risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Data were analyzed using the Cochrane's Revman 5.3 software. Certainty of the evi- dence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool. T rial sequential analysis was used to calculate the required infor- mation size in a meta-analysis and to detect the robustness of the results. The protocol for this review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019132259). Results: T wenty-three RCTs involving 1907 adults were included. For global improvement of IBS-D symptoms, there was no difference between TXYF and PB (RR 1.53, 95% CI [0.95, 2.46]), but m-TXYF was superior to (RR 1.68, 95% CI [1.44, 1.97]), whether fixed m-TXYF (RR 1.54, 95% CI [1.08, or unfixed CI [1.40, 1.97]). Meta-analysis also showed m-TXYF was superior to PB on improving specific symptoms (stool consistency, stool frequency, or abdominal pain). However, certainty of evidence for the above out- comes was \"low\" or \"very low\". Only 8 trials reportedadverse events (AE). Among them, 6 trials reported no AE occurring in either group; the other 2 trials reported 7 mild AEs, and 2 cases occurred in fixed m-TXYF group. Conclusion: The evidence suggests that TXYF and m- TXYF are beneficial for improving stool consistency and abdominal pain, and m-TXYF is also beneficial for global symptoms and stool frequency. P02.09 Randomized Controlled Trials of Pediatric Tuina for Anorexia: Quality Assessment of Methodological and 2Beijing University of TCM, Beijing, China 3London South Bank University, London, UK Contact: Shibing Liang, zyi20126185@163.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to evaluate the methodological quality and intervention reporting quality of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on pediatric T uina (PT) for anorex- ia and to provide suggestions for clinical trial design and reporting of PT . Methods: Five databases were searched from inception to November 2018. Literature that meeting the inclusion cri- teria were included. T wo authors used the Cochrane bias risk assessment criteria and modified the STRICTA report- ing guideline for PM to evaluate the methodological and intervention reporting quality of the included RCTs. Results: T otal of 63 RCTs were included. The reporting rates of random sequence generation, allocation conceal- ment, blind method, incomplete outcome data, funding, and baseline data were Selective outcome reports, sample size estimates, trial pro- tocol registration, and information were not reported in any of the included publications. Methodological quality assessment showed that 63 RCTs had methodological prob- lems of varying degrees and lacked high-quality. The quality evaluation of PT reporting found that the reporting rate of providing the rationale for using PT and the control setting were 63.49% (40/63) and 23.81% (15/63), respectively. The reporting rate of the qualifications of clinician providing the PT treatment setting were the same, both were 1.59% (1/ 63). The reported rates of individualized/nonindividualized selection of PT, single/bilateral manipulation of the massage site, the body reaction induced by the massage and whether other interventions were applied in the same period there is a lack of RCTs with high- quality methodology for the treatment of anorexia by PT . Thequality of methodological and intervention reporting in the literature was low. Future RCTs for PT should be designed and reported in strict accordance with the Cochrane Bias Evaluation Criteria. A specific reporting guideline for PT which could be achieved by adapting STRICTA is requiredin order to develop standards for reporting this intervention. P02.10 Difference in Time Course of Change in Blood Perfusion/Flow Between Acupointsand Sham Points Following AcupressureTreatment Shin Lin & Cell Biology, Susan Samueli Integrative Health Institute, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California Contact: Shin Lin, shinlin@uci.edu Abstract Purpose: Acupressure, a common practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine, is gaining usage in integrative medicine and health. This pilot study is on the specificity of how such treatment can elevate blood perfusion/flow at acupoints. Methods: The subjects were a dozen healthy males and females (age \u00bc20-26). Blood perfusion/flow was measured as \"flux\" with a laser Doppler flowmetry instrument (Moor DRT4). Acupressure was applied with the eraser end of a pencil attached to a Beslands SF-500 Digital Push/PullDynamometer at a force of 5 to 6 N (sufficient to produce \"de qi\") for 3 minutes. Results: Acupressure PC6, HT3, HT7, ST2, and GB14 to an average of 19 /C2higher than baseline immediately after treatment, compared toincreases at sham points 2 cm medial, lateral, proximal, tively) (n \u00bc30). T o study these apparent differences in greater detail, blood flow at PC4 and sham points was con- tinuously monitored from immediately after treatment toreturn back to baseline. In this experiment, the average levels of blood flow immediately after treatment were 30/C66 (standard deviation) times higher than baseline at the acupoint, and 25 /C64/C2and 23 /C610/C2at sham points 2 cm proximal and ulnar to the acupoint (n \u00bc4). While the level at the acupoint was higher than the sham points,the differences were not statistically significant ( P\u00bc.1). On the other hand, the average of the time taken for the acu-point to drop halfway to baseline (25.8 /C64.5 min) was sig- nificantly longer that those for the proximal sham point (15.8/C63.8 min) and the radial sham point (15.5 /C62.7 min) (P<.05). Conclusion: This study indicates that acupressure accom- panied by \"de qi\" sensation can greatly increase blood flow at acupoints, and the time taken to return to baseline is significantly longer than those for surrounding sham points,suggesting a functional and spatial specificity related to blood flow. P02.11 Traditional Chinese Medicine for Breast Cancer: A Scoping Review China Contact: Chunli Lu, jennylu@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: The aim is to summarize traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for breast cancer and provide evidence base to clinical practice. Methods: We conducted literature searching in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos fromtheir inception to January 2019 to identify systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Patients with breast cancer in any stagewere included. TCM modalities included all kinds ofherbal preparations and nonpharmaceutical therapies. ASMTAR-2 and ROBIS were used to evaluate methodolog- ical quality of SR. Results: T w e n t y - s e v e nS R si n c l u d i n g3 4 0R C T sw i t h2 40 8 2 participants were reviewed, which were published in Englishin 2006 to 2018. Eight SRs involved 7371 breast cancer patients with hormone therapy and chemotherapy related side effects treated by acupoint stimulation (manual, electric,acupoint injection, and self-acupressure) or massage com- pared with placebo or conventional therapy. Eight SRs involved 5836 breast cancer patients with hot flush by acu-puncture or electroacupuncture compared with sham acu- puncture or conventional therapy. Seven SRs focused on 9498 breast cancer patients to treat tumor by conventionaltherapy combined with herbal medicine, acupuncture, or mas-sage. Three SRs involved 1040 breast cancer patients with side effects by acupuncture or electroacupuncture or acu- pressure compared with sham acupuncture or conventional56 Global Advances in Health and Medicinetherapy. One SR involved 3142 breast cancer patients after mastectomy treated by herbal medicine compared with con- ventional therapy. Outcome measures mainly included symp-toms, quality-of-life, long-term survival, and adverse events. The quality of 27 SRs was low to moderate by ROBIS. Four SRs reported potential bias of included RCTs and 1 SRreported conflict of interest of included RCTs by ASMTAR-2. Conclusion: Current evidence focuses mainly on acupoint stimulation for breast cancer side effect. Further studies canbuild up robust evidence for the effectiveness and safety of herbal preparation for breast cancer and should be reported according to PRISMA and address the potential bias and conflict of interest of included RCTs. P02.12 Prediction of Deficiency, Medium, and Excess Patterns in Japanese KampoMedicine: A 2Shikino Care Center, Takaoka, Japan 3University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan 4Chiba University, Chiba, Japan 5Iizuka Hospital, Iizuka, Japan 6Kameda Ayako Maeda-Minami, ayako373@keio.jp Abstract Purpose: We have previously reported on a predictive model for deficiency-excess pattern diagnosis which wasunable to predict the medium pattern. This study aimed to use data from 6 clinics in Japan to develop predictive models for deficiency, medium, and excess pattern diagnosisand to confirm whether the cutoff values for the diagnosis of these patterns differed between the clinics. Methods: We collected data from patients' first visit to 1 of the 6 Kampo clinics in Japan from January 2012 to February 2015. The exclusion criteria included unwilling- ness to participate in the study, missing data, duplicate data, age <20 years, /C2019 subjective symptoms, and irrele- vant patterns. In total, 1068 participants were eligible forinclusion. All participants were surveyed using a 153-item questionnaire. We used an e-questionnaire system on a tablet computer to record the subjective symptoms ofpatients at 6 Kampo specialty clinics. We constructed a predictive model of deficiency, medium, and excess patterndiagnosis using a random forest algorithm from training data and extracted the most important items. We calculated the predictive values of each participant by applying their data to the predictive model and created receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with an excess-medium andmedium-deficiency patterns. Furthermore, we calculated the cutoff value of these patterns in each clinic using ROC curves and compared them.Results: Body mass index and blood pressure were the most important items in the random forest model. In allclinics, the cutoff value of the excess-medium and medium- deficiency patterns was >0.5 and <0.5, respectively. Conclusion: We managed to create a random forest model of deficiency, medium, and excess pattern diagnosis from the data of 6 Kampo clinics in Japan. We did not findany differences in the cutoff values of these patterns between the 6 clinics. P02.13 Acupuncture for Pediatric Sickle Cell Pain Management: A Promising Nonopioid Therapy Shiu-Lin Tsai1, Michelle Yunzhi Qian4, and Margaret T Lee2 1Department of Emergency Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 2Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York,New York 3Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, New York, New York 4Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York Contact: Shiu-Lin Tsai, shiulin@aol.com Abstract Purpose: T o describe the use of acupuncture for pain man- agement in children with sickle cell disease. Methods: Retrospective chart review of a single-institution experience on acupuncture in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease evaluated between 2012 and 2019.Demographic characteristics, presenting pain location, pain score pre- and postacupuncture, and adverse events were collected.Results: T wenty-four patients with sickle cell pain, median age 17.5 years, 62% females, 37.5% African American, 50%Hispanic, received 90 acupuncture treatments: 48 in the hematology outpatient clinic and 42 in the inpatient unit. The mean treatment duration was 18.5 /C64.8 minutes. Fifty-Abstracts 57five treatments administered to 22 patients who received a median of 2.5 acupuncture sessions had documented pre-/ postacupuncture pain scores. Pain reduction was achieved in 65.5% of these treatments. A 0 to 10 scale for 13 treat-ments reported a mean pre-acupuncture score of 7.31 /C6 1.75, postacupuncture of 6.08 /C61.85, and a mean pain score change of 1.23 /C61.09 ( P\u00bc.11); a 0 to 4 scale for 42 treat- ments reported a mean pre-acupuncture score of 3.31 /C6 0.72, postacupuncture of 2.33 /C60.98, and a mean pain score change of 0.98 /C60.99 ( P<.0001). No adverse events were noted. Conclusion: Acupuncture therapy decreased pain for our patients with sickle cell disease, providing a safe nonopioidtherapeutic option. P02.14 Efficacy of Electro-acupuncture and Manual Acupuncture Versus of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China 2School of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 3Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China Contact: Jianfeng Tu, tujianfeng1@126.com Abstract Purpose: Acupuncture is widely used for knee osteoar- thritis (KOA), despite contradictory evidence of efficacy. The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy of electro-acupuncture (EA) and manual acupuncture (MA)with sham acupuncture (SA) for KOA. Methods: In this multicenter trial, participants with KOA were randomly assigned to receive 24 sessions of EA, MA, or SA over 8 weeks. Participants, outcome assessors, and statisticians were masked to treatment group assignment. The primary outcome was the response rate at week 8, which is the proportion of participants who simultaneously achieved minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) in pain and function. The MCII in pain and function was setat 2 points on the 11-point numerical rating scale and 6 points on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale, respec- tively. The efficacy analyses used the modified intention-to- treat population, which included all patients who wererandomly assigned and had at least 1 postbaseline measurement.Results: Between December 25, 2017 and October 10, 2018, 1243 participants were recruited and assessed foreligibility; 480 participants were randomly assigned to theEA (n\u00bc160), MA (n \u00bc160), or SA (n \u00bc160) groups, of whom 442 were evaluated for efficacy (EA n \u00bc151, MA n\u00bc145, SA n \u00bc146). The response rates at week 8 were 60.3% (91 of 151) in the EA group, 58.6% (85 of 145) in theMA group, and 47.3% (69 of 146) in the SA group. The between-group differences were 13.0% (97.5% CI, 0.2% to 24.4%; P\u00bc.0507) for MA versus SA. Conclusion: Among patients with KOA, treatment with EA, compared with SA, resulted in less pain and betterfunction at week 8. The response rate in the MA groupwas increased by 11.3%, but this did not meet statisticalsignificance. P02.15 Scalp Acupuncture for Poststroke Cognitive Shaanxi, China 2Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Chenchen Wang, cwang2@tuftsmedicalcenter.org Abstract Purpose: Although scalp acupuncture has been used in China for decades, its benefits for poststroke cognitiveimpairment remain unknown. We aimed to systematicallyreview the efficacy and safety of scalp acupuncture inpatients with poststroke cognitive impairment to informclinical practice. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of 8 English and Chinese databases from inception throughOctober 2018. We included randomized controlled trialsof scalp acupuncture in poststroke cognitive impairmentpatients with sample size /C2120. The outcomes were cogni- tive function (Mini Mental State [MMSE],Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Loewenstein occupationaltherapy cognition assessment [LOTCA], andNeurobehavioral Cognitive Examination), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-24, and Self-rating depressivescale), activity of daily living (Barthel Index), and quality oflife (Short Form-36 and World Health Organization Qualityof Life Instruments). We calculated mean differences (MD)and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all relevant58 Global Advances in Health and Medicineoutcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. The quality of each study was assessed. Results: T en randomized controlled trials met eligibility criteria (764 subjects). The mean treatment duration was 8.2 weeks. The average number of sessions was 41. The duration of needle insertion ranged from 30 minutes to24 hours. Six studies showed that scalp acupuncture resulted in statistically significant improvement on MMSE [95% CI: 1.89, 4.04]), compared reported improvement in LOTCA (8.87 [7.31, 10.42]). Three studies reported improved anx- iety or depression. Six studies reported improvement onthe Barthel Index (7.63 [5.21, 10.06]). T wo studies reported improvement in overall quality of life. No serious adverse events occurred in any of the included trials. Conclusion: Scalp acupuncture has potential benefits on cognitive impairment, depression, daily living activities, and quality of life in patients with poststroke cognitive impair- ment. Well-designed trials with a standardized therapeutic method are needed to better inform clinical practice. P02.16 Yugengtongyu Granules May Reduce the Incidence of Adverse CardiovascularEvents in Patients With Stable CoronaryArtery Disease: A Double-BlindRandomized Controlled Trial Dayang Wang 1, Li Huang2, and Hui Xu3 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China 3Jiangxi Hospital of Integrated Medicine, Nanchang, China Contact: Dayang Wang, wdy337@163.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to evaluate the effect of Yugengtongyu Granules on reducing the incidence of AdverseCardiovascular Events (ACEs) and improving quality of life in patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD). Methods: A method of double-blind randomized con- trolled trial (RCTs) was used in this research. A total of 114 patients with SCAD in the Department of Cardiology in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital were enrolled fromDecember 2014 to August 2016. Patients were randomly divided into experimental group (n \u00bc57) and control group (n\u00bc57) by a randomized block design. Combined with the basic of standard treatment of SCAD according to 2013 ESC guidelines, the experimental group was givenYugentongyu Granules orally for 24 weeks and the control group was given standard treatment and placebo. The patients were interviewed or telephoned on the 1st, 3rd,6th, 9th, and 12th month after enrollment. The incidence of ACE in the 2 groups and the scores of each dimension of the Seattle Angina Questionare (SAQ) at each time were compared. Other , UCG, ECG, safety indicators (erythrocyte, platelet, coagulation), and so on, were also recorded and compared in this research. Results: Despite 22 subjects withdrew during the follow- up, the incidence of ACE in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group, which were 2.32% to 14.58%, respectively ( P\u00bc.039), in spite of little difference in hs-CRP and ECG; SAQ in the experimen- tal group scored higher than the control group in the 4 dimensions: Physical Limitation, Anginal Frequency, Treatment Satisfaction, and Disease Perception at the follow-up of the third month or the sixth month; there was no significant difference in the Anginal Stability dimen- sion of SAQ, UCG, and safety indicators. Conclusion: The Yugengtongyu Granules can benefit patients with SCAD by reducing the incidence of ACE and relieve symptoms, leading to a better quality of life. P02.18 Cost-Effectiveness of Electro-acupuncture for the Treatment of SymptomaticGallstone Diseases Wendy Wong 1, Jessica YL Ching2, Regina Sit WS3, Sun Wai Zhu2, Justin Kit Fai4, Chong Ching Ning Charing4, Abrigo Jill Morales4, Alexander Lau YL4, and Lin Zhi Xiu4 1School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Institute of Integrative Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong KongSpecial Administrative Region of China 2Hong Kong Institute of Integrative Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ofChina 3School of Public Health, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China 4Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China Contact: Wendy Wong, wendy.wong@cuhk.edu.hk Abstract Purpose: T en percent to 15% of the adult population are affected by gallstone diseases. Cholecystectomy is contro- versial and inflammation of gallbladder increases the of pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or gallbladder cancer. Electro- acupuncture (EA) has been widely used for gallstone dis- ease. The study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of EA in terms of clearance and safety.Abstracts 59Methods: A total of 133 subjects with symptomatic gall- stone diseases of gallstones /C208 mm were randomly allocat- ed in either EA group (n \u00bc66) or control group (n \u00bc67). Treatment group received 20 sessions of EA, while the con- trol group remained for observation. The proportion of patients with total clearance of gallstone and patients reported outcomes (PRO) before and after treatment were assessed. Ultrasonographers who performed the ultrasound were blinded to the allocation of the subjects. Results: The number and size of gallstones were statically comparable between groups of 133 subjects at baseline. Three (4.5%) subjects from EA group, while 1 (1.9%) subject from control group had total clearance of gallstones after the study. No significant difference on total clearance of gallstones was found between groups. PRO of EQ5D rose 0.01 in treatment group during the first 5 weeks while it dropped 0.04 in control group. At patient level, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for EQ5D is $34 129 per patient to raise Quality-Adjusted Life Y ears. At clinic level, ICERs for EQ5D was $9702, respectively, for having EA of gallstones diseases. The total cost for a patient treated in surgery in public hospital was HK$19 071 while HK$72 503 to $148 282 in private hospitals. Conclusion: The use of EA for gallstone diseases was found to be safe. With small sample size, it was found that EA was not able to increase total gallstone clearance. Acupuncture of 20 sessions was more expensive than doing surgery at the public hospital which greatly subsided by the Hong Kong government. The use of EQ5D showcased the decision-making pathway for patients' centered care. P02.19 Effect of Moxibustion on Intestinal and Serum Malondialdehyde Content and Intestinal IL-6 and TNF- aLevels in Naturally Aging Rats Ouyang Xiali1, Han Li1, and Zhao Baixiao1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Ouyang Xiali, 18810900268@163.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to observe the effect of moxibustion at Guanyuan point on the levels of intestinal malondialde- hyde (MDA) and serous MDA and intestinal inflammatory cytokines in natural aging female rats and to explore the possible mechanism of its anti-aging effect. Methods: The young group was composed of 8 12-week- old female Wistar rats, 16 36-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 2 groups, control group and health moxibustion group. The 3 groups of rats wereshaved in the Guanyuan area and fixed with a special rat fixator for 20 minutes/day for 40 days. The health-care mox- ibustion group was treated with special fine moxa strip at Guanyuan point. Forty days later, the contents of MDA inintestine and serum was measured by thiobarbituric acid method, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- ain rat intestine were detected by enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay. Results: Compared with the young group, the contents of intestinal and serum MDA and the expression of inflamma- tory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- ain the control group were higher than those in the young group. Compared with thecontrol group, the content of serum MDA and the expres-sion of intestinal inflammatory cytokines IL-6 TNF- ain the health moxibustion group decreased. Conclusion: Moxibustion at Guanyuan point can regulate the intestinal immune system and improve the antioxidant capacity of naturally aging rats. Its mechanism may be relat- ed to reducing the level of intestinal inflammatory cytokinesand inhibiting the production of lipid peroxides in the body. P02.20 Evidence-Based Evaluation on Safety Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Si-Hong Yang, sihong_yang@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: Cheezheng pain relieving plaster is widely used in clinical treatment of a variety of diseases. For proprietaryChinese medicines, safety is as important as efficacy. Through a method combined bibliometrics analysis with evidence-based evaluation to conduct the safety ofCheezheng pain relieving plaster. Methods: Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP , WanFang, and CBM) and English databases (PubMed and CochraneLibrary) and the State Food and Drug Administration Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center database were retrieved from the establishment of each database to April2019. All trials of Cheezheng pain relieving plaster were included. The methodology quality was assessed by interna- tionally recognized evaluation tools or standards, and usingR 3.5.3 software to meta-analysis the incidence of adversereactions/events. The factors affecting the adverse reac- tions/events of Cheezheng pain relieving plaster were dis- cussed through subgroup analysis, and descriptive analysis60 Global Advances in Health and Medicinewas performed on the studies that could not be meta- analyzed. Results: Sixty-two randomized controlled trial (RCT), 9CCT, 15 case series, and 8 case reports were included;8111 cases of Cheezheng pain relieving plaster used in 86RCT/CCT/case series studies; and 579 cases of adversereactions/events. The meta results showed that the inci-dence of adverse reactions/events of pain reliev-ing plaster was 3.73% (95% confidence interval: 2.57%,5.10%). Subgroup analysis showed that there was no signif-icant association between the incidence of adverse reac-tions/events among the type of disease, whether it wascombined, the mode of administration, the length of med-ication, and duration of treatment. Conclusion: The incidence of adverse reactions/events in Cheezheng pain relieving plaster in this study was 3.73%,but the incidence was overestimated due to the inclusion ofresearch methodological quality problem and the lack ofstudies into unreported adverse reactions/events. Theadverse reactions/events mainly manifested as skin allergies.It is recommended to pay attention to the patient's allergyhistory and medication history before clinical application toensure the safety of medication. P02.21 Effect of Acupuncture on Postprandial Distress Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China 3Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China Contact: Jingwen Yang, yangjw0626@126.com Abstract Purpose: Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) is the most common subtype of functional dyspepsia, and itlacks satisfactory treatment. Acupuncture is a commontreatment for PDS, but the effect is uncertain due to thepoor quality of prior studies. This trial was conducted toassess the efficacy of acupuncture in patients with PDS. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, sham acupuncture-controlled trial conducted at 5 hospitals inChina, we randomly assigned 278 adults who had PDS toacupuncture or sham acupuncture thrice a week for4 weeks. The 2 primary outcomes were the response ratebased on overall treatment effect (OTE) and eliminationrate of all 3 cardinal symptoms: postprandial fullness, upper abdominal bloating, and early satiation after 4-week treatment. Results: A beneficial OTE at week 4 occurred in 115 (83.3%) of 138 patients with acupuncture, compared with 72 (51.4%) of 140 patients who received sham acupuncture (odds ratio, 4.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.71 to 8.24, P<.001). The elimination rate was 28.3% among patients receiving acupuncture compared with 16.4% in the sham acupuncture group (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.58, P\u00bc.02). The efficacy of acupuncture was maintained during 12-week posttreatment follow-up. There were no serious adverse events. Conclusion: Acupuncture is an effective treatment that increased OTE respond and elimination rate of PDS, with sustained efficacy over 12 weeks in patients who received 4- week acupuncture thrice a week. P02.22 Blepharospasm Treated by Facial Acupressure and Auricular Point Sticking: A Retrospective Case Series of 60 Children Zhang Ying Ying1, Liu Jingping1, and Yang Ming1 1Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Zhang Ying Ying, yuchen8240@126.com Abstract Purpose: Blepharospasm is characterized with involuntary hyperactivity of periocular muscles, increased blink rate,and eye dryness. The aim is to preliminarily evaluate clinical effects and safety of facial acupressure and auricular point sticking on children with blepharospasm. Methods: Sixty children aged 3 to 9 years with blepharo- spasm diagnosed by a universal clinical guideline in acupunc- ture clinic of Xi'an NO. Four hospitals, 35 males, and 25 females were all observed between March and October in 2018. All children were only given the same acupoints stim- ulation (once daily, 15 min each session, for 6 days). Firstly, we applied acupressure manually on facial and head acu- points: 20), and Sishencong (EX-HN 1), then combined with pediatric massage for relaxation, such as Kai tianmen, Yun taiyang, and kneading manipulations. After acupressure and massage adopting auricular point sticking on Shenmen, Fengxi, Erjian, Liver, Spleen, Brain stem and Endocrine to consolidate curative effect (replacing new ear sticker every 2 days for 18 days).Abstracts 61Results: According to the Cohen's blepharospasm evalua- tion scales, the frequency of eyelid spasm before and after treatment was scored from 0 to 4. Rating dropped to 0 and dry eyes feeling disappeared was defined as cure. Forty chil- dren (67%) were cured after 3 courses (18 days) treatment.No adverse events were found, telephone follow-up of 40 curative children for 3 months revealing no relapse. Conclusion: Sequential use of facial acupressure, pediatric massage, and auricular point sticking may reduce the fre- quency of blinking and relieve eye dryness symptom in chil- dren with blepharospasm. Therefore, it is worthy of further validation in randomized controlled trials. P02.23 Which Standardized Scale of Skin Itchiness Is Appropriate to Evaluate ComprehensivePatient Change After Taking a TraditionalJapanese Medicine?: A Protocol naires) are currently available in many medical fields. We have also been developing an e-questionnaire system based on Japanese traditional Kampo medicine since 2008 based on specialists' consensus. After more than a decade of data collection and analysis in multiple institutions in Japan, wecollected more than 8000 participants' comprehensive symptom and careful follow-up data. We are analyzing these data and extracting specific features of Japanese Kampo medicine, including how specialists are making a traditional pattern diagnosis and deciding on an appropriateherbal formula. At present, we are tackling following par- ticipants' subjective symptoms and objective findings using standardized scales according to each conventional diagnosis. Methods: We are including adult patients with skin itchi- ness, which is one of the most frequent symptoms in Japanese Kampo medicine clinics, mainly due to atopic der- matitis or any other form of eczema. The patient profile and symptoms will be investigated at the first consultation andfollowed using a visual analogue scale via our e-question- naire system for 3 months of taking any personalized Kampo medicine. The symptoms and findings will be fol- lowed using standardized scales, namely, the Patient- Oriented Eczema Measure, Eczema Area and SeverityIndex, 5-D itch scale (5 D), and Skindex 16. In addition, we will measure participants' levels of inflammation markersin the blood due to allergic reactions and intestinal perme- ability based on the concept of the gut-skin axis or leaky gut. Results: This observational pilot study has been approved by an appropriate institutional review board, and we areaiming to recruit 30 participants. Conclusion: It will provide more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of subjective symptoms and objec- tive findings in participants with skin itchiness.

Methods: A phase IV, multicenter, prospective, 1-armed, real-world study has been conducted in 38 cases of hospi-tals in China. Patients with atherosclerotic thrombotic cere- meridional intermingled phlegm and blood stasis) wereenrolled. Patients were treated with T ongluo Huatan Capsule (1.2 g thrice daily) orally for 4 weeks without Chinese patent medicine such as invigorate blood andunblock the collaterals, extinguish wind, and dissolve phlegm. The primary endpoints were Neurological function deficit assessment (NIHSS), traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) syndrome scores, modified Rankin scores (mRS) and safety including electrocardiogram, blood routine, liver and kidney function, and so on. Results: A total of 2169 cases were enrolled. The mean NIHSS decreased from 7.46 /C62.12 at baseline to 4.22 /C662 Global Advances in Health and Medicine1.82 at week 4 ( P<.01), and the mean TCM syndrome scores decreased from 9.74 /C62.23 at baseline to 5.29 /C6 2.19 at week 4 ( P<.01). The total effective rate of NIHSS and TCM syndrome scores were 84.09% and 81.43%,respectively. The mRS was 2.19 /C60.86 before treatment and 1.55 /C60.85 after treatment ( P<.01). The rate of adverse events was 0.06%, and no severe adverse eventsoccurred. The adverse reactions were mainly the gastroin- testinal tract reaction manifested as abdominal fullness and stomachache, and so on. Conclusion: T ongluo Huatan Capsule is effective and safe for the treatment of cerebral infarction recovery phase. P02.25 Impact of Self-Acupressure for Fatigue in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Pilot Trial Suzanna Zick1, Eduard Drannikov1, erythematosus (SLE) is a preva- lent autoimmune disease, with high levels of fatigue, lackingtreatments. Self-acupressure has been shown to reducefatigue in other populations. We conducted a pilot studyto determine feasibility and preliminary impact on fatigue in people with SLE.Methods: Participants were women >18 years with a diag- nosis of SLE and fatigue /C214, measured by Brief Fatigue inventory (BFI). Women were randomized into 4 groups;usual care (UC), sham acupressure (sham), stimulating acu- pressure (SA), or relaxing acupressure (RA), once daily for 6 weeks, and then participated in a 4-week washout period.Feasibility was assessed through study retention. Fatiguewas assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 10 weeks. Linear mixedmodels were used to assess the impact of group by visiton fatigue. Results: One hundred sixteen women were screened and 52 participants were enrolled (UC \u00bc13, sham \u00bc14, SA\u00bc14, RA \u00bc11). At baseline fatigue was 5.8 /C61.8, age was 46.3 /C611.0, 69% of the women were white, and 25% were black. Of the 52 participants, 11 withdrew by week 3, and 22 by week 6; 23 (44%) women completed all 10 weeks, P\u00bc0.27 across groups. At 3, 6, and 10 weeks, SA was supe- rior to RA, sham, and UC (mean change baseline to 6 weeksof BFI:/C03.1/C60.8 SA, /C01.9/C60.7 RA, /C02.0/C60.6 sham, and /C00.7/C60.6 UC (group by visit at 3, 6, and 10 weeks were all P>.05). One women experienced mild transient bruising and another pain in fingers joints when applying acupressure. Conclusion: Self-acupressure was safe. Acupressure and SA in particular led to clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue of 33% to 50%. However, many women did not complete all 6 weeks of treatment. Shorter self- acupressure treatment <3 weeks and examination of characteristics that led to drop-out could help to better maximize the use of acupressure in SLE. P02.26LB Treatment of Ptosis (MG) is autoimmune neu- romuscular disease characterized by weakness and fatigabil- ity of the skeletal muscles when autoantibodies are directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromus- cular junction. In MG, there is an 80% decrease in AChR;10% to 40% of cases affect only the muscles controlling eye and eyelid movement causing ptosis and diplopia. Since there is no cure for MG, treatments are primarily aimed at improving nerve impulses to muscle or suppressing the immune system. Studies on rats have shown that acupunc- ture can increase AChR expression at the neuromuscular junction, alleviating muscle atrophy. Studies have also shown that acupuncture can help regulate T cells and T helper cells. In Eastern medicine, muscle weakness and fatigue are caused by a deficiency of Qi and a stagnation within acupuncture meridians. Providing acupuncture treatments to strengthen the root Qi weakness and remove stagnation may help treat ptosis from MG. Methods: A 57-year-old male with AChR \u00feMG and thy- moma status post thymectomy and radiation March 2017 who presented with ptosis diplopia. Diplopia resolved globulin, though the ptosis persisted. Cellcept was added September 2019. He received 16 treatments that included acupuncture, tui na massage, dietary, and lifestyle recom- mendations at the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine over 7 months.Abstracts 63Results: Patient subjectively noticed improvement in ptosis after 2 treatments. He reported 90% improvement after 10treatments. There was a concurrent decrease in MG quality of life (MG-QoL15r) score (10-1) and decrease MG activ- ities of daily living score (2.5-0.1). Prednisone was reduced from 40 mg to 20 mg qd. Insomnia and constipation had resolved. Conclusion: This case study suggests that an East-West medicine approach including acupuncture, tui na massage, and concurrent with standard Western medications mayhelp treat refractory ptosis from myasthenia gravis and deserves P02.27LB Licensed Acupuncturists' Clinical Reasoning: Demonstration of Complexity,Connectivity, and Lisa Taylor-Swanson 1, Tanuja Prasad2, and Lisa Conboy3 1College of Nursing University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 2ApplyComplexity, New York City, New York 3NESA, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: Lisa Taylor-Swanson, lisa.taylor-swanson@nurs.utah.edu Abstract Purpose: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) uses diag- nostic and treatment procedures that are complex and tai- lored to each patient. The complexity of the medicine is acore concept and strength of traditional acupuncture and can be maintained successfully in a randomized controlled trial format and often with better results than standardized protocols. This project aims to describe clinicians' reasoning during the provision of individualized treatment. Methods: We used several qualitative techniques, including (1) diagnostic interviewing to identify and describe varia- tions in diagnostic reasoning and heuristics as described inretrospective accounts given by acupuncturists in response to their review of clinical records of a small sample of patients they treated in a clinical trial of acupuncture, (2)double coding the diagnostic interviewing data for themes of complexity, considering the TCM diagnostic framework as a complex system, and (3) frame analysis to identifytrends of changes in codes across practitioners. Purposive sampling was used to create a sample of practitioners from the parent study (n \u00bc4) with variation in training, offered diagnoses, and years of experience. Each clinician complet- ed 2 interviews covering 2 to 3 patient cases. Results: We found support for the TCM diagnostic system to act as a complex adaptive system. Found codes include aspects of complex systems including emergence,adaptation, connectivity, emergence, self-reflection, self- organization, nonlinearity, and a critical phase change in a clinician's thinking. Frame analysis revealed patterns in codes across clinicians.Conclusion: We requested our practitioners to perform individualized diagnoses\u2014a complex process requiringmore than the recitation of memorized facts and pat- terns\u2014and we are as interested in capturing how practi- tioners thought as what they thought. Considering the diag-nostic process as a complex system may offer insight into the operation of other complex systems of clinical reason- ing, such as biomedicine, in addition to adding to the med-ical education literature. P03: Clinical Research: Herbs and Supplements P03.01 A Feasibility Study of Lavender Aromatherapy in an Awake Craniotomy Environment Diane Ames1and Nancy Conway1 1Advocate Aurora Health Care, Milwaukee, Wisconsin Contact: Diane Ames, diane.ames@aurora.org Abstract Purpose: Awake craniotomy maps speech, motor, and sen- sory function during tumor resection. Although many patients tolerate this surgery well, some studies report patients experience moderate to severe pain and anxiety.Alternate methods to mitigate pain and anxiety are needed; however, interventions are limited due to potential interfer- ence with the neurocognitive exam. There is a body of lit- erature related to lavender aromatherapy used to reduce anxiety or pain in a variety of pre/post-surgical procedures.This feasibility study determined the number of patients that would consent to participate and complete the study. Secondary objectives measured the effects of lavender onanxiety and pain, and to improve satisfaction with pain con- trol in patients undergoing awake cranial surgery. Methods: This was a single arm pilot 10-month study. Forty consecutive patients /C2118 were approached. Participants received standard of care intraoperatively plusaromatherapy delivered via nasal inhaler at designated times. The devise contained 15 drops of Lavender and grapeseed 4 drops. Outcome measures included enrollment and completion rates, anxiety, and pain as measured by the Visual Analog Scale Anxiety (VAS-A) and pain (VAS-P) and64 Global Advances in Health and Medicinesatisfaction with pain control as measured by the Patient Opinion of Pain Management survey (POPM) using an inde-pendent ttest. Results: In total, 31 patients (77% of 40 patients approached, 86% of patients consented) completed all ele- ments of the trial. Most patients (77%) preferred to receive the aromatherapy on an as-needed basis, compared to 23% who preferred scheduled inhalations. Both the VAS-A and VAS-P mean scores did not reach significance; however, themean score for anxiety was slightly higher at each inhalation point, and the pain score was the same or slightly higher before aromatherapy as compared to postprocedure.POPM scores indicated satisfaction with pain control during surgery. Conclusion: This study demonstrated patient willingness to participate in receiving intraoperative lavender aroma- therapy during awake cranial surgery. P03.02 Effect of Alkaline Reducing Water on J Therapy\u2014Salgado Institute of Brazil 2Laboratory of Experimental Sciences Program\u2014University Contact: Francisco J Cidral-Filho, cidral@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of alkaline reducing water in comparison to reverseosmosis (RO) water on Hydration via Bio-electric Impedance (BI) and plasma osmolarity. Methods: The study was conducted at the Salgado Institute of integrative Health, Londrina, PR, Brazil, and the protocol was approved by the Institutions Ethics com- mittee. Informed consent forms were obtained during patient screening phase of the study at the site of thestudy. Sample size consisted of 20 healthy volunteers (8 males and 12 females, ages 20-30) randomized by single draw into 2 experimental groups (n \u00bc10 per group). Participants were assessed at baseline (bioelectrical imped- ance analysis\u2014Quantum V, RJL Systems, Clinton T and plasma osmolarity) and were asked to drink1 L of water (alkaline reducing or RO) a day for 5 days. On day 6 postbaseline, participants were re-evaluated. Alkalinity (pH 9.65) was achieved by adding to reverse osmosis water 0.4 mL/L of a proprietary sodium silicate formulation (Cisne enterprises Inc., Odessa, T exas). Negative oxidation reduction potential ( /C0300 mV) and increased free electrons is induced by infusing the water with a proprietary hydrogas technology (Altered Labs LLC, Fort Lauderdale, Florida). Combined, these technolo- gies turn drinkable water into a potent alkaline, reducing (anti-oxidative) agent. Results: Alkaline reducing water induced a sig- in total body water ( p<.038) and lular water ( p<.046); as well as in extracellular water (although not statistically significant). Plasma osmolarity also significantly ( P<.0219) decreased with consumption of alkaline reducing water. Conclusion: Five consecutive days of consumption of 1 L of alkaline reducing water significantly increased total body and intracellular wate, while decreased plasma osmolarity, indicating increased hydration in comparison to reverse osmosis water consumption. P03.03 Effect of Rubus ideaus (Red Raspberry) Consumption During Pregnancy in a MouseModel Marie Hastings-Tolsma 1, Ryan Stoffel1, Allie Stinchcomb1, Robert and Jacob Turner2 1Baylor University, Dallas, Texas 2Stephen F Austin State University, Nacogdoches, Texas Contact: Marie Hastings-Tolsma, marie_hastings-tolsma@baylor.edu Abstract Purpose: The trigger for the onset of human labor remains a scientific mystery. Being born too early or too late is a global health problem and interventions that stimulate or block labor processes are urgently needed. This research examined Rubus idaeus (RI)\u2014commonly referred to as red raspberry leaf, which is widely purported to be efficacious in promoting cervical ripening and favorable birth out- comes. The purpose of this randomized control trial was to determine the influence of RI consumption during gesta- tion on C57BL/6 mice and their offspring. The aims were to (1) determine differences in the length of gestation, gesta- tional weight gain, and litter size where RI is consumed daily at varied strengths and (2) determine differences in off- spring characteristics and behavior where maternal RI con- sumption has occurred.Abstracts 65Methods: Once paired, mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: placebo (n \u00bc10) receiving plain water, RI aque- ous extract fluid of 38 mg/g/day (n \u00bc10), and RI aqueous extract fluid of 57 mg/g/day (n \u00bc10). All received the same standardized diet throughout gestation. Pregnant mice were weighed daily and chow intake, and fluid consumption was determined daily. Length of gestation and litter size were determined at the time of birth. Differences in offspring characteristics were also determined and included physical characteristics (weight and body development) and neuro- motor reflex and behavior (locomotive abilities, geotaxis reflex, cliff avoidance reflex, and swimming development). Results: Preliminary findings suggest that litter size and number of viable pups were reduced with RI exposure in a dose dependent fashion ( Pvalues .0442 and .0286, respective- ly). Length of gestation did not differ between groups. Reductions in gestational weight gain were also observed but were not found to be statistically significant ( Pvalue .177). Conclusion: Use of RI from early gestation should be reconsidered, particularly at high doses. P03.04 Safety of Anthroposophic Medicinal Products: An Analysis of Adverse DrugReactions From German Pharmacovigilance Databases Jong 2Louis Bolk Institute, Utrecht, Netherlands 3European Scientific Cooperative on Anthroposophic Medicinal Products, Institute for Applied Epistemology and Medical Methodology at the Witten/Herdecke University, Freiburg, Germany 4Louis Bolk Institute, University of Applied Sciences Leiden, Zuid Holland, Netherlands 5European Scientific Cooperative on Anthroposophic Medicinal Products, Institute for Applied Epistemology and Medical Methodology at theWitten/Herdecke University, Faculty of Health, Freiburg, Germany Contact: miek.jong@miun.se Abstract Purpose: Anthroposophical medicinal product (AMP) ther- apy is a widely used form of complementary and alternative medicine in Germany and other countries world-wide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of AMPs on a system level. Methods: Retrolective safety analysis of AMP-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in pharmacovigilance data-bases of 4 AMP manufacturers in Germany. For each ADR, information about the patient, outcome, causality, and AMPwas retrieved. Primary outcome was the frequency of reported ADRs relative to the maximum daily administra- tion doses (MDAD) sold. Results: In the period 2010 to 2017, a total of 5506 ADRs were reported that had occurred in 2762 patients, compris-ing 370 different AMPs. The overall frequency of reportedADRs for AMPs was 1.5 per million MDAD. A total of 104 ADRs (1.9%) were classified as serious, and the overall fre- quency of reported serious ADRs was 0.03 per millionMDAD. Most frequently reported serious ADRs were urti-caria (n \u00bc8; 0.002 ADRs per million MDAD) 0.001 ADRs per million MDAD). Most fre- quent nonserious ADRs were eye irritation (n \u00bc411; 0.1 ADRs per million MDAD), injection site inflammation(n\u00bc379; 0.1 ADRs per million MDAD), and application site pain (n \u00bc286; 0.08 ADRs per million MDAD). ADRs were more frequently reported with parenteral AMP administration (18.9 ADRs per million MDAD), compared to oral (0.6 ADRs per million MDAD) and local administra-tion (1.6 ADRs per million MDAD). The large majority ofpatients (91.9%) had recovered or were recovering fromthe ADR, and there were no reports with a fatal outcome.Most ADRs were reported by health-care professionals (57.7%), such as pharmacists (29.9%) and physicians (7.2%). Conclusion: In this retrolective safety analysis of pharma- covigilance data, reported ADRs were very rare. No areasof safety concern for AMP therapy were identified. P03.05 Mixture of Rhodiola L. Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea 2Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea Contact: Yunna Kim, yunna.anna.kim@khu.ac.kr Abstract Purpose: Chronic sleep disturbances can result in low per- formance of activities during the day such as decreasedconcentration and lethargy, leading to poor quality of life and increased burden on medical use and costs. Drugs com- monly used to treat insomnia can cause side effects. Thisstudy was conducted to investigate a new agent that cansolve the side effect of existing insomnia treatment and helpsleep quality using root of Rhodiola rosea L . and seed of Nelumbo nucifer a extract (RNE). Methods: We examined the change of sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life in the cases with subthreshold insomniaafter administration of RNE. We recruited 20-65-year-old66 Global Advances in Health and Medicinehealthy people with subthreshold insomnia. The RNE was prepared as capsules containing extract of root of Rhodiola rosea L. and seed of N. nucifera by the proportion of 2:1. The participants orally administered 2 capsules/day (750 mg/day) before sleep for 2 weeks. Insomnia severity index (ISI), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), sleep diary, fatigueseverity scale (FSS), and Short Form-36 Results: Six men (30.0%) and 14 women (70.0%) were included, and 13 finished the trial. The clinical trialshowed that RNE improved overall sleep quality.Subjective evaluation index for sleep, such as ISI, PSQI total score, and component 1, showed improvements over time. The ISI score decreased from 12.80 /C61.36 to 10.00/C64.71, and its PSQI score was reduced from 10.25 /C6 2.38 to 8.40 /C63.03. Wake time after sleep onset (WASO) decreased by 57% and sleep efficiency also showed stasti- cally significant change. FSS was not significantly changed, but items of SF-36 which were related to physical healthand mental health significantly increased afteradministration. Conclusion: RNE markedly improved sleep quality of people with subthreshold insomnia and also amelioratedphysical and mental health with safety. These results suggestthat RNE might be a preventive or therapeutic agent for sleep disturbance. P03.06 Whole System Ayurvedic Medicine Approach for Chronic Low Back Pain Anupama Kizhakkeveettil1and Jayagopal Parla1 1Southern California Contact: Anupama Kizhakkeveettil, anukv2017@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to describe the role of whole system Ayurvedic medicine approach for management of chroniclow back pain (LBP). Methods: Information from the Ayurvedic classical text- book and scientific evidence for the whole system approachof Ayurveda for management of LBP will be explained alongwith a case discussion. Clinical feature: A 35-year-old female presented with LBP of 6 years duration. Pain limited her endurance capacity for walking, sitting for a long time, driv-ing, and climbing steps. When the patient came to the initialAyurveda consultation, she reported severe pain through-out the past week, and the intensity of LBP was rated as 9 to 10 while walking, and 6 to 7 while resting (on a 0-10 numeric pain scale). Imaging done 8 months ago had shownreduction in the intervertebral spaces and herniation of L3-L4 and L5-S1 disc. Magnetic resonance imaging done 8 months ago initial visit for Ayurveda indicate reductionin the intervertebral spaces and herniation Score: 51% representthe severe disabilities. Interventions and outcomes: The patient was managed with Ayurvedic diet, lifestyle changes, along with herbs, and yoga for 6 weeks. Patient was alsorecommended an Ayurvedic therapy called \"Katibasti\" foronce a week for 6 weeks. Results: The LBP was relieved over a 6-week period with Ayurvedic protocols. At the end of the 4th week, thepatient reported pain rated at 3 to 4 out of 10 while walkingand 0 to 2 out of 10 while resting. Oswestry Disability Indexscore was 28% at the sixth week indicating minimal disabil-ity. At the end of the sixth week, all functional activities had improved. Conclusion: The results of this current case study indicate that whole system approach of Ayurvedic medicine may beeffective for management of chronic LBP especially withpain and functional activities. P03.07 Andr /C19e, Contact: Renato Leca, renatoleca@terra.com.br Abstract Purpose: Garlic is one of the most important bulb crop grown in the world and is rich in allicin. Allicin undergoesenzymatic reaction and is converted to hydrogen sulfide that increase vascular endothelial growth factor levels and promote angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was toevaluate the effect of germinated bulb garlic on thewound healing skin. Methods: It was used germinated garlic bulb alcoholic extract at 10% (w/w) carried in emulsion (EE) comparedto a placebo emulsion (PE) in Wistar rats. T wo parallelincisions were made on the right (EE) and left (PE) sidesof rat's back, and the tissues were prepared for histologicaland morphometrical analysis (3rd, 7th and 14th day) afterthe beginning of the assay. Results: After 3 days, both area of wound showed fibri- nous crust and in their surroundings, new blood vessels, andlarge amount of inflammatory cells; however, there is noAbstracts 67difference between the treatments. After 7 days of lesion, the 2 treatments decreased inflammatory infiltrate, pres- ence of granulation tissue, and a fibroblastic proliferation was observed. At the 14th day, both areas showed a reduc-tion of blood vessels, fibroblasts, and large amount of col- lagen fibers in the extracellular matrix of dermis, but, in EE treated area, there was a better organization of matrixfibers, extracellular, and thicker collagen fibers. The repair-ing process was faster when compared to the PE treated area. The blood vessel number in 3 days is lower in EE (156.7/C650.33) when compared to PE (213.3 /C681.45). At 7th and 14th days, respectively, the vessels number is higher in EE treated area (171.0 /C662.86/65.5 /C66.36) than the PE (140.0/C617.32/55.5 /C614.85), although those differences were not significant. Conclusion: It is possible to conclude that garlic bulb alco- holic extract can improve the wound healing skin in rats. P03.08 T ear and Plasma Vitamin D Studies Abstract Purpose: aim is to compare tear and blood vitamin D3 levels in healthy young adults practicing physical activity, with different times of sun exposure, and to evaluate theeffects of vitamin D3 eye drop supplementation. Methods: Thirty-six volunteers (19-27 years) separated into 2 groups: indoor (sun exposure less than 3 h/week) and outdoor (sun exposure more than 7 h/week) activities.Blood vitamin D3 levels (3 mL venous blood) and tear levels (Schirmer tapes ) were evaluated. Both tear and blood were electrochemiluminescently evaluated to assess metabolite25 (OH) vitamin D3 levels. After that, vitamin D3 eyedrops were used to evaluate possible changes in these levels. Results: The mean plasma vitamin D3 level in the indoor group was 25.01 ng/mL, while the mean plasma vitamin D3 level in the outdoor group was 35.55 ng/mL ( P<.05). In all 36 participants, vitamin D3 tear levels were higher than100 ng/mL (the upper limit of the system used), wellabove plasma levels in both participant groups ( P<.01). In 6 of these randomly chosen subjects, prepared vitamin D3 eye drops were used, with each drop containing 5000 IU,and 1 drop was instilled into each eye twice a day for 3 weeks to assess serum levels. A mean increase was observed, at the plasma level of 25.18%, ranging from 9.2% to 42.8%. Conclusion: Vitamin D3 tear mean levels were high in all volunteers of this syudy, regardless of sun exposure time; vitamin D3 tear mean levels were much higher than plasma levels in both indoor and outdoor physical activities. The eye drop was effective and increased vit D3 serum levels by 25.18%, with only 3 weeks of use, suggesting the usefulness of the conjunctival pathway for vit D3 absorption. Both results are unpublished in the world literature. P03.10 Effects of Pau d' Arco on Contact: Christine McClure, christinem0685@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of Tabebuia avellanedae for primary dysmenorrhea (PDM). PDM is experienced by up to 90% of menstruating women in the United States, causes signif- icant work and school absenteeism, and is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain. Current treatments including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and combined oral contraceptives can have significant side effects with chronic use. Tabebuia avellanedae is a South American tree, the inner bark of which has great potential as a candidate treatment for PDM as it inhibits production of PGE2 and reduces cyclooxygenase-2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Methods: This is a single arm, open-label trial evaluating safety and tolerability of 1050 mg/day of encapsulated Tabebuia avellanedae for 2 months in 12 generally healthy women aged 18 to 45 years with PDM. The effects of the treatment on quality of life, pain intensity, and pain interfer- ence, and on inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reac- tive protein and PGE2 are evaluated as secondary and ter- tiary measures, respectively. Results: This trial has been approved by the institutional review board at Helfgott Research Institute and the National University of Natural Medicine. Results are pend- ing study completion.68 Global Advances in Health and MedicineConclusion: The proposed study will be the first study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Tabebuia avellanedae in PDM. We also aim to collect proof-of-concept mechanis- tic data supporting the hypothesis that Tabebuia avellanedae reduces PGE2 concentration in vivo in women P03.12 High-Dose Cannabidiol for the Treatment of Parkinson's Related Sleep Dysfunction: Initial Results of a U.S. Case Study Megan Sweeney1and Robert Bonakdar1 1Scripps Center for Integrative California Contact: Megan Sweeney, sweeney.megan@scrippshealth.org Abstract Purpose: Sleep disorders are a common and refractory nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) affecting three-fourths of the patient population. Previous research has noted cannabidiol (CBD) as a potential treatment option.1-3Recently, hemp-based CBD products have become available in the United States. Methods: A 65-year-old female with a 5-year history of PD and clinical diagnosis of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and abnormal sleep study was evaluated. Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2) and Parkinson's Disease Questionare-39 (PDQ-39) were com-pleted. After evaluation, patient initiated a dose titration of a tincture with a verified 19 mg of CBD per serving. Patient reached an initial dose of 57 mg/day after 1 month and will be followed monthly to assess tolerability and efficacy. Results: After 1 month, PDSS-2 scores improved from 34 to 27 ( /C07; minimum clinically significant change [MCSC] \u00bc/C03.44). PDQ-39 improved from 72 to 59 (/C013; MCSDC \u00bc/C04.72). The patient tolerated treatment well and will continue with titration and monthly evaluation as part of an ongoing CBD case series. Conclusion: A hemp-based CBD extract demonstrates tolerability and efficacy in improving PD-related sleep abnormalities after 1 month of use. The results noted are clinically significant and the first U.S. documentation of ben- efits seen in previous case studies utilizing high-dose CBD. Note that only product was provided by CV Sciences, San Diego, California; they were not involved in any aspect of the present research. Patient completed a case study con- sent as part of a pre-existing institutional review board pro- tocol (IRB-13-6248).P03.13 Multispecies Jolla, California Contact: Megan Sweeney, sweeney.megan@scrippshealth.org Abstract Purpose: The occurrence of gastrointestinal diseases and comorbid migraine is well established. Some have theorized that migraine may be induced by a \"leaky gut\" that allows food particles to pass the gastrointestinal wall. Probiotics have demonstrated potential improvements in intestinal barrier function, although high-quality evidence is minimal. The gut microbiome has also been shown to play a role in chronic pain. These meta-analyses sought to aggregate and analyze previous studies on probiotics and migraine disorders. Methods: A search was performed in June 2019 to identify relevant English-language publications in Medline, Embase,Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library using the terms migraine (migraine disorders and headache) and probiotics (microbial dietary supplements, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and gut microbiota). A qualitative review of existing studies evaluated products, methodology, and validity. A systematic meta-analysis was conducted to obtain sums of populations and measures, compare means of distinct interventions, and evaluate outcomes. Results: A total of 6 studies, conducted between 2001 and 2019, representing 1241 adult, predominantly female partic- ipants with migraine between 18 and 75 years of age from 5 countries were included in the present meta-analysis. Themajority of participants across all included studies had been diagnosed with episodic or chronic migraine. Studies varied across intervention duration (8-12 weeks) number of strains in each probiotic (4-14 strains), composition (Lactobacillus Bifidum and Lactobacilis Acidophilus most frequent), dosages, and outcomes evaluated (migraine self- report surveys, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and quality of life). Overall, frequency and severity of migraine reduced across all studies. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Migraine is a widespread, disabling, and costly condition often accompanied by alterations in the gut microbiome. Although probiotics seemingly have greatpotential to reduce migraine, more randomized, controlled trials are needed to better understand mechanisms, optimal treatment combinations, and outcomes across various patient populations.Abstracts 69P03.14 Phosphatidylserine for the Treatment of Pediatric Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Alisha Bruton1, Douglas Hanes2, Alisha Bruton, brutona@ohsu.edu Abstract Purpose: The aim is to examine the evidence for phospha- tidylserine for symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) in children. Methods: Medline, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception through 2011/2018.Standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the heterogeneity of the studies was estimated using I2. Results: Four studies met inclusion criteria for the narra- tive review (n \u00bc230), and 3 for the meta-analysis (n \u00bc215). We found very low-quality evidence that phosphatidylserinemay be more effective than placebo in reducing total ADHD symptoms (effect size \u00bc0.74; 95% CI \u00bc/C00.10, 1.57), very low-quality evidence that phosphatidylserine may be moreeffective than placebo in improving symptoms of hyperac-tivity/impulsivity (effect size \u00bc0.55, 95% CI \u00bc/C00.21,1.31), and low-quality evidence that phosphatidylserine may be significantly more effective than placebo in improving symp-toms of inattention (effect size \u00bc0.36, 95% CI \u00bc0.07, 0.64). Phosphatidylserine may be effective for reducing symptoms of ADHD in children, particularly symp-toms of inattention. High-quality research in this area is warranted. P03.18 Shen Long Jian Ji, a Chinese Herb Formula, in the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Randomized, and Chuang Liu1 1Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China 2Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China 3Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, ChinaContact: Lijian Pang, hahaya123@126.com Abstract Purpose: Based on the early successful animal experi- ments, we aim to further investigate the clinical effective- ness and safety of Shen Long Jian Ji (SLJJ), a Chinese Herb formula, for the patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF). Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of T raditional Chinese Medicine. A total of 60participants were enrolled who were randomly divided intotreatment group and control group with 30 cases in eachgroup. The treatment group were treated with SLJJ granuleand control group with SLJJ placebo 3 times a day for90 days. The study outcomes include Traditional ChineseMedicine (TCM) symptoms scores, blood gas analysis(PO 2, PCO 2, and SO 2), lung function (TLC, VC, DLCO, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC) and 6WMT. The differences of all indicators in each group before and after treatment werecompared on 90th day and between the 2 groups on 30th,60th, and 90th day. Results: Following the completion of therapy, the difference of TCM symptoms scores, PO 2,P C O 2, 6WMT , DLCO, and FEV1 before and after treatment in the treatment group wasstatistically significant ( P<.05). The mean values of PO 2, , DLCO, and FEV1 were higher, while TCM symptomsscores and PCO 2were lower than those before treatment. However, no statistical difference was founded in the controlgroup ( P>.05). There were significant differences in TCM symptom scores, PO 2,P C O 2, DLCO, FEV1, and 6WMT between groups on 60th and 90th days ( P<.05). The mean values of PO 2, 6WMT , DLCO, and FEV1 were higher and TCM symptoms scores and PCO 2were lower in the treat- ment group than those in the control group. No seriousadverse reactions were observed during trail. Conclusion: SLJJ tend to improve multiple indicators of suffers with IPF which may be related to the course oftreatment and has good safety.

P03.19 Psilocybin Use and the Subjective Experience of Connectedness John Phipps1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: John Phipps, jphipps@nunm.edu70 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: Classic psychedelics such as psilocybin- containing mushrooms are receiving growing interest fortheir therapeutic potential in conditions such as addictionand treatment-resistant depression. The results of early clinical trials are encouraging. Much of this research has been conducted in highly controlled clinical environmentsand under conditions of reduced sensory input.Development of these therapeutics will require inclusionof a more naturalistic and expansive contextualization ofparticipant experiences, including relationships betweeninner and outer worlds. The objective of this study was to better understand how psilocybin use has influenced participants' experience of connectedness. Methods: T en individuals with multiple psilocybin experi- ences, but not currently using any psychedelics (within pre- ceding 2 months), and no diagnosis of serious mental illnessparticipated in 2 semistructured interviews. The interviewswere recorded and transcribed verbatim to text.Transcripts were independently coded in duplicate and ana-lyzed by inductive thematic analysis with integrated consen- sus-building. Results: The theme of increased connectedness associated with psilocybin experiences emerged from all participants. The primary focus of this sense of connection was varied and included the physical body, familial and social relation-ships, the environment and its biota, and a universal spiritualpresence or \"higher power\". Additional themes includedthe persistence of these impressions over time and thetransformative effect these impressions had on participants'subsequent life experiences. Conclusion: A subjective sense of enhanced connected- ness deriving from psilocybin experiences is a common andcentral theme reported by participants. These findings sup- port a potential role for this sense of enhanced connected- ness as a component of the reported therapeutic effects ofpsilocybin. Future research could be strengthened by con-sideration of this factor within the experimental design. P03.20 Effect of Resveratrol on Cytochrome P450 Washington 2Impel Neuropharma, Seattle, Washington 3National University of Natural Medicine, Brice Thompson, bthom89@uw.eduAbstract Purpose: Resveratrol, a polyphenolic antioxidant, is used as a dietary supplement in inflammation, obesity, and aging. In vitro studies have shown that resveratrol is a mechanism- based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), anenzyme important in the metabolism of numerous drugs. We conducted a pilot study to investigate whether single and multiple doses of resveratrol altered the pharmacoki- netics of midazolam, an established clinical substrate for CYP3A4, to determine the extent of the natural product-drug interaction in vivo. Methods: Six healthy adults were recruited for a pharma- cokinetic study of oral midazolam on 3 study days: prior toresveratrol administration (day 1), following a single 1 g oral dose of resveratrol (day 8), and following a daily 1 g oral dose of resveratrol for 1 week (day 15). Plasma sampleswere collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry for midazolam. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was used to estimate the param-eters. Geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals were used to compare results following single and multiple resveratrol dosing to baseline. Results: Peak midazolam concentrations were increased by 18% and 40% following single and multiple doses of resver- atrol, respectively. Exposure to midazolam increased by10% and 28% following single and multiple doses of resver- atrol, respectively. Possibly due to a concomitant decrease in the apparent oral volume of distribution, the terminalhalf-life of midazolam was slightly decreased upon multiple doses of resveratrol, although the change was not as appar- ent following a single dose of resveratrol. Conclusion: Overall, minor interactions were seen with single and multiple doses of resveratrol. Based on the oralpharmacokinetics of midazolam, it appears that resveratrol inhibits intestinal CYP3A4 with minimal effect on hepatic CYP3A4. Further investigation is necessary to confirmwhether longer treatment regimens of resveratrol will result in increased inhibition of CYP3A4 phar- is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric conditions of childhood and can persist into adulthood with numerous adverse health outcomes. Many children do not receive standard-of-care stimulant medica- tion due to side effects or lack of effectiveness. Other options, including integrative therapies, warrant investigation. Objective: T o examine the evidence for effectiveness of phosphatidylserine supplementation for symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents. Inclusion/Exclusion: Study participants were children /C2018 years old with ADHD. Intervention was phosphatidyl- serine supplementation in any dose/duration, compared to placebo, wait list, or standard of care. Outcome measureswere validated scales of ADHD symptoms. All study designs were included in the narrative review, but only trials were included in the meta-analysis. Methods: Pubmed/Medline, Pubmed/Ovid, The Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception through November 2018. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and the heterogeneity of the studies was estimated using I2. Results: Six studies met inclusion criteria for the narrative review (n \u00bc1064) and 3 studies for the meta-analysis (n\u00bc215). We found very low-quality evidence that phos- phatidylserine may be more effective than placebo in reduc- ing total ADHD symptoms (effect size \u00bc0.74; 95% CI\u00bc/C00.10, 1.57). We found very low-quality evidence that phosphatidylserine may be more effective than placebo in improving symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity (effect size\u00bc0.55, 95% CI \u00bc/C00.21,1.31) and low-quality evidence that phosphatidylserine may be significantly more effective than placebo in improving symptoms of inattention (effect size\u00bc0.36, 95% CI \u00bc0.07, 0.64). Conclusion: Phosphatidylserine may be effective for reducing symptoms of ADHD in children, particularly symp- toms of inattention. High-quality research in this area is warranted. Future trials should be randomized, controlled, and adequately powered.

Methods: We analyze medical records of 114 patients who visited Indara oriental medical clinic for dry eye syndrome.Patients were treated with acupuncture and Inmok-tang, and the ocular surface disease index was evaluated before and after treatment. Results: Analysis of 114 medical records showed a signif- icant decrease in the pretreatment and posttreatmentocular surface disease index and a statistically significant positive correlation between the duration of Inmok-tang administration and the change in the ocular surface diseaseindex. Conclusion: Herbal medicine treatment with Inmok-tang reduces the Ocular Surface Disease Index, an indicator ofsubjective symptoms of dry eye syndrome. P03.23LB Enteromorpha prolifera Extract Prevents Against Oxidative Ree Kim, mrkim@cnu.ac.kr Abstract Purpose: Enteromorpha prolifera (EPE), which is one of the green algae, contains various antioxidants such as carote- noids, phycocyanin, chlorophyll, and phenolic compounds. Moreover, ethylacetate extract of EPE showed the highest72 Global Advances in Health and MedicineDPPH radical scavenging activity compared with water or ethanol extract. Nonetheless, there has been no report onthe effect of EPE on memory impairment due to oxidativedamage. In this study, we examined that protective effect ofEPE against oxidative stress-induced memory deficit inanimal model. Methods: EPE was orally administered (50 or 100 mg/kg body weight) to mice and then scopolamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.)was intraperinoneally administered for 5 weeks. Memoryperformance was evaluated in the Morris water maze testand passive avoidance test. Also, brain acetylcholinesterase(AChE) and cholineacetyl transferase (ChAT) activity, bio-markers of oxidative stress and the loss of neuronal cells inhippocampus was evaluated by histological examinations. Results: Administration of EPE significantly restored memory impairments induced by scopolamine in theMorris water maze test (escape latency and number ofcrossing platform area) and in the passive avoidance test.Treatment with EPE inhibited the AChE activity andincreased the ChAT activity in the brain of memory-impaired mice induced by scopolamine. Additionally, theadministration of EPE significantly prevented the increaseof lipid peroxidation and the decrease of glutathione levelin the brain of mice treated with scopolamine. Also, the EPEtreatment restored the activities of antioxidant enzymesincluding peroxidase and glutathione reductaseto control damage of neurons in hippocampal CA1 andCA3 regions were prevented by EPE treatment. Conclusion: It is suggested that EPE may be useful for memory improvement through the regulation of cholinergicmarker enzyme activities and the survival of neuronal cellfrom oxidative stress-induced cell death in the brain of mice. P03.25LB Randomized Controlled Trial With a Phytodrug Combination Root Andreas Michalsen1 1Charit Berlin Immanuel Hospital, Berlin, Germany 80 mg powder/filmtablet) has been used as licensed drug in Germany for more than 40 years, mainly for the treatment of respiratoryinfections. There is still insufficient evidence in uncomplicat-ed acute rhinosinusitis. Therefore, we performed a clinicalstudy to investigate the efficacy and safety of the commer- cially available herbal remedy (Angocin VRAnti-Infekt N, Repha, Germany). A total of 380 patients (m/f, aged 18-75) attend- ing one of the 16 study centers as a result of nasal obstruc-tion and facial pain for /C203 days were to be randomized in the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IV study.Treatment was the recommended dose of 3 /C24 film- coated tablets for 14 days. Main criterium for inclusionwas a score between 8 and 12 on the MRSSinv (MajorRhinosinusitis Symptom Score; investigator, judged by phy-sician). Primary outcome were changes in MRSSinv as reg- istered between days 6 and 10, computed as area under curve (AUC) and assessed by analysis of covariance withday 3 as covariate. The MRSSpat (judged by patient) wasused as coprimary endpoint. Results: A total of 380 patients were randomized, 348 finished per protocol (173 verum, 175 placebo). The anal-ysis of covariance provides a statistically significant smallerAUC with the herbal remedy versus placebo (17.5 vs 19.2;P\u00bc.03,v 2test). Interpolation and linear regression analyses confirmed the findings. Adverse events were registered in42 cases (21.9%) for verum, respectively, 35 (18.6%), forplacebo, especially (10.4% v, respectively, 8.2% p) and gastrointestinal complaints (5.7% v, respectively, 3.2% p), with probable causation by medication in8 verum, resp. 8 placebo cases. Conclusion: The results of efficacy showed a significant difference in favour of the herbal remedy with good toler-ance and safety. Further research should concentrate ondifferential activity by microbiological etiology, recurrencerates, and effects on specific symptoms of rhinosinusitis. P03.26LB Endogenous Gut Microbiota Changes in Healthy Multistrain Probiotic Jennifer Ryan1and Noelle Patno2 California Contact: and bifidobacteria areAbstracts 73among the most commonly used probiotics, and preclinical studies have demonstrated that they can produce postbiotics that promote the growth of endogenous gut microbiota through cross-feeding interactions. However, many probiotichealth benefits are species and strain specific, and more research is needed, particularly on probiotic supplements that contain combinations of probiotic strains. This study exploredthe short-term impact of a multistrain probiotic supplement on stool levels of commensal gut microbiota in healthy adults. Methods: T en healthy adults were enrolled in a single-arm, open-label study. Over a 10-day period, participants consumed a once daily probiotic supplement capsule containing 8 strainsof lactobacilli and bifidobacteria CFU counts from baseline to study comple- tion were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene PCR and analyzed using paired ttests of log-transformed data to identify significant differences. Cohen's d was calculated and interpreted as small (d\u00bc0.20), medium (d \u00bc0.50), or large (d /C210.80) effect size. Results: Increases in stool CFU counts of Lactobacillus species, muciniphila were sig- nificant with medium or greater effect sizes (d >0.50). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that the probiotic supplement could potentially impact health by affecting levels of endogenous gut microbiota that are con- sidered bioindicators of health. Possible mechanisms includepostbiotic exchange and cross-feeding interactions between probiotic strains in the supplement and endogenous gut microbiota. However, randomized, controlled researchover a longer duration is necessary to follow-up on the findings of this preliminary work. P04: Clinical Research: Manual Therapies P04.01 Spinal Manipulation and Patient Self- Management for Preventing Acute toChronic Back Pain: The PACBACK Purpose: This research Center for Complementary and Integrative Health's Strategic Plan2016 by focusing on the investigation of nonpharmacologicpain management strategies that can improve first-line lowback pain (LBP) management, including the reduction ofopioid use. Specifically, this large, predominantly pragmatic study addresses the secondary prevention of high-impact chronic LBP , the most common chronic pain condition inAmerican adults. The result of this trial has the protentionalto significantly transform front-line LBP management. Methods: This is a 2-site randomized trial with a 2 /C22f a c t o - rial design. A total of 1180 individuals with acute or subacutenonspecific LBP , at medium or high risk for persistent disablingLBP , will be randomized to either spinal manipulative therapy,supported self-management, the combination of the 2, andmedical care (295 participants per group). The trial uses ahybrid design to address both effectiveness and implementation.Effectiveness (aim 1) will be determined through 3 primaryobjectives focused on (1) prevention of chronic LBP at12 months, (2) recovery from acute/sub-acute LBP at 6 months, a n d( 3 )c u m u l a t i v er e d u c t i o no fp a i na n dd i s a b i l i t yo v e r1y e a r . For implementation (aim 2), we will gather contextual data usingmixed methods to facilitate translation to other real-world clin-ical settings and aid in the interpretation of trial results. This trialis divided into a feasibility phase UG3 with 8 milestone criteriarequired to be met to transition to the next phase (just com-pleted and reported here) and the full-scale phase UH3. Results: All 8 milestone criteria and goals for the UG3 planning and feasibility phase (94 participants) were metand will be reported on at the conference. Conclusion: The study is funded to transition to the full- scale (UH3) phase recruitment for which will start in the fallof 2019. P04.02 Development and Validation of a Cloak Shaped Device for Sham Pediatric Tuina:Protocol for a Randomized ControlledStudy Jianxiong 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China 2Wenzhou Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wenzhou, China 3Dongguan Kanghua Hospital, Dongguan, China 4Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China 5GuangZhou Hospital of TCM, Guangzhou, China74 Global Advances in Health and MedicineContact: Jianxiong Cai, lacus826@126.com Abstract Purpose: Valid placebo device or placebo procedure become key issues for randomization and placebo- controlled designed clinical trials on the validation of treat-ment modalities, as blinding both the recipients and theclinical researches are essential for good research practice. Few have been developed for Pediatric T uina (PT) which is a therapeutic massage for children. In this study, we willdetect whether the newly developed cloak shaped device is valid as a placebo device in PT researches. Methods: This is a 2-arm, parallel-group randomized con- trolled trial (RCT), while participants and researchers will be blinded. Sixty eligible children will be randomly assignedto genuine T uina or sham T uina group with the informedconsent signed by their guardians. During the process of T uina, a cloak shaped device will be used to cover the child- ren's body so that the children, guardians, observers, andresearchers will be blinded. Guardians and observers will be asked to ascertain whether they could differentiate genuine T uina from sham T uina. The primary outcomes are the accu-racy judgment rates of the type of T uina that participantsactually received based on guardians' or observers' evaluations. Results: We developed a cloak shaped device and design an RCT to detect whether the device is valid as a placebo in PT researches. Conclusion: This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the validity of a Cloak Shaped placebo device in researches inregards of PT. We expect results to provide solid evidencefor future applications. Trial registration: ClinicalT rials.gov, NCT03247725. Registered on March 2018. P04.03 Body Awareness in Patients Treated With Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: A Pilot Study Danielle Emmet1, Glenn and Wolf Mehling2 of Osteopathic Medicine, Touro University Emmet, manipulative an integrative form of pain management. Interoceptive body awareness is a mechanism of action in mind-body approaches for pain management. This pragmatic pilotstudy aimed at investigating the relationship between OMT and body awareness. We explored whether prior experience with OMT was associated with differences in levels of interoceptive body awareness before and after asingle OMT treatment. Further analyses in clinical pain out- comes with covariates (mind-body practices, nonosteo- pathic body work, and lifetime exposure to trauma) are ongoing and will be presented. Methods: Participants were adults seeking OMT for the treatment of pain at an OMT T eaching Lab and were either OMT -naive or OMT -experienced. Interoceptive body awareness was assessed with the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version 2 (MAIA- 2; 37 items on 8 scales) before and after their OMTappoint- ment and at 1- and 3-week follow-up. All participantsreceived OMT as part of usual care and OMT practitioners were blinded to individuals' study enrollment status. We used descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 42 participants enrolled in the study, 36 had complete data with blinding maintained and were included in the analyses, 19 were OMT -naive and 17 OMT -experienced. The OMT -experienced participants higher MAIA-2 for not-worrying vs 2.41; P\u00bc.004) and trusting (3.94 vs 3.14; P\u00bc.032) at base- line. Further analysis is underway and will be ready for the conference presentation. Conclusion: With integrative approaches to pain manage- ment such as OMT , interoceptive body awareness as measured by the MAIA-2, at baseline differs between OMT -naive and OMT -experienced individuals seeking OMT for pain management. These differences may predict treatment outcomes. Further data analysis is underway to better understand the relationship between OMT and bodyawareness as a potential mechanism of action in the thera- peutic effects of OMT for pain management. P04.04 A Systematic Review of Tuina for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Recommendations forFuture Trials Bu Medicine, Beijing, China 2Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Bu Fanlong, bufanlong2008@sina.com Abstract Purpose: This systematic review assessed whether T uina (therapeutic massage) is more effective and safer than noAbstracts 75treatment or routine medical treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: T en databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, CNKI, Wanfang, , CBM, International StandardRandomized Controlled Trial Number Register, U.S.National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, andWHO International Clinical Trials Registry) were searched from their inception to June 2019 for randomized clinical trials of IBS diagnosed based on Manning or Rome criteria.T uina with or without routine treatments (RTs) was testedagainst RTs. The Cochrane risk of bias was evaluated foreach trial. RevMan 5.3 was used to conduct a meta-analysis. Results: A total of 8 trials (5 IBS-diarrhea and 3 IBS- constipation) with 545 participants using 8 different manip-ulations were included. All trials were published in Chinese.For total effective rate ( >30% improvement in overall symptom scores), T uina showed certain advantages com- pared with RTs (6 trails, 393 patients, risk ratio [RR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.45, I2 \u00bc64%), and T uina in addition to RTs showed more effect than RTs (3trails, 115 patients, RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.54, I2 \u00bc0) for IBS-diarrhea. All trials did not report adverse effect in rela-tion to T uina. Risk of bias was generally unclear across all domains. Conclusion: This study shows that both T uina alone and combined with RTs may be superior to RTs for IBS in totaleffective rate. T uina plus RTs may have additional benefit for IBS-diarrhea. Due to the existing methodological issues and the heterogeneity of T uina manipulation, current findingsneed to be confirmed in large scale, multicenter, androbust randomized trials (especially on outcome assessingblinding and allocation concealment). P04.05 Effects of Long-term Massage Therapy: A Case Study Taylor Koval1, Michael Finn2, and Lindsey McKernan2 1Osher Center at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee 2Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee Contact: Taylor Koval, taylor.r.koval@vumc.org Abstract Purpose: Chronic pain effects 50 million people in the United States. National guidelines recommend a patient-centered practice. This includes the use ofComplementary and Alternative Medicine. Massage therapy (MT) is on the pulse of national strategies to treat chronic pain. However, the literature on massage effects on chronicpain is limited at best. We present 3 cases of chronic painand long-term MT.Methods: A series of 3 patients indicated for MTeach with a different chronic pain condition: complex regional pain syn-drome, ankylosing spondylitis, and breast cancer present forMT . The therapist took a patient-centered perspective toguide treatment focus. Outcomes were measured empiricallyusing goniometer measures to the problem areas before and after each session. For patient 1, cervical spine flexion and distance of temporomandibular joint to acromion processwere measured across 68 sessions over 40 months, patients2 were measured across 105 sessions over 26 months,patient 3 measured across 169 sessions over 25 months,both patients 2 and 3 were shoulder flexion. Results: We found an overall effect of sessions on treat- ment outcomes, such that more sessions led to improve-ment, B \u00bc.024, t(557)\u00bc7.59, P<.0001. This was more pronounced in Case 2 and less in Case 3; however, there were no statistically significant differences across cases orinteractions with time in a model exploring these as fixedeffects. There was moderate autocorrelation over time,which was controlled for in the statistical model,phi\u00bc.25. We also examined individual narratives of treat- ment for each patient. Conclusion: Each massage session met patients at their pain narrative and engaged them in the decision processof their care. Long-term MT, a constant in the healing pro- cess, showed to have meaningful increases of joint mobility. Patient narratives complement these empirical findings byshowing the need for more accessible interventions forchronic pain sufferers. P04.06 Massage for Symptom Management in Adult Inpatients With Hematologic Malignancies Carla Kuon1, Rae Wannier2, and James Harrison2 1Osher Center UCSF, San Francisco, California 2UCSF, San Francisco, California Contact: Carla Kuon, carla.kuon@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Nonpharmacologic therapies such as massage are attractive adjunct treatments due to a low side-effectprofile and have in the past proven useful in targeting aconstellation of side effects frequently encountered inoncology patients. 1-11Although massage therapy often is used to treat musculoskeletal disorders, it also can beused to treat stress and anxiety, improve mood, inducerelaxation, and control pain. Methods: We designed a single-arm observational feasibil- ity study of massage therapy in adults admitted to the bone76 Global Advances in Health and Medicinemarrow transplant service at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center between June 2017 and May 2018. An order set was created in the electronic health record (EHR) to make the service fully automated (Figure1). An electronic consult order was placed in the EHR for any patient either requesting or agreeing to massage ther- apy when offered by a physician or nurse practitioner. Results: Over an 11.5-month period, 109 patients received 142 massage treatments. We received surveys on 134 treat-ments. Of the 134 treatments, 71 (53%) were paired with both pre- and postmassage surveys completed. We per- formed both an adjusted and an unadjusted analysis ofpatient-reported symptoms and our anxiety-distress- fatigue-nausea composite outcome. Patients reported a sta- tistically significant reduction in the composite outcome(/C01.16; 95% confidence interval: /C01.55 to /C00.76; P<.001) in the analysis adjusted for patient demographics character- istics. This reduction in the composite scores seems primar-ily to be driven by reductions in anxiety (pre: 2.2 /C63.2 vs post: 0.8 /C61.6), fatigue /C63.1 Overall, there was a 64%, 49%, and 63% reduction in the reported symptom scores for anxiety,fatigue, and pain, respectively (Figure 2), and 73% of patients reported \"better\" or \"much better\" sleep the following night. P04.08 Examining the Behavioral and Contextual Elements of Spinal Manipulative Therapyfor Low Back Pain Craig Schulz 1, Gert Bronfort1, Roni Evans1, and John Minnesota Contact: Craig Schulz, schu1385@umn.edu Abstract Purpose: Low back pain (LBP) is associated with several maladaptive behaviors including overuse of medications, fear avoidance, and others. Complementary interventions like spinal manipulative therapies (SMT) are now recom- mended as alternatives to drugs and other invasive treat- ments for LBP . However, like most LBP interventions,research has yielded only modest treatment effects and has rarely addressed important behaviors and thus may not be reaching its full potential. Indeed, SMT in its clinicalapplication includes contextual and behavioral elements that often go unrecognized. First steps for helping LBP patients shift to healthier pain behaviors requires identifying theirneeds, and the specific contextual and behavioral aspects of treatments, like SMT, they perceive as helpful/unhelpful. Methods: A mixed methods analysis of a random sample of 60 deidentified qualitative interview transcripts from LBP patients collected alongside 6 federally funded randomized clinical trials investigating SMT will be performed. Transcripts will be analyzed deductively using an analytic framework informed by the Theoretical DomainsFramework, Behavior Change T echnique T axonomy v1, and T emplate for Intervention Description and Replication. Results: We will identify and describe LBP patients' capa- bility, opportunity and resource related needs, and the per- ceived helpful/unhelpful aspects of SMT, classified in terms of contextual and behavioral elements. Conclusion: This project will be among the first to apply established behavioral models and contextual frameworks to SMT, expanding the currently limited understanding of its behavioral and contextual mechanisms. Understanding LBP patient needs and their perceptions of treatments, like SMT, from a behavioral and contextual perspective, are essential for understanding SMT's mechanisms of action. This willprovide important new generalizable knowledge about the role of SMT care for overcoming maladaptive pain behav- iors, as well as how it could be enhanced to optimize care. This has potentially impactful long-term implications for research and translation of SMT to reduce the publichealth burden of LBP . P04.10 Evidence-Based Diagnosis for Low Back Pain: Systematic Review and T erminologyRecommendations Robert Vining 1 1Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research, Davenport, Iowa Contact: Robert Vining, robert.vining@palmer.edu Abstract Purpose: Inconsistent terminology use and varied clinical evaluation occurs within and between professionals of clin- ical disciplines caring for persons with low back pain (LBP). The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate currentevidence for office-based diagnostic tests designed to inform working diagnoses for common conditions causing LBP and to recommend standardized terminology use across health-care disciplines. Methods: A systematic review (Prospero#: CRD42018099106) was conducted from inception through December 2018. PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Index to Chiropractic Literature databases were searched. Unpublished (gray) literature was also searched.Abstracts 77T wo team members independently determined article eligi- bility via title, abstract, and full-text screening and by usingScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists toassess methodological quality. Results of eligible systematicreviews and individual studies, not already included in thosereviews, were described. T wo team members separatelyabstracted and verified data. Results: Initial searching revealed 3995 articles. After dupli- cate removal and eligibility screening, 36 (8 systematicreviews and 28 individual studies) were included.Diagnostic criteria identifying probable discogenic, sacroiliacjoint, and zygapophyseal (facet) joint pain were obtained fromstudies injection-confirmed provocation or anestheticprocedures. Radiculopathy and neurogenic claudication diag-nostic criteria are supported by studies using expert-levelconsensus and imaging findings. Diagnostic criteria for myo-fascial pain, sensitization (central and peripheral), and radic- ular pain are supported by expert consensus-level evidence. Commonly, individual studies demonstrated risk for bias inreference standard and patient selection domains. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests evidence-based criteria should be used to inform\u2014working\u2014rather thandefinitive diagnoses for LBP . We recommend differentiatingnociceptive from neuropathic pain and identifying sensitiza- tion during the clinical evaluation. T o avoid confusion cre- ated by unclear language observed within the scientific lit-erature, we recommend researchers and practitionersadopt terminology consistent with InternationalAssociation for the Study of Pain terminology. P04.11 Evidence-Based Diagnosis for Low Back Pain: Office-Based Evaluation Robert Vining1 1Palmer Center for Iowa Contact: Robert Vining, robert.vining@palmer.edu Abstract Purpose: Low back pain (LBP) is often diagnosed as non- specific, due to a lack of gold standard tests to differentiatebetween multiple potentially overlapping conditions, incon-sistent psychosocial contributions to symptom perceptionand perpetuation, and limited understanding of causalmechanisms. However, nonspecific diagnoses do not identify aberrant physiology, differentiate or characterize symptoms, or otherwise inform care decisions. Guidelinesrecommend identifying select diagnoses such as radiculop-athy, which has the practical effect of demanding differenti-ation from other LBP producing conditions. Establishingevidence-based working diagnoses for common causes ofLBP potentially differentiates clinical presentations with sim- ilar characteristics and fosters communication with patients and between health professionals. The purpose of this pre- sentation is to report an evidence-based diagnostic check- list and exam, designed to assist practitioners of multiple disciplines functioning at a primary spine care level in devel- oping evidence-based working diagnoses. Methods: An iterative process was used to update a pre- viously developed diagnostic checklist and clinical exam. This process was informed by a systematic review of office-based diagnosis methods for common neuro- musculoskeletal conditions causing LBP . The systematic review, which searched through published and unpublished literature from inception through December 2018, was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, and was regis- tered with PROSPERO (CRD42018099106). Results: The diagnostic checklist and exam facilitate clinical evaluation by organizing and visually displaying evidence for or against working diagnoses, listing evidence-based diag- nostic criteria and tests, and providing opportunity to record clinical findings. Conditions causing LBP from noci- ceptive signaling include discogenic, myofascial, centrally and to augment nociceptive signaling. Conclusion: A practical and evidence-based diagnostic pro- cess including an exam and checklist can be used to guide clinical evaluation and demonstrate evidence for working diagnoses for primary level spine care practitioners. P04.12 Brain Function Network of Chinese Massage for Knee Osteoarthritis Changhe Yu1, Lunxue Qing2, and Changxin Liu1 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Affiliated Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing, China 2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Changhe Yu, yakno2@163.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to observe the effects of massage therapy on brain function network in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: For 19 female patients with pain-related symp- toms that met the diagnostic criteria for knee osteoarthri- tis, the unilateral knee with the heaviest pain was selected for 6 weeks of massage treatment. All acupoint positioning was carried out with reference to the name and location of78 Global Advances in Health and Medicinethe acupoint (the national standard GB/T12346-006 of China). The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and TheWestern Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) were assessed at baseline, after the first treatment and after the sixth treatment as well as functionalmagnetic resonance imaging scanning.Results: The age of 19 subjects ranged from 41 to 69 years, with a course of disease between 1 and 10 years. The mostseverity knees of each subject were chosen in the study and received the treatment. The NRS scores significantly decreased from the baseline, after first treatment to thesixth treatment as 5.26 /C61.17, 3.08 /C61.27, respectively ( P<.001). And the WOMAC index scores significantly decreased from the baseline, after firsttreatment to the sixth treatment as After first massage treatment, the hemisphere buckled back, middle of the forehead, the central anterior gyrus, and the medial sideof the forehead changed; and after sixth massage treatment, the fusiform and sacral gyrus of the left hemisphere of the brain changed.Conclusion: T uina treatment can significantly improve the pain symptoms of knee osteoarthritis patients, and thedegree of improvement is positively correlated withthe number of treatments. T uina can adjust the changes of pain-related brain function network, and the transient effects of single treatment and multiple times showed thecumulative effect after treatment. P04.13 Massage Therapy and Knee Osteoarthritis: A Conceptual Research Framework Johnson1, Donya Nemati2, Sarah Meyer3, and Niki Munk4 1Department of Community Dentistry & Behavioral Science, Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 2Department of Health Sciences, Indiana University School of Health and Human Sciences, Indianapolis, Indiana 3Health Science Library, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 4University of Indiana\u2014IUPUI, Indianapolis, Indiana Contact: Alisa Johnson, alisa.johnson@ufl.edu Abstract Purpose: Research indicates massage therapy is an effec- tive nonpharmacological intervention for knee osteoarthri- tis (KOA) pain and dysfunction. However, the mechanisms underlying massage are largely unknown, thereby limitingthe development and implementation of targeted massage interventions. Scientific advances have led to the develop- ment of a conceptual model of KOA pain which outlines keyfactors (eg, inflammation, central sensitization, depression), applicable to the investigation of massage-mediated improvements for KOA. Building upon this model, we sought to develop a framework that will guide future inves-tigations of the mechanisms by which massage reduces pain and improves function in KOA, leading to the development of targeted nonpharmacological interventions for pain. Methods: The research team conducted an iterative, in- depth literature review of PubMed, Web of Science, PEDro, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases using the key words: massage, knee osteoarthritis, arthritis, andchronic pain. Articles were screened according to factors identified in Kittelson's conceptual model as important to KOA pain (eg, inflammation, central sensitization, muscledysfunction, depression, and anxiety). Authors met monthlyto review and compile articles based upon consensus. Results: Ninety-one articles were identified as relevant to massage and the factors of KOA outlined in Kittelson's con-ceptual model, with 15 specific to the effects of massage in KOA. Research suggests massage may impact KOA pain through multiple pathways, including alteration of inflamma-tory and neuroendocrine responses, improved pain modu-lation and decreased pain sensitivity, and improved muscle function, sleep, and psychological well-being. Conclusion: The developed research framework reflects Kittelson's KOA model and highlights multiple mechanistic pathways through which massage therapy may mediate KOA pain and will be used to guide future research efforts leadingto the development of targeted therapeutic massage inter-ventions. Additionally, this framework is applicable to other CIMinterventions and may lead to an improved appreciation of key non-pharmacological treatment targets in adults withchronic musculoskeletal pain. P04.14 Massage and Maternal Anxiety: Feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial on the Effectsof a Partner-Delivered Massage onMaternal Mental Health During University, Melbourne, Australia 4School of Lauche, Symptoms of anxiety and stress during pregnan- cy are potentially harmful for mothers and their babies. Thisstudy aimed to explore the potential benefits of a partner-delivered relaxation-massage to decrease prenatal maternalanxiety. Methods: A feasibility randomized controlled trial was conducted with low-risk pregnant women up to 32 weeksgestation. They were randomised to either a partner-delivered relaxation-massage group (intervention) or aself-directed stress-management program (control). Aftera 2-hour introductory workshop, women (and partners)independently undertook the assigned interventions for 4to 12 weeks using manuals and DVDs. The primary out- come measure was feasibility (recruitment, attrition, and adherence to the intervention), and secondary outcomesincluded maternal anxiety, depression, and stress(DASS21); maternal and infant birth outcomes; and safety.Experiences with the massage intervention were capturedby qualitative interviews following delivery. Results: A total of 361 mostly partnered women were approached, out of which only 113 could be screened for eligibility. A total of 44 were recruited and randomized toeither the intervention or control group but only 27 of 44attended the workshops. The massage intervention wascarried out once weekly on average and up to twiceweekly closer to delivery. Symptoms of anxiety, stress,and depression significantly decreased over time, with nosignificant differences between groups. Birth outcomeswere comparable between the groups. Women reporteda benefit from massage of 77.7 /C615.1 on a 100 mm visual analogue scale, and qualitative interviews with the women showed high satisfaction. No serious adverse eventsoccurred. Conclusion: The main barriers included slow recruitment and initial high attrition. Once women attended the inter-ventions they were highly satisfied with the intervention.Despite the benefits, however, the massage program wasnot superior to a self-directed stress management program. Overall, a partner-delivered massage intervention appears to be feasible and safe. Further studies are necessary toexamine the benefits of such intervention more closely.P04.15 Pain Occurrence Collected via Weekly T ext Message Over 1 Year in a Pragmatic TrialEvaluating Chiropractic Care for Low BackPain in Military Members Zacariah Shannon 1, Cynthia Long1, Robert Vining2, and Christine Goertz3 1Palmer College of Chiropractic, Davenport, Iowa 2Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research, Davenport, Iowa 3Duke Durham, North Carolina Contact: Zacariah Shannon, zacariah.shannon1@palmer.edu Abstract Purpose: The use of SMS text messages to collect weekly or monthly data provides opportunity to study symptom variation for chronic or episodic problems such as low back pain (LBP). We explored this in 140/750 active-duty military participants with LBP enrolled in a pragmatic, clin-ical trial conducted to compare usual medical care plus chi- ropractic care (UMC \u00feCC) to UMC alone. The objective of this subgroup analysis was to describe LBP frequency collected by text message over 1 year. Methods: After 6 weeks of care, 140 participants were sent weekly text messages through 1 year asking the number of days with LBP (0-7). The analysis included only the 103 (74%) who responded to at least 80% of texts over the 46-week period. We calculated the median number of pain days per week and number of weeks with 0 pain days separately for participants with acute ( <1 month) and chronic ( >3 months) LBP for both groups. Results: Mean age was 34 years (18-50), 23% were women, and 25% were nonwhite. There were 56 partici- pants in UMC \u00feCC and 47 in UMC with approximately 45% acute and 45% chronic LBP . The median number of pain days per week in UMC \u00feCC was 2.7 versus 4.2 in UMC for acute LBP and 4.2 versus 5.6 for chronic LBP . The median number of weeks with 0 pain days in UMC \u00feCC was 5.0 versus 1.0 in UMC for acute LBP and 0 for chronic LBP in both groups. Conclusion: These preliminary results show that the addi- tion of chiropractic care to usual medical care resulted in a difference of more than 1 fewer pain days per week for participants with both acute and chronic LBP and 4 addi- tional weeks with 0 pain days for participants with acute LBP . Further research is needed to investigate the robust- ness of these findings.80 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP04.16 Tuina-Based Versus Physical Manual Therapy-Based Program for the Knee Pain of Osteoarthritis: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Study Changhe Yu1, Changxin Liu2, Yanan Sun3 1Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Affiliated Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing, China 2Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing, China 3Xuanwu Hospital, Beijing, China Contact: Changhe Yu, yakno2@163.com Abstract Purpose: Chinese massage (T uina) has not previously been compared with physical manual therapy for patients withosteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The purpose of thisstudy was to compare outcomes between a T uina-basedphysical therapy (TPT) program and a manual-based physicaltherapy (MPT) program. Methods: Sixty-six subjects with OA of the knee were randomly assigned to a TPT group (n \u00bc33; 81.8% females, 18.2% males; mean age [ /C6SD]\u00bc70.4/C611.3 years) an MPT group (n \u00bc33, 78.8% females, 21.2% males; mean age [/C6SD]\u00bc66.2/C611.3 years). Subjects in the TPT group received T uina, education, and self management and ahome exercise program 10 sessions in total over a 3-week period. Subjects in the MPT group received physicalmanual therapy, education and self management, and ahome exercise program 10 sessions in total over a 3-week period. Measured outcomes were the time walkedin 20 m, Numberal Rating Scale on pain (NRS-P), theWestern Ontario and McMaster UniversitiesOsteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and Short Form (SF)-12questionnaire at baseline, 4th, and 16th week. Results: Both groups showed clinically and statistically sig- nificant improvements in 20-m walk time, NRS-P , scores at 4 weeks; improvements were still evi-dent in both groups at 16 weeks. By 4 weeks, WOMACscores had improved by 50.42% in the TPT group and by37.16% in the MPT group; NRS-P scores had improved by66.56% in the TPT group and by 38.84% in the MPT group.At 16th week, both groups were substantially and aboutequally improved over baseline measurements. Subjects inthe TPT treatment group were more satisfied with theoverall outcome of their rehabilitative treatment comparedwith subjects in the MPT group. Conclusion: The results indicate that a T uina-based pro- gram for patients with OA of the knee provides importantbenefit at end of the 4-week treatment and the improve-ment can last for 3 months.P04.17LB Effects of a Healing T ouch Intervention in Postcardiac Event Patients Prior to Starting Cardiac Rehabilitation Megan Sweeney1, Christopher Suhar1, Elizabeth Fraser1, and Eva Stuart1 Integrative La Jolla, California Contact: Megan Sweeney, sweeney.megan@scrippshealth.org Abstract Purpose: Having a major cardiovascular event can be life altering and stressful\u2014both physically and psychologically. In accordance with national guidelines, cardiologists rou- tinely recommend cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after majorcardiac events, although patients often experience delaysprior to starting CR programs. Healing touch (HT) is anoninvasive, complementary approach to healing comprisedof gentle touch in a relaxing environment that draws onenergy fields surrounding the body to restore harmonyand balance. This randomized, controlled study sought toexamine the effects of HTon quality of life (QoL), biometricfitness, mental well-being, and CR program attendance inpostcardiac event patients. Methods: After providing informed consent, adults referred to CR programs between 2016 and 2019 wererandomized and completed fitness assessments,Dartmouth Quality of LifeQoL surveys, and SF-36 healthquestionnaires. The experimental group received 6, 60-minute HT treatments over 3 weeks before starting CR.The control group received standard-of-care without HT .Attendance and metabolic equivalents (METs) wereassessed throughout the 12-week program, and baselinesurveys were repeated upon completion. Results: Compared to baseline, post-CR assessments across the 73 (39 M, 34 F) participants (37 experimentaland 36 control) yielded significant ( P<.001) differences in QoL, physical health, mental health, and METs in bothgroups. Between-groups analyses showed significantly great- er CR attendance (36 vs 32 sessions) and significantly higher METs achieved (78.6% mean increase vs 61.3% meanincrease) in the experimental versus control group, respec-tively. On average, those who received HT had more sub-stantial increases in QoL compared to controls over the 12weeks. Mean body mass index (BMI) also slightly controls). Conclusion: Results reinforce HT's safe and therapeutic capacity to reduce anxiety, improve QoL, and support heal-ing in postcardiac event patients. Future longitudinal studiesmust evaluate whether physical and psychological improve-ments are sustained after HT and CR completion.Abstracts Mind- Body P05.01 Stakeholder Perspectives on Web-Based Delivery of Yoga for Young Adult CancerSurvivors Elizabeth Addington 1, Veronika Grote1, Karly School Medicine, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Elizabeth Addington, elizabeth.addington@northwestern.edu Abstract Purpose: Y oga has potential to improve symptoms (eg, anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue) that are common inyoung adult cancer survivors (YACS), but few yoga trials include YACS. Furthermore, illness and lack of instructors with cancer-specific training can limit community-basedaccess to yoga. Web-based delivery may help to closethese gaps, especially for young adults, who are adept inter-net users. We therefore aim to develop and evaluate onlineyoga classes for YACS using a stakeholder-engaged approach. Methods: Using web-based videoconferencing, we con- ducted interviews with yoga instructors who have experi- ence teaching yoga to adults with cancer (n \u00bc7) and sepa- rate focus groups with YACS with a range of yogaexperience (n \u00bc7). We then conducted thematic analysis to identify participants' views on how yoga may benefitYACS and how it may be delivered safely and effectivelyonline. Results: YACS discussed the limitations of attending public yoga classes not designed for people with cancer. Additionalthemes from both yoga instructors and YACS includecancer as trauma, rebuilding strength and confidence in the body, relaxation and soothing, coping with noncancer- related stressors, and connecting with a community offellow YACS. Recommended practices to address thesethemes include yoga nidra, postures and meditationsdesigned to increase grounding and heart-opening, andgroup discussions. Conclusion: Y oga techniques may address YACS' psycho- social, physical, and existential concerns. Live, web-baseddelivery has potential to facilitate YACS' access to yoga and connection with community. Ongoing research will fur- ther develop our understanding of YACS' needs andevaluate the feasibility and efficacy of online yoga classes to meet these needs. P05.02 Yoga in Women With Abdominal Obesity\u2014Do Lifestyle Factors Mediate the Effect? Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany 2Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Essen, Germany 3Department Integrative of Internal and Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany Contact: Dennis Anheyer, d.anheyer@kem-med.com Abstract Purpose: The reduction of obesity is an important chal- lenge for health policy. Although dietary interventions arewidely available, patient adherence is usually low. A possiblealternative is yoga which is a promising way to reduceweight. We hypothesized that weight reduction throughyoga may be mediated by several lifestyle factors. Methods: This is an exploratory secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of yogato waiting list in women with abdominal obesity. Body massindex (BMI) and waist circumference were assessed asoutcomes; exercise habits, physical activity, and healthynutritional habits were considered as potential mediatingvariables. T o analyze the mediating effects, the procedurerecommended by Hayes was followed. Effects were estimat-ed using a bootstrap sampling procedure with 20.000resamples using z-standardized change scores. Separate analyses were undertaken for each independent variable. Point estimates and 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Mediating effects on BMI were found for physical exercise habits (95% CI; /C00.56 to /C00.07) and daily fruit and vegetable (95% CI; /C00.38 to /C00.01). Furthermore, a significant mediating effect was found if both variables wereincluded in a multiple mediator model (95% CI; /C00.74 to /C00.13). In contrast, there was no evidence for mediating effects in the model containing the lifestyle variables and achange in waist circumference. Conclusion: Within this secondary analysis of a random- ized controlled trial, we showed that the positive effect ofyoga on the BMI is mediated through patient /C19s vegetable and82 Global Advances in Health and Medicinefruit intake as well as patients' physical exercise habits. Y oga thus seems to promote a healthier lifestyle. P05.03 A Positive Response to Nonpharmacological Therapies in Patients With Fibromyalgia Raveendhara Bannuru1, Michelle Park2, Lori Lyn Price1, and Chenchen Wang1 1Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 2Tufts School Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Raveendhara Bannuru, rbannuru@tuftsmedicalcenter.org Abstract Purpose: Identifying the factors associated with response to nonpharmacological therapies in patients with fibromyal-gia will help personalize treatments and provide informationto improve design and interpretation of future research. Weused data from a large comparative effectiveness trial of TaiChi versus aerobic exercise to investigate baseline charac-teristics associated with clinical response at 24 weeks infibromyalgia patients. Methods: Participants were assigned to aerobic exercise (2/C2/week for 24 weeks) or 1 of 4 T ai Chi interventions (1 /C2 or 2/C2/week for 12 or 24 weeks). Results from the trial showed that all treatment groups demonstrated improve-ment in the revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire(FIQR) scores, but the combined T ai Chi groups improvedsignificantly more at 24 weeks than the exercise group. We used a minimally clinically important difference of 14% (8.1 units) on a 0 to 100 FIQR scale as response criteria. Weperformed a multivariable analysis to investigate baselinevariables (demographics, physical performance, outcomeexpectancy, self-efficacy, and other psychosocial factors)associated with positive response. Results: Mean age of the 181 participants was 52 years, 92% were females, average body mass index was 30 kg/m 2, and average duration of body pain was 12.4 years. Mean FIQR at baseline was 55.5. There were 108 participants(60%) who responded to either treatment. When the 6variables which were significant ( P<.10) in the univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analysis, onlyFIQR remained significant. Having a higher FIQR score orgreater impact of symptoms was significantly associatedwith clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks(P\u00bc.01). Response did not significantly differ by treatment. Conclusion: Individuals with fibromyalgia who had more severe symptoms seem to experience greater clinicalimprovement from Tai Chi or aerobic exercise than thosewho are less impacted by their condition. More studies arewarranted to confirm whether other clinical variables may be associated with positive response. P05.04 Changes in Perceived Stress After Yoga, Physical Therapy, and EducationInterventions for Chronic Low Back Pain:A Secondary Analysis of a RandomizedControlled Trial Jonathan Berlowitz 1, Daniel Hall2, Christopher Joyce3, Karen Sherman5, Robert Saper6, and Eric Roseen6 1Boston University School of Medicine, Lincoln, Massachusetts 2Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 3Department of Rehabilitation Science, Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions, Boston, Massachusetts 4Department of Epidemiology, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 5Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 6Department of Family Medicine, Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Jonathan Berlowitz, jbber@bu.edu Abstract Purpose: Psychological stress and musculoskeletal pain are common, especially in low-income populations. Studies evaluating treatments to reduce stress in patients with chronic pain are lacking. Given the potentially bidirectional relationship between perceived stress and pain, we aimed to quantify the effect of 2 evidence-based chronic low back pain (cLBP) interventions, yoga and physical therapy (PT), on perceived stress in adults with cLBP . Methods: A predominantly low-income and racially diverse sample (n \u00bc320) was randomized to 12-week yoga, PT , or education interventions. We compared changes in the 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10) from baseline to 12- and 52-week follow-up among yoga and PT partic- ipants to those receiving education. Subanalyses were conducted for participants with elevated pre-intervention perceived stress (PSS-10 score /C2117). We conducted sensi- tivity analyses using various imputation methods to account for potential biases in our estimates due to missing data. Results: Results: Among 248 participants (mean age \u00bc46.4, 80% nonwhite) completing all 3 surveys, yoga and PT showed greater reductions in PSS-10 scores compared to educationat 12 weeks (mean This effect was stronger among participants with elevated pre-intervention perceived stress for both yoga and PT (mean respectively). Results were similar at 52 weeks and in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Among lower income adults with chronic low back pain, we found that yoga therapy and physical therapy were more effective than back pain education for reducing perceived stress. A bidirectional relationship between per- ceived stress and chronic pain suggests that optimal treat- ment for certain patients with musculoskeletal pain may include a stress management component. P05.05 Mindfulness-Based Intervention (Moment- by-Moment in Women's Recovery) Effectson and Relapse AmongWomen in Long-term ResidentialTreatment: Controlled Trial David Black 1and Hortensia Amaro2 1University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 2Florida International University College of Medicine, Miami, Florida Contact: David Black, davidbla@usc.edu Abstract Purpose: This trial endpoint analysis tests the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention ( Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery [MMWR]) on substance use and relapse among women enrolled in long-term residential treatment. Methods: This parallel-group randomized controlled trial (NCT02977988) conducted from 2016 to 2018 was designed to compare substance use and relapse among N\u00bc200 women diagnosed with SUD in residential treat- ment. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study conditions as adjuncts to their residential SUD treatment: (1) a mindfulness-based intervention (MMWR) or (2) neu- robiology of addiction (NA), with the latter serving as the psychoeducational control condition. Baseline interviews occurred prior to randomization and follow-up interviews were held approximately 8 months after the study interven- tion start date. All participants received SUD treatment services as normally provided by the treatment facility with- out affecting the level of usual care provided to patients. Trained study staff interviewed participants using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) measure, a calendar-based val- idated semi-structured interview measure of daily sub-stance use. This allowed for the quantification of daily sub- stance use from the study intervention start date to studyendpoint 8 months later. From the TLFB, we quantified study outcomes as (a) time to first use for any drugs oralcohol intoxication; (b) days of use; and (c) relapse statuscategorized as abstinent (did not use during the timeperiod), lapse (used after intervention but did not revertto regular use on one-third or less of days from first use),and relapse (continued to use regularly on more than one-third of days from first use to follow-up). Results: We will test study group differences in (1) time to first use with piecewise Cox proportional hazard models,(2) days of use with negative binomial hurdle models, and(3) relapse status with multinomial logistic regression. Conclusion: Positive results will support the use of mind- body practices in SUD residential treatment facilities. P05.06 Relationships Between Food Insecurity Status, HEI Scores, and ADHD SymptomSeverity in a Irene Hatsu2 1The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 2Deaprtment of Human Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 3Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 4Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Lethbridge, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada 5Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Emilia Bowers, bowers.522@osu.edu Abstract Purpose: Food insecurity occurs in 13.9% of households with children in the United States, and the chance of being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder(ADHD) is nearly 6 times greater in food insecure house-holds. Yet, few studies exist exploring this relationship,particularly from the perspective of dietary patterns andnutrient intake. The purpose of this study is to explorerelationships among food insecurity status, Healthy EatingIndex (HEI) scores, and ADHD symptoms severity in apediatric ADHD population. Methods: These data were collected as part of baseline assessments from a clinical trial investigating an alternativetreatment for ADHD in children ages 6 to 12 years (n \u00bc91). Household food security status was assessed using the 18-Item US Household Food Security Survey, and symptomseverity of ADHD was assessed using the Child and84 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAdolescent Symptom Inventory-5 questionnaire. HEI scores were calculated by administering the Vioscreen FoodFrequency Questionnaire. Statistical analyses included 1-way analysis of variance and Wilcoxon Rank Sum testswhen appropriate for model assumptions. Results: Children in food insecure households (n \u00bc8) scored higher in hyperactivity symptoms than food securechildren (n \u00bc83) ( P\u00bc.050). The mean cohort total HEI score was 64.7 (SD 9.25), which is higher than reportedfor the general population of similar age. Children fromfood insecure households reported decreased HEI scorefor intake of fatty acids ( P\u00bc.008) and increased HEI score for empty calorie consumption ( P\u00bc.036). Conclusion: Results demonstrate that relationships may exist between severity of symptoms of ADHD and dietaryquality as measured by HEI scores in food insecure house-holds. Future analyses should test for existing dietary pat-terns outside of HEI scores in relationship to food insecu-rity and ADHD symptoms. P05.07 Impact of Tai Chi and Mind-Body Breathing in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:Insights From a Qualitative Substudy of aRandomized Controlled Trial Elizabeth Gilliam 1, Tina Cheung1, Daniel Litrownik2, Peter M Wayne3, Marilyn L Moy4, and Gloria Yeh1,3 1Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brookline, Massachusetts 2Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Somerville, Massachusetts 3Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 4Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Section, Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Tina Cheung, tcheung@bidmc.harvard.edu Abstract Purpose: Prior research suggests that mind-body inter- ventions may support maintenance of healthy behaviorsand improve health-related quality-of-life and self-efficacy.We sought to qualitatively explore cognitive, psychosocial,and behavioral factors in patients with chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) who participated in mind-bodyinterventions. Methods: The parent study was a 3-arm prospective, ran- domized controlled trial (N \u00bc123) investigating Chi (TC) versus mind-body breathing (EDU) control in patients with moderate-severe COPD. TC involved traditional movements and meditative breathing, while MBB focused mainly on medita-tive breathing. Semistructured interviews were conducted with all participants at 12 weeks. Qualitative analysis of 65 randomly selected transcripts (N \u00bc22 TC, N \u00bc22 MBB, N\u00bc21 EDU) was performed by 2 independent reviewers using an iterative process to identify emergent themesinformed by grounded theory methods. Results: Our population had mean age \u00bc68.1, GOLD stage\u00bc2.3. We identified 6 topic areas (awareness, cogni- tive beliefs, physical well-being, psychological well-being, social functioning/support, and behavior change) frequentlymentioned. Compared to EDU, more participants in TCand MBB noted improvements in physical function (eg, better breathing, able to mow lawn, ride bike), awareness of self/self-care (eg, \"in tune\" with body, awareness of con-dition, how to take care of themselves), ability to regulateemotions (eg, decreased emotional reactivity, decreased anxiety/stress/frustration), and symptom management (eg, utilizing breathing techniques, pacing). More participants inTC, in particular, expressed cognitive improvements relatedto executive function (eg, decision-making, planning/setting intentions to continue self-care, physical activity). Those in TC also reported improvements in the ability to breakcycles of anxiety and breathlessness, and reduce need touse rescue medications. Conclusion: Both TC and MBB improved management of emotional and physical symptoms in COPD, supportingexisting research. TC had a particularly positive impact on intention and planning to continue physical activity and self- care management, which may be important for long-termadherence and healthcare engagement. P05.08 Effect of Audio-Visual Brain Entrainment on Mood and Quality of Sleep: A Pilot Martins1 1Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Health Sciences Post- graduation Program, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil 2Quantum University, Honolulu, Hawaii Contact: Francisco J Cidral-Filho, cidral@gmail.comAbstracts 85Abstract Purpose: The study objective was to investigate the effect of the Audio-Visual Brain Entrainment (ABE) on Mood and Quality of Sleep of university students. Methods: The study was conducted at the Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Brazil, and the protocol was approved by the Institutions Ethics committee. Informed consent forms were obtained during patient screening phase of the study at the site of the tests. Sample size consisted of 7 university students (4 males and 3 females. Ages between 20 and 58 years who were not making use of analgesics, anti- inflammatories, or sleep aids 7 days prior to, as well as during the study, and who had no hearing disabilities. ABE was delivered with a BrainTap headset (New Bern, North Carolina) in 20-minute sessions 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Session consists of binaural beats at 18 to 0.5 Hz, isochronic tones at 18 to .0.5 Hz and visual Entrainment through light- emitting diode lights at 470 nm flickering at 18 to 0.5 Hz. The following questionnaires were applied at baseline and after 6 weeks: Epworth Sleepness Scale\u2014Daytime sleepi- ness, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index (PQSI), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and Perceived Stress Scale (EPS-10). Results: ABE effectively reduced ISI (data not statistically significant), PQSI ( P<.05), DASS-21 (data not statistically significant), and EPS-10 (data not statistically significant). The participants reported feeling very relaxed during the sessions. Conclusion: Despite the reduced sample size (n \u00bc7), results indicate that ABE significantly increased quality of Sleep of university students (PQSI P<.05). A lager sample size study is necessary to confirm and extend the effects of ABE on mood. P05.09 Effects of Mindfulness on Emotional Well- being Among Older Adults: ReducedPerceived Stress and Negative AffectVariability as Candidate Mechanisms Dana Dharmakaya Colgan 1, Dan Klee1, Tab Memmott1, Dharmakaya Colgan, colgand@ohsu.edu Abstract Purpose: The cognitive theory of stress suggests that 2 factors contribute to an individual's stress susceptibility: var- iability in appraisal of the stressor (perceived stress) and the affective response to the stressor (negative affect). Negativeaffect variability (NAV), the within-person variation of nega- tive affect over time, contains unique information relevant towell-being. NAV is directly linked to most mood disordersand associated with elevated stress levels. Dispositional mindfulness, however, has been associated with increased emotional well-being and reduced perceived stress, negativeaffect, and negative affect variability. This study investigated ifperceived stress and NAV are candidate mechanisms bywhich mindfulness improves emotional well-being amongolder adults using ecological momentary assessment. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 134 mild to moder- ately stressed 50- to 85-year-olds completed self-report measures of emotional well-being, dispositional mindfulness,and perceived stress. Participants were then given a pre-programmed handheld device that sounded an alert up to 4times a day, for 2 days, signaling participants to answerquestions regarding their current negative affect. The stan-dard deviation of the 8 negative affect means, gathered overthe 2 days, was used to measure daily fluctuation in NAV .Pearson's correlations characterized relationships betweenvariables. A path analysis was conducted to partition the variance among variables. Results: Bootstrapping analyses indicated a significant indi- rect effect of mindfulness on emotional well-being throughperceived stress and NAV (confidence interval [CI] \u00bc.0003 to .052) but not a significant indirect effect of mindfulnesson emotional well-being through NAV only (CI \u00bc/C0.0266 to /C0.0779). Conclusion: The pattern of appraisal and affective reactiv- ity may be particularly salient in shaping psychophysiologicalresponses to stress and likely plays a prominent role in age-related processes and disease. Mindfulness may decouplethis pattern of appraisal and negative affect reactivity andvariability, leading to greater stress resilience and emotionalwell-being P05.10 Patterns of Respiration Rate Reactivity in Response to Cognitive Stress Associated With Self-reported Wellness and Resilience Dana Dharmakaya Colgan1, Dan Klee1, Douglas Hanes2, and Barry Dana Dharmakaya Colgan, colgand@ohsu.edu Abstract Purpose: Resilience is characterized as the capacity to uti- lize the stress response for optimal performance, with min-imal psychophysiological costs. Both exaggerated and86 Global Advances in Health and Medicineblunted stress reactivity, specifically cardiovascular and cor- tisol reactivity, have been associated with reduced self- reported resilience and increased depression. Less is known about stress reactivity of respiration rate and itsassociated psychological correlates. This study examinedrespiration rate (RR) reactivity in response to cognitivestress and evaluated psychological correlates. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 64 adults completed self-report measures of resilience, dispositional mindfulness,perceived stress, depression, and sleep quality. Participantsthen completed 3 tasks: baseline period, breath countingtask, and a cognitive stress test (Portland arithmetic Stress T est [PAST]). RR was measured continuously throughout the tasks using a light elastic piezoelectric beltand assessed in BrainVision Analyzer. Participants thatincreased their respiration rate by 2 breaths per minuteduring the PAST were identified as responders, whereasparticipants who demonstrated a blunted respiration response (less than an increase of 2 breaths per minute) were identified as nonresponders. T wo sample ttests com- pared means of the self-reported measures between the 2groups. Results: Compared to nonresponders (n \u00bc19), respond- ers (n\u00bc34) were associated with greater mindfulness (P\u00bc.02), quality ( P\u00bc.03), and P\u00bc.01) P\u00bc.007). No significant differences in self-reported resilience were revealed(P\u00bc. 12). Average increase in RR during the PAST was strongly correlated to a decrease in RR during breath counting, relative to baseline ( r\u00bc.81). Conclusion: Findings provide more evidence that a blunted stress response, as measured by an absence of astress-induced increase in RR, may be associated with reduced well-being, and potentially, reduced resilience. Furthermore, responder status may be indicative of a pat-tern in which the individual can reduce RR under favorableconditions but appropriately respond to the initiationof stress. P05.11 Measuring the Accuracy of Medical Intuition: A Pilot Study Wendie Colter1and Paul J Mills2 1The Practical Path, Inc., Tujunga, California 2UC San Diego School of Medicine, San Diego, California Contact: Wendie Colter, thepracticalpath@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Medical intuition is designed to identify and eval- uate energetic structures and patterns in the energysystems of the body (biofield) that may correspond to ill- nesses, imbalances and disease in the physical body. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine accuracy rates of trained medical intuitives. Methods: The medical intuitives (n \u00bc5) met with individual study participants in independent 30- to 60-minute blinded sessions. Study participants (n \u00bc67; 87% females) included a cohort of patients from UC San Diego Health and PrebysCardiovascular Institute Cardiac T reatment Center atScripps Health, San Diego. Following the session, partici-pants completed a postsession survey with a Likert-typescale to rate the medical intuitives' accuracy. Results: Location of main physical issue: 94% accurate; location of secondary physical issue accurate; evaluation of health issue(s): between life to others: 3%; would have another session: yes 96%/no significant point reductionof 2.43 on a 10-point Likert-type scale in Mpost \u00bc3.89, t\u00bc7.98, trained med- ical intuitives have high accuracy rates to identify primaryand secondary physical complaints and/or illnesses, consis-tency with medical diagnoses, as well as to identify lifeevents that led to the complaints and/or illness. Further experimental research is needed. The University of California San Diego School of Medicine is collaboratingwith The Practical Path, Inc. on a new research proposalto further study medical intuition. P05.12 A SMART Approach to Reducing Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms Michelle Dossett1, Emma Needles2, Zachary Donahue2, Jeremy Ruskin2, and John Denninger2 1University of California, Davis, Sacramento, California 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Michelle Dossett, mdossett@ucdavis.edu Abstract Purpose: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most diac arrhythmia. In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrilla-tion (PAF), acute stress and negative emotions increase theAbstracts 87likelihood of an AF episode 2 to 5 fold; happiness decreases the likelihood of AF by 85%. We studied the effects of theStress Management and Resiliency Training Program(SMART -3RP) delivered virtually on quality of life, arrhyth- mia burden, and mental health in patients with PAF . Methods: Eighteen subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive the SMART -3RP immediately or 3 months after ran- domization (waitlist control group). SMART -3RP groupswere delivered virtually using a secure video conferencingplatform. The SMART -3RP is an 8-week multimodal resilien-cy program that incorporates mind-body skills, stress man- agement techniques, healthy lifestyle behaviors, cognitive reappraisal, and adaptive coping skills. Subjects completedself-report measures assessing AF-related quality of life, AFsymptom severity and burden, distress, stress, anxiety (GAD-7), worry (PSQW), depression (PHQ-8), positive affect (PANAS-positive), happiness, mindfulness (CAMS-R),stress reactivity/coping (MOCS), resiliency (CES), gratitude(GQ-6), and empathy (IRI) at baseline, 3 months, and6 months (control group only). Results were analyzed using independent samples ttests in SPSS. Results: Compared to the waitlist control group, partici- pants who received the SMART -3RP reported significantly higher positive affect ( P\u00bc.021, Cohen's d \u00bc1.20) and enhanced coping with stress ( P\u00bc.011, Cohen's d \u00bc1.36) with a trend toward the SMART -3RP delivered vir- tually may enhance positive emotions and coping with stress as well as decrease negative emotions and improve AF-related quality of life. These results warrant a larger scalestudy to better understand the potential benefits of virtuallydelivered resiliency programs to help manage PAF . P05.13 Phone-Delivered Mindfulness Training to Promote Medication Adherence andReduce Sexual Risk Behavior AmongPersons Living With HIV: An ExploratoryClinical Trial Michael Carey 1Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 2Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, Providence, Rhode Island Contact: Eugene Dunne, eugene_dunne@brown.eduAbstract Purpose: This study sought (1) to explore whether telephone-delivered mindfulness training (MT) was feasibleand acceptable for people living with HIV (PLWH) and (2) to obtain preliminary evidence of MT's effects on medica- tion adherence and sexual risk behavior. Methods: Participants (N \u00bc50 PLWH; 50% female; M age\u00bc47.5 years) were randomized to either MT or to health coaching (HC), a time- and attention-matched control group. Both MT and HC were administered during 8 weekly phone calls by trained interventionists. At baseline, postin-tervention, and at 3-month follow-up, we assessed (a) adher-ence to ART (self-report, unannounced phone pill counts,viral load), (b) sexual risk behavior (self-report, incident sex-ually transmitted infections), and (c) hypothesized mediators of MT's effect (mindfulness, anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, and impulsivity). At postintervention and follow-up,we conducted qualitative interviews to obtain patient feed-back about their experiences in the study. Results: Fifty-five percent of the MT patients completed at least half of their calls, whereas 86% of HC patients did (P\u00bc.025); on average, MT patients completed 4.5 sessions, whereas HC patients completed 5.6 sessions. Most patients(MT\u00bc88%, HC \u00bc87%) reported satisfaction with their intervention. Within-group analyses showed that patientsin MT and HC reported improvements in medication adher- ence, mindfulness, and protected sexual events as well as reductions in anxiety, depressive symptoms, perceivedstress, and impulsivity over time; however, no between-groups differences were observed. Conclusion: MT was generally well accepted but did not appeal to all patients. HC was more universally feasible and accepted by patients. MT and HC helped patients equivalently.Continued research with larger samples is needed to deter-mine the magnitude and durability of these improvements andto identify which patients are most likely to benefit. P05.14 A 3-Day Yoga-Based Program for Education Professionals Improves Psychological Health: A PragmaticRandomized Controlled Trial Natalie Dyer 1, Sara Borden1, Jeffery Dusek2, and Sat Bir Khalsa3 1Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health, Stockbridge, Massachusetts 2University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio 3Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Natalie Dyer, natalieleighdyer@gmail.com88 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: The purpose of this controlled trial was to exam- ine changes in psychological health in education professio-nals that attended a residential 3-day yoga and mindfulness-based program. Methods: The 3-day yoga and mindfulness-based RISE (Resilience, Integration, Self-awareness, Engagement) pro-gram was administered at the Kripalu Center for Y oga & Health. Education professionals recruited from the Pittsfield Massachusetts school district were pragmatically assignedto the RISE or waitlist control group. Self-report measuresof psychological health were completed before (baseline),after (post), and 2 months after RISE (follow-up). Thirtyparticipants (RISE n \u00bc9, control n \u00bc21) completed baseline and post measures and were included in the analysis. Results: Relative to the control group, the RISE group exhibited improvements in positive affect ( ( P\u00bc.027) from baseline to post. At the follow-up, RISE participants exhibited improve-ments in waitlist controls. After the waitlist control group attended RISE,they showed improvements in resilience the follow-up compared to baseline. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the RISE program improves multiple measures of psychological health in edu-cation professionals immediately following the program and2-months following. More research is needed to investigatelonger term changes following RISE. P05.15 Efficacy of a 3-Day Residential Yoga-Based Program for Education Professionals Natalie Dyer1, Sara Borden1, Jeffery Dusek2, and Sat Bir Khalsa3 1Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health, Stockbridge, Massachusetts 2University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio 3Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Natalie Dyer, natalieleighdyer@gmail.comAbstract Purpose: The purpose of this single-arm trial was to exam- ine changes in psychological well-being in education profes-sionals after attending a 3-day yoga and mindfulness-basedprogram. Methods: Adult education professionals (eg, principals, superintendents) recruited from the New Y orkDepartment of Education (NYDOE) attended a 3-day res- idential RISE program (Resilience, Integration, Self- awareness, Engagement) that included training in physicalpostures and exercises, breathing techniques, relaxationpractices and meditation/mindfulness practices appropriatefor individuals in stressful professions administered at theKripalu Center for Y oga & Health. Self-report measures of psychological well-being (PSS, RS, PANAS, UWES, and MBI) health-related behaviors andsleep quality were completed before (baseline), immediatelyafter (post), and 2 months after RISE (follow-up). Results: Following RISE, at post, participants (N \u00bc74) showed improvements in self-reported ( P\u00bc.011), vigor (work engagement) ( P\u00bc.010), dedication (work engagement) (P\u00bc.017), and professional efficacy (burnout) ( P\u00bc.001) com- pared to baseline. With respect to health-related behaviors,participants reported improvements in exercise duration (P\u00bc.015), vegetable intake ( P\u00bc.010), and marginal improve- At the 2-month follow-up, participants (N \u00bc48) showed to baseline. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the RISE program improves measures of psychological well-being and health ineducation professionals immediately following RISE and 2 months following. More research is needed to compare RISE to a control group of education professionals fromthe NYDOE. P05.16 A Qualitative Evaluation of the Subjective Experience of Receiving a Reiki Session Natalie Dyer1, Ann Baldwin2, and William Rand3 1Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 3Center for Reiki Research, Southfield, Michigan Contact: Natalie Dyer, natalieleighdyer@gmail.comAbstracts 89Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the qualitative experience of individuals receiving Reiki at pri-vate practices throughout the United States. Methods: This study is the qualitative aspect of a large- scale study that showed that a single session of Reikiimproved quantitative measures of psychological and phys-ical health symptoms. T rained and certified Reiki Masters (N\u00bc99) conducted Reiki sessions in person at their private practice, with each session lasting between 45 and90 minutes. For the qualitative aspect of the study, ReikiMasters' clients were asked to indicate why they were seek-ing the Reiki session and to describe what they experienced during the session. A random sample of 50 reports was extracted from the total sample (N \u00bc1284) to identify emergent themes using a grounded theory approach. Results: Reiki clients (N \u00bc50) reported that they sought the Reiki session for symptom relief, relaxation, to improve emotional and physical health, and/or curiosity. Qualitative analysis using grounded theory revealed 7 major themes ofthe Reiki experience: (1) deep relaxation, (2) mental clarityand peace, (3) positive emotions and emotional healing, (4)altered perceptions, (5) spiritual experience or journey, (6) deep breathing, and (7) symptom relief. With respect to the theme of positive emotions and emotional healing, individ-uals experienced feelings of love, peace, and happiness, andfelt as if they had a deep emotional healing. Subthemes forthe altered perceptions were visual perceptions such as color and light; body sensations including floating, twitching, waves of energy, tingling, heat/warmth; and changes in theperception of time. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Reiki facilitates eliciting the relaxation response and alters emotions and perception in such a way as to facilitate a healing experi-ence. Future research will compare the experience of Reikito sham Reiki and other mind-body and bioenergetic heal-ing practices such as qigong. P05.17 Examining the Psychometric Properties of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Across Racial and Ethnic Groups Ashley Eddy, BA1, Alicia Vasquez, BS2, Jenna PhD2 1Pacific University, Forest Grove, Oregon 2Pacific University School of Graduate Psychology, Forest Grove, Oregon Contact: Ashley Eddy, eddy9851@pacificu.eduAbstract Purpose: Little research has been conducted to assess multicultural considerations in measuring mindfulness. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Five Facet MindfulnessQuestionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 2008) across differentracial and ethnic groups (Black/African American n \u00bc63; White n \u00bc74; Asian American n \u00bc24; Hispanic/Latinx n\u00bc36). Methods: Differences in FFMQ mean scores between racial/ethnic groups were compared using a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Reliability for each racial/ethnicgroup was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and convergentvalidity was examined using Pearson zero-order correla- tions between the FFMQ and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985), the Brief ResilienceScale (BRS; Smith et al., 2008), and subscales of the DASS (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; Osman et al., 2012). Results: One-way ANOVA results indicated 193) \u00bc2.60, P\u00bc.054). FFMQ Cronbach alpha as Black/ African American, a\u00bc.80; White, a\u00bc.84; Asian American, Hispanic/Latinx, a\u00bc.53. Statistically significant correlations between the FFMQ and conceptually measures was Future studies should examine the FFMQ among different racial identities to further explore multicul- tural differences. The low reliability found within the Hispanic/Latinx group suggests that large-sample examina-tion of the FFMQ among this population is necessary. P05.18 The Construct Validity of the Pentatonic Scale Body Constitution in Chinese Li Emily1 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Contact: LI Emily, emilyruochu@link.cuhk.edu.hk Abstract Background: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prac- ticed body constitution (BC) theory in diagnosing, treating,90 Global Advances in Health and Medicineand preventing disease. Pentatonic Scale Body Constitution (PSBC) was first recorded in Y ellow Emperor's Canon ofMedicine, which classified BC types as Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi,and Yv according to personality, body shape, and phonetic feature. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) are recom- mended as one of the supplement measurements forTCM practice. This study aimed to collect the constructof PSBC by the expert panel and confirm the needs of a new construct of PSBC. Methods: Three-rounds Delphi data collection in the expert panel of 7 was conducted for reaching consensus on 78 items containing personality, body shape, demo- graphics based on ancient literature. T o confirm the contentvalidity, a cognitive debriefing interview in 10 CMPs and 10layman subjects with representative ages and genders were used. T wenty pieces of transcription were recorded by ver- batim and to ensure interpretation of context of Cantonesewas appropriate. Results: Delphi confirmed the PSBC scales including the 3 domains of personality (35), body shape measurement (10)and demographics (33). Cognitive debriefing reached theContent validity index (CVI) of 80% to 100% on clarity, relevance, and appropriateness of PSBC scales. T wo items were modified and response options were improved withvisualization aid to facilitate good respond. Conclusion: This is the first study to explore the meaning of PSBC with ancient literature and expert opinion in thestandardization of framework in the new construct of aus-cultation of PRO development in Chinese. The construct and content were confirmed by Delphi study and the cog- nitive debriefing interview that showed highly feasible ofincorporating auscultation and inquiry in a PRO items mea-surement. The literature understanding of voice, sound and music are the necessary knowledge supporting to PSBC study. Further scoring algorithm is needed to explore thepsychometric properties of PSBC in TCM application. P05.19 A Community-Based Trial of Mindfulness for Physical Activity in Older Adults: APilot Study Applying a Behavioral andTranslational Intervention MappingApproach Roni Evans 1, Alex Haley1, Linda Leininger1, Craig Minneapolis, Minnesota Contact: Roni Evans, evans972@umn.eduAbstract Purpose: Engaging in sufficient physical activity is a critical health behavior, particularly for older adults. Mindfulness is a promising approach for developing attentional and emo- tional regulation, which could be helpful for physical activity, especially if coupled with evidence-based behavior change strategies. Little research, however, has addressed mindful- ness as the complex intervention that it is, and from a behavioral perspective in a systematic and rigorous way; further translation to practice is rarely addressed. Methods: A pilot study was conducted with our commu- nity partner, the YMCA T win Cities as the initial step of a phased project (R21/R33AT009110) leading to a random- ized trial (n \u00bc182). Both experimental and control groups were developed using intervention mapping and established frameworks to align target outcomes with intervention mechanisms and behavioral strategies, define fidelity, and discern active and control elements. The Behavior Change Wheel and RE-AIM Framework was used to inform long- term sustainability. Baseline and follow-up measures (accel- erometer and self-reported measures) were collected to assess feasibility of data collection. Qualitative measures of barriers and facilitators were also assessed. Results: Thirty individuals were randomly assigned to 8, 90-minute sessions of Mindful Movement or an active con- trol. A priori feasibility milestones were met (28/30 com- pleted 6/8 sessions, 30/30 completed self-reported follow up, 29/30 completed accelerometer activity measurement, 27/30 engaged in home practice, 28/30 were satisfied, and no moderate or severe adverse events were attributed to the interventions). Qualitative analyses revealed facilitators to intervention engagement included YMCA staff, program content, resources, and format in both groups. Barriers were mostly logistic related (eg, parking, noise, and scheduling). Conclusion: Pilot data were used to refine recruitment strategies and interventions for the ongoing randomized trial. This pilot study demonstrates the successful applica- tion of processes and frameworks for intervention devel- opment and feasibility testing to enhance the likelihood of trial success and eventual broad translation to community- based settings.Abstracts 91P05.20 Effectiveness of a Self-Hypnosis Protocol for Managing Chronic Pain in Outpatient Integrative Medicine Lindsey McKernan1and Michael Finn2 1Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 2Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee Contact: Michael Finn, michael.t.finn@vumc.org Abstract Purpose: Clinical hypnosis is a psychosocial intervention that can cultivate skills to enhance self-management ofchronic pain. Evidence supports the use of individual hyp-nosis for pain control; however, limited information existsregarding its effectiveness as a group intervention, compar- ison to individual intervention, and application in integrative medicine. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a stan-dardized self-hypnosis intervention for chronic pain condi-tions in an outpatient integrative medicine setting, assessingthe benefits of group and individual intervention delivery. Methods: A total of 125 patients with a chronic pain con- dition engaged in an 8-week group hypnosis protocol fortraining in self-hypnosis for pain management. Of thesepatients, 15 engaged in an individual application of the pro- tocol. Patients were assessed on a battery of validated measures before and after treatment along with 3- and 6-month follow-up assessing aspects of the pain experienceincluding pain intensity, pain interference, and pain cata-strophizing. Participants were also assessed on aspects of physical and mental health, pain widespreadness, self- efficacy, and hypnotizability. Results: Preliminary analyses indicate that patients improved in pain intensity, B \u00bc/C00.80, SE \u00bc0.16, t (119)\u00bc/C04.91, P<.001; There were no detectable differ- ences in outcome between group and individual interventions, Ps>.1. Additional analyses of long-term follow-up will occur at data completion in February 2020and address secondary outcome measures, the moderatingroles of hypnotizability and pain widespreadness, andcohort-level effects. Conclusion: Preliminary posttreatment analyses indicate that the 8-week self-hypnosis protocol was effective in improving aspects of patients' pain experiences, with com- parable intervention effects between settings. We argue forthe primary role hypnosis should play in the management ofchronic pain in integrative medicine environments.P05.21 Caregiver: Interprofessional Yoga and Education Program for Caregivers of Family With Alzheimer's or Other Dementia Susan Gould Fogerite1, Carl Milak1, Margaret Mary 1Rutgers School of Health Professions, Newark, New Jersey 2Rutgers University Behavioral Health Center, Newark, New Jersey 3Rutgers School of Nursing, Newark, New Jersey 4Atlantic Health System, Morristown, New Jersey 5Pocono Consortium for Integrative Health, Bartonsville, Pennsylvania 6Kula for Karma, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey 7Way to Wellness, Branchburg, New Jersey 8Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida Contact: Susan Gould Fogerite, fogerisu@shp.rutgers.edu Abstract Purpose: The aim is to investigate safety, feasibility, and preliminary effects of an inter-professional, yoga, wellness and caregiving skills program for caregivers of family withdementia. Methods: Eight-week, single-arm pilot trial with 8 unique once/week classes consisting of a 1-hour, interactive, edu- cational module designed to enhance an aspect of caregiverwell-being and/or caregiving skills and a 1-hour integrated yoga/meditation class. The yoga practice, which included philosophy, breathing, postures, relaxation and guided med- itation, was gentle, mindful, progressive, and related to the topic for the week. The interprofessional team of PhDs, PAs, OTs, MDs, an RD, yoga teachers, and yoga therapists, from Rutgers, other academic and health institutions, andyoga organizations, designed and implemented the study. Assessments (caregiver well-being, caregiver burden, resil- ience, mindfulness, perceived stress, sleep, and Short Form- 36), were performed at weeks 0, 9 and 16. Qualitative research, including feedback on intervention, perceived benefits, and use of skills and knowledge was obtained at 9 and 16 weeks. Results: Eight caregivers, ages 50 to 84 years, 6 females, enrolled, 1 dropout due to caregiving challenges. Participants attended 7 or 8 sessions. Adherence to the protocol was high, with no reported adverse events. Significant improvements were seen in the Perceived Stress Scale, The Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index, and92 Global Advances in Health and Medicinethe Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness tools, with positive trends in aspects of the PROMIS 43 and the Caregiver SelfEfficacy Scale. Program evaluation indicated most importantaspects: meeting other caregivers, sharing experiences/sto-ries, sense of camaraderie, yoga, meditation, relaxation,breathing, emotional, and spiritual benefits. All educationalmodules were deemed helpful, with Resiliency, Spirituality &Self-Care the highest. Most important skills utilized; copingskills, mindfulness, stretching, breathing, and relaxation. Conclusion: The study was feasible, with successful recruitment, retention, and effective delivery of the inter-vention. It was safe and well tolerated. Participantsreported continued self-care and caregiving skills use, withbenefits indicated by qualitative feedback and quantitativeassessments. P05.22 Interrater Reliability of the Mindfulness- Based AssessmentCriteria for Measuring T eacher Skill inMindfulness-Based Interventions Frederick Hecht 1, Rebecca Crane2, Patricia Wendy Hartogensis1, Bangor, UK 3University of Oxford, Oxford, UK 4Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island Contact: Frederick Hecht, rick.hecht@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: The Mindfulness-Based Interventions: T eaching Assessment Criteria (MBI:TAC) is potentially an importanttool for measuring teacher skill, a central element in inter-vention fidelity in mindfulness-based interventions. TheMBI:TAC measures 6 teacher competency domains, ratedon a 6-point scale. Preliminary data suggest good interraterreliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of .6to .81 for individual raters, but in prior studies many ratersknew teacher experience level. We sought to rigorouslyevaluate interrater reliability. Prior practice has been torate 2 sessions; we also assessed whether ratings afterviewing a single session had adequate interrater reliability. Methods: We video recorded courses taught by 21 mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) teachers andrandomly selected 2 sessions from each course for rating.We conducted an 8-session course to train experiencedMBI teachers in using the MBI:TAC; 18 trained raters par-ticipated in the current study. Each MBSR teacher was ratedby 3 people who did not know the teacher. Raters assignedan initial rating after viewing the first session and then made a final rating after watching the second session. T wo-way random effects models were used to generate absolute agreement ICCs for individual rater and average ratings. Results: Individual rater ICCs ranged from .33 (relational skills domain) to .56; organization and guiding mindfulness practice domains also had ICCs <.50. ICCs based on aver- age ratings ranged from .6 to .8 across 6 MBI:TAC domains after watching 2 sessions. ICCs of ratings done after watch- ing 1 session, averaging 3 raters, were .32 for relational skills but over .5 (range up to .64) for other domains. Conclusion: ICCs indicated good reliability using an aver- age of 3 ratings, but interrater reliability was only fair for 3 of 6 domains when using a single rater. Results suggest that 2 sessions should be rated, ideally by more than 1 rater, to get high interrater reliability. P05.23 Feasibility of a Mindful Yoga Intervention for Patients With Chronic Severe MoodDisorders Nina Vollbehr hjr.hoenders@lentis.nl Abstract Purpose: Chronic mood disorders lead to significant impairment, a large number of patients do not seek help and, even if they do, many do not respond to treatment or suffer from negative side effects of medication. It is there- fore important to develop innovative and attractive treat- ments for chronic mood disorders. Y oga represents a promising treatment approach in this regard. Methods: This pilot study tested the feasibility of a 9-week manualized mindful yoga intervention for patients with chronic mood disorders. Eleven patients with chronic severe mood disorders, currently in treatment, completeda 9-week mindful yoga intervention. Qualitative methods were used to assess patients' experiences and quantitative methods were used to assess intervention effects on psy- chological distress and potential mechanisms. Results: Eight patients completed the training ( /C215 ses- sions) and rated the overall quality of the training with a score of 8.8 (using a 1-10 scale). All participants reported less psychological distress and no adverse events. Potential mechanisms that showed most promise were worry and fear of depression and anxiety, and, to a lesser extent,Abstracts 93rumination, trusting bodily experiences and not distracting from sensations of discomfort (both aspects of body awareness). Conclusion: A 9-week mindful yoga intervention appears to be a feasible and attractive treatment when added totreatment as usual for a group of patients with chronic mood disorders. Large scale randomized controlled trials with a yoga intervention added to treatment as usual com-pared to a structurally equivalent control group, with anadequate sample size, are needed to determine efficacy.Regarding potential mechanisms, worry, fear of emotion of the emotions of depression and anxiety, and, to a lesser extent, rumination, trusting bodily experiences andnot distracting from sensations of discomfort (both aspectsof body awareness) seem most promising to explore infuture studies. P05.24 A Mindful Yoga Intervention for Young Women With Major Depressive Disorder: Design and Baseline SampleCharacteristics of a tions for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), modestrates of treatment response and high relapse indicate theneed to augment existing interventions. Following theory and initial research indicating the promise of mindful yoga interventions, this study examines mindful yoga as a treat-ment of MDD in young women, who are especially at riskfor developing MDD. Methods: This randomized controlled trial uses a sample of young adult females (18-34 years) to examine the efficacyand cost-effectiveness of a 9-week mindful-yogaintervention added to treatment-as-usual (TAU) versusTAU alone in MDD. Primary outcome measures consist of clinician-administered (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and self-report (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales)measures of depression. Underlying mechanisms will beexamined, including rumination, negative self-evaluation, intolerance of uncertainty, interoceptive awareness, and dis- positional mindfulness. Assessments were conducted at pre-intervention and will be conducted at postinterventionand 6- and 12-month follow-up.Results: The baseline sample consists of 171 women of which 88 were randomized in the mindful yoga intervention and 83 controls. The mean age was 25.08 years (standarddeviation [SD] \u00bc4.64, range 18-34). The mean level clinician-rated symptoms of depression was 18.39 (SD\u00bc6.00, range 6-33), indicating moderate depression (Zimmerman, Martinez, Y oung, Chelminski, & Dalrymple, 2013). Fifty-three percent of participants were in a relation-ship and 17% had children. Fifty-six percent had a paid job for a mean of 22 hours per week (SD \u00bc12.59, range 1-60), and 46% were currently in school or university. Most par- ticipants were living alone (25%), in student housing (18%), or with their partner (17%).Conclusion: This trial will provide important information regarding the benefits of adding yoga-based interventions to TAU for young women with MDD and the mechanisms through which such benefits may occur. P05.25 Effects of a 12-Week Yoga Versus a 12- Week Educational Film Program onSymptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome andRelated Outcomes: An ExploratoryRandomized Controlled Trial Kim Innes Morgantown, West Virginia 2University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 3Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 4Group Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 5The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Kim Innes, kinnes@hsc.wvu.edu Abstract Purpose: The goal of this exploratory randomized con- trolled trial (RCT) was to assess the effects of a yoga versus educational film program on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) symptoms and related outcomes in adults with RLS, a common and burdensome sleep disorder.Methods: Forty-one community-dwelling, ambulatory non- pregnant adults with moderate to RLS were ran- domized to a 12-week beginner Iyengar yoga (n educational film (EF) program (n \u00bc22); yoga group94 Global Advances in Health and Medicineparticipants were asked to practice at home 30 minutes/day on nonclass days. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post- treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Study Group Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinalscale), sleep quality, mood, perceived stress, and quality of life (QOL). Results: Thirty adults (13 yoga and 17 EF), aged 24 to 73 (mean\u00bc50.4/C62.4 years), completed the 12-week study (78% females, 80.5% white). Y oga and EF group participantsattended an average 13.0 /C60.84 (81%) and /C60.3 classes (85%), respectively; yoga participants com- pleted a mean of 3.8 /C60.3 (81%) homework sessions/ week. Postintervention, both groups showed significant improvement in RLS symptoms and severity, perceived stress, mood, and QOL-mental health ( Ps/C20.04). Relative to the EF group, yoga participants demonstrated significant- ly greater reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom sever- ity (Ps/C20.01), and greater improvements in perceived stress and mood ( Ps/C20.04), as well as sleep quality ( P\u00bc.09); RLS symptoms decreased to minimal/mild in 77% of yoga group participants, with none scoring in the severe range by week12, versus 24% and 12%, respectively, in EF participants. In the yoga group, IRLS and RLS severity scores declined with increasing minutes of homework practice ( rs\u00bc.7,P\u00bc.009 and .6, P\u00bc.03, respectively), suggesting a possible dose- response relationship. Conclusion: Findings of this preliminary RCT suggest that yoga may be effective in reducing RLS symptoms and symp-tom severity, decreasing perceived stress, and improving mood and sleep in adults with RLS. P05.26 Acting With Awareness Moderates the Relationship Between Negative Affect andAlcohol Use Candice Kennedy 1, Jenna Flowers1, Alicia Vasquez1, and Michael Christopher1 1Pacific University Oregon, Beaverton, Oregon Contact: Candice Kennedy, hoke4893@pacificu.edu Abstract Purpose: Negative affect (NA) consistently predicts alco- hol use. In mindfulness-based relapse prevention, anevidence-based treatment, mindfulness skills such as acting with awareness (AA) are taught to help prevent alcohol relapse. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to exam-ine whether AA moderates the relationship between NA and alcohol use in a large representative sample of American adults (N \u00bc601).Methods: The PROCESS V.3 macro for SPSS 26 was used to test the interaction between NA and AA in predictingalcohol use. The NA subscale of the PANAS was used as thepredictor, with the alcohol use subscale of the Alcohol UseDisorders Identification T est (AUDIT) as the outcome, andthe AA subscale of the Five Factor MindfulnessQuestionnaire-Short Form (FFMQ-SF) Results: Pearson zero-order correlations itive relationship between NA and AUDIT ( r\u00bc.11,P\u00bc.006) and negative relationship between AA and AUDIT(r\u00bc/C0.10, P\u00bc.019). The interaction term generated evi- dence for a moderating effect of AA on the relationshipbetween NA and AUDIT (\u00df \u00bc. 054, P\u00bc.0122). Simple slope analyses revealed that the relationship between NAand AUDIT is significant when AA is low ( /C01SD, \u00df\u00bc.036, P\u00bc.012), but \u00df \u00bc/C0.014, P\u00bc.480). Conclusion: AA may be a protective factor against prob- lematic alcohol use. One mechanism by which interventionssuch as mindfulness-based relapse prevention may work isby increasing AA. Further research should explore the roleof mindfulness mechanisms on affective predictors of alco-hol use in clinical substance use populations. P05.27 Pilot Feasibility and Acceptability of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Perinatal Women With Trauma History Candice Kennedy1, Kristen Mackiewicz Seghete2, and Alice Graham2 1Pacific University Oregon, Beaverton, Oregon 2Oregon Health & Sciences University, Portland, Oregon Contact: Candice Kennedy, hoke4893@pacificu.edu Abstract Purpose: Postpartum depression (PPD) can have signifi- cant consequences for mothers and infants. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) during pregnancy is aneffective preventative intervention for PPD. However,little is known regarding the efficacy and potential mecha-nisms of action of MBCT for women with a trauma history.In this pilot trial, we attempted to establish the feasibilityand acceptability of conducting an intergenerational trans-lational study of the neurobiological mechanisms of actionof MBCT during pregnancy for women with traumahistories. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited to participate in an MBCT group during pregnancy or treatment as usual(TAU). Maternal neuroimaging was completed 6 weekspostpartum, and infant neuroimaging was completed inAbstracts 95the first 4 weeks following birth. The Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) and the ClientSatisfaction Questionnaire\u20148 (CSQ-8) were used to col-lect data on trauma history and participant satisfaction withtheir assigned group. Feasibility was calculated using per- centage of attendance for greater than 4 MBCT sessions; acceptability was measured using the CSQ-8. Mean differ-ences between groups on the CSQ-8 were tested using theMann-Whitney Utest. Results: A total of N \u00bc12 women completed the study. Eighty-three percent met clinical cutoff for trauma historyon the MACE. Four (80%) participants assigned to MBCTcompleted at least 4 groups. Mean CSQ-8 scores for theMBCT group were significantly higher than TAU, U \u00bc1.500, P\u00bc.008. All women and their infants eligible for an imaging session attended. Conclusion: MBCT and maternal and infant neuroimaging are feasible and acceptable for pregnant women withtrauma histories, who are at increased risk of PPD. Theseare promising results supporting further exploration ofMBCT mechanisms at a neurobiological level from larger,randomized samples from this population to provide robustevidence to support this intervention. P05.28 A Multicenter, Parallel-Group, Randomized Controlled Trial on Eurythmy Therapy andTai Chi in Chronically Ill Elderly WithIncreased Risk of Falling: Trial Huber3 1Center for Complementary Medicine, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg 2IFAEMM at the University of Witten/Herdecke, Freiburg, Germany 2Center for Complementary Medicine, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany 4Clinical Trials Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany 5Division Methods in Clinical Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center, Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany 6Faculty of Medicine, Center for Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology Freiburg, and polypharmacy increase while sensory, motor, and cognitive functionsdecrease. Falls occur in 30% of elderly at least once per year, with injuries at 10% to 20%. Reducing falls and enhanc- ing physical, emotional, and cognitive capacities are essential for healthy aging despite chronic disease. Eurythmy therapy (EYT) and T ai Chi train balance, mobility, and concentrative and sensory capacities. Methods: In 8 trial sites, 550 outpatients aged 65 years and older with chronic disease and increased risk of falling (his- tory of imbalance, Berg Balance Scale [BBS] score /C2049) will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either EYT or TaiChi (provided twice, later once per week plus practice at home, for over 24 weeks) added to standard care or stan- dard care alone. Standard care includes a detailed written recommendation on fall prevention and the visit of a prima- ry care doctor. Patients living a reclusive life or economi- cally disadvantaged patients will be particularly addressed. A motivation and communication concept supports patients' compliance with trial procedures and practicing. Public and patient representatives are involved in the planning and con-duction of the trial. Falls will be documented daily in a diary. Falls, injuries, and complications will be ascertained during monthly phone visits. The falls efficacy scale, BBS, cognition (MoCA), Mood (GDS-15), quality of life (Short Form 12), instrumental activities of daily living, use of medical and nonmedical services, and adherence will be assessed at months 3, 6, and 12 and inner correspondence with prac- tices at month 6. Results: Patient enrolment started in August 2019. The trial is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01GL1805) and registered at DRKS00016609. Conclusion: Reduced fall risks and fear of falling and improved mobility, quality of life, mood, and cognition are relevant for elderly to cope with aging and diseases and to reduce health-care costs. P05.29 Effects of Mindfulness and Acceptance Interventions on Affect T olerance andSensitivity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials Kristen Kraemer 1, Christina Luberto2, Daniel Hall3, Long Ngo1, and Gloria Yeh1 1Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Newton, Massachusetts 2Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 3Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Kristen Kraemer, kkraemer@bidmc.harvard.edu96 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: Affect intolerance/sensitivity, defined as the inability to withstand negative emotional states, is a transdiagnostic mechanistic process implicated in the devel- opment and maintenance of numerous forms of psychopa- thology and negative health behaviors. Mindfulness and acceptance interventions are posited to directly improve affect intolerance/sensitivity; however, there has been no quantitative synthesis of this research. Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to November 2018. Studies that included a ran- domized controlled trial (RCT), adults across any popula- tion, a mindfulness or acceptance intervention, and an affect tolerance/sensitivity outcome were eligible. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed according to Cochrane. Hedge's g values, 95% con- fidence intervals, Pvalues, and Q-values were calculated for a series of random-effects models using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (V .3). Results: T wenty-five studies (pooled N \u00bc1778), generally of moderate quality, were included. Most studies included Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (n \u00bc8) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (n \u00bc6). Affect intoler- ance/sensitivity was assessed via self-reported anxiety sen- sitivity (n \u00bc9), distress tolerance (n \u00bc7), and intolerance of uncertainty (n \u00bc4). Most studies included those with anxi- ety psychopathology (n \u00bc8), medical conditions, such as cancer (n \u00bc4), or healthy adults (n \u00bc4). There was a small-moderate, significant effect of mindfulness and accep- tance interventions on improving affect intolerance/sensitiv- ity postintervention (Hedges' g \u00bc/C0.35, 95% CI\u00bc/C0.50 to/C0.19,P<. 001), with to (Hedges' g \u00bc/C0.35, 95% CI \u00bc/C0.61 to /C0.00, P<.01). There was a significantly larger effect for studies with inactive compared to active controls. There was a slightly larger effect for longer ( /C218 sessions) versus shorter interventions ( <8 sessions), though this difference was not significant. Conclusion: Mindfulness and acceptance interventions may be effective for improving affect intolerance/sensitivity, with effects maintained up to 6 months. Future work aimed at optimizing these interventions to maximally engage affect intolerance/sensitivity is warranted.P05.30 Feasibility Study of a Modified Yoga Program for Elderly Adults Cheryl LaMore1, Suzanna Zick2, Kevin Boehnke3, Lora Girata2, and Patty Hart4 1Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 2University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 3Department of Anesthesia, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 4Ann Arbor, Michigan Contact: Cheryl LaMore, cstrzoda@med.umich.edu Abstract Purpose: Managing chronic pain is difficult. This is partic- ularly true in older adults, where prevalence of is up to 50%.Y oga has been shown to be effective for improving balance,physical mobility, and quality of life in elders /C2165 years; however, no studies have examined yoga for improving pain and anxiety in this population. We conducted a feasi- bility study among adults in assisted and independent livingto examine whether yoga could be a viable pain manage-ment strategy. Methods: We recruited adults ( /C2165 years of age) in assis- ted or independent living with chronic pain ( /C213o na 10-point scale and lasting for /C213 months) and who had no current yoga practice. The intervention included 10 weekly 60-minute gentle yoga classes led by a certified yoga instruc- tor with experience teaching elderly adults. Participantsfilled out validated questionnaires investigating pain (BriefPain Inventory), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxietyand Depression Scale), other measures relevant to pain, and questions about feasibility at weeks 5 and 10. Results: T wenty-four participants enrolled (87.5% women) and 20 completed the intervention. Average age was xxxand all participants were white. Pain severity decreased from 4.6 (SD \u00bc1.3) to 4.1 (SD \u00bc1.5) and pain interference decreased from 3.4 (SD \u00bc2.1) to 2.8 (SD \u00bc1.4), though these decreases were not statistically significant ( P>.05). Anxiety decreased from 5.7 (SD \u00bc3.8) to 4.3 (SD \u00bc3.1), and a clinically and statistically significant decrease (P\u00bc.005). There were no statistically significant differences in fatigue, depression, sleep, or physical function. Y oga waswell tolerated, with adverse events related to transientmusculoskeletal pain. Participants reported being somewhat likely to recommend yoga to a friend and quite a bit likely to do yoga again; 4/20 reported practicing yoga outside ofclass.Conclusion: Among assisted and independent living elder- ly adults, yoga was well-tolerated and improved anxiety but not pain after participation in a 10-week yoga program.Abstracts 97P05.31 Multiple Therapeutic Benefits of Tai Chi for Older Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain:Insights From a Qualitative Analysis Tamsin Lee 1, Karen Sherman2, Elizabeth Phelan1, Rene Hawkes2, and Judith Turner1 1University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 2Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute, Seattle, Washington Contact: Tamsin Lee, tl579@uw.edu Abstract Purpose: T o assess qualitative findings on the perceived benefits of T ai Chi among older adults (65 \u00feyears) with chronic low back pain participating in a pilot feasibility trial. Methods: Tai Chi intervention group participants were invited to attend a focus group session 52 weeks after ran- domization. They were asked to describe their experience of Tai Chi class attendance and the benefits of their practice. Transcripts were read and coded to identify major themes and detailed subthemes. All emerging themes were reviewed by the study team and discussed until consensus was achieved. Results: Eighteen older adults attended the focus group. Five major themes were identified: physical benefits, body awareness, mental-emotional benefits, social benefits, mul- tiple benefits, and integration of Tai Chi into daily activities. Improvements in pain, balance, flexibility, leg strength, and posture were the most common benefits reported by par- ticipants. Increased body awareness led to simple postural adjustments that facilitated pain coping. Mental-emotional benefits included greater mindfulness, a sense of relaxation, and mental clarity. Social benefits included commitment to attending class which in turned strengthened motivation to practice. Cross-cutting benefits involved integrating skills into one's daily activities with resultant increased functional independence and improved quality of life. Conclusion: This qualitative analysis demonstrates the multiple and nuanced nature of the benefits that older adults living with chronic low back pain experience from engaging in a T ai Chi intervention.P05.32 Effect of Sukshma Vyayama Joint Loosening Yoga on Aromatase Inhibitor- Induced Arthralgia in Breast Cancer Patients: A onFacebook Rajendra Prasad2, and Greg Mears1 1Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, New York 2S-Vyasa University, Bangalore, India Contact: Leigh Leibel, ll3125@cumc.columbia.edu Abstract Purpose: Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy causes joint pain in up to half of women, and up to 20% become non- compliant with treatment due to pain and discomfort. This pilot study investigated the efficacy of sukshma vyayamayoga in improving AI-induced joint pain and evaluated thefeasibility of delivering the intervention on Facebook. Methods: Breast cancer patients undergoing treatment with AI's with self-reported arthralgia were recruited viaan institutional review board-approved announcementposted in 2 closed breast cancer support groups on Facebook to participate in a yoga study delivered on Facebook. Participants completed BPI, DASH, PRAI, andWOMAC questionnaires before and after the study.Intervention consisted of 12 joint loosening exercises per-formed in a chair, once daily for 12 minutes, Monday to Friday for 4 weeks. Asynchronous video demonstrations were available in a secret Facebook group and viewing con-firmed by typing \"done\" (timestamped) in comments. Results: A total of 200 women responded worldwide; 38 met the inclusion criteria/consent, 26 completed the onlineconsent, interventions, and pre/post questionnaires.Participants based in the United States, Canada, and UnitedKingdom. Paired simple ttests results showed significant (P<.05) improvement in all the pain measures and quality of life parameters after yoga intervention compared to baseline. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that it is feasible to teach sukshma vyayama to patients on Facebook and that the intervention significantly improves AI-inducedarthralgia. T eaching yoga via social media may providebetter access to this therapeutic modality to patients at all points in the cancer care continuum globally. Variable pre mean post mean Thermo-Fasciatherapy to Reverse an Alzheimer Diagnosis: A CaseStudy Lord 1 1InterActive Fasciatherapy Clinic, Bromont, Quebec, Canada Contact: Raymond Lord, raymondlord.massotherapeute@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Male, 67, has Alzheimer family history, participat- ed in protocols at Douglas Mental Health University Research Center. Late 2016, received an Alzheimer diagno- sis, took combination therapy (Memantine & Rivastigmine/ Exelon patches), anxiety medication, and nearly some for 2 Alzheimer risk factors: hypertension and hyperglycemia. He presented stiff cervical/lumbar areas, right eye/scalp intense pain, stuttering, snoring, anxiety, and extreme afternoon fatigue. In youth, experienced traumas (head, emotional), regular migraines, and daily sugar cravings into adulthood. Methods: In weekly 1-hour sessions, I manually provided firm, supportive, holding pressure on body parts. He was supine on grounded/infrared mats, described interoceptive sensations to raise body-awareness, used nose in-breaths, and deployed throat out-breaths to relax fascia and release muscle/nervous tensions. When sensations stop, I change location for another cycle. Results: The first 2 sessions, he felt as if \"fresh water poured into his brain.\"Concurrently, sugar cravings stopped, a liking for fruits/vegetables developed and lost 5 kg. The fifth week, he relaxed the cervical/lumbar areas. The eighth week onward, he most probably released trau- matic pent up energy using vigorous and repetitive body- wide contractions/releases (Figure 1). Over a 6 month period, he noticed many improvements: hypertension/ hyperglycemia returned to normal; reduced anxiety and eye/scalp pain; better sleep, energy, speech, mood, and memory tests. His MD also noticed, scheduled a fluoro- deoxyglucose PET scan for glucose metabolism and, with a 99% confidence level, concluded: \"Y our brain is amyloid-\u00df deposition free and healthy,\" reversed the Alzheimer diag- nosis, stopped Alzheimer medications, deprescribed anxiety medication, and encouraged him to continue with fascia- therapy. A 21 month follow-up FDG-PET scan confirmedinitial results. Conclusion: Evidence suggests weekly interoceptive thermo-fasciatherapy sessions improved this individual's quality of life and cognitive functions. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of daily sugar cravings as a natural response to correct insufficient glucose supply to the brain.P05.34 Acceptability of an Online Mind-Body Intervention for Parenting Stress: Mixed- Methods Results From a Randomized Controlled School, Boston, Massachusetts 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 3Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona 4University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland Contact: Christina Luberto, cluberto@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Parents of children with learning/attentional dis- abilities (LAD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are atelevated risk for chronic stress. The types of stress and treatment needs differ between these parent groups. We adapted our evidence-based mind-body intervention(SMART -3RP) for parents of children with LAD and ASD,delivered via videoconferencing. Preliminary results from our wait-list randomized pilot trial suggest the adapted pro- gram is feasible and efficacious in improving stress coping;however, we wanted to have an in-depth understanding ofits acceptability. The purpose of this analysis is to (1) explore participants' feedback regarding the virtual SMART -3RP groups and (2) compare feedback across LADand ASD parents. Methods: The SMART -3RP is an 8-week mind-body group intervention with 1.5-hour sessions delivered via synchro-nous group videoconferencing. Participants were 1:1 ran-domized to immediate or delayed SMART -3RP (separate groups for LAD and ASD) and completed a feedback ques- tionnaire postintervention (N \u00bc33 M age\u00bc45.99, SD \u00bc6.75). Results: Participants reported the intervention had the right number of sessions (69%), right session duration (83%), and right amount of structure (83%). They felt com-fortable during sessions (89%) and found it helpful to learnmind-body skills (89%). There were no significant differen- ces between ASD and LAD parents other than a trend for more ASD parents reporting sessions were too long (22%ASD vs 6% LAD, x 2\u00bc5.67, P\u00bc.06). Qualitative themes were similar across parents and included that video delivery had some technical challenges but enabled participation; group support and mind-body skills were helpful; and fur-ther SMART -3RP sessions or psychotherapy are needed. Conclusion: LAD and ASD parents similarly found a syn- chronous video-based mind-body resiliency program to beacceptable in content and structure. T echnology limitationsAbstracts 99notwithstanding online delivery were very satisfactory and overcame obstacles to participation. Suggestions for opti-mizing video delivery include participant instructions to useheadphones and mute themselves when not speaking. P05.35 Dyadic Integrative Exercise for Persons With Dementia and Their Care Partners Wolf Mehling1 1University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California Contact: Wolf Mehling, wolf.mehling@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: In the absence of disease modifying treatments for dementia, nonpharmacological interventions are vital forenhancing the lives of persons with dementia (PWD). ThePaired Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise(PLIE\u00b4) study is examining the effects of a unique integrative group movement program that targets preserved abilities and neural mechanisms in PWD and includes their carepartners (CP). The intervention includes 1-hourcommunity-based classes with 5 dyads, 2 days/week for12 weeks, and 3 monthly home visits. We present results from a randomized controlled study examining feasibility, efficacy, and satisfaction. Methods: Seniors with mild to moderate dementia and their CPs were enrolled and randomized to receive either an immediate or delayed start to the Paired PLIE \u00b4program with outcomes measured at baseline, 12 weeks, and24 weeks and anonymous evaluation surveys sent afterwithdrawal or completion. Feasibility was assessed based on enrollment and percent completion. Efficacy was assessed by calculating standardized effect sizes comparingchange during Paired PLIE \u00b4versus change during control period (difference-in-differences). Satisfaction was assessedbased on quantitative and qualitative evaluation survey responses. Analyses include mixed effects models and descriptive thematic analysis. Results: Thirty dyads (60 participants) enrolled and 24 (80%) completed the study. Effect sizes suggested improve- ments during Paired PLIE \u00b4for PWD depressive life (caregiver-rated, Satisfaction was high (mean 5-point Likert scale: 4.8), and participants were likely to recommend the program to others (mean 11-point Likert scale: 9.4). Most caregivers reported observing phys-ical, emotional, and social benefits for their loved ones andthemselves. Conclusion: Paired PLIE \u00b4is a promising integrative group movement program for PWD and their CPs that appears tobe feasible and is associated with high levels of satisfaction and preliminary evidence of benefits to participant and carepartner physical, emotional, and social well-being. P05.37 A Call to Action: Evidence for Tai Chi in the Treatment of PTSD Barbara Niles1and DeAnna Mori1 1VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Barbara Niles, Abstract Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is catego- rized as a psychological disorder, although it has deleteriouseffects on physical health and has been increasingly consid- ered a systemic disorder, affecting both the brain and the entire body. There is growing interest in using mind-bodytreatments, such as Tai Chi, to address both the physical and mental health symptoms of PTSD. We will review the extant evidence on the use of Tai Chi in the treatment of PTSD andhypothesize physiological and psychological pathways of action. Methods: Electronic literature searches on PTSD and Tai Chi were conducted using PubMed, and 4 EBSCO databases (Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and SocINDEX). The search terms used for Tai Chi were qigong, qi gong, chi kung, chikung, tai ji, and taichi. The PTSD search terms were posttraumatic, posttrau- matic, PTSD, combat stress, soldier, warrior, veteran, and combat. Studies were included if they were (1) nonrandom-ized trials, (2) case studies, (3) observational studies, (4) qualitative research, or (5) quasi-experimental. Results: Seventeen publications were identified through title review. Thirteen publications were removed after abstract screening: 8 were not empirical studies, 1 was not relatedto PTSD, 2 were both not empirical studies and not related to PTSD, and 2 were not related to T ai Chi. Four full text articles were assessed for eligibility and included. Conclusion: The pilot studies reviewed provide strong anecdotal evidence to support the use of Tai Chi in thetreatment of PTSD. Additional literature review identified several possible pathways by which T ai Chi can improve both psychological symptoms and physiological sequalae ofPTSD. Hypothesized mechanisms for further study include (1) arousal reduction, (2) improved body awareness, (3) behavioral activation and social interaction, (4) reducedchronic pain, (5) improved functional connectivity and changes in brain structure, and (6) positive adaptations in the neuroendocrine system.100 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP05.38 A Short- and Long-term Evaluation of a University-Wide Interdisciplinary Body of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 2University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio Contact: Brenna Novak, novakbk@mail.uc.edu Abstract Purpose: Positive short-term effects of mind-body skills programs on participant well-being have been reported inhealth professional students. With expansion of a university-wide mind-body program across 10 colleges, both short-term and longitudinal potential benefits onwell-being had yet to be established in a diverse student group. The purpose of this study was to report on mental and emotional well-being of a diverse group of studentsimmediately following a mind-body course compared tocontrols, and to determine whether program effects were sustained at 1-year follow-up. Methods: A cross-sectional pre-post survey was adminis- via SurveyMonkey to participants of a 9-week mind-body skills course and a control group at a publicuniversity in Spring 2017 to 2019. One-year follow-up was completed on a subset of participants/controls. Students were assessed on validated measures of stress,positive/negative affect, mindfulness, resilience, empathy, and burnout. Student scores were analyzed between groups and over time using multivariate and bivariateanalyses. Results: In this survey, 201 participants and 179 controls completed evaluations before and after the 9-week course (79% response rate; 73% females, 72% white, mean age\u00bc25 years). Then, 29 participants and 24 controls from a Spring 2018 group were assessed again 1 year later (61% response rate; 74% females, 73% white, mean age\u00bc24 years). Participants' well-being significantly improved on all but one measure (burnout/emotionalexhaustion) immediately following the course compared to controls ( P<.05). Within the longitudinal group of par- ticipants, only improvements in mindfulness measures returned to baseline scores. Conclusion: While participation in this mind-body skills program improved indicators of well-being immediately fol-lowing the 9-week course, sustained effects at 1-year follow-up were only seen for mindfulness. Future program- ming should focus on developing and implementingmind-body skills booster sessions to enhance the longitu- dinal benefit of participation in the program. P05.39 Effect of a Single Audio-visual Brain Entrainment Session on Heart RateVariability: A Clinical Trial With 100 AdultVolunteers Michael Porter 1, Patrick Porter2, Afonso Inoue Shiguemi Salgado3, Francisco Integrative Health, Londrina, Brazil 2Quantum University, Honolulu, Hawaii 3Residency Program in Integrative Physical Therapy - Salgado Institute of Integrative Health, Londrina, Brazil Contact: Patrick Porter, pporter@braintap.com Abstract Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the Audio-visual Brain Entrainment (ABE) on heart rate variability. Methods: Sample size consisted of 100 adult volunteers (50 males and 50 females) with no hearing disabilities. ABE was delivered with a BrainTap headset (New Bern, NC, USA) in a 20-minute session. Session consists of bin- aural beats at 18 to 0.5 Hz, isochronic tones at 18 to .0.5 Hz, and visual entrainment through light-emitting diode lights at 470 nm flickering at to 0.5 Hz. Heart rate var- iability (Dinamika HRV, Advanced Heart Rate Variability T est System, Moscow, Russia) was assessed at baseline and after ABE session. Results: ABE significantly (1) increased heart rate variabil- ity: HRV index (a low HRV is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease - P<.001, 21.8%) and RRNN (RR normal-to-normal intervals; a marker (2) increased parasympathetic activity markers: RMSSD (Root Mean Square of the Successive RR interval Differences - P<.0001, 32.2%), NN50 (the number of pairs of successive NN (R-R) inter- vals that differ by more than 50 ms - P<.0001, 50.6%), pNN50% (the proportion of NN50 divided by the NN (R-R) P<.001, index modulation of the branch of the autonomic nervous system - P<.0336, 37.1%), and LFnu (low-frequency band: general indicator of aggregate modulation of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the Autonomic Nervous System - P<.0048, 45.1%), and (3) decreased stress (P<.001, 38.4%) and heart rate ( P<.0001, 6.2%).Abstracts 101Conclusion: A single ABE session with the BrainTap Headset significantly increased heart rate variability andparasympathetic activity as well as decreased stress indexand heart rate. P05.40 MINDING-GOALS: Effects of a Web-based, Interactive, Mind-Body Intervention in of Hypertension Center, Boston, Massachusetts 2University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania 3University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 4UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania 5Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania Contact: Iniya Rajendran, iniya.rajendran@bmc.org Abstract Purpose: Hypertension is the most common chronic health condition among adults in the United States.Despite effective medications, 40% of treated patients do not meet blood pressure (BP) goals. This discrepancy, in part, reflects low patient adherence to lifestyle recommen-dations, such as physical activity, weight and diet, and med-ication nonadherence. The purpose of this study was toevaluate an online mind-body behavior program for BPcontrol. Methods: This was a pilot randomized control trial of 76 primary care patients aged 21 to 79, with a diagnosis of hypertension, uncontrolled BP (systolic BP [SBP] /C21 145 mmHg or distolic BP [DBP] /C2190 mmHg, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. The control groupreceived the \"Goal-oriented Online Access to LifestyleSupport\" (GOALS) program, a successful online programthat has promoted weight loss and adapted for BP reduc-tion. The MINDING-GOALS program incorporated amind-body component to GOALS which included 4 mindfulness methods: (1) body scan, (2) sitting practice, (3) walking meditation, and (4) mindful exercise. The interventionlasted 16 weeks and patients were followed for up to12 months. Results: Of 39 and 37 in the control and intervention group, respectively, baseline characteristics were similar except that the intervention group had twice the numberof black participants. The control group completed a meanof 8.4 versus 7.7 lessons. Compared to the control group,there was a nonsignificant decrease in mean SBP(149.1 mmHg mmHg, mmHg to 81 mmHg, P\u00bc.6), and a decrease in weight (205 lbs. to 199.7 lbs., P\u00bc.3). No difference was seen in the mindful awareness scale and medication adherence based on pill recall. Conclusion: The results show that a web-based platform to deliver mindfulness may lower BP and reduce weight although the effects are not fully driven by improving mind- fulness. No change in medication adherence was seen likely due to high baseline adherence. P05.41 A Cry in the Wilder-city: A Qualitative Analysis of Nature's Effects on Well-beingas Expressed in Urban Park Bench Journal Entries Francesca Richardson 1and Sara Warber2 1The Institute for Integrative Health, Baltimore, Maryland 2University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan Contact: Francesca Richardson, frichardsonphd@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: With the increase of planned urban green spaces to support health and well-being, there is a need to examine the impact of these green spaces on individual well-being. This qualitative study examines user well-being within 8 urban parks in the Washington, DC area that were devel- oped by the TKF Foundation of Annapolis, MD. Methods: Each site has specific elements (a portal, a path, a bench on which to reflect, and a journal on which to record thoughts and feelings) that offer certain sensory and internal experiences. In addition, these sites have been curated by a firesoul (a local person who sought funding for\u2014and was involved in\u2014design and management of the site) over time. In the first phase of this study, journal entries left at 8 of the sites encompassing entries of more than 1000 individuals were analyzed using content analysis and the overarching themes were identified. Results: Five major themes included: (1) Therapeutic expe- riences in the site, including positive emotional and physical experiences such as references to healing, reduction of stress, finding peace and solace, renewal of wholeness, empowerment and self-agency, and transformation. (2) Confessions or sharing of a secret, of an authentic self, or of personal failings and a wish and plan to change. (3) Celebration, honoring, memorializing, or marking of a par- ticular moment in time. (4) Existential interpretation of cycles of nature. (5) Concern for others/feeling connection with them.102 Global Advances in Health and MedicineConclusion: The journal entries suggest that these specif- ically designed park sites are effective as nature-based inter- ventions that seek to alter the environment to promote nature interactions. In addition, the themes elucidate howparks influence human well-being through multiple path- ways. Further research, focusing on individual and commu- nity well-being, is in progress with the community members who developed, managed. and now use these urban park sites. P05.42 A Closer Look at Yoga Nidra: Sleep Lab Analyses (Feasibility and Effects on Sleep,the Autonomic Nervous System, and Self-Reported Anxiety) Erica Sharpe 1, Butler2, Ramin Soltanzadeh3, Doug Hanes1, and Ryan Bradley1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 2Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 3University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba Contact: Erica Sharpe, esharpe@nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: In this pilot study, the guided meditation tech- nique, Y oga Nidra, was tested for feasibility as an interven- tion for insomnia. Feasibility questions including acceptabil- ity of intervention conditions, credibility of Y oga Nidra as a treatment for insomnia, and appropriateness of our mea- surement tools were investigated, along with the impact of Y oga Nidra on sleep onset, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and self-reported anxiety. Methods: Feasibility was measured using recruitment/ retention data and questionnaires. Sleep and brainwave pat- terns were measured using electroencephalography. ANS tone was measured via heart rate variability and respiratory rate. Anxiety was measured using self-report surveys. Our population included 22 adults, aged 18-45, with difficulty falling asleep. Each participant completed 2 visits. Half ofthe population was randomized to practice Y oga Nidra at the second visit. Results: Excellent feasibility was demonstrated, with 136 inquiries, 64 screened, and 22 participants (age 32 /C67) enrolled in under 3 months. Strong acceptability was dem-onstrated by a low dropout rate (5%) and high comfort/ tolerability ratings ( >50% at each visit). Our study provided proof-of-concept data that Y oga Nidra reduced acute anx- iety by 20%, and similar to other meditative practices, it altered electroencephalography-measured alpha power in the occipital lobe (11% increase) and reduced respiration rate by 12%, relative to control. Sleep was detectedduring/after Y oga Nidra, supporting our hypothesis that this practice may promote sleep. Lastly, participantsreported reductions in pain during/after Y oga Nidra, along with enhanced relaxation following Y oga Nidra (5% physical and 4% emotional) versus lying quietly (which decreasedrelaxation). Conclusion: Our results successfully demonstrated expected biological and psychological changes (decreased anxiety and respiration rate, increased alpha brainwaves, sleep production), suggesting Y oga Nidra may be a promis-ing tool to combat insomnia. This study provides evidence that repeating this work in larger populations would be valuable for confirming effects of Y oga Nidra on the ANS,sleep, pain, and anxiety. P05.43 First Impressions of Yoga Nidra: Investigating Personal Experience ThroughQualitative and Quantitative Measures Erica Sharpe 1, Angela Senders1, and Ryan Bradley1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: Erica Sharpe, esharpe@nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: In this study, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to explore participant experience of the guided meditation technique, Y oga Nidra, as it relates to sleep andrelaxation. Methods: Mood was assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) before and after a 30- minute Y oga Nidra practice (recorded by its creator, Satyananda Saraswati). Information on current insomnia(Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), sleep practices, and mind- body practices was collected at intake. Following Y oga Nidra, focus group interviews addressed domains of inquiry,including experiences before/during/after the practice; chal- lenges; and likelihood of adopting the practice for insomnia. Results: Our sample included 25 people, 70% females, age 41/C611 years, from the general population of Oregon and Hawaii. Pre-intervention ISI scores revealed 72% of ourpopulation to have at least subclinical insomnia (44% ofwhom showed moderately severe clinical insomnia) and 58% of the population had a regular mind-body practice (58% for >5 years). Average positive and negative affect were within 1 point of the instrument average before Y oga Nidra, and nearly a full standard deviation lower, after- wards (average change in PA and NA: /C022% and /C030%, respectively). Focus group discussions are still being ana- lyzed. Within the first 14 participants, 6 people discussed physical relaxation, 3 mental, and 8 emotional (reducedAbstracts 103irritation and anxiety). Eight participants mentioned a trance-like state or feeling of disconnect with the physical body. Six reported sleeping or nearing sleep. Self-reported challenges included lying still, understanding the recording,and interfering thoughts. Eleven people said they would bewilling to try the practice at home, for insomnia. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that Y oga Nidra appears tolerable for individuals suffering from insomnia and that it may produce mental, emotional, and physical relax-ation. Feedback from these focus groups has been used toinform the design of our other Y oga Nidra research studiesand will continue to inform future designs. P05.44 Are There Gender Differences Between Mindfulness and Stress? Upasna Singh1, Gabrielle Chin2, and Jeffrey 2Rowan University, Glassboro, New Jersey Contact: Upasna Singh, upasna.us1@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Mindfulness refers to nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment. Although more women practicemindfulness meditation in the United States, and previousstudies have found inverse associations between trait mind- fulness and stress, it is unclear if self-rated mindfulness or the link between trait mindfulness and stress differs bygender. Methods: Using an anonymous online survey study, we tested if Rowan University students (n \u00bc534, 65.0% females, 67.2% white, median age \u00bc19 years, range \u00bc18- 56) showed significant differences in average scores onself-report measures of trait mindfulness and stress acrossmales and females. We also tested whether the associationbetween trait mindfulness and stress differed by gender. We hypothesized that the correlation between mindfulness and stress in female students will be significantly stronger com-pared to male students, such that female students withhigher trait mindfulness also have lower stress. We usedthe Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R) to measure trait mindfulness and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) to measure stress. Independent samples ttests com- pared mean scores across gender. Pearson correlationswere used to test the association between mindfulnessand stress. Fisher's Z tested for differences between corre-lations across gender. Results: Males had a significantly higher average score in trait mindfulness ( P\u00bc.002) and females had a significantly higher average score in stress ( P<.001). Nonetheless,correlations between trait mindfulness and stress in males (r\u00bc/C0.643) and females ( r\u00bc/C0.697) were both strong, and did not significantly differ ( P\u00bc.303). Conclusion: Higher trait mindfulness strongly correlated with lower stress levels, but contrary to our prediction, thestrength of the relationship did not differ between genders.Therefore, mindfulness interventions, which are alreadyknown to both reduce stress and increase mindfulness,may be equally useful for male and female college stu-dents\u2014an important topic for future research. P05.45 Virtual Reality BonesTMand FeldenkraisVR Movements Compared to Core Stabilization Biofeedback and MotorControl Exercises: Comparative Effects onChronic Nonspecific Low Back Pain in anOutpatient Clinical Setting: A Dissertation Study and Randomized Controlled Trial Tim Sobie 1 1Saybrook University, Oakland, California Contact: Tim Sobie, tim@alliantcare.com Abstract Purpose: Chronic back problems continue to be a leading cause for disability in all of medicine and are the number 1symptom disorder for consulting integrative medicine prac-titioners. Feldenkrais VRpractitioners aim to clarify new functional interrelationships towards an improvedneuroplasticity-based change in the cognitive construct ofone's own background body schema. These phenomenahave also been found to clinically correlate to chronicpain through concurrent distortions in cortical representa-tion (of body schemas or maps). The Feldenkrais Method VR (FM) is a comprehensive approach being manifested throughmanual contact (FI VR) techniques and movement experiences (ATMVR) and has been anecdotally purported to improve symptoms and functions in Chronic Non-specific LowBack Pain (CNSLBP). However, there is little scientific evi-dence to support superior treatment efficacy. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared a novel Virtual Reality Bones TM/FeldenkraisVRMovement (VRB/FM) intervention against more conventional protocolsfor Core Stabilization Biofeedback/Motor Control Exercises(CSB/MCE). N \u00bc30 participants with CNSLBP were assigned to either the experimental group (VRB/FM @N\u00bc15) or the control group (CSB/MCE @ N \u00bc15). Known confounding biopsychosocial variables were con-trolled via stratified-random assignment on the FABQ.104 Global Advances in Health and MedicineTreatment outcome measures included VAS-PAIN, RMDQ, PSFS, and Timed Position Endurances T ests\u2014including Flexion/Extension Ratios at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8-weeks. Statistical analysis was conducted using Wilcoxon rank-sum and paired, 2-tailed ttest. Results: The VRB/FM group demonstrated greater improvement in all treatment outcome measures as com- pared to the matched CSB/MCE control group. Conclusion: This is the first RCT study to demonstrate that a Feldenkrais MethodVR-based approach being combined with Virtual Reality BonesTMcan be more efficacious for the treatment of CNSLBP than the current and accepted phys- ical medicine standard of isolated Core Stabilization Biofeedback/Training and Motor Control Exercises. Futuremultisite RCT studies with larger sample sizes are therefore recommended. P05.46 Lower Self-Efficacy Is Associated With Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms AmongBreast Cancer A Zick3 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 2Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 3University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan Contact: Deanne Tibbitts, dtibbitts@nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: Breast cancer survivors commonly experience posttreatment symptoms. Self-efficacy, the perceptions people hold about their own capabilities, promotes positive health behaviors and may affect whether individuals employsymptom management strategies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible associations between self-efficacy and posttreatment symptom severity in breast cancer sur- vivors. We hypothesized that lower self-efficacy would be associated with poorer sleep quality, greater fatigue and pain, and increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of baseline data (n\u00bc237) from a randomized clinical trial of acupressure for persistent cancer-related fatigue (NCT01281904). Separate multivariable linear regression models were used to inves- tigate the association between self-efficacy and each depen- dent variable (fatigue, sleep quality, pain severity and pain interference, depressive symptoms and anxiety), as mea-sured by the General Self-Efficacy scale (possible scores: 10-40), Brief Fatigue Inventory, Pittsburg Sleep QualityIndex, Brief Pain Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. Models were adjusted forage, race, income, breast cancer stage, and history of che-motherapy or hormone therapy. Results: Participants had a mean age of 59.8 /C69.7 years, were predominantly white (90.3%), were diagnosed withearly stage breast cancer (stage 0 or 1, 57.4%), and had amean General Self-Efficacy (GSE) score of 32 /C64.4, slightly higher than population norms. In adjusted models, GSEwas negatively associated with depressive was observed between GSE and fatigue, sleep quality, painseverity, or pain interference. Conclusion: Lower general self-efficacy is associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Longitudinalstudies should examine general self-efficacy as a predictor ofmental health outcomes after breast cancer. Clinical trials ofmind-body interventions for improving mental health inbreast cancer survivors should explore the role of self-efficacy. P05.47 Mindfulness Is Directly Related to Global Well-being and Self-Esteem and InverselyRelated to Perceived Stress and DepressiveSymptoms in Urban, Latino Adolescents Claudia Toledo-Corral 1and Marc Weigensberg2 1California State University Northridge, Northridge, California Southern Los Angeles, California Contact: Claudia Toledo-Corral, claudia.toledo-corral@csun.edu Abstract Purpose: Mindfulness shows association with psychological health in multiple populations but has been understudied inLatino adolescents. Therefore, our objective was to deter-mine cross-sectional associations between mindfulness andother measures of positive or negative mental health traits. Methods: Sample was composed of predominantly Latino adolescents (95% of n \u00bc190) recruited from several Los Angeles metropolitan area high schools (mean age: 14.7 /C6 0.6 years; 68% females). Mindfulness was assessed by aver-aging values of the 14-item Mindful Attention AwarenessScale for Children (Cronbach's alpha \u00bc0.874). Perceived stress and depressive symptomatology were assessed bysummation of the 14-item Cohen's Perceived Stress alpha \u00bc0.790) the 20-item for Epidemiological Studies- Depression Scale (Cronbach'salpha\u00bc0.785), respectively. Global well-being was assessed by the single-item Arizona Integrated Outcomes Scale, andAbstracts 105self-esteem by averaging values of the Rosenberg's 10-time self-esteem alpha \u00bc0.891). Analyses include unadjusted, bivariate Pearson correlations andlinear regression models, adjusted for a priori covariatesof age, sex, and ethnicity. Results: Mindfulness was directly related to positive mental health traits: addition, mindful- ness was inversely related to negative mental health traits:perceived stress ( r\u00bc/C0.587, P\u00bc.009). Conclusion: In a population of urban, predominantly Latino adolescents, trait mindfulness is associated withoverall psychological health based on multiple validatedmeasures. This suggests mindfulness-based interventionsmight be of use to improve psychological health in thisunderstudied population at risk of multiple healthdisparities. P05.48 A Comprehensive Integrative Medicine Program Improved Patient-ReportedOutcomes in an Academic Medical CenterOutpatient Cancer Setting E Blaine Tucker 1, Chris D'Adamo2, for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 2Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Laurel, Maryland Contact: E Blaine Tucker, bguelde@som.umaryland.edu Abstract Purpose: Previous research has shown that Integrative Medicine practices such as acupuncture, massage, yogatherapy, and therapeutic dialogue can provide nonpharma-cological management for cancer patients from diagnosis tosurvivorship. The University of Maryland School ofMedicine Center for Integrative Medicine's (CIM)Integrative Medicine for Cancer Care (IM4CC) outpatientprogram offers these modalities to encourage a new stan-dard of care for the cancer patient. Methods: Integrative Medicine Services were introduced to patients at various points along their cancer care. Thepatients who elected for treatments could select variousmodalities including acupuncture, massage, yoga therapy,and therapeutic dialog. Patient's pre- and posttreatmentsession anxiety, stress, fatigue, and pain scores were mea- sured, compiled, and analyzed. Results: At 6-month review, 354 patients were treated. Treatments provided included acupuncture (48 sessions), massage (111 sessions), therapeutic dialog (82 sessions), yoga therapy (109 sessions), and 4 declined services.Statistical analysis was performed using paired ttests and showed statistically significant improvements in anxiety, stress, and pain posttreatment session. Conclusion: Our results indicate that a comprehensive integrative medicine program featuring acupuncture, mas- sage, yoga therapy, and therapeutic dialog have benefitedcancer patients in an outpatient setting. Integrative services are ongoing, and data continue to be collected and analyzed. One-year program results will be available in January 2020. P05.50 Decreased Inflammation Following Mindfulness Training: Findings From aRandomized Waitlist-Controlled Trial ofYoung Adult Cancer Victorson Stacy Sanford3, and Thomas 1Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 2Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 3Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois Contact: David Victorson, d-victorson@northwestern.edu Abstract Purpose: T o examine the role of mindfulness training on changes in inflammatory responses (eg C-Reactive Protein [CRP] and Interleukin-6 [IL-6]) in a sample of young adult cancer survivors. Methods: Y oung adult cancer survivors were randomized to either 8-weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; n \u00bc42) or a wait list control group (n \u00bc44). T wo- thirds of the treatment group also received 8 additional weeks of weekly mindfulness-themed texts or email mes- sages. Whole blood spots were collected at baseline and16-weeks using a finger prick approach. Analysis of CRP and IL-6 was done with a validated ELISA protocol. Kruskal- Wallis nonparametric tests were used to estimate differen- ces in ranks among groups due to skewed distributions. Results: There were no statistically significant group differ- ences in CRP or IL-6 values at baseline, nor were any sig- nificant group differences in IL-6 detected at 16 weeks. However, there was a significant difference in CRP bystudy arm at the 16 week assessment (H(2) \u00bc6.896, P<.01), with a mean rank of 25.8 for mindfulness partici- pants, and 37.9 for wait list control participants. Baseline106 Global Advances in Health and Medicineand 16-week median CRP values for the treatment group were 1.146 and .48400, respectively, while control groupvalues were 1.321 and 1.490, respectively. Both groupsexperienced some normal attrition between baseline and 16 weeks. The treatment group lost 13 and the control group lost 12 individuals. Both groups had the samenumber of individuals with elevated CRP ( >3) drop out (n\u00bc4) in each group. Conclusion: This study examined the role of mindfulness training on 2 biomarkers of inflammation (CRP and IL-6) ina randomized wait-list controlled trial of MBSR with young adult cancer survivors. While IL-6 did not demonstrate sig- nificant group differences at the 16-week follow up, CRPdid, in favor of the treatment group. Interpretive cautionshould be exercised given the small sample size of this study. P05.51 Energy Medicine for Hand and Wrist Pain: A Large Pilot Study Helane Wahbeh1, Abstract Purpose: The objectives of this within-subject pilot study were to: (1) evaluate feasibility and acceptability; (2) assessappropriate measures for definitive trial; and (3) collect pre- liminary data on the effects of energy medicine for partic- ipants with hand and wrist pain. Methods: Energy practitioners were vetted to purportedly eliminate or reduce hand or wrist pain using energy medi-cine techniques. Participants completed baseline assess-ments and then received one 30-minute energy medicinesession. Measures were repeated immediately after the ses- sion and again 3 weeks later. Measures included subjective pain (Pain Numeric Rating Scale), sleep quality (SleepQuality Scale), overall well-being (Arizona (Cloninger Self-Transcendence Scale, Inclusion of Nature in Self, Inclusion of the Other in Self), as well as nerve con-duction velocity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and elec-trocardiography coherence between the practitioner andparticipants. Results: Seventeen practitioners completed sessions on 193 participants from April to September 2019. Subjective current pain significantly improved over all 3 sessions (repeated measures analysis of variance others ( P\u00bc.0045) improved. There was a decrease in heart rate ( P<.00005) and an increase in high frequency heart rate variability ( P\u00bc.009). There was an increase in overall coherence ( P\u00bc.05) and a trend in overall phase coherence ( P\u00bc.07) in the electrocardiography signal between the healer and the participant. The other meas-ures showed no significant changes. Conclusion: Feasibility and acceptability were confirmed and measure collection did not disrupt the healing environ-ment. While this pilot study was not powered to definitivelytest hypotheses, the results warrant further studies. P05.52 Outcome Expectations and Chronic Widespread Pain: Relationship BetweenPerceived Benefits of Exercise andCharacteristics of Patients With Fibromyalgia Michelle Park 1, Lori Lyn Price2, Raveendhara Bannuru2, and Chenchen Wang2 1Tufts University School of Boston, Massachusetts 2Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Chenchen Wang, cwang2@tuftsmedicalcenter.org Abstract Purpose: Despite the well-established benefits of exercise, implementation as a treatment for fibromyalgia remains achallenge. The outcome expectancy of a treatment is iden-tified as a determinant of adherence to and engagementwith exercise. While in chronic pain there is a correlation between greater motivation to exercise and higher out- come expectation for exercise (OEE), little is knownabout factors influencing OEE in fibromyalgia. We examinedthe associations between OEE (baseline and longitudinal)and demographic, physical, and psychosocial variables infibromyalgia patients. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of data obtained from a single-center, 52-week, randomized com-parative effectiveness trial of Tai Chi versus aerobic exercisefor participants with fibromyalgia (n \u00bc226). OEE was assessed with the 9-item Outcome Expectations forExercise Scale, where a higher value indicates strongerexpectation for a positive outcome. Univariate analyses assessing the relationship between participant characteris- tics (demographics, physical performance, outcome expec-tancy, self-efficacy, and other psychosocial factors) and highOEE (/C214) were performed using logistic regression.Abstracts 107Variables achieving a significance level of .10 were included in the multivariable model using backward selection. Results: Participants had mean age of 52 years and body mass index of 30 kg/m2, 92% were females, 61% were white, and 35% had a college degree. In univariate analyses, lowersymptom severity, higher self-efficacy, better mental health,better perceived health status, and better function wereassociated with higher OEE. Multivariable model revealedthat participants with and function (6-minute walk: OR \u00bc1.01, CI\u00bc1.00, were likely to have higher OEE. No signif- icant change in OEE was detected over the course of thestudy. Conclusion: Our study found that higher OEE was signif- icantly associated with greater self-efficacy and physical per-formance. Baseline OEE was found to be high and remainedstable for up to 1 year, showing promise for long-termexercise engagement in fibromyalgia patients. P05.53 Effective Recruitment Strategies in an Exercise Trial for Patients WithFibromyalgia Michelle Park 1, Lori Lyn Price2, Raveendhara Bannuru2, and University School of Boston, Massachusetts 2Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Chenchen Wang, cwang2@tuftsmedicalcenter.org Abstract Purpose: Recruitment of fibromyalgia populations into long-term clinical trials involving exercise interventions isa challenge. We evaluated the cost and randomizationyields of various recruitment methods used for a fibromy-algia trial in an urban setting. We also investigated differences in participant characteristics and exercise inter- vention adherence based on recruitment source. Methods: We recruited individuals with fibromyalgia in the greater Boston area to a clinical trial using a range of strat-egies. We used the American College of Rheumatology1990 and 2010 diagnostic criteria to determine eligibility.We compared cost and yield of 6 recruitment strategiesas well as described baseline characteristics, and attendancerates of participants across strategies. Results: Our recruitment resulted in 651 telephone pre- screens, 272 in-person screening visits, and 226 randomizedparticipants. Advertisements in a local commuter newspa-per were most effective, providing 113 of 226 randomiza-tion participants, albeit high cost ($212 per randomizedparticipant). Low cost recruitment strategies included clin- ical referrals and web advertisements, but they only provid- ed 32 and 16 randomization participants. Community-based strategies including advertisement and flyers recruited a more racially diverse participant sample than clinic referrals and mailing or calling patients. There was no observed dif- ference in attendance rates among participants recruited from various strategies. Conclusion: Newspaper advertisement was the most effective and most expensive method for recruiting large numbers of individuals with fibromyalgia in an urban setting. Community-based strategies recruited a more racially diverse cohort than clinic-based strategies. P05.54 The Cost of Health Resource Use in Patients With Fibromyalgia Ebuwa Igho-Osagie1, Raveendhara University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 2Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Chenchen Wang, cwang2@tuftsmedicalcenter.org Abstract Purpose: Few studies have assessed the economic burden of fibromyalgia syndrome in the United States, even though it is a common rheumatologic disorder. This study estimates annualized costs of fibromyalgia care from the health-care utilization data of a fibromyalgia clinical trial. We also assessed the association between cost and overall fibromy- algia impact severity. Methods: We analyzed secondary data from a 52-week randomized trial comparing T aichi and aerobic exercise therapy among 226 adults with fibromyalgia. Data on med- ication use, physician visits, and medical/surgical procedures in the 6 months prior to intervention commencement were collected using the validated Health Assessment Questionnaire. Medication costs were estimated by assign- ing average wholesale price from Micromedex Redbook, accounting for strength, number of pills, and frequency of use. Health facility utilization costs were estimated by assigning Medicare-derived reimbursement rates to doc- tors' visits', hospitalizations, and medical/surgical proce- dures. Fibromyalgia severity was established using revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores: mild 0 - <39; moderate 39 - <59; severe 59-100 (Bennett et al., 2009). A generalized linear model assessed the association between costs and fibromyalgia overall impact, adjusting for age, self-108 Global Advances in Health and Medicinereported pain, use of narcotics and antidepressants. All costs are in U.S. dollars, all P-values are 2-tailed. Results: In total, 225 participants completed the HAQ questionnaire. Baseline mean age was 51.7 /C612.1. 92.5% were females; 51% and 59% respectively antidepressant use. Mild, moderate, and severe fibro- myalgia categories were 18.64%, and $6949.59 /C6 mild, moderate, and severe fibro- myalgia. No statistical differences were noted with severity categories, but anti-depressant users had 2 times higherhealth-care costs ( P<.001). Conclusion: Fibromyalgia patients have annualized average health-care costs of $11, 274 (6-month cost multiplied by 2)and patients on anti-depressants use 2 times higher health-care resources than those not using antidepressants. P05.55 Group Outdoor Health Walks Using Activity Trackers: Measurement andImplementation Insight From a Mixed-Methods Feasibility Study Katherine Irvine 1, Melissa Marselle2, Alan Melrose3, and Sara Warber4 1James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, Scotland 2Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research, Leipzig, Germany 3Dinnet, Aboyne, Scotland 4University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan Contact: Sara Warber, swarber@umich.edu Abstract Purpose: Physical inactivity has recognized consequences for individual and public health. Outdoor walking groups aim to promote wellbeing or prevent chronic health con- ditions by modifying individual behavior. Motivation of phys-ically inactive adults to participate and measurement ofhealth-related benefits are ongoing challenges. Activitytrackers have the potential to promote increased physical activity and provide accurate measures of physical activity. Innovative measures from integrative medicine may beapplicable to health outcomes in nature-based interventionstudies. We present results of a feasibility study of a 12-week group outdoor health walk (GOHW) that incorpo- rated activity trackers and the use of a modified holistic health and wellbeing measure, the Self-Assessment ofChange (mSAC). Methods: A convergent mixed methods design was used to assess participant involvement, physical activity, andholistic health and wellbeing. Thirteen older adults (63- 81 years old, 76% females) were recruited to and remained involved throughout the program. Walker level data includ-ed: pre-post self-report questionnaires, daily step counts, and in-depth interviews. Program delivery information included: weekly checklists, written reflections from those delivering the intervention, stakeholder meeting minutes, and a final report. Results: Activity trackers did not entice doctors to sign- post walkers to the GOHW. Activity tracker usage compli- cated program delivery but motivated walkers to join the group and be more active\u2014through step count feedback and group interaction. By week 12, all participants metnational physical activity guidelines. Clinically significant changes in holistic health and wellbeing on the mSAC were observed for: sleeping well, experiencing vibrant senses, feeling energized, focused, joyful, calm, and whole. Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility of using activity trackers to motivate engagement in nature- based health walks in previously inactive individuals. The mSAC provides a promising measure for nature-basedhealth research. We provide a model as guidance for the design of future longitudinal large-scale studies of nature- based interventions such as group outdoor health walks. P05.56 Integrative Health Immersion Retreats in Nature: An Observational Study With 12-Month Follow-up Sara Warber 1, Kathryn Hayward2, and Bill Manahan3 1University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 2Odyssey Journey Private Practice, Mallorca, Spain 3University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Contact: Abstract Purpose: Integrative health immersion retreats (IHIR) in natural settings are increasingly common. Limited research suggests that these multimodal retreats improve quality of life and mood. This study examined short- and long-term effects of an immersion retreat in the California redwoods on holistic well-being and nature connection. Participants inthe 5-day IHIR learned self-care, stress reduction, creativity, and relationship-building. They ate plant-based meals, engaged in mind-body-spirit disciplines, and spent time in the natural environment. Methods: The 30 self-selected participants and staff (ages 28-77, 63% women) were coping with common life chal- lenges: job change, burnout, academic stress, divorce, mar- riage, starting a family, contemplating retirement, grapplingAbstracts 109with prejudice, emancipating, aging well. Outcomes includ- ed validated scales measuring aspects of nature connectionand bio-psycho-social-spiritual well-being, as well as shortwritten answers. Analysis included change over time on quantitative scales (pre-post, pre-3 months, pre-12 months) and thematic analysis of qualitative short answersat 12 months. Results: Postretreat, participants experienced less per- ceived stress and more positive emotions, social support,spiritual transcendence, and connection with nature.Participants endorsed vibrant senses, feeling empowered, and having the ability to let go and forgive. Feelings of con- nection, calmness, joy, wholeness, and balance alsoimproved. At 3 months, participants still experiencedimprovement in perceived stress, emotional support, feelingmore whole, and balanced. At 12 months, perceived stress remained significantly improved, as were both positive and negative emotions, emotional support, and 15/16 items onthe holistic Self-Assessment of Change scale. At 12 months,participants remembered the power of the natural setting,their experience of community, their self-growth, and the \"great food.\" They felt that the retreat had changed them personally. Conclusion: Our results suggest that IHIRs have long- lasting effects on the perceptions of stress, emotions, emo-tional support, and holistic well-being of generally healthyindividuals. These results pave the way for more rigorousrandomized controlled trials of integrative health immer- sion retreats. P05.57 Yoga for State Anxiety Reduction in University Students Kristen Mackie1, Susan Kasser1, Jeremy Sibold1, and Karen Westervelt1 1University Burlington, Vermont Contact: Karen Westervelt, karen.westervelt@med.uvm.edu Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a 1-hour yoga class on immediate measures of state anxiety and affect within a population of universitystudents. Methods: Students at a medium-sized university in the northeast region of the United States voluntarily attendeda 1-hour yoga flow class put on by the university's campusrecreation department. Participants completed surveys, measuring their anxiety and effect, both before and imme- diately following the class. Participants self-reported onboth the State T rait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Positiveand Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). Demographical and related questions were included on the initial questionnaire. Results: Fifty-nine students participated, from various aca- demic years and majors. Results revealed that the yogaintervention significantly reduced students' state anxietyby 25%, improved their positive affect by 21%, anddecreased their negative affect by 25%. In addition, 62% ofparticipants reported relaxation or stress reduction thegreatest benefit from taking the class. Conclusion: In conclusion, this research demonstrated that participation in a single yoga class immediatelyimproved affect and reduced anxiety, thus providing ahealthy option for anxiety management in universitystudents. P05.59 Psychological Mechanisms Driving Stress Resilience in Mindfulness Training: ARandomized Controlled Trial Brian Chin 1, Emily Lindsay2, Carol Greco2, Kirk Brown3, Joshua Smyth4, Aidan Wright2, and David Creswell1 1Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 2University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 3Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 4Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania Contact: Brian Chin, bnchin@andrew.cmu.edu Abstract Purpose: Mindfulness interventions have been shown to reduce stress; however, the mechanisms driving stress resil- ience effects are not known. Mindfulness interventions aim to teach individuals how to: (a) use attention to monitorpresent moment experiences with (b) an attitude of accep-tance and equanimity. A randomized controlled dismantlingtrial (randomized controlled trial [RCT]) was conducted totest the prediction that the removal of acceptance skillstraining would eliminate stress reduction benefits of a mind-fulness intervention. Methods: This preregistered RCT randomly assigned stressed community adults to 1 of 3 conditions: (a)Monitor and Accept (MA) mindfulness training, a standard8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) inter-vention that provided explicit instruction in developing bothmonitoring and acceptance skills; (b) Monitor Only (MO) mindfulness training, a well-matched 8-week MBSR inter- vention that taught monitoring skills only; or (c) NoTreatment (NT) control. Stress and nonjudgment weremeasured using ecological momentary assessment (EMA)for 3 days at baseline and 3 days at postintervention.110 Global Advances in Health and MedicineResults: Consistent with predictions, MA participants increased in nonjudgment and decreased in both stress rat-ings and the proportion of assessments that they reportedexperiencing feelings of stress in daily life, relative to bothMO and NT participants. Conclusion: This RCT provides one of the first experi- mental tests of the mechanisms linking mindfulness inter-ventions with stress resilience. These findings suggest thatacceptance skills training may be a necessary active ingredi-ent and support the value of integrating acceptance skillstraining into stress reduction interventions. P05.60 Optimal Format to Assess Intervention Fidelity in Mindfulness Research Erin Floyd1, Shelley Adler2, Patricia Moran2, Wendy and Frederick Hecht1 of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 2UCSF Osher Center, San Francisco, California 3Bangor University, Bangor, UK 4Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island Contact: Erin Floyd, erin.floyd@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Intervention fidelity is a critical issue in Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) research. The fieldhas been limited by the absence of tools to evaluate teacherskill, a potentially central element of intervention fidelity.The MBI: T eacher Assessment Criteria (MBI:TAC) wasdeveloped to measure teacher competency and is emergingas an important method of measuring MBI teacher profi-ciency. T o date, the MBI:TAC has been conducted withvideo recordings, which have important logistical limitationsand possible Hawthorne effects in the research setting. Wesought to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining reliable MBI:TAC ratings using audio-only recordings instead. Methods: MBI teachers trained in using MBI:TAC rated audio-only recordings of Mindfulness-Based StressReduction (MBSR) sessions that had been previously ratedusing video. We calculated absolute agreement intraclasscorrelation (ICC) coefficients to assess interrater reliabilityfor audio ratings and compared them to the ICCs of videoratings. We also interviewed 4 raters individually to assesstheir experience rating sessions recorded in both formats.We conducted qualitative thematic analysis of interviews; 2team members independently coded transcripts and jointlyreconciled coding differences. The full team identified keythemes.Results: Eight MBI:TAC raters provided an average of 1.7 ratings of 18 teachers recorded with audio. For the 6 MBI: TAC domains, very preliminary individual rater ICC coeffi- cients adjusted for session number ranged from 0.47 to 0.72. Raters emphasized the importance of visual informa- tion, particularly when assessing less experienced teachers. There was no consensus whether raters' perceived accura- cy was lower when using audio versus video. Some raters posited that audio sessions seemed more difficult than video due to less experience using this format. Conclusion: ICC coefficients were generally similar to those obtained with video recordings, though further data are needed. Qualitative data suggest that raters found audio-only ratings more challenging. Audio-only recordings may be feasible for MBI:TAC ratings. P05.61 T emporal Dynamics of Daily Life Stress, Affect, and Several Affect RegulationStrategies, in Patients With (Chronic)Mood and Anxiety Disorders Before andAfter a Mindful Yoga with chronic mood and anxiety disor- ders experience many life stressors and are more reactive to these stressors. Mindful yoga represents an intervention that might reduce stress reactivity. However, little is known about the different affect regulation processes by which mindful yoga might reduce stress reactivity. Methods: In this study, we examined within-person tem- poral associations between stressful experiences, affect and 4 potential affect regulation processes: rumination, fear of emotion, mindfulness, and body awareness, before and after a mindful yoga intervention. Using experience sampling methodology, 12 patients with chronic mood and anxiety disorders completed 5 daily assessments for 15 days before and after a 9-week mindful yoga intervention. Autoregressive moving average models were used to assess mean-level change from pre-to-postintervention and vector autoregressive models to assess change in the temporal associations.Abstracts 111Results: We found a positive change in affect balance before and after the training in 9 out of 12 participants. Also, for most individuals we found positive changes in the proposed affect regulation processes from pre-to-postintervention. Of the processes, fear of emotionshowed changes from pre-to-postintervention for mostindividuals, followed by mindfulness, body awareness, and then rumination. Considering the dynamic relationships between stress, the 4 proposed affect regulation processesand affect balance, we found individual differences in whichthe pathways changed and how they changed. Conclusion: T o our knowledge, this is the first study to examine processes of change within a person before andafter a mindful yoga intervention. In general, individualsseem to improve with regard to affect balance and theaffect regulation processes. However, in the context of daily life stress, change seems to be difficult and complex, and it remains difficult for many individuals to preserve abetter affect balance with regard to the proposed affectregulation processes. P05.62 The Interpersonal Mindfulness Program for Health-care Onnen, Drenthe, Purpose: The Dutch Center for Integrative Psychiatry (CIP) provides mindfulness and compassion training forpatients and health-care professionals since 2004. In 2018,a new Interpersonal Mindfulness Program (IMP) was devel- oped and offered to mental health-care workers. This pro- gram presents a methodical way for those who have alreadyfollowed a mindfulness training, to further deepen mindfulpresence, empathy, and compassion in the interpersonaldomain. We examined the feasibility of this program and its effects on mindfulness, self-compassion, empathy, stress, and professional quality of life compared to a control group. Methods: The training consisted of 9 weekly 2.5-hour ses- sions and daily home practice (45-60 min). T wenty-five par- ticipants (mean age 51.4 years (SD 10.8) with mindfulnessexperience participated in the IMP training, and 22 controls(mean age 47.5 years (SD 10.4) were recruited. Participantsand controls completed self-report questionnaires before and directly after the IMP training concerning levels ofmindfulness, self-compassion, empathy, stress, and quality of life. Participants also completed an evaluation form about the training.Results: On 3 measures, self-compassion, empathy, and compassion fatigue, the IMP training had a significantlyeffect in a positive direction, with partial eta squaredvalues of 0.119, 0.109, and 0.104, respectively, meaning effect sizes between medium and large. On the FFMQ sub- scale \"nonreactivity to inner experience\" and on the SCSsubscale \"isolation,\" the training had a significantly positiveeffect with partial eta squared values of 0.093 and 0.088, respectively, meaning medium to large effect sizes. No effect was observed on mindfulness, stress, and compassionsatisfaction. Satisfaction with training was 8.2 (SD 0.7) and with teachers 8.4 (SD 0.7). Five participants reported some mild adverse reactions. Conclusion: IMP appears feasible for health-care profes- sionals and seems to induce positive effects. Further research on the effectiveness and mechanisms of changeof the IMP training in larger samples is needed. P05.63 Interprofessional Resilience, Work Engagement, Perceived Stress, and Rates of Burnout Improved via a System-wide Mindfulness Offering at a Large Academic Medical Center Maryanna Klatt1, Amanda Blake2, Gabram2 Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio 2The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 3The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Maryanna maryanna.klatt@osumc.edu Abstract Purpose: Health-care provider (HCP) burnout clinician job title and role, and thus, intervention strategiesdesigned to address burnout need to be interprofessional inboth scope and practice. This research tested pre-post changes in measures of burnout, resilience, perceived stress, and work engagement for interprofessional HCP fac-ulty and students participating in Mindfulness in Motion (MIM), a novel 8-week multimodal evidenced-based inter- vention delivered onsite. Methods: Our team expanded a Graduate Medical Education (GME) pilot of MIM to target interprofessional resiliency within our academic health center by bringing112 Global Advances in Health and Medicinetogether resident physicians, resident chaplains, attending physicians, medical center faculty, and hospital administra- tive/managerial clinical staff. Results: The 2017 to 2019 faculty/student chaplains, 5% clinical 26% nonclinical These cohortsdemonstrated significant 16.1% reduction whilesignificantly increasing resilience scores pre/post 8-weekintervention. T otal burnout was determined by scores onthe subscales of emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonaliza- tion (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). By 8-week intervention end,there was a highly significant decrease in the in the emo-tional exhaustion ( P<.0001) and depersonalization score (P<.0001), with highly significant increase in the personal accomplishment ( P<.0001) MBI subscales as compared to baseline. In addition, resilience, as measured by the ConnorDavidson Resiliency Scale (CDRS) significantly increased(P<.0001). There was also a significant increase (P<.0001) in the total Utrecht Work Engagement Score (UWES) and a highly significant decrease in scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; P<.0001). Conclusion: MIM significantly reduced burnout and per- ceived stress, for interprofessional faculty and staff, while increasing resilience and work engagement in a large aca- demic health-care system. This study illustrates the poten-tial for increasing the health and wellness of trainees, faculty,and staff, via this interprofessional endeavor, teaching effec-tive mindfulness skills, and strategies. P05.64 A Lens Into the Psycho-social Changes Resulting From Mindfulness Programmingfor Health-care Professionals: Beth Steinberg2, and Maryanna Klatt1 Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio 2The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio Abstract Purpose: After several years of implementing Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) programming in a large Academic Medical Center, quantitative results consistently showed significantchanges in burnout, perceived stress, resiliency, and workengagement by the end of the 8-week intervention. Yet,self-compassion was the significant qualitative change most voiced by research participants. Methods: T o test which (if any) of these changes preceded the others, we compared interprofessional health-care pro-fessionals on these outcome variables between 2 cardiacsurgical critical and progressive care units with similarpatient acuity, providing MIM to one unit (n \u00bc8), while other unit (n \u00bc24) served as control. Assessments of per- ceived stress, burnout, work engagement, resilience, self-compassion, and self-transcendence were performed1 week before the start of the 8-week intervention,1 week after, and at 9 months. Measures utilized: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), UtrechtWork Engagement Scale (UWES), Self-Compassion Scale(SCS), and Self-Transcendence Scale (STS). Results: One week after the 8-week intervention, there was a highly significant change in the intervention group total self-compassion score ( P<.01) compared with the control unit, yet no other significant changes occurred. In-person, monthly mindfulness booster sessions were heldfor the intervention group with the intention of sustainingany benefits garnered by the health-care professionals. At 9months after the study began, there were significantimprovements in total work engagement ( P\u00bc.02), with highly significant sustained improvements in self-compassion for the inter- vention group compared to controls. Conclusion: Results from this study indicate that for some highly stressed groups of health-care professionals, self-compassion may be the first variable to change: it may pre- cede other important changes and that for the other benefits of mindfulness training to occur, longer, sustainedmindfulness training may be needed to render changes typ-ically seen in 8-week mindfulness interventions. P05.65 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Recurrent Depression: Effectiveness in a Real-World Health-care Setting andConsiderations for Implementation Sophie Lazarus 1, Joshua Joseph1, and Cheryl Carmin1 1The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Sophie Lazarus, sophie.lazarus@osumc.edu Abstract Purpose: Depression is a highly prevalent and recurrent mental health disorder (Kessler, 2003). Mindfulness-basedcognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, & T easdale,Abstracts 1132013) is an evidence-based group treatment that utilizes eastern meditative practices and cognitive-behavioral prin- ciples to treat recurrent depression. The treatment aims to provide participants with the understanding and skills to recognize and free themselves from patterns ofdepression-related negative thinking. The treatment has been shown through multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce depressive symptoms and risk for future depressive relapse (Kuyken et al., 2008) as well as symp- toms of anxiety (Hofmann et al., 2010). Despite this, little research is being conducted at later stages of the transla- tional journey, namely effectiveness in real-world health- care settings. Real-world mental health services are normal- ly designed to address the needs of patients experiencing more acute difficulties and may be unable to uphold the stringent exclusion criteria of RCTs. Methods: The current analyses utilized pre- and posttreat- ment data from 5 cohorts of MBCT participants and aimed to examine the effectiveness of MBCT implemented in a large Mid-Western academic medical center. Patients with a history of depression and the absence of any comorbid disorders that would significantly interfere with treatment (eg, primary substance abuse, psychosis, or bipolar I) were referred from outpatient providers within a large academic medical center. Results: Repeated measures analyses of variance for treat- ment completers (N \u00bc29) revealed significant improve- ments in depression, anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and flourishing over the 8 weeks of treatment (all P<.05). Furthermore, decreases in depression were related to pro- posed mechanisms of change of increased mindfulness (r\u00bc/C0.59, P<.001) and self-compassion ( r\u00bc/C0.36, P<.001). Decreases in anxiety were unrelated to these constructs (all P>.05). Conclusion: These findings have important implications for implementation of MBCT within real-world health-care settings. Considerations related to comorbid anxiety and program development will be discussed. P05.66 Sociodemographic Analysis of Yoga for Chronic Low Back Pain Adhana McCarthy1, Erik Groessl1,2, and Lin Liu1,2 1University of California San Diego, San Diego, California 2VA San Diego, La Jolla, California Contact: Adhana McCarthy, a3mccarthy@ucsd.edu Abstract Purpose: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a common con- dition for which clinical guidelines recommend usingeffective nonpharmacological treatments instead of opioids. Y oga for cLBP has substantial evidence supporting its use and possible differential effects by gender and age. A recent clinical trial with 150 military veterans found that yoga par-ticipants reported significantly greater improvements in dis- ability, pain and other outcomes. We explored whether sociodemographic subgroups responded differently to yoga in that trial. Methods: Disability was measured with the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) as a continuous and binary variable (30% score reduction is considered clinicallysignificant). Patient characteristics (gender, age, and \"homeless in the last 5 years\") that were significantly asso- ciated with reduced RMDQ were entered into the overall model in addition to yoga group assignment. Results: Y oga group assignment remained significant throughout. Gender was marginally significant when added to the model ( P\u00bc.062). History of homelessness was not significant. Age was significant ( P\u00bc.024) and gender became a less relevant predictor when age entered the model (P\u00bc.167). The change in RMDQ score was 0.008 lower for each additional year of age. Women were significantly younger than men in the overall sample (48.0 vs 55.5,P\u00bc.002) and trended toward a higher rate of clinical improvement in the whole sample (56% vs 36%, P\u00bc.091) and in the yoga group (77% vs 51%, P\u00bc.090). Conclusion: Y ounger age, and to some extent female gender, were associated with a higher rate of clinical improvement in disability after a yoga intervention for vet- erans with cLBP . Future research should examine thesevariables and examine whether these relationships are influ- enced by veteran or nonveteran status. P05.67 Effectiveness of App-Based Relaxation Exercises in Patients With Chronic Humboldt-Universit \u20acat zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany 2Berlin Institute of Health, Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Berlin, Germany 3Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Zurich and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland Contact: Daniel Pach, daniel.pach@charite.de114 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: The aim of this pragmatic randomized trial was to evaluate whether app-based relaxation exercises includ- ing audio-based autogenic training, mindfulness meditation, or guided imagery are more effective in the reduction ofchronic neck pain (NP) than usual care alone. Methods: Participants aged 18 to 65 years, owning a smartphone, having chronic neck pain and a previousweek's average neck pain intensity /C214 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) were randomized into either an inter- vention group practicing app-based relaxation or a usualcare group. In both groups, follow-up data were collected through app-based diaries and surveys. The primary out- come was the mean NP intensity during the first 3 monthsbased on daily measurements. Secondary outcomes includ- ed NP based on weekly measurements, pain acceptance, neck pain-related stress, sick leave days, pain medicationintake, and adherence measured until 6-month follow-up. For primary analysis, analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline NP intensity was used.Results: Participants in both groups (intervention n \u00bc110, control 110, mean age 38.9 /C611.3 (SD)), baseline NP of 5.7/C61.4) showed a decrease in mean NP during the first 3 months (intervention 4.1 95%CI [3.8, 4.4] and control 3.8 [3.5 4.1]). For the primary outcome, no significant differ- ence between groups could be observed during the first3 months (group difference 0.3 [ /C00.2, 0.7], P\u00bc.231). Also secondary outcome measures did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The number of participants practic-ing exercises at least 10 minuntes per week dropped from 106 in week 1 (mean exercises 5.7 /C62.9) to 38 in week 12 (3.4/C62.4), and to 30 in week 26 (3.0 /C61.7). Conclusion: The study app was not effective in reducing chronic NP and keeping participants engaged in exercising. Future studies should elaborate whether an app thatincludes a more detailed behavioral change strategy, infor- mation, and visual elements would be more effective in a self-care setting. P05.68 Imagine HEALTH: Changes in Physical Activity and Dietary Intake Following a 12-Week, Cluster RCT Lifestyle InterventionUsing Guided Imagery to Reduce Obesity-Related Disease Risk in Urban, Predominantly Latino Adolescents Marc Weigensberg 1, Quintilia A Angeles, California Contact: Marc Weigensberg, weigensb@usc.edu Abstract Purpose: We previously showed that individually delivered guided imagery (GI) improved physical activity (PA) out- comes in obese Latino adolescents. The objective is to determine primary lifestyle behavioral outcomes (PA and dietary intake) from a RCT lifestyle intervention using group GI. Methods: 232 high school (154 4 intervention arms: (1) nonintervention control (C); (2) lifestyle education (LS); (3) LS \u00festress reduction GI (SRGI); and (4) LS \u00felifestyle behavior GI (LBGI). Group lifestyle education class sessions (2/week) and GI sessions (1/week, conducted in the facilitated group process of \"council\") were held after school for 12 weeks. Primary Outcomes: change in accelerometer- measured time spent in sedentary behavior and PA and dietary intake (diet recall), adjusting for overweight status. Statistical analyses: (1) intention to treat (ITT), across- group differences in mean change at 12 weeks; and (2) ad hoc: proportion of individuals showing any improvement in PA measures in each group. Results: The ITT analysis showed no significant between- group differences in mean PA or dietary outcomes. For C, LS, SRGI, LBGI, respectively, percent of subjects who increased time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA was 22, 50, 39, 12 ( P\u00bc. 013); percent of subjects who decreased time spent in sedentary behavior was 33, 62, 54, 29 (P\u00bc.035). Adherence to protocol (defined as attendance of 75% of intervention sessions) was poor in all groups. Conclusion: There were significant between group differ- ences in the proportion of subjects who decreased seden- tary activity and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, favoring the SRGI and LS groups. The null findings of the intervention in ITT analysis are difficult to interpret given poor session attendance, generally due to multiple, conflicting after-school activities. Further analyses are needed to detect potential subgroups helped by the inter- vention, as well as results at longer term follow-up.Abstracts 115P05.69LB Improvements in Well-being and Pain Experience Among Adults With Migraine With Mindfulness: Qualitative Results From a Randomized and Rebecca Wells1 1Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina 2UC-San Diego, San Diego, California 3Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Rebecca Wells, rewells@wakehealth.edu Abstract Purpose: As migraine medications are often limited by inefficacy, side effects, and cost, a demand for nondrug treatments exists. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction(MBSR) teaches mindfulness meditation/yoga over 8 weekly classes with a structured curriculum. Since stress is the most commonly reported migraine trigger,MBSR may be especially helpful as a nondrug intervention. The objective is to elucidate potential mechanisms of how mindfulness impacts the pain experience and quality of life inadults with migraine through structured qualitative analyses. Methods: We conducted a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of MBSR versus headache (HA) educationfor migraine. Prior to randomization, participants were trained with quantitative sensory testing to distinguish pain intensity and unpleasantness. Of 96 randomized, 71participants (MBSR n \u00bc33; HA education n \u00bc38; 7 cohorts) completed semistructured interviews after classes ended. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Theresearch team (1) developed transcript summaries using a standardized template based on the interview guide with 12 key domains; (2) aggregated data into a matrix organizedby key domains and cohort; and (3) resolved discrepancies and discussed emerging patterns weekly. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that most MBSR par- ticipants reported: (1) shifting out of \"auto-pilot\" mode in daily life; (2) decreased reactivity to stress in daily life, rela- tionships, and with migraines; (3) attenuation of painunpleasantness; and (4) greater self-awareness and self- compassion. Additional MBSR benefits included group ben- efit with decreased migraine stigma and sense of isolation;use of mindfulness as an acute migraine treatment; disrup- tion of maladaptive patterns of thinking; of migraine; positive lifestyle changes; and clinical migraineimprovements.Conclusion: Qualitative interviews provide rich insights into MBSR experiences of participants with migraine.Mindfulness meditation may meaningfully improve well-being, quality of life, and perception of migraine pain and pain experience with less stigma. Future research will help clarify factors that contribute to mindfulness benefits. P05.70LB Meditative Interventions and Immune Function: A Systematic Review Hulett 1, Price-Blackshear1, Angela Ann Bettencourt1 1University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 2University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina Contact: Steven Pratscher, spratscher@mail.missouri.edu Abstract Purpose: The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effects of meditativeinterventions on immune function. The secondary purpose was to examine potential moderating effects of the type of immune measure, intervention, and sample. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were searched through June 2019 for meditative interventions with immune measures. Studies were eligible if the inter- vention included a formal meditation component and ameasure of immunity or cell-aging. Of the identified 1131relevant reports, 84 articles met eligibility. Publication bias and risk of bias were assessed. Results: A total of 6461 participants were represented in the meta-analysis. Overall, meditative interventionsincreased immune function (g \u00bc.25); this effect was larger than that for control conditions (g \u00bc.03). For the medita- tive interventions, the average effect sizes were significantfor all sample types and meditative intervention types, andthe magnitudes of these effect sizes were similar. An exam-ination of categories of immune function revealed that, although the average effect size was not significant for leu- kocytes, significant effect sizes were revealed for inflamma-tory andNF-jB. A meta-regression revealed that longer in immune func- tion, Z\u00bc2.40, P\u00bc.02. Conclusion: Meditative interventions appear to offer favorable immune benefits among healthy individuals and those with physical and psychological disorders. Whereas immune benefits were observed with all types of meditativeintervention, the meta-analyses suggest different types of116 Global Advances in Health and Medicinemeditative interventions may exert different effects on spe- cific types of immune functions. Meta-regression suggeststhat longer meditative interventions are associated withgreater effects on immune function. Future meditative inter-vention research is warranted to examine this dose-response question with regard to the duration needed to influence immune biomarkers. P05.71LB A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Meditation and Music Listening Versus Enhanced Usual Care for Subjective Cognitive Decline: Feasibility and Preliminary Efficacy Kim Innes1 1West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia Contact: Kim Innes, kinnes@hsc.wvu.edu Abstract Purpose: Findings from our recent RCT suggest that med- itation and music listening (ML) improve cognitive and psy-chosocial outcomes in older adults with subjective cognitivedecline (SCD), although the lack of a usual care group has limited conclusions. In this pilot RCT, we assessed the fea- sibility and preliminary efficacy of a simple Kirtan Kriyameditation (KK) and ML versus an enhanced usual care(ECU) program in older adults experiencing SCD, astrong predictor of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Forty participants with SCD were randomized 1:1:2 to a KK, ML, or EUC program. KK and ML participantswere asked to practice 12 minutes/day for 3 months; EUCparticipants were given a comprehensive educational packetregarding healthy aging and strategies for improving/main-taining brain health. At baseline and 3 months, we measuredmemory and cognitive functioning, stress, mood, sleep- quality, and health-related quality of life (QOL) using well-validated instruments. Feasibility was assessed usingmeasures of retention, adherence, treatment expectancies,and participant satisfaction, as well as information from dailylogs and exit questionnaires. KK and ML groups demon-strated similar changes in cognitive and psychosocial meas-ures and were pooled for analysis of outcomes. Results: Thirty-two participants (80%) completed the study, with retention highest in the EUC group ( P<.05). KK/ML participants performed an average of 6.0 (0.4) prac-tice sessions/week, and EUC participants, a mean of 7.5(0.6) brain health activities/week. Treatment expectancies were similar in all groups. Despite limited power and very active engagement by the EUC group, participants assignedto KK or ML showed greater improvements in memoryfunctioning (Memory Functioning Questionnaire, Ps/C20.025), cognitive performance (Trail Making T est-B), per- ceived stress, QOL, and multiple domains of mood(Ps<.09) relative to the EUC group. Conclusion: Findings of this pilot study suggest incorpora- tion of an EUC program is feasible and acceptable, and fur-ther support the promise of meditation and music listeningfor enhancing cognitive function and psychosocial status inadults with SCD. P05.72LB Interoceptive Awareness and Central Sensitization in Chronic Low Back Pain Dana Dharmakaya Colgan1, Dan Klee1, and Barry Oken1 1Oregon Health Portland, Oregon Contact: Dana Dharmakaya Colgan, colgand@ohsu.edu Abstract Purpose: In approximately 25%-55% of nonspecific chron- ic low back pain (NScLBP) patients, central sensitization is acausal mechanism in the development and maintenance ofpatient-reported pain. Central sensitization is defined as apersistent state of high reactivity in the central nervoussystem that amplifies the pain experience and results inpain hypersensitivity. Central sensitization in NScLBPpatients is modulated by in interocep-tive awareness. Maladaptive forms of aware-ness, such as pain and kinesiophobia, predictcentral sensitization by activating the sympathetic nervoussystem, which, in turn, contributes to and sustains centralsensitization. Less is known about the effects of skillfulinteroceptive awareness. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 20 adults (7 NScLBP and 13 healthy controls) completed self-report measures ofclinical pain, symptoms of central sensitization, and intero-ceptive awareness. Participants then underwent an evokedpain paradigm while time-locked EEG activity was recorded.Three blocks of 30 electrical stimuli were applied on thenondominant hand. Lack of habituation in the amplitude ofpain-related evoked potentials following the 3 blocks indi-cated central sensitization. Nonparametric correlations andlinear regression analyses were Among NScLBP patients, self-reported symptoms of central sensitization were positively associated with paindisability ( r\u00bc.86) and pain intensity ( r\u00bc.83), and with factors on ( r\u00bc./C074) and Body Listening ( r\u00bc/C0.72). Further, when controlling for sex and chronic pain status, a regression analysis revealed that Attentional Regulation ( P\u00bc.05) predict the presence of cor- tical pain habituation, indicating central sensitization. Conclusion: Skillful interoceptive awareness was inversely associated with both self-reported symptoms and a physio- logical measurement of central sensitization. T argetingskillful interoceptive awareness may be an important mech- anism in treating NScLBP . P05.73LB A Qualitative Study of the Acceptability and Feasibility of Yoga Among Women inSubstance Use Disorder Recovery Margaret Gorvine 1, Nickolas D Zaller1, Cari J Clark2, Tiffany F Haynes1, and Sarah A Marshall1 1University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 2Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia Contact: Margaret Gorvine, mmgorvine@uams.edu Abstract Purpose: While there is preliminary evidence for the effec- tiveness of trauma-informed yoga practices among womenwho have experienced violence, less in known about how best to deliver yoga to women in substance use disorder (SUD) recovery (eg contextual factors to consider in inter-vention development, as well as women's preferences for self-care practices). Understanding the lived experience of women in SUD recovery as well as perceptions and expe- riences of yoga among women in recovery aids in contex- tualizing intervention development and implementation. Methods: This formative, exploratory study included 17 semi-structured interviews informed by the Whole Health Resilience model in a qualitative research design. The studyfocused on 8 settings that deliver substance use treatment and/or recovery services (eg hospital, community-based treatment centers, peer-support groups such as NarcoticsAnonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous), as well as prison re-entry programming. Additional participants were recruited online through a yoga teacher's group and through snowball referrals. Demographic and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) questionnaires were administered.The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed via hybrid thematic analysis. Results: The interest in yoga for self-care in SUD recovery was positive (from moderate interest \"I wouldn't mind trying it\" to strong interest \"I'm really interested in it\"). Overall, themes developed included facilitators to yogauptake such as beginner classes, motivation, and reassur- ance that body type (eg, weight) and physical injuries (eg, spinal injuries, knife wounds, among others) would be addressed. Novel findings included perceptions of yoga'sbenefits for stress reduction, yet not for reduced craving. Barriers included environmental factors such as money, time, and caretaking responsibilities. There was mixed evi-dence of trauma-informed yoga teaching practices in the community settings. Conclusion: Further research of trauma-informed mind- body practices for women in SUD recovery is warranted, for not only SUD and trauma outcomes but also in the interest of culturally adapting interventions in local settings. P05.74LB mHealth Platform for Self-Management of Hypertension: A Prashast1, and Niina Haas2 1University of Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 2BrightOutcome, Buffalo Grove, Illinois Contact: Paula Gardiner, paula.gardiner@umassmed.edu Abstract Purpose: Background: Hypertension affects millions of Americans. OWL-H (Our Whole Lives for Hypertension) is a mobilehealth (mHealth) web-based platform that teaches mindful- ness and evidence-based strategies to improve self- management of hypertension. The primary goal of thispilot was to evaluate the feasibility of OWL-H and cooking classes in the self-management of hypertension. Methods: We conducted a pre-post intervention study with 2 cohorts to assess the feasibility of a 9-module life-style modification program and mind-body activities (body scan, meditation), accompanied by 3 cooking classes over 8 weeks among patients with hypertension. Outcome data,collected at baseline and 8 weeks, included demographics, usage and attendance, self-efficacy in home measurement of blood pressure, and satisfaction in using OWL-H for hyper-tension self-management. In the statistical analysis, we used descriptive statistics and qualitative methods. Results: Among the enrolled 24 participants, the median age was 58 years, 88% were females, and 54% reported a household income of less than $30 000. Participants who were not confident in taking their blood pressure reducedfrom 8.3% at baseline to 4.8% on follow-up at 8 weeks. Outof 9 modules, the average number of modules accessed was 4( m i n\u00bc0; max\u00bc9). Out of 24 participants, 11 attended all 3 cooking classes, while 3 attended only 1 class. Of the118 Global Advances in Health and Medicineparticipants that logged on to OWL-H, the minimum com- pleted mind-body practices was 0, the maximum was 40,and the mean was 7. Eighty-three percent of participantsreported that they were \"Very Satisfied\" with using OWL-Hto help manage their hypertension. Conclusion:Conclusions: The mHealth platform for hypertension self- management, OWL-H, and accompanying cooking classesare a potential tool to educate patients on factors thatcan help reduce their hypertension. P05.75LB State Mindfulness, Trait Mindfulness, and Response to Mindfulness Training: Is There a Genomic Signature? Jeffrey Greeson, greeson@rowan.edu Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to advance the emerging field of \"Mindfulomics\" by testing whether thereare functional genomic signatures of state mindfulness, traitmindfulness, and response to mindfulness training. Methods: Open trial of an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, using a pretest posttestdesign, with 30 healthy adults. Next-generation sequencing(Illumina RNAseq) using whole blood samples was used toassess a targeted panel of 168 genes involved in regulatingstress and inflammatory-related cell signaling pathways.State mindfulness was operationalized by comparing a 15-min mindful breathing task to a 15-min quiet rest period with eyes closed. T rait mindfulness was operationalized by comparing \"high\" versus \"low\" trait mindfulness scores atbaseline, based on median split. Response to mindfulnesstraining was tested by comparing pre-post MBSR changes ingene expression. Results: For both state mindfulness and trait mindfulness, no statistically significant differences were found inConserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA)or individual gene expression. Regression models control-ling for age, sex, BMI, and immune cell subsets confirmednull results. Many effect sizes, however, were in the mediumrange or higher (Hedge's g >. 50). Mixed-effects regression models revealed no statistically significant differences in CTRA or individual gene expression post-MBSR, on aver- age. Correlational analyses, however, found that individualdifferences in psychological response to MBSR were signif-icantly associated with changes in gene expression.Specifically, reduced stress (beta \u00bc.46, P\u00bc.006) anddecreased anxiety (beta \u00bc.37, P\u00bc.035) both predicted lower CTRA global scores and higher CTRA antiviral factor scores following the MBSR course.Conclusion: Based on effect sizes from a small-scale pilot study, we conclude that state mindfulness, trait mindfulness, and mindfulness training can all plausibly impact stress- andinflammatory-related gene expression. Individual differences in psychological response to mindfulness training may best characterize participants who exhibit anticipated changes ingene expression. P06: Education Research P06.01 Attitudes of Internal Medicine Residents T oward Integrative Medicine and NeedsAssessment to Provide IntegrativeMedicine Content 1Georgetown University, Washington, District of Columbia 2MedStar Health Research Institute, Hyattsville, Maryland 3MedStar-Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia 4Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: Hakima Amri, amrih@georgetown.edu Abstract Purpose: While the interest of physicians in Integrative Medicine (IM) is increasing, there are limited studies thatexplore this interest among internal medicine residents. In this study, we surveyed the attitudes toward IM and evalu- ated the need to offer IM content to internal medicineresidents at the MedStar-Georgetown University Hospital and its affiliates. Methods: The study is based on a 3-step conceptual framework outlining Attitudes, Knowledge, and Behavior of internal medicine residents. In this first step, we used the IM Attitudes Questionnaire. Additional questionsabout the residents' background knowledge in IM and their interest to learn more about the field were formulat- ed. Finally, demographic data were collected according toInstitutional Review Board recommendations. The survey was distributed electronically between May and July of 2017 and data analyzed using descriptive statistics.Abstracts 119Results: Fifty-nine completed surveys were collected from 23 females and 36 males. Respondents include 58% Whitenon-Hispanic, 30.5% Asian/Pacific Islanders, 3.5% Black non-Hispanic, 7% mixed race. Among the res-idents, 83% reported that they had previously heard of IM but only 51% had visited an IM practitioner. When asked if they are interested in learning about IM, 86% replied yes.The preferred format to deliver content was equallyreported as Lecture Series or Seminar/Grand Rounds(49%), followed by CME and online minicourses. Themodalities and therapies that the residents expressedmost interest in learning more about were as follows:Acupuncture (42%), Dietary Supplements (39%), Mind-body Medicine and Integrative Nutrition (31%).While assessing the respondents' view on IM training, 32%of participants agreed that doctors who know about IM inaddition to conventional medicine generate improvedpatient satisfaction. Conclusion: Internal medicine residents expressed posi- tive attitudes toward IM and a need to learn about this fieldwhile in residency. Implications and recommendations arediscussed. P06.02 Hospital-Based Massage Therapy Competencies and Beth Rosenthal1 1ACIH, Charlotte, North Carolina 2Northwestern Health Services University, Bloomington, Minnesota 3UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, San Francisco, Brennan, brennanmk@aol.com Abstract Purpose: An increasing number of hospitals are offering massage therapy at the bedside. Given the complexities ofthe hospital environment and the wide range of patient conditions, it is reasonable that a high level of competence be required to practice responsibly in this setting. TheHospital-Based Massage Therapy (HBMT) Task Force ofthe Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health wasformed to explore the need for a set of standard compe-tencies for the practice of massage therapy in hospital envi-ronments and to develop a peer reviewed set of competen-cies for this practice. The task force facilitated theformation of a standard set of competencies. This sessionwill be used to review the competencies and discuss howthey can be applied by hospitals, schools, and massagetherapists.Methods: The members of the task force identified mas- sage therapists who worked in hospitals as well as hospitals known to have HBMT programs and a survey was distrib- uted to those. These individuals were also asked to identifyothers who might be interested in participating in the proj- ect. The purpose of the survey was to assess various ele- ments of HBMT programs such as educational/experience requirements, employment model, orientation, and supervision. Results: Thirty-two of 37 hospitals (87%) completed the survey. The T ask Force considered the high response rate and the extent to which respondents provided in-depth information to the open-ended questions as evidence of the need for specific competencies for safe and effective massage therapy for hospitalized patients. In addition to the survey, the task force used a Delphi technique toengage survey participants and other experts in the field to shape the initial draft of the competencies. Conclusion: As these competencies are shared with hos- pitals, massage therapists, and massage educators, the Task Force members expect that additional development of thecompetencies will take place as various groups implement them. P06.03 Battling Burnout and Building Bridges: Evaluation of an InterprofessionalIntegrative Health Education Program Audrey Brooks 1, Molly Burke1, Robert Crocker1, and Victoria H Maizes2 1Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 2Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona Contact: Audrey Brooks, brooksaj@email.arizona.edu Abstract Purpose: Multiple professions play a role in supporting the health and wellness of a patient. An Integrative Health (IH) foundation across professions will improve patient care. Health professionals at risk or experiencing burnout nega- tively affect the patient experience as well as being unhealthy for the professional. The Integrative Health &Lifestyle program (IHeLp) was designed to support an inter- professional IH team approach, enhance student well-being, increase wellness behaviors, and decrease burnout risk as a professional. A 5-year evaluation was conducted to assess the impact on students completing a 6-month, mostly online, interprofessional, IH and wellness education program.120 Global Advances in Health and MedicineMethods: Participants completed an evaluation of the online program upon completion (n \u00bc241). T o assess impact validated burnout, emotional intelligence, overall well-being, attitudes toward interprofessional learning and teams, and wellness behavior measures were completedprior to starting the program, upon completion, and 30- day follow-up. Results: Almost all participants rated the content as meet- ing or exceeding expectations (90%-100% based on unit). Participants rated IHeLp as personally enriching (100%), professionally enriching (98%), transformative (97%),would recommend the program to others (96%), and felt able to apply the content (97%). Pre-post program improvements (n \u00bc85) were observed for burnout, emo- tional intelligence, overall well-being, attitudes toward inter- professional learning and teams, and wellness behaviors (diet, mind-body practices, sleep, and exercise).Improvements in burnout, attitudes toward interprofes- sional teams, diet and sleep behaviors were maintained at the 30-day follow-up (n \u00bc49). Conclusion: High satisfaction in an online interprofessional educational program both personally and professionally can support a student's health, wellness, and interest in workinginterprofessionally from an integrative perspective. Providing both IH/wellness content and required self-care assignments throughout the 6-month program improvedwellness, emotional intelligence, overall wellbeing, and burnout. Providing appropriate education and training for all health professionals in an integrative approach is impor-tant to support attitudes and openness to interprofessional team approaches to care. P06.04 Primary Care Physicians Perceptions of Integrative Medicine and Changes inReferrals Jeffery Dusek 1, Francoise Adan2, and James Werner3 1University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio 2UH CIHN, Cleveland, Ohio 3Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio Jeffery Dusek, jeffery.dusek@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Primary Care Providers' (PCP) serve as main referral source for Integrative medicine (IM) clinics, but may not enough knowledge or experience to refer. Wehypothesized that single exposure to IM education and experience with acupuncture, massage or both may influ- ence PCP perceptions and their referrals to our IM clinics.Methods: Eligible UH clinicians were primary care physi- cians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants who spent 20 or more hours per week providing direct patient care. Interested study eligible clinicians met with study personnelfor consenting and baseline questionnaire completion. After completion of their education session, subjects were able to choose the intervention (massage or acupuncture or both) that fit their schedule. Results: A total of 28 PCPs (20 females) consented and enrolled in the study. Although 25% (7) reported receiving training in IM in medical school, about 50% reported receiv- ing brief IM training since medical school. When asked \"how often is massage useful in the treatment of chronic pain?\": 50% and 74% rated Often/Always before and after the study respectively and 83% reported that the education on mas- sage was persuasive. When asked \"how often is acupunc-ture useful in the treatment of chronic pain?\": 36% and 65% rated Often/Always before and after the study respectively and 91% reported that the education on acupuncture was persuasive. Finally, using IM referrals tracked in the elec- tronic health record, we found that 20% of PCPs referredin the 3 months before the study and which increased to 36% of PCPs in the 3 months after the study. There was a corresponding 120% increase in number of unique patients referred. Conclusion: These data suggest that a single exposure to education and experience with acupuncture, massage or both can significantly increase PCP referral intent and mod- erately improve the number of PCPs referring and the number of unique patients referred for IM. P06.05 Frame Your Life: Creating a Mindful College Experience From FirstSemester on Campus Maryanna Klatt 1and Roshini Srinivasan2 1The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio 2The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Maryanna Klatt, maryanna.klatt@osumc.edu Abstract Purpose: The college years are among the most stress- inducing for students, and stress can bring with it a host of negative consequences. In particular, freshman (first-year) college students tend to experience even greater stress, asthe transition from high school to college can be particularly distressing. The first year of college can be a time of great personal, social, and professional growth and is a critical period of time to develop the habits/mindsets integral to identity postgraduation. This research assessed the impactAbstracts 121that taking a first-year Mindfulness seminar, with both online and in-person elements, had on students' perceptions ofstress and resilience. This course sought to help freshmanframe not only their college experience but see the collegeyears as integral to framing how they wanted to live the rest of their lives. Methods: T wenty-three first-year college students at a large public university in the Midwestern United States registered for this academic course and elected to be in this educational research study. Participants completed measures of per-ceived stress and resilience at the same time points pre-and postcourse; additionally, they answered 8 weekly quali-tative questions on the course website on topics related tothe impact of mindfulness on their daily life. Results: The Perceived Stress Scale indicated a highly sig- nificant reduction ( P\u00bc.0038) in students' perceived stress after the 8-week mindfulness course; results from the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale indicated a highly signif- icant ( P\u00bc.0009) increase in students' resilience. Qualitative responses reflected student learning of the need for mean-ing and purpose, perspective taking, the value of being in thepresent, the role that we have allowed technology to play inour lives, and the importance of focused attention. Conclusion: Participants were exposed to the theory and practice of mindfulness through a curricular offering thathad a significant impact on their perceived stress andresilience. P06.06 Addressing Well-being Needs of Patients and Medical Students with a Health Promotion Integrative Health Elective Pathway Amy Locke1, Tricia Petzold1, and Rebecca Wilson1 1University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah Contact: Amy Locke, amy.locke@hsc.utah.edu Abstract Purpose: Medical schools struggle to teach both the needed skills for assisting patients with health behaviorchange and for providing advice about integrative healththerapies. At the same time, students are at high risk forpoor self-care and burnout. Curricular programs may beable to address patient care as well as health of students. Methods: The University of Utah implemented multiple elective pathways to allow a more in-depth field of knowl-edges. The Health Promotion and Integrative Health Pathway includes 300 hours of education including core courses and a variety of electives through all 4 years, includ-ing an interprofessional Culinary Medicine course. The goalis physicians who are able to champion healthy lifestyles, preventive medicine, and wellness at the level of them-selves, their individual patients, and their community.Graduating students are surveyed regarding their confi-dence in assisting patients with health behavior change aswell as their own health habits. Results: Prior to pathway implementation, students had moderately high levels (strongly agree or agree on a 5-point Likert-type scale) of comfort discussing health behav-iors (75% nutrition, 88% physical activity, 88% sleep, and 88% stress), counseling patients about integrative modalities (76%), and helping patients change health behaviors (76%)but less comfort with natural products (38%). The majorityof students (75%) felt that they championed a healthy life-style for themselves. Their health habits suggested room forimprovement: 60% ate at least 2 cups of vegetables daily,30% met the CDC recommendations for physical activity,and 72% slept 7 to 9 hours nightly. Completion of a 1-creditculinary medicine class (10/91 students) did not significantly change comfort in discussing topics, although health behav- iors were slightly better. Pathway students report morepositive attitudes toward these topics. Conclusion: By combining curriculum with services tar- geted at medical student well-being, we hope to optimize not only the medical student experience but also theirfuture patients. P06.07 Student Well-being and Mindfulness Knowledge Following an Online Academic Mindfulness Course Christina Luberto1,2, Bonnie Halvorson3, Sydney Crute2, and Janice Goodman3 1Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 3MGH Institute for Health Professions, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Christina Luberto, cluberto@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Education in mindfulness-based interventions is being increasingly incorporated into academic programs forhealth professions students. Our institute offers a Mind-Body Health and Healing Certificate program, for whichwe recently developed a new graduate-level onlinecourse, \"Mindfulness for Healthcare Providers.\" Given that mindfulness training is best taught experientially, this course included a strong personal practice component andmay therefore have dual benefits of improving students'mindfulness knowledge and their personal well-being. Thepurpose of this study is to (1) describe a new online122 Global Advances in Health and Medicineacademic mindfulness course and (2) explore changes in students' well-being and mindfulness knowledge frombefore to after the course. Methods: T wenty-three students enrolled in the course (96% females, 91% white, M age\u00bc33.13, standard deviation (SD)\u00bc14.10; 48% nursing students, which was online-only elec- tive including an overview of mindfulness-based interven-tions, applications to specific patient populations, reviewof the evidence, interactive discussion boards, and guidedmeditation recordings for personal practice ( /C2440 minutes/ day). Students were invited to complete self-report meas- ures of psychological well-being and a mindfulness knowl-edge check before (n \u00bc22) and after the course (n \u00bc18). Qualitative data were extracted from postcourse discussionposts (n \u00bc22). Results: Among n \u00bc11 students with pre-post data, burn- out rates decreased from before (68%) to after the course(36%), and there were medium-sized improvements in pos- itive affect (d \u00bc.64) and small-medium improvements in perceived stress (d \u00bc.30), mindful awareness (d \u00bc.20), and empathy (d \u00bc.15). Qualitative themes included improved emotional well-being and stress management, increased mindfulness, improved patient care skills, and time barriers to ongoing practice. Mindfulness knowledgescores increased from before (Mean \u00bc.36, SD \u00bc.11) to after the course (Mean \u00bc.79, SD \u00bc.17). Website usage data and student grades will be analyzed in January 2020. Conclusion: It was feasible to teach graduate students about mindfulness interventions through an online course.Improvements in personal and professional well-being were reported. Next steps and lessons learned will be discussed. P06.08 Attitudes and Comfort With Use of Integrative Medicine in Fourth Year Medical Students After a 2-Week Elective Rachael Maciasz1, Justin Laube2, and Zhiyu of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 2UCLA East West, Santa Monica, California 3David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Westwood, California Contact: Rachael Maciasz, rmaciasz@mednet.ucla.edu Abstract Purpose: Nationally, there is increased interest and use of Integrative Medicine (IM) approaches and therapies by patients and thus a need for medical trainees to be compe- tent in IM to help guide patients. Increasingly, there is a pushto incorporate IM into medical education to bridge thisneed. This study evaluates medical students' attitudes, inter- est, and comfort with the use of IM before and after anexperiential elective. Methods: A 2-week IM elective was offered for fourth- year medical students in 2018 and 2019. It included didac-tics and experiential sessions on evidence-informed IM therapies and healing systems. Students were assessed before and after the elective on their prior experienceswith IM, comfort using IM personally, comfort discussingIM with patients, and attitudes toward IM. Univariate anal-ysis and paired ttest were used for analysis. Results: T wenty-three students participated with 20 com- pleting the questionnaire; 85% had used IM therapies fortheir own health, most commonly for pain, anxiety, and athletic injury. Most common modalities were supplements, massage, meditation, and yoga. All students reported little-to-no training in IM prior to medical school and that theirmedical education in IM was inadequate thus far. Studentswere highly interested in learning about IM therapies. After the elective, students were significantly more comfortable using IM therapies personally and discussing IM therapieswith patients ( P<.0001). Conclusion: Our study emphasizes the strong interest among medical students toward IM education for personaluse and to care for patients. The elective significantlyincreased students' comfort with using IM for personal use and discussing IM with their future patients. This study suggests value for immersive IM electives for medicalstudents to increase confidence to provide IM infused care.More research is needed to determine the optimal electivestructure, length, and IM topics to include to optimize the impact. P06.09 Massage Therapy Education Needs: Qualitative Analysis of Massage Education Stakeholder Views on Foundation Training, Continuing Education, and Employment Niki Munk1, Donya Nemati2, Samantha Indiana\u2014IUPUI, Indianapolis, Indiana 2Department of Health Sciences, Indiana University School of Health and Human Sciences, Indianapolis, Indiana 3Massage of Northern Ohio Practice Based Research Network, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Niki Munk, nmunk@iu.edu Abstract Purpose: Apply qualitative data analysis methods to mas- sage education stockholder views systematically collectedAbstracts 123during the 2017 Alliance for Massage Therapy Education (AFMTE) Educational Congress; attendees reported what should be stopped, started, continued and done more in massage education regarding foundation and continuingeducation, and employment. Methods: Collected comments (n \u00bc647) were arranged high to low by forum participants' assigned value points. Four independent reviewers conducted multiple readingsand attended biweekly meetings to finalize a coding frame- work. T wo researchers applied the coding framework to all comments; disagreements were reconciled by the lead researcher. Theme development sought to provide an over- arching assessment of what massage education stakeholdersdeemed most needed to progress the massage field. Member checking for developed themes occurred during the 2019 AFMTE Congress with a REDCap delivered agree- ment slider scale for each theme (0 \u00bctotally disagree to 100\u00bctotally agree). Results: Four themes developed related to (1) tension regarding qualifications and inconsistent practices in the massage field; (2) need for the massage field to elevate its education, policies, and practice; (3) the existence of biasand competitive narratives/motivations within the sample and those in the massage field; and (4) desire for wage dig- nified and valued employment environments for massage therapists. Sixty-seven education stakeholders participated in member checking and confirmed themes (median agree- ment values \u00bc77, 89, 81.5, and 95, respectively). Conclusion: Massage education stakeholders provided critical reflection on common practices within massage edu- cation and employment. Feedback items within developedthemes point to several massage field-derived practices and \"behaviors\" that may (1) threaten the field's ability to inte- grate into health care, (2) reinforce negative public and/or related health professionals' views of the massage field gen- erally and with regard to therapist training and competen-cies, or (3) limit the extent to which a massage therapy career is viable and sustainable. More opportunities are needed for massage field stakeholders to provide critical profession related feedback. P06.10 The Development and Evaluation of an Undergraduate Integrative HealthCertificate Program Brenna Novak 1, of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 2University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio Contact: Brenna Novak, novakbk@mail.uc.eduAbstract Purpose: T raining the next generation of learners in evidence-based integrative health (IH) is critical. T o expand education of evidence-based and experiential IH practices and principles, an undergraduate Integrative Health and Wellness Certificate was developed at a large public university. The purpose of this abstract is to describe the development and evaluation of the certificate. Methods: Research on nationwide IH educational pro- grams and current university-wide IH-related courses already available began in 2016. T wo foundational courses (Fundamentals of Integrative Health and Medicine and Science and Practice of Mind-Body Medicine) were designed based on core IH principles and piloted startingin 2018. A mixed-method survey was administered to stu- dents following the piloted foundational courses assessing student experience and impact. Responses were examined using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: These 2 foundational courses received high inter- est among students, with wait-lists for both. Fifty-three stu- dents completed the survey assessing their experience in atleast one of the courses (response rate \u00bc71.6%); 90.6% of students rated their overall experience as excellent. Students reported the course as \"experiential,\" \"eye-open- ing,\" \"directly and informative\"; 98.1% shared a high probability of changing the way they focus on personal well- ness due to the class through regular meditation (39.6%),exercise including yoga (35.8%), eating habits (35.8%), and self-care/stress reduction (20.8%); 92.4% of students would highly recommend the course. Following the success of these piloted courses, the IH certificate program was for- malized in 2019, with additional required classes in personalnutrition, exercise physiology, and positive psychology. Conclusion: The introduction of 2 foundational IH courses as part of a new certificate program proved successful and further strengthened the value proposition of this new edu- cational offering. This IH certificate will allow students from various disciplines to have foundational principles of IH to advance both personal and community health and the field. P06.11 Implementation and Evaluation of a Nutritional Pain Management Course forHealth-care Professionals Megan Sweeney 1, Robert Bonakdar1, and Nancy Cotter2 1Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine, La Jolla, California 2VA Atlantic Health, Morristown, New Jersey Contact: Megan Sweeney, sweeney.megan@scrippshealth.org124 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: Nonpharmacologic approaches to pain manage- ment are essential among the current epidemics of opioid abuse and undertreated pain. The relationship between pain and metabolic dysregulation cannot be overlooked. Reportshave also shown how insufficient nutrition education often makes clinicians hesitant to recommend eating habits or dietary supplements to patients. Nutrition-based interven-tions hold promise for reducing or eliminating pain across multiple populations. We hypothesized that a certification course for multidisciplinary health-care professionals wouldpositively increase their familiarity and confidence in nutri- tional approaches to pain. Methods: Supplemental to a previous pilot study involving 115 participants, a 6-hour continuing education course wasdesigned to address key concepts of nutritional pain man- agement, including the potential role of diet in augmenting pain (inflammatory, nutrient deplete, and obesogenic diets)and in reducing pain (reduction of inflammation and weight and nutrient deficiency). The course offered practical ways to introduce a health-promoting diet, evidence-basednutrients, and dietary supplements to those with systemic inflammation and pain conditions. Participants were admin- istered pre-and postworkshop validated surveys on knowl-edge, confidence, and prior training in nutritional pain management. Results: Precourse surveys from 413 indicated that the majority (88%) had very little to no previous education on nutrition and dietary supplements. Postcourse surveys reveal participants' knowledge, confidence, and comfort uti-lizing nutrition to manage pain improved significantly (P<.001), across all 6 items. Qualitative survey results indi- cated that education on supplements\u2014including probioticsand vitamins\u2014was most beneficial to participants. Themajority (91%) felt well educated after the course. Conclusion: Multiple practitioners should be aware of the role of diet in the amelioration and exacerbation of pain.This continuing education course for multiple disciplines significantly improved their knowledge and comfort in pro- viding nutritional counseling for managing pain. Thus, asingle workshop is useful to enhance clinical knowledge and increase utilization of an often overlooked but vital, nonpharmacological approach to pain.P06.12 Integrative Medicine Providers' Perceptions of Palliative Care Conversations\u2014A Collaboration BetweenIntegrative Medicine for the Underserved and Palliative Care Lauren Vilardo 1, Stephanie Cheng2, Delia Chiaramonte3, Mikhail Kogan1, and David Steinhorn4 1GW School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, District of Columbia 2University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 3University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 4Children's National Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: Lauren Vilardo, lmvilardo@gwu.edu Abstract Purpose: Integrative medicine (IM) providers treat patients of all ages, at all stages of life. Many IM modalities are wellsuited to end-of-life (EOL) care; however, IM providers' com-fort with EOL conversations and the adequacy of their trainingfor EOL conversations is unknown. Our goals were to deter-mine (1) how comfortable providers feel talking to patients about EOL issues, (2) how effective providers felt that their formal education was at teaching this skill, and (3) providers'perceptions of the importance of this skill in their fields. Methods: We surveyed 29 IM providers in an institutional review board-exempt study at the June 2018 IM4US con- ference in Washington, DC. Results: Most respondents (64%) reported that they are comfortable talking to patients about EOL issues; 70% of respondents felt comfortable modifying their goals fromcure-focused to care-focused. However, just 36% ofrespondents felt that their formal education had been effec-tive at teaching these skills; 93% responded that it is impor-tant for practitioners in their fields to skillfully talk to theirpatients about EOL issues. Conclusion: Despite providers' perceptions of inadequate formal training in conducting EOL conversations with theirpatients, the majority of providers responded that they are at least somewhat comfortable in discussing EOL and comfort-focused care with their patients. The majority rec-ognized the importance of conducting EOL discussions skill-fully with their patients, but only one-third of practitionersfelt that they had sufficient training. Because the vast major-ity of IM providers acknowledge the importance of skillfulEOL discussions, further research is required to determinethe best way to integrate EOL education into IM curricula and whether formal education can effectively teach these skills so that more IM providers are comfortable with EOLdiscussions and goal setting in their life-limited patients.Abstracts 125P06.13 Feasibility of a Train-the-Trainer Model for Dissemination and Uptake of CulinaryMedicine Education Melinda Ring 1, Rupa Mahadevan2, Elaine Cheung2, and Stephanie Folkens3 1Northwestern, Chicago, Illinois 2Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 3Common Threads, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Melinda Ring, mring@nm.org Abstract Purpose: The aim of this project is to increase the ability of faculty to deliver a culinary medicine and service-learningeducation program to medical trainees. In 2016, an academic-community partnership between Northwestern Osher Center and Common Threads led to the develop-ment of a unique elective (Cooking Up Health) in which trainees learn about nutrition and cooking and then go into underserved communities to teach elementary school chil-dren about healthy habits. Previously reported data show that participants note increased confidence in and attitudes toward nutrition and obesity counseling. Requests from other sites led to our creation of a training through which attendees can bring culinary medicine to their home institu-tion. By sharing this work, we believe we can impact on the nutrition-competence of future health-care providers, the wellness of students during their training, and improvethe health of children and families in communities. Methods: Our goal was to provide other institutions access to a well-researched and vetted course and the tools needed to maximize likelihood of successful imple- mentation. T o see whether this was feasible, we hosted workshops in 2018 (13 faculty from 8 institutions) and 2019 (12 faculty from 7 institutions). Workshops were coc-urated and taught by academic and community partners. The agenda consisted of participation in a mock culinary medicine class including hands-on cooking, interactive activ-ities, and brainstorming steps to completion. Evaluation of the workshops was conducted using pre- and postsurveys in Qualtrics and follow-up surveys 6 and 12 months later. Results: Postworkshop evaluations showed participants gained confidence in ability to implement the elective andhigh likelihood of recommending the course and the train- ing. Perceived barriers to success were financial resources and time in the curriculum. Conclusion: It is feasible to use a Train-the-Trainer model to disseminate culinary medicine education content. Additional follow-up is needed to assess success of imple- mentation efforts.P06.14LB The Perception of Difficulties in the Inclusion of Cam Approaches and Uses in Conventional Medicine Denise Scheines1 1Buenos Aires, Argentina Contact: Denise Scheines, dscheines@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The purpose of the research was to study the subjective perception of difficulties in the inclusion of camapproaches to conventional medicine. The larger purposeof this pilot study is to gain further insights and wisdom onthe reasons beneath cam approaches, and therapies are sodifficult to merge with conventional medicine. The innova- tion shift that I am proposing is to study these obstacles from the cam professionals perspective. Methods: A nonprobabilistic, descriptive study of consec- utive cases for convenience was implemented; 21 cam pro-fessionals were surveyed by a Likert-type questionnairespecially designed for the study; 10 categories were ana- lyzed: epistemology, certification, legal, health insurance, statistics data, therapeutic outcomes, education, interdisci-plinary, language, and demographic context. Results: We found that for the 61.9% of cam professionals the mayor difficulty is both the epistemology dimension andthe lack of health insurance. For the 38.1% of cam professio-nals, the lack of formal certification is a difficulty as well; same percentage was found for the interdisciplinary dimension. Regarding the absence of statistics data of cam approachesin South America, especially in Argentina, we also found thatthis dimension was rated as an important difficulty in 47.6% ofcam professionals. Finally, therapeutic outcomes, language,and demographic context were not significant. Conclusion: The survey informs that there are 2 mayor perceived difficulties in the inclusion of cam to conventionalmedicine: on the one hand, the epistemology and on theother, the lack of cam in health insurance. This study was anattempt to gain further insights on the reasons beneath thedifficulties that arises when trying to merge conventionaland complementary approaches in health care. P06.15LB Decreasing Burnout: A Narrative Medicine Curriculum for Millennials Eugene Lee1 1Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Eugene Lee, eugenecllee@gmail.com126 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: Medical students are utilizing different resources and technologies to learn. These resources are different from traditional teaching methods. Additionally, they have different stressors affecting their wellness. The narrative medicine curriculum was crafted to teach millennials about the use of social media as a medical professionaland to decrease burnout. Our goal is to evaluate the cur- riculum's efficacy with those topics in mind. Methods: Students enrolled in the Narrative Medicine Elective took a pre-elective survey and a postelectivesurvey. The surveys included the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory to evaluate for burnout and questions regarding social media use as a medical professional. The results of the survey were used to evaluate the curriculum and suggest changes for improvement. Results: The curriculum decreased emotional exhaustion from 9.59 to 6.6 and depersonalization from 7.91 to 2.93 with a Pvalue of .005 and <.005, respectively. Personal accomplishment was unchanged from 14.18 to 13.93 ( P value .774). Using a Likert-type scale from 0 (not confident) to 4 (very confident), comfort with social media as a med- ical professional increased from 1.95 to 2.93 ( Pvalue .027). Conclusion: For medical students in the millennial age range, the current narrative medicine curriculum is effective in decreasing feelings of burnout with respect to emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and in improving confi- dence with social media. Based on this information contin- ued efforts to improve the curriculum for personal accom-plishment and to identify teaching modalities for these medical students are in progress. Other institutions may benefit from a similar curriculum. P06.16LB T opical Wintergreen Essential Oil as a Unique Cause of Salicylate T oxicity Phillip Gross1, Yusuf Alimi1, and Swhaeb Shubair1 1Northeast Georgia Center, Gainesville, Georgia Contact: Phillip Gross, phillipgross@nghs.com Abstract Purpose: The aim is to recognize the importance of obtaining a detailed medication history including prescribed medicines, herbal medicines, and supplements and to rec-ognize the potential deadly complications of a commonly used herbal medicine. Methods: Case vignette of a hospital admitted patient. Results: A 30-year-old obese Caucasian female presented with intractable nausea and vomiting, coffee ground emesis, generalized abdominal pain, diarrhea, and tinnitus for 1 day.She was diagnosed with salicylate toxicity leading to meta- bolic acidosis requiring hemodialysis and acute blood loss anemia prompting transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells and upper endoscopy with findings of hemorrhagic gastritis. Subsequent history revealed Y oung Living winter-green essential oil use, application of undiluted oil topically on hands, chest, and hair daily over a 3- to 4-month period totaling 10 bottles containing 15-mL wintergreen essential oil each. Poison control confirmed wintergreen essential oil use the likely cause of the salicylate toxicity. Conclusion: This study recognizes the importance of an herbal medicine and supplement history. P06.17LB Lacking Theory: Case Reports' Potential for Massage Therapy Theory Development Samantha Zabel1and Niki Munk2 1Indiana University, Indianapolis, Contact: Samantha Zabel, sazabel@iu.edu Abstract Purpose: Pain is a leading reason why people utilize mas- sage therapy, and massage for chronic back pain specifically has received much attention. Despite extensive research in these areas, the massage field has little associated theory and no recognized foundational model linked to practice generally or within pain contexts. While theory is included in some research and foundation massage education texts and curricula, the extent to which theory is considered in day-to-day practice is unknown. Case reports allow mas- sage therapists to disseminate their practice experiencesand rationale in terms of theoretical basis for treatment approach and results. This project sought to examine pub- lished case reports as a preliminary evaluation of theory application in massage therapy practice for chronic low back pain. Methods: A content analysis was conducted on peer- reviewed and massage clinician derived case reports focused on chronic low back pain. Included articles were part of a published reporting guidelines audit from 2016.Each included case report was examined for references to theory as a part of treatment decision-making or results discussion. Results: Six case reports met eligibility criteria and were examined for mention or reference to theory. One case directly referenced a scientific pain theory (gate control), 2 cases made indirect references to an unidentified theory, 2 included unclear references to potential theoretical explanations, and 1 made no theory references.Abstracts 127Conclusion: Little theory was included in massage thera- pist derived case reports focused on chronic low back painperhaps reflecting a lack of conscious theory use in treat- ment planning or results attribution in therapeutic massage practice. While not definitive due to limitations in this effort's methods, consideration of these findings may prompt a discussion among the massage field about theory'srole in its development and application in practice in addi- tion to the potential for case reports to inform theory development and refinement. P06.18LB Yoga Class as an Adjunct to Anatomy Lectures to Improve Anatomy T est Scores Eugene Lee1, Noemy Sandoval Skeet2, and Amy Hoyt1 1Loyola University Medical Chicago, Illinois 2Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, Illinois Contact: Eugene Lee, eugenecllee@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine whether a yoga class synced with anatomy lectures wouldaid in the process of learning anatomy in the first year of medical school. Methods: First-year medical students in anatomy voluntar- ily enrolled in the study. At time of enrollment, an intake survey was completed and the participant was randomized into a wait-list or yoga group. The yoga group participantsengaged in 1 hour/week yoga sessions focused on topics synced with anatomy lecture topics. The wait-list group was given the opportunity to participate in the same yoga sessions after completion of their anatomy course. Each yoga session began with a presurvey including a modifiedversion of the DASS21 and closed with a similar postsurvey. Prior to each exam stress levels of both groups were assessed using the PSS-4 scale. Exam scores from bothyoga group and wait-list group were obtained from their 4 anatomy exams. This is an on-going study and 2 out of 3 years have been completed. Institutional review boardapproval was obtained for this study. Results: T o date, 64 participants have been enrolled, and 77% of participants identified as kinesthetic learners. T ests scores between the yoga group and wait-list group were not statistically different. Stress levels (determined by mod-ified DASS21) immediately after yoga sessions decreased an average of 30%. However, stress levels measured using PSS- 4 prior to exams showed no statistical difference betweenthe 2 groups. Conclusion: Medical students identifying as kinesthetic learners are yearning for teaching styles other thantraditional lectures, and so additional resources should be available for those students. Although preliminary datashow that 1 hour/week of yoga is insufficient for improving scores on medical school anatomy exams, yoga is beneficial in decreasing stress levels in medical students. P07: Health Services Research P07.01 Predictors of Headache/Migraine and the Use of Mind-Body Medicine in U.S.Children: A Population Based Analysis of the 2017 NHIS Data Dennis Anheyer 1Department of and Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany 2Department of Rural Health, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia 3Department of Family and Community Medicine, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas 4Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany Contact: Dennis Anheyer, d.anheyer@kem-med.com Abstract Purpose: Chronic headache is characterized by the pres- ence of pain in the region of the head for at least 15 daysper month for more than 3 months. The aim of this studywas to analyze differences in sociodemographic character-istics and health related factors as well as the prevalence of mind-body medicine use among U.S. children suffering from headaches and/or migraine. Methods: This analysis is a secondary analysis of data from the 2017 U.S. National Health Interview Survey.Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were com-pared between individuals with and without headaches using v 2tests. T o test potential clinical predictors, a back- ward stepwise procedure with a logistic regression statisticwas used, and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidenceintervals were calculated. Results: Children with headaches had a higher age, more often were females, non-Hispanic White or Hispanic, and were originated in the south of the United States. Moreover, children suffering from headaches could mostof the time not spend enough money for healthy mealsand were more likely to be sad or depressed in the past128 Global Advances in Health and Medicine12 months. The prevalence of complementary medicine use among U.S. children suffering from headaches was 18.8%.The most frequent used therapy was yoga (57.2%) followedby spiritual meditation (31.1%) and mindfulness meditation(24.0%). Conclusion: The use of mind-body medicine among chil- dren suffering from headaches was high. While yoga was themost frequent used therapy other movement-orientedtherapies like tai chi or qigong were not used by childrenwith headaches and/or migraine. P07.03 Breast Cancer and Use of Complementary Therapies in the Chilean's National Health Survey 2017 Paula Bedregal1, Victoria Passi2 1Faculty Chile, Santiago, Chile Contact: Paula Bedregal, pbedrega@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Breast cancer in Chile is the main cause of death by cancer in women. It is 1 of the 82 conditions that countswith universal access to treatment in the public and privatehealth-care sector because of the Law of ExplicitGuarantees in Health (GES). Breast cancer package of serv- ices in Chile does not include complementary therapies (CTs), despite that some of them are incorporated intosome evidence-based clinical guidelines. The aim is to com-pare the use of CT in people with and without breastcancer diagnosed ever in life. Methods: Analyses from the last Chilean National Health Survey (2017) that through a complex sampling allows toestimate the national prevalence of chronic diseases andhealth conditions of people over 15 years old, as well asthe use of services, in a sample of 5514 people. Results: 1.2% of women has or had breast cancer, mean age of 66 /C610.4 years old; 95.3% received allopathic treat- ment related to GES, 86% of them received surgery. Thosewith breast cancer use more CT (36.4% vs 5%) and use andnatural medicine (38.1% vs 23.1%) than people withoutthis condition. There is no difference in the use of acupunc- ture, Bach's flowers, Reiki, Chiropractic, and other CT . The use of each type of CT is mediated by the educational level.Those who received CT perceived more benefits in home-opathy and herbs and less in acupuncture and Bach's flow-ers. Excluding Bach's flowers, most people would like tohave access to these services in the public service of health, to guarantee continuity of care and treatment. Conclusion: Despite the restrictions in access, people with breast cancer tend to use CT . Nevertheless, thosewith the most scientific evidence (acupuncture) are lessused. We should explore the reasons of it. Some economic reasons are probably at the base. P07.04 T elemedicine Use in Complementary Medicine Consulting: A Survey of Homeopaths and Naturopaths in Ontario, Canada 2Facebook, San Francisco, California 3University of Toronto, San Francisco, California Contact: David Brule, david.brule@utoronto.ca Abstract Purpose: T elemedicine, defined as the use of online and telephone-based technologies in health service delivery,holds great potential for the delivery of care in both con-ventional biomedical care and in traditional, complementa- ry, and alternative medicine. These technologies have prom- ise for reaching underserved populations, providing accessto nonlocal specialists, and being convenient for patients.This research aims to investigate the extent of, rationale for, as well as strengths and challenges associated with, telemedicine-based consulting by homeopaths andnaturopaths. Methods: Using a census-based approach, state-regulated homeopaths and naturopathic doctors in Ontario, Canadawere surveyed using the online Qualtrics survey tool.Survey questions captured demographic and socioeconomic data of respondents as well as opinions regarding respond- ents' motivations behind telemedicine use. Results: The survey was conducted between October 2018 and January 2019; 183 homeopaths and 366 naturo- paths responded to the survey, representing an overallresponse rate of 34.8% and 32.7%, respectively, from ourprimary (e-mail-based) recruitment strategy. Among homeopath respondents, 63.4% reported having performed a homeopathic consultation with a patient using face-to-faceonline video in the past 6 months. For homeopath respond-ents who reported telemedicine use, the average propor- tion of their consultations devoted to face-to-face online video was 18.8%. In contrast, only 32.7% of naturopathicrespondents reported having performed a consultation withAbstracts 129a patient using online video in the past 6 months, with 8.6% of their consultations devoted to online video consultations.There were no significant differences in use of telemedicinewith regard to gender, geographical location, age, orincome. Conclusion: Face-to-face online video is used by more than half of homeopaths in Ontario, Canada. Ontariohomeopaths are nearly twice as likely to engage in online video consultations as naturopaths. Future analysis of the data will explore the motivations behind telemedicine useamongst homeopaths and naturopaths in Ontario. P07.05 Smart Phone App-Based Platform Evaluation of Low Back Pain Cian O'Donnell1, Marc Brodsky2, and Bharath Reddy3 Inc., Carmel, Indiana Contact: Marc Brodsky, mbrodsky@stamhealth.org Abstract Purpose: A healthy back curriculum is an ongoing collab- orative wellness program sponsored by a community hos- pital and a community organization. Objective was to col-lect quality improvement data of the low back pain programby a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actcompliant smart phone app-based platform and to evaluatethe feasibility for the app to be used for program evaluation and research purposes. Methods: Participants in the 12-week healthy back curric- ulum session from September 2018 through December 2018 downloaded a proprietary app on their smartphones. Subjects were prompted to complete baseline and 12-weekfollow-up health-related quality of life validated question-naires for low back pain (minimal data set per NationalInstitutes of Health Task Force on Research Standards forChronic Low Back Pain and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire). Participation in the program evaluation was voluntary, and no incentive was provided to completethe surveys. Results: Fifteen subjects completed enrollment surveys on the smart phone app-based platform. Eight subjects com-pleted follow-up surveys. Seven participants were lost tofollow-up. Fifty percent (4/8) of those who completedfollow-up surveys had at least 30% improvement in averagepain over the previous week (0-10 scale, with 0 describing no pain and 10 describing worst pain imaginable) at the end of the 12-week exercise program relative to average painover the previous week at baseline.Conclusion: The smart phone app-based platform enabled evaluation data to be viewed as it was collected, decreased administrative effort of data collection, and facilitated an efficient route to data analysis compared to pen-and-paper methods. Higher compliance of participants complet- ing the data sets over time would improve the utility of the application. P07.07 Acupuncture Utilization Patterns and Quality of Life Outcomes for Migraine/Headache: Findings From the PRIMIERStudy and the BraveNet Collaborative Jeffery Dusek6 1UC Health and University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 2Department of Family Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 3Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 4Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York 5University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts 6University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Jennifer Carroll, jennifer.2.carroll@cuanschutz.edu Abstract Purpose: Acupuncture is a beneficial treatment of migraine and possibly other forms of headache. This study describes utilization patterns and outcomes for migraine/headaches, for acupuncture as a component of other integrative med- icine services. Methods: This study is a subgroup analysis of PRIMIER (Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Interventions Effectiveness Registry), an observational cohort study that enrolled 4954 patients from August 2013 to October 2017 across 17 U.S.-based Integrative Medicine sites. For this subgroup analysis, we analyzed patients with a self- reported history of headache or migraine who completed at least 2 of surveys within the first year of enrollment and had evaluable EHR data. Here, we report on the association of acupuncture for migraine/headache with changes on thePROMIS-29, a validated survey instrument for patient reported outcomes (pain interference and intensity, physical function, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, fatigue, and social functioning). Results: Acupuncture was provided at almost all (15, 88.2%) sites. We identified 205 patients reporting head- ache/migraine (mean age \u00bc45, 89% females, 90% white),130 Global Advances in Health and Medicineof whom 58 (28.3%) received acupuncture at baseline. Acupuncture was the second most common service for headache/migraine (after IM physician consults), accountingfor 11.3% to 24.4% visits across all time points. The median number of visits was 2 (range, 1-9 visits). Participants reported elevated baseline scores on the fatigue, anxiety,and pain interference. We observed improvement in pain interference at 6 months (LS mean \u00bc/C02.24, P\u00bc.0012), social functioning at 4 (LS mean \u00bc1.43, P\u00bc.0240), 6 (LS mean\u00bc1.42, P\u00bc.0283) and 12 months (LS mean \u00bc2.45, P\u00bc.0002), and fatigue at 4 (LS \u00bc/C01.41, P\u00bc.0479) and 12 months (LS mean /C01.54, P\u00bc.0409). No other changes were observed. Conclusion: For patients with migraine/headache, improvements were observed for some quality of life meas- ures. Future research should explore variations in acupunc- ture \"dose\" with quality of life outcomes. P07.08 Misaligned Expectations on Integrative Medical Service for Diabetes and DiabeticKidney Disease: A Comparative FocusGroup Series of Patients and Physicians Kam Wa (Chris) Chan 1, Pak Wing Lee1, Crystal Pui Sha Leung2, Gary Chi Wang Chan3, Wai Han Yiu1, Hoi Man Cheung1, Bin Li1, Sarah Wing Yan Lok1, Hongyu Li1, Rui Xue1, Loretta Yuk Yee Chan1, Joseph Chi Kam Leung1, Tai Pong Lam4, Kar Neng Lai1, and Sydney Chi Wai Tang1 1Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China 2Department of Family Medicine and Primary Healthcare, Hong Kong East Cluster, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SpecialAdministrative Region of China 3Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China 4Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ofChina Contact: Kam Wa (Chris) CHAN, chriskwc@hku.hk Abstract Purpose: Despite increasing volume of evidence on the efficacy of integrative medicine (IM), we continue to encounter patients covering the use of IM which imposesa threat to clinical management. Discrepancy of perspective between patients and physicians over IM research and ser- vice provision remains unclear. We sought to explore thebarriers and recommendations regarding IM service imple- mentation among diabetes patients and physicians. Methods: A 10-group, 50-participants semistructured focus group interview series was conducted. T wenty-onepatients with diverse severity of disease, comorbidities,and education levels and 29 physicians (14 western medi-cine [WM] and 15 Chinese medicine [CM]) with diverseclinical experience, academic background, and affiliationwere purposively sampled from private and public clinics.The perspectives were qualitatively analyzed by constantcomparative method with grounded theory approach. Results: Seven subthemes regarding barriers toward IM service were identified including finance, service access,advice from medical professionals, uncertainty of servicequality, uncertainty of CM effect, difficulty in understandingCM epistemology, and access to medical records. Patientsunderreported the use of CM and disregarded medical advice due to the concern over neutrality of medical advice and mutual understanding among both WM andCM physicians. Practical issues including inconvenience ofaccess to service, frequent follow-up, use of decoction andlong-term financial burden were identified as key obstaclesamong patients. Regarding research design, WM physiciansemphasized standardization and reproducibility, while CMphysicians emphasized personalization. Some CM-relatedoutcome measurements were suggested as abstract andnoncommunicable by patients and WM physicians. Physicians from both sides acknowledged the discordance in epistemology should be addressed by a more pragmaticapproach in clinical evaluation. Conclusion: Further assessment on IM should be pragmat- ic to balance between standardization, reproducibility, and real-world practice. Evidence-based IM programs should merge with existing infrastructure. Treatment modalityshould be user-friendly and affordable for patients withchronic condition. P07.09 Analyzing Complementary and Substitute Relationships Between Korean and Western Medicine Service Use ofOutpatients Youngeun Choi 1 1Korean Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea Contact: Youngeun Choi, wowo9129@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze com- plementary and substitute relationships between Koreanmedicine and western medicine service use of outpatientsAbstracts 131using the data from Korea medical panel survey invested in 2015 comparing to conducted study in 2009. Methods: Invested subjects were 18 130 individuals used outpatient medical service from the 2015 Korea healthpanel data set. General characteristics and medical utiliza-tion of all subjects and Korean medicine and western med- icine use by disease group were analyzed descriptively. v 2 analysis was conducted to analyze the factors that affected Korean medicine and western medicine service use of out-patients, and logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the complementary or substitute relationships between outpatient's choice of Korean medicine and west-ern medicine use. Additionally, we conducted logisticregression analysis by the 7 disease groups. Results: The rate of subjects in over 65 years group used both Korean medicine and western medicine togetherraised on 2015 compared to 2009. Also, the odds ratiosof substitute relationships between Korean medicine useand western medicine service use raised and the results of complementary and substitute relationship analysis by disease groups differed. Musculoskeletal diseases, injuries,addictions, and external diseases were used to substitutesin both 2009 and 2015 in relationship of substitute between Korean medicine use and western medicine use; however, nervous system diseases were used to relationship of sub-stitute in 2015 contrasted to relationship of substitute inrespiratory and skin system diseases in 2009. Conclusion: The result includes a combination of social aspects such as the increasing incidence of chronic diseasedue to the aging in recent, policy aspects such as the col-laborative pilot project between Korean medicine and west- ern medicine, economic aspects such as lower total cost of the collaborative treatment, and scientific aspects such asthe demonstration of the effects of the collaborativetreatment P07.10 Attitudes T oward Professional Collaboration: An International Survey Kieran Cooley1, Iva Lloyd2, and Jon Wardle3 1The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 2World Naturopathic Federation, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 3University of Technology, Sydney, Australia Contact: Kieran Cooley, kcooley@ccnm.edu Abstract Purpose: Collaboration between different tra- ditional, complementary (T&CM) and conventional medi- cine (CM) is a stated objective of the World HealthOrganization. Individual T&CM practitioners appear to bethe primary driver for intra- and interprofessional collabo- ration (IPC) within and between T&CM and CM with littleformal presence within T&CM professional associations andeducational institutions. T o understand this gap, this studyexplored attitudes, desire, and perceived barriers (AD&PB)that these bodies have toward IPC. Methods: National associations and educational institu- tions from 9 health-care professions(Ayurveda, Chiropractic, CM, raditional Chinese, Anthroposophic,Integrative, Naturopathic Osteopathic Medicine) weresurveyed Survey questionnaireexploring representative AD&PB towards IPC betweenT&CM and between T&CM and CM. The survey was sentto 692 potential participants (483 national organizations and209 educational institutions) between February and April2018. Results: Response rate from T&CM bodies was varied (6%-35%). Descriptively, there was a high degree of agree-ment on both the perceived benefits and obstacles withIPC;>80% indicated that the benefits of IPC included opportunity for best practices and preventive medicineand patient choice (treatment and health outcomes);>80% also indicated that communication and philosophical differences in health care are primary obstacles. Conclusion: There is agreement on the perceived value and barriers on engaging in IPC that result in diminisheddesire and capacity within T&CM professions. The results ofthis study emphasize the need for T&CM bodies to addressexisting attitudes, articulate a strategy, and develop educa-tion, training and guidelines for IPC. P07.11 A T ool to Facilitate Collaborative Research Among the Integrative Health and Medicine Professions James Whedon1, Kieran Cooley2, Courtney Everson3, John Finnell4, and Beth Rosenthal5 1Southern California University of Health Sciences, Whittier, California 2The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 3Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 4University of Texas School of Public Health, Dallas, Texas 5Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health, Chicago, Illinois Contact: Purpose: The Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health (ACIH) supports activities and projects in education,clinical care, research, and policy that are transforming our132 Global Advances in Health and Medicinehealth-care system into one that creates comprehensive health and well-being. The Research Working Group(RWG) of ACIH investigated the creation of a directoryof researchers that would facilitate collaboration in integra-tive health research by identifying individual researchers andinstitutions by their areas of interest and expertise.With such a research directory, researchers could moreeasily find each other, ultimately with the goal of catalyzing awareness, collaboration, and networking. Methods: RWG members explored the key elements of developing an online research directory through a series ofe-mail and virtual meetings. Currency, accuracy, accessibili- ty, and ability to moderate inclusions were identified as pri- orities. Pros and cons of developing our own platform,establishing a website-based \"directory,\" or using an exist-ing platform were considered. RWG members then expe-rienced and shared their assessment of Google Forms andResearchGate as existing web-based platforms. Results: After iterative consensus-based discussions under a strengths and risk-based lens,the RWG decided to create a networking space onResearchGate. Metrics regarding readership, project collab-oration and connections (social networking) will help eval-uate the success of this initiative. Conclusion: Researchers who wish to take advantage of this networking opportunity must first join ResearchGateand then join as a member of the \"Academic Collaborativefor Integrative Health Researcher Network Project.\" TheIntegrative Health Researcher Network Project thus servesas a hub for web-based networking with other like-mindedintegrative health and medicine researchers onResearchGate. P07.12 Personalized Nutrition Intervention: Machine-Learning Algorithm at the Intersection of Gaming, Medicine and Behavior Change Nicoleta de Deugd1and Robert Hage1 1St. de Deugd, ndedeugd@sgu.edu Abstract Purpose: Many people are addicted to foods that ultimate- ly cause disease. The leading causes of death in the United States are heart disease and cancer, both largely preventableby making behavioral changes. These attitudes are greatlyinfluenced by our education. Regardless of the efforts madeby various institutions to educate people about healthybehaviors, compliance is still low, and the number ofdeaths from these diseases is on the rise. We now know that the health status of a mother, not only at the moment of pregnancy, but also years before she becomes pregnant, greatly influences the health of her children. In other words, an obese or overweight woman will most likely give birth toa child that is predisposed to obesity, which raises his or her risk of death from chronic disease. Hence, an early inter- vention is recommended. Methods: Newtrima, an app in development, functions as a personalized virtual health and wellness space for women. It integrates baseline dietary recalls with other health metrics, such as microbiome and DNA profiling, and generates an avatar. This way women are interactively educated about healthy behaviors while using game as a learning tool.Thus, they vicariously learn what is suitable for them, by engaging with their own avatar that is programmed to deliv- er the optimal education for each individual. Results: Periodically, women do behavioral check-ins, including 24-hour dietary recalls, which are not only mea- suring the success of this method but are also helping the machine-learning algorithm to become more personalized. Conclusion: Currently, nutrition education (when exis- tent) is taught as an all-size-fits-all model. This approach does not deliver sustainable, long-term results. Furthermore, people who seek to learn more about healthy behaviors have to navigate through a myriad of conflicting information that is not well understood or trusted. A paradigm-shift from all-size-fits-all to a tailor-made model is apparent. P07.13 Trait Mindfulness Predicts Diabetes Distress in U.S. Veterans Monica DiNardo1, Ada Youk2, and Angela Phares1 1VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 2University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Contact: Monica DiNardo, mdinardo21@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: U.S. Veterans with diabetes often experience emotional distress including diabetes-distress (DD) that can lead to poor diabetes self-care and suboptimal glycemic control contributing to higher rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality than in the general U.S. population. Mindfulness is recognized as a beneficial factor in Veterans with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, but little is known about mindfulness in Veterans with diabetes. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between of mindfulness and glycemic control (A1C) with DD in Veterans.Abstracts 133Methods: Veterans (n \u00bc128) were recruited from an urban Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care system.Participants completed validated measures on mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale [MAAS]) and DD (Problem Areas in Diabetes Questionnaire [PAID]). A1C,a 3-month estimate of glycemic control, was obtained from the medical record. Univariate linear regression was used to examine the association between DD with mindfulness andwith A1C. Results: Veterans were generally older (60.8 /C610.3 massindex 33.81 /C65.98 kg/m 2) and had a duration of 13.07/C610.56 years and A1C of 8.67 /C61.57% (cut point for reasonable glycemic control /C208%). Mean MAAS score (4.30/C60.93) was consistent with the normative score in community adults, and mean PAID score was 37 /C620.42 (cut off for emotional burn-out /C2140). Regression models showed that MAAS mindfulness was a predictor of lower DD in Veterans. However, contrary to a large body of research in the general population, DD was not associatedwith glycemic control in Veterans. Further study of inde- pendent predictors of A1C in Veterans is needed to devel- op mindfulness-based strategies for improving glycemiccontrol, diabetes outcomes, and overall well-being in this population. P07.14 Perceived Peer Support Among Palliative Care Colleagues and the Effect ofAppreciation Focused Monthly Gatherings Cassidy Doucette 1and Julie Howell2 1Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah 2Team Member, Salt Lake City, Utah Contact: Cassidy Doucette, cassidy.doucette@hci.utah.edu Abstract Purpose: An interest in resilience among health-care pro- fessionals continues to rise as burnout rates climb. Strategies to reduce burnout and drive professional fulfill-ment include a focus on collegiality and sense of community.Perceived peer support has been linked to burnout and fulfillment. This project assesses the impact of monthly appreciation focused gatherings on perceived peer supportand well-being needs among palliative care providers. Methods: Wellness Champions from the Palliative Medicine Program at University of Utah participated in ayear-long structured quality improvement program focused on improving professional well-being. Pre/postsurvey dataincluded the Stanford fulfillment, peer support, burnout,stress, and needs assessment. Results: Pre-intervention well-being assessment ipants) demonstrated low (16.7% vsinstitution 30%), but perceived appreciation and supportfrom peers was low. Half of respondents (49.9%) reportedthat explicit appreciation by coworkers and 33% reportedexplicitly expressing appreciation. The needs assessmenthighly ranked collegiality efforts, closely followed by workflexibility and support. Priorities were echoed in responsesto the qualitative question \"What could help this team be abetter place for you to work?\" Based on results, leadershipendorsed monthly \"wellness gatherings\". Gatheringsoccurred during the last 1.5 hours of a work day. Locationand activity varied (from wine and cheese at a botanicalgarden to volunteering). Each gathering ended with anappreciation/gratitude exercise. Funding was provided by aResiliency Center grant. Six-month follow-up data arepending. Conclusion: Addressing well-being can be challenging. Using a data-driven approach to consider the uniqueneeds of groups can lead to increased buy-in. Pre/postmea-surement can allow ongoing process improvement tomodify programs to best meet the needs of faculty andstaff. Perceived peer support is known a driver of burnout.Measures that can improve support may have substantialdownstream impact on patient experience, cost, and qualityof care. P07.15 Cross-sectional Analysis of Spirituality and Substance Use Among Sexual Health Clinic Patients Eugene Dunne1and Michael Carey1 1Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island Contact: Eugene Dunne, eugene_dunne@brown.edu Abstract Purpose: Spirituality may play an important role in pre- venting risky substance use. The purpose of this studywas to explore spirituality and anger toward God as theyrelate to substance use. Methods: Patients (N \u00bc339; M age \u00bc28; 67% African American) receiving care at a publicly funded sexualhealth clinic completed a baseline survey. Alcohol-relatedconsequences were measured using the Short Inventory ofProblems\u2014Revised and spirituality and religious attitudeswere measured by the Attitudes toward God Scale134 Global Advances in Health and Medicine(ATGS-9). Cluster analysis determined whether distinct groups would emerge based on 2 dimensions (CG\u00bccomforted by God, AG \u00bcanger towards God) of the ATGS-9. Group differences were examined using mul- tivariate ANOVA controlling for baseline characteristics. Bonferroni correction was used for post hoc comparisonsof estimated marginal means. Results: The cluster analysis resulted in 4 distinct groups and demonstrated adequate model fit. An examination ofATGS-9 response patterns revealed the following character- istics of the 4 groups: (1) high spirituality and positive atti- tudes toward God, (2) moderate spirituality and positive attitudes toward God, (3) moderate spirituality and nega- tive attitudes toward God, or (4) low spirituality and neu-tral attitudes toward God. Significant mean differences were present among the 4 groups (F \u00bc8.96, P<.001). Specifically, participants with moderate levels of spirituality and negativeattitudes (eg, anger towards God) reported greater levels of alcohol related consequences (M \u00bc10.2) compared to those with high spirituality and positive attitudes(M\u00bc3.2), moderate spirituality and positive attitudes (M\u00bc3.9), and those with low spirituality and neutral atti- tudes (M \u00bc4.4). Conclusion: Alcohol-related consequences were preva- lent among patients who reported negative religious atti-tudes, such as anger towards God. Although the current analysis cannot determine causality, it highlights that spiri- tuality may play an important role in health behavior, partic-ularly among at-risk minority populations. P07.16 Integration of Acupuncture Into a T otal Joint Replacement Program: A Practice-Based Research Evaluation Jeffery Dusek 1, Francoise Adan2, Christine Kaiser2, and Jessica Surdam2 1University Ohio Contact: Jeffery Dusek, jeffery.dusek@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Beneficial outcomes have been reported from using acupuncture as an adjunct therapy, but there are few studies on acupuncture for postsurgical joint replace-ment patients. Our study focused on whether adjunctive acupuncture integrated into a total joint replacement pro- gram could contribute a nonpharmacological componentfor pain management. Methods: Clinical personnel provided acupuncture refer- rals in the electronic health record for patients admitted toUniversity Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center and scheduled for TKR or THR on a Monday between May 6, 2019 and July15, 2019. A licensed acupuncturist approached referred patients individually on the afternoon of surgery (day 0), the morning on the day after surgery (day 1) or both.Pre- and postscores for pain, anxiety, and stress were obtained by the acupuncturist verbally using a standard 11-point numeric rating scale. Similarly, anxiety and stressscores were obtained using the same methodology. After acupuncture, patients were also asked \"How would you rate the impact of acupuncture on your visit?\" on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Results: As an interim analysis of this IRB approved retro- spective record review, 102 patients offered acupuncture aspart of clinical services and 75% (79/102) elected to receive acupuncture. There was an average reduction in postacu- puncture pain scores of 1.0 points from 3.52 to 2.52. Theaverage reduction in postacupuncture anxiety scores was 0.91 points from 1.63 to 0.62. Postacupuncture stress scores were on average 0.69 points lower than the pre-acupuncture score from 1.36 to 0.62. Finally, the point of care question scores averaged 4.53, which is equally divided between somewhat positive and very positive responses. Conclusion: Results suggest that adjunctive acupuncture is a viable choice for reduction of pain, anxiety, and stress postTKR/THR. Additional results will be available at presenta- tion. Importantly, referring clinical personnel and patients reported strong enthusiasm for acupuncture as an adjunctfor enhanced pain management. P07.17 \"Be Fit\"\u2014A Pilot Hospital 1Columbia University, New York, New York 2Sacred Heart University, Fairfield, Connecticut 3Columbia Univeristy, Stamford, Connecticut 4Stamford Hospital, Stamford, Connecticut 5CIMW, lipoprotein cholesterol1 and impaired fasting glucose2are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the most prevalent cause of mor- tality in the United States; 42% of females and 34% of males in the United States have elevated cholesterol.3Over theAbstracts 135last 8 years, the Center for Integrative Medicine and Wellness has been utilizing a proprietary nutrition plan, the \"modified Mediterranean diet\" to significantly reduce weight, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose in ourpatients. 4,5In June 2018, an exercise portion with struc- tured, semipersonal training sessions for 60 minutes 2 /C2 per week was added to the program. We now present aninterim analysis of the results of the first 25 participants of this program. Methods: A list of the initial 25 participants of the Be-Fit program from June 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 wasgenerated from the electronic medical record. Inclusion cri- cholester- ol>200 mg/dL or lipids lowering medication, fasting blood glucose ( >100 mg/dL), or current smoker. Exclusion criteria: Pregnancy and children under the agedof 18 years.

Conclusion: This interim analysis clearly indicates that the initial phase of the hospital-sponsored Be-Fit program hasresulted in clinically meaningful reductions in weight, BMI,fasting blood glucose, and total cholesterol. P07.18 Assessing the Feasibility of Rural Primary Care Residency Training for LicensedNaturopathic Physicians in the Northwest Luciano Garofalo 1, Thomas Bell2, Gena Poling3, and Davis Patterson4 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 2NEW Health, Chewelah, Washington 3Bastyr University, Kenmore, Washington 4University of Washington, Seattle, Washington Contact: Luciano Garofalo, luciano.garofalo@student.nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: Naturopathic physicians (ND) are uniquely situ- ated to address areas of unmet health-care need in Oregon and Washington as primary care providers (PCPs). In bothstates, NDs have a broad scope of practice and are licensedas independent practitioners once graduating from their programs. However, with a larger role in the health-care system, the need for postgraduate residency trainingbecomes more important for clinical success and patient safety. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of develop- ing a residency program for licensed naturopathic physiciansin rural community health centers (CHCs) of Oregon and Washington. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with leadership at 8 CHCs. Six of the centers were rural, 2 of which already employed NDs. T wo urban centers that employed NDs as PCPs were included because they offeredvaluable insight to the study. The investigators independent- ly reviewed the notes from each site visit and coded them for prominent themes through inductive reasoning analysis.Results: Consensus was met for the following themes: onboarding and mentorship; increasing the diversity of clin- ical training for NDs; financial structure; length of residency;and addressing clear health-care needs in the community. Several key opportunities for naturopathic primary care residencies in rural communities were identified. Theseopportunities include the need for PCPs in rural communi- ties, the desire for nonpharmacologic management of chronic pain, and the prevention of morbidity from complexconditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Barriers to the development of rural primary care residencies for NDs include lack of Medicare reimbursement, differingawareness of the ND scope of practice, availability of ded- icated mentors, and the fitness of naturopathic interns' clin- ical training for rural primary care.Conclusion: These results may serve as guideposts for the future development of naturopathic primary care residen- cies in rural community health centers. P07.19 Identifying and Addressing Food Insecurity Within a Family Medicine Residency Clinic Amrien Ghouse, DO1, William Gunther, DO2, and Matthew Sebastian, DO2 Center for Integrative Medicine- Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois Health, Farmington Hills, Michigan Contact: Amrien Ghouse DO, amrien.ghouse@nm.org Abstract Purpose: We created and implemented a program to iden- tify and address Food Insecurity within our patient popula-tion in Metro Detroit. Our primary objective was to identify Food Insecurity within our patient population while136 Global Advances in Health and Medicineproviding our patients access to healthy food and increasing their nutritional knowledge. Methods: Patients were provided with a voluntary screen- ing survey upon checking in for their primary care visits.The questionnaire consisted of 5 questions that assessed their Food Security status over the past 12 months. Surveys were then reviewed and provided with a food secu-rity score. Patients that were identified to have a score oflow food security or very low food security were then selected to be part of a pilot group. Our initial pilot phase consisted of 10 participants that were enrolled in a6-week long workshop led by a chef and nutrition educator. A nationally recognized Cooking Matters curriculum was taught during class. The curriculum focused on providingaffordable and healthy recipes to adults with limited budg-ets. Participants were provided with targeted nutrition edu- cation, information on budgeting, and hands on meal prep- aration techniques. They concluded each session with a bagof groceries aided them in implementing the techniqueslearned during their weekly session and provided them with food for their household.Results: Of the 10 participants, initially enrolled-2 were unable to attend any sessions due to lack of transportation. One participant withdrew from the course after attending several sessions due to the content of the curriculum.Surveys provided to each participant after attending 50%of the workshop classes revealed that all participants found that the course was beneficial and increased their nutritional knowledge. Conclusion: Through the development of a screening pro- cess and program to provide qualifying patients with edu- cation and access to food, we are working to combat food insecurity while improving patient's overall health. P07.20 Feasibility of Care Coordination: Preventative Care and Patient Perceptionsin an Integrative Concierge Primary CarePractice Oliver Glass 1, Jane Pendergast1, Thrasher2, Carolina Contact: Oliver Glass, oliver.glass@duke.edu Abstract Purpose: Chronic diseases are leading drivers of health- care costs in the United States. Coordination of care is largely underutilized in the primary care setting to managepatients with chronic disease leading to continued fragmen- tation of care and increased health-care burden. Existingdata on coordination of care in an integrative health primarycare practice are limited. The purpose of this study was todetermine the feasibility of incorporating a nurse primarycare coordinator (PCC) into an integrative health primarycare concierge practice. Methods: This prospective 6-month trial was conducted at Duke Integrative Medicine, an integrative health primarycare concierge practice. Eligible participants were DukeIntegrative Primary Care practice members with 1 yearmembership. Participants (n \u00bc30) received 3 phone calls from a PCC over 6 months. PCC phone calls addressed members' health management. The primary aim was feasi-bility, measured by the completion of 3 phone calls facilitat-ed by the PCC. Secondary aims included change in patientsatisfaction and the number of additional health-care visitsand services utilized by study participants during the 6-month intervention. Magnitude of change over time wasassessed using a test of symmetry, implemented in theSAS (v4) FREQ procedure. Results: Adherence to the intervention was high: 93% of individuals completed 3 required study intervention phonecalls; 57% completed 3 phone calls with the PCC. Patientsatisfaction (n \u00bc28) improved over baseline for frequency of communication with primary care physician ( P\u00bc.05), fre- quency of communication with care ( P\u00bc.01), and member experience ( P\u00bc.01). The PCC intervention led to 35 additional clinical care visits(40% were preventative care). Conclusion: Primary care coordination by a nurse was a feasible intervention that increased patient satisfaction and led to additional preventative clinical care visits. P07.21 Comparison of Naive and Nonnaive Treatment Groups in the PRIMIER Study North Carolina 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 3University Hospitals Connor Integrative Health Network, Cleveland, Ohio 4Osher Center for Integrative Medicine-Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 5University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, Massachusetts Contact: Oliver Glass, oliver.glass@duke.eduAbstracts 137Abstract Purpose: Previous studies indicate that those with prior exposure (nonnaive) to integrative medicine modalities (eg, acupuncture, tai-chi, meditation) may have more robust therapeutic responses than those with no prior exposure(naive). Using existing data within the Patients ReceivingIntegrative Medicine Effectiveness Registry (PRIMIER), we explored whether naive participants have differential patient-reported outcome measures to integrative medi-cine therapies than nonnaive participants.Methods: Linear mixed-models were used to compare change scores of naive (n \u00bc352) and nonnaive (n \u00bc2283) treatment groups at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12- months for PROMIS measures: Anxiety, Depression, SleepDisturbance, Pain Interference, Pain, Physical Function, Fatigue, Quality-of-Life (QOL), and Social Supplement. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Patient ActivationMeasure (PAM) were also included. Least square meanswere calculated from model estimates.Results: Both naive and nonnaive treatment groups indi- cated statistically significant improvements over baseline measures at 12 months for PROMIS Anxiety, Depression, Sleep, Fatigue, Social, PSS, and PAM ( P<.01). Between- group differences indicated that the naive treatment group had a significantly greater reduction in PROMIS Fatigue 95% CI [/C03.5/C01.3] than the nonnaive group [ /C01.5 /C00.4] at 12 months ( P<.05). Compared to the nonnaive group, the naive treatment group had significant improve- ments in change score for PROMIS Physical Function at 4 months ( P<.01); QOL at 4 and 6 months ( P<.05); Sleep and Pain Interference at 6 months ( P<.05); and Fatigue at 12 months ( P<.05). Conclusion: Patients without prior exposure to integra- tive medicine therapies may have greater benefit than those with prior exposure. Further comparison of naive treat-ment groups to nonnaive treatment groups in randomized controlled trials is warranted. Caution should be used when interpreting patient reported outcome measures in studiesthat include both naive and nonnaive patients. P07.22 Health Coaching in an Integrative Health Primary Care Concierge Practice: A CarolinaContact: Oliver Glass, oliver.glass@duke.edu Abstract Purpose: Health coaching is a patient-centric approach to facilitating self-management of health behaviors across acute and chronic health conditions through goal setting. Despitethe positive benefits of health coaching in clinical settings, few studies have evaluated its integration into an integrative health primary care practice. The purpose of this study is toassess the feasibility of incorporating health coaching into aprimary care integrative health concierge practice. Methods: Patients of Duke Integrative Primary Care (DIPC) who are established members were eligible to par- ticipate in this 6-month clinical study. Interested patients (n\u00bc30) that scored a level 2 or level 3 on a baseline Patient Activation Measure (PAM) and self-identified asbeing interested in coaching were offered enrollment. In May 2019, the first cohort (n \u00bc15) of patients began receiv- ing health coaching. Board-certified health coaches deliv-ered 9 coaching sessions per participant over 3 months. Health coaching sessions occurred over the telephone or in person at DIPC. The primary outcome of the study isfeasibility, defined as the total number of sessions attendedby all participants. Secondary outcome measures include 3- month and 6-month change from baseline in PAM, PROMIS Global, and a patient satisfaction survey. Paired ttests were used to compare baseline and 3-month PAM and PROMIS scores. Results: Mid-point analysis indicates 100% of coaching ses- sions attended by the first cohort. Mean PAM score improved from 59.8 /C65.8 (level 3) at baseline to 71.3 /C6 13.0 (level 4) at 3 months, P<.05. PROMIS Global Physical Health T Score increased from 46.7 /C67.2 (good) at baseline to 50.2 /C67.1 (very good) at 3 months, P>.05. PROMIS Global Mental Health T score increased from 48.6 /C66.4 (very good) at baseline to 51.1 /C67.3 (very good) at 3 months, P>.05. Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest that health coach- ing in an integrative health primary care concierge practice is a feasible and effective strategy to improve patient acti- vation and physical and mental health. P07.24 Getting Ahead: An Novel, Integrative Health Approach to Tackling Poverty in Primary Care Heidi Gullett1and Kurt Stange1 1Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Heidi Gullett, heidi.gullett@case.edu138 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: Poverty remains a recalcitrant determinant of health. Clinicians, working in a health system that increas-ingly commodifies and fragments care, frequently see theresults of upstream heath determinants but are not sup-ported to meaningfully address them. Getting Ahead is a promising approach to helping people to move out of pov- erty by exploring how economic class impacts interactionsat the individual, organizational, and community levels. Methods: Cohorts of patients ranging in age from 18 to 83 work together at a community health center in Cleveland,for sixteen 2.5-hour sessions exploring their own and theircommunity's experience of poverty. Participants begin by creating a mental model of life now and then continue with a facilitated exploration of the causes of poverty, thehidden rules of economic class including language, theoriesof change, and individual and community resources.Participants then create individual and community futurestories. Results: During Getting Ahead, clinicians are afforded unparalleled insight into their patients' lives creating pow- erful context for improved health. Participants in the first 4Getting Ahead cohorts have returned to high school,enrolled in GED completion programs, set boundaries inunhealthy relationships, obtained employment in multiplesettings, engaged in a neighborhood painting project,obtained driving permits, quit smoking, maintained sobrietyin the setting of significant social stressors, and sought inde-pendent living arrangements. There are measurable out- comes including life stability, optimism, hope, perceived stress, 11 areas of resource acquisition, development of afuture orientation, and improved preventive health care. Conclusion: The application of Getting Ahead in clinical settings offers a promising integrative health approach byaddressing poverty in a health-care setting. Innovations inservices that offer opportunity for development of a future orientation have the potential to yield creative, community- driven solutions to poverty in which the state of well-beingin body, mind, and spirit can be fully realized for individualsand communities. P07.23 Expansion and Further Validation of Markov Model Results on the Cost- Effectiveness of Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Chronic Low Back Pain Patricia Herman1 1RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California Contact: Patricia Herman, pherman@rand.orgAbstract Purpose: The results of a decision analytic (Markov) model were recently published showing the 1-year effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (societal and payer perspectives) of adding 17 nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic lowback pain from 10 randomized trials to usual care. That model and its results illustrate a proof of concept; that such modeling can be done and provide useful results. This study further tests this model by adding the results of 7 additional interventions from 5 trials. Methods: As before, the model includes 4 health states: high-impact chronic pain (substantial activity limitations); nopain; and 2 others without activity limitations, but with higher (moderate-impact) or lower (low-impact) pain. We followed previous methods to estimate intervention- specific transition probabilities for these health states using individual patient-level data and where required, pre-viously developed prediction models. We also used the same quality-adjusted life-year weights; health-care costs (based on 2003-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data); and lost productivity costs for each health state as in the original model. Results: The new studies added 2 new arms for acupunc- ture: 1 more cost-effective and 1 less cost-effective than the2 existing acupuncture arms. The new studies also added 2 new arms for yoga. Both were less cost-effective than the one we had in the model, which could be expected given the extreme benefits shown in the existing study. The stud- ies also added 2 group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)arms with remarkably similar cost-effectiveness. The results for the CBT and MBSR arms also compared favorably with other published cost-effectiveness results for that studybased on actual changes in health-care utilization. Conclusion: Modeling leverages the evidence produced from clinical trials to provide more information and better comparability than is available in the published stud- ies. This study illustrated the benefit and feasibility of adding additional studies to the model. P07.25 Paradigm-Specific Risk Conceptions, Patient Safety, and the Regulation ofTraditional and Complementary Medicine Practitioners: The Case of Homeopathy in Ontario, Canada Nadine Ijaz 1 1University of Ijaz, nadine.ijaz@utoronto.caAbstracts 139Abstract Purpose: The statutory regulation of traditional and com- plementary medicine providers has been identified by the World Health organization as a strategy for enhancing patient safety. However, the concept of risk is neitherstatic nor epistemologically neutral. Conventional biomedi-cine's risk conceptions are substantially rooted in principles of scientific materialism, while many traditional and comple- mentary medicine systems have vitalistic epistemic under-pinnings that give rise to distinctive safety considerations.This study investigates the statutory negotiation of differ- ential risk conceptions in the context of traditional and complementary medicine's professional regulation. Methods: Elaborating a theoretical concept of \"paradigm- specific risk conceptions,\" this work employs Bacchi's post-structural mode of policy analysis (\"What's the Problem Represented to Be?\") to critically analyze risk discourse in government documents pertaining to the 2015 statutory reg-ulation of homeopathic practitioners in Ontario, Canada. Thiscase is of particular salience given that homeopathy's episte- mic framework is widely considered biomedically implausible. Results: The Ontario government's preregulatory risk assessment for occupational homeopathy took an epistemi- cally inclusive approach which emphasized homeopathy-specific risk conceptions. Such homeopathy-specificconcepts, epistemically rooted in vitalism, extend beyond materialist constructions of adverse events and clinical omis- sion to address potential harms from \"proving symptoms,\" \"aggravation,\" new homeopathy subsequently articulated safetycompetencies addressing such vitalistic concepts, the tangiblerisk management strategies ultimately mandated for practi- tioners exclusively addressed risks epistemically consistent with scientific materialism. This policy approach substantiallyechoes the implicit biomedical underpinnings evident in Ontario's broader legislative context but leaves a significant policy gap regarding the primary safety issues originally artic-ulated to justify homeopaths' statutory regulation. Conclusion: T o optimally preserve patient safety and full informed consent, regulators should favor a pragmatic, epi-stemically inclusive approach that actively negotiates paradigm-specific risk conceptions from both biomedicine and the traditional or complementary medicine occupation-al group under governance.P07.26 A Survey of Acupuncture-Providing Registered Massage Therapists in Ontario,Canada: Motivation, Training, and Ijaz 1, Sandy Welsh1, nadine.ijaz@utoronto.ca Abstract Purpose: An increasing number of massage therapists in several countries are providing acupuncture to their clientsbut little is known about this practice. This study aims tocharacterize the motivations, training backgrounds, practice patterns, and clinical experiences of massage therapists who perform acupuncture. Methods: The authors used a cross-sectional, online survey design involving acupuncture-providing registeredmassage therapists (RMTs) in the province of Ontario,Canada, where acupuncture is included in massage therapy'sscope. Analysis involved descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis of qualitative findings. Results: The survey response rate was 33.7% (n \u00bc212), representing 25.5% of all Ontario RMTs rostered to prac-tice acupuncture. Participant demographics mirrored theprofession as a whole, except that providers were on aver-age several years older than other RMTs. Most respondents(72.7%) had completed over 200 hours of training in acu- puncture; most trainings included clean needle technique (96.8%), clinical supervision (93.5%), traditional Chinesemedicine content (83.4%), and a final examination (96.8%).Respondents typically used acupuncture in about one-thirdof their sessions (mean 32.3%, standard deviation [SD] 5.0)with an average of 10.5 weekly clients (SD 14.3).Acupuncture-providing RMTs had been initially motivatedby acupuncture's potential effectiveness for musculoskeletalconditions (97.2%), a wish to attract more clients (61.3%), and physical fatigue from delivering manual therapies (48.3%). Most reported being more likely to achieve excel-lent clinical results (84.9%), experience greater professionalsatisfaction (79.9%), and attract or retain clients (64.8%)since using acupuncture. A minority also reported earninga higher income (34.6%) and experiencing more adverseevents in practice (21.5%). Qualitative responses addedexplanatory nuance to numeric results. Conclusion: The use of acupuncture by massage therapists represents an emerging trend that holds promise in enhanc-ing clinical care, professional stability and provider longevity.Additional research is needed to establish internationalstandards for safe and effective acupuncture practice inthis practitioner group.140 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP07.27 Effects of Inpatient Integrative Medicine on Readmission Rates and Length of Stay Kevin James1, Annie Zhang2, and Andrew Shubov2 1David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California 2University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California Contact: Kevin James, kjjames@mednet.ucla.edu Abstract Purpose: UCLA East-West Medicine is an integrative med- icine specialty service which utilizes both \"western\" and traditional Chinese medical techniques to improve patienthealth and well-being. Recently, a full-time physician-led inpatient program has been established to provide integra- tive East-West (EW) medicine consultations at the 281-bedUCLA Santa Monica Hospital. This study seeks to quantify the effectiveness of inpatient EW medicine by evaluating the effect of the new inpatient integrative medicine consultationservice on readmission rates and hospitalization lengths of stay. Methods: EW consultations were identified through chart review. Patients were included in the study if they had been admitted within the 2 years prior to their first EW consul-tation, which allowed us to calculate baseline length of stay (LOS) and 30-day readmission rates for this patient popu- lation prior to EW consultation. Hospitalization/admissionsdates and expected and observed length of stay data were obtained from electronic health records through Vizient software. T o account for admission complexity, observedLOS was normalized against expected LOS to determine an O/E ratio. A total of 266 unique patients and 1702 admis- sions were analyzed. Of the 1702 admissions, the 326 thatincluded an EW consultation were compared against the 1376 that did not. Results: The average O/E ratio before EW involvement was 1.15847, and the average O/E after EW involvement was 1.34381 ( P\u00bc.006). The baseline 30-day readmission rate for this population prior to EW consultation was 38.44%. The rate of 30-day readmissions for admissions that included an EW consultation was 25.15% ( P<.0001). Conclusion: Patients for whom EW consultation is requested tend to have greater than average LOS andreadmission rates. EW consultations reduced 30-day read- mission rates but increased LOS. This supports further investigation into the value of integrative medicine in theinpatient setting.P07.28 Contributing to Global Health\u2014 Development of a Consensus-Based Research Strategy for a Whole Medicine and Health System, Anthroposophic Medicine \u20acoke9 1Center for Complementary Medicine, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Medical Center\u2014University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg 2IFAEMM at the University of Witten/Herdecke, Freiburg, Germany 3Integrative Oncology Program, Oncology Service, Lin Medical Center, Clalit Health Services, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel 4Institute for Integrative Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Herdecke, Germany 5Program of Health Policy, Systems and Management.

One key featureis the focus on patient-centered and multimodal care andthe integration of intercultural perspectives in a wide range of settings. The authentic, rigorous, and fair evaluation of such a medical system, with its inherent complexity andindividualization, imposes methodological challenges. Methods: T o develop a research strategy for a specific T&CM system, anthroposophic medicine (AM), we used a3-phase consensus process with experts and key stakehold-ers, consisting of pre-meeting methodological literature andAM research review and interviews, face-to-face consensus meetings, and postmeeting feedback and review. Results: AM covers many medical specialties in outpatient and inpatient, primary, secondary, and tertiary care; in health education and pedagogy. It is integrated with conven- tional medicine in the public health-care system. It appliesspecific medicines, nursing techniques, arts therapies,Abstracts 141eurythmy therapy, rhythmical massage, counseling, and psy- chotherapy. A research strategy focuses on (I) efficacy and effectiveness\u2014divided into evaluation of the multimodaland multidisciplinary medical system as a whole, a reason- able amount of confirmatory randomized controlled trials on exemplary therapies and indications, the wide range ofinterventions and patient-centered care strategies with less extensive formats like well-conducted small trails, observa- tional studies, high-quality case reports andnosological issues as well as innovation and development; (VI) patient perspective and involvement, public needs, ethics; (VII) educational matters and professionalism; and(IX) disease prevention, health promotion, and public health. Conclusion: The research strategy may provide transpar- ent and comprehensive insight into potential benefits or risks of AM and can serve as a framework for an evidence-informed approach for a variety of stakeholdersand collaborating networks with the aim of improving global health. P07.30 Naturopathic Approaches to Cancer Screening and Prevention: A QualitativeStudy Evan Barnathan 1, Mike Kohut2, Devra Craig Schneider4 1Maine Medical Center, Portland, Maine 2Maine Medical Center Research Institute, Portland, Maine 3Unaffiliated, Portland, Maine 4Tufts University School of Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: Mike Kohut, mkohut@mmc.org Abstract Purpose: Research suggests that patients receiving care from both CAM providers and MDs or DOs experience higher rates of breast and cervical cancer screening thanthose receiving care from MD/DOs alone. We explored practices of cancer screening and prevention among natu- ropathic doctors (NDs) in Maine to identify opportunitiesfor collaboration between MD/DOs and NDs and to improve access to cancer screening and prevention. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 out of Maine's 37 licensed NDs, eliciting practices of cancer screening and prevention as well as experiences col- laborating with MD/DOs. Transcribed interviewsunderwent inductive-deductive coding and were analyzed for content and themes via the constant comparativemethod. Results: Cancer screening practices varied among NDs, but no participants were opposed to cancer screening.Most participants believed their primary role was incancer prevention rather than screening. All were accus-tomed to working with MD/DOs, referring patients to them when needed. Many NDs reported acting as a bridge to obtaining cancer screening and other medicalcare for patients who would otherwise avoid MD/DOs.Generally, naturopathic principles are consistent with rou-tine cancer screening though participants suggested that patient preference and individual risk may impact the force- fulness of their recommendations. Despite an overall will-ingness to recommend cancer screening, participantsreferred to several barriers to screening and to workingwith MD/DOs including perceived prejudicial attitudesfrom MD/DOs and concerns over cost and insurance cov- erage for cancer screening. Conclusion: Licensed naturopathic doctors assist people in providing individualized care plans founded in nutrition and lifestyle and providing health care to some who may feel disconnected to conventional medical providers. Our find-ings suggest that, with support, NDs can help to ensureappropriate cancer screening, particularly among patientswho avoid conventional medicine. Encouraging better com-munication between NDs and MD/DOs has potential to improve access to cancer screening and prevention. P07.32 Use of Cannabis in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel of Internal Medicine, Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of medicinal cannabis opens up potential new applications, for example, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the present study was toexamine the prevalence of use and experiences with the useof cannabis in German patients with IBD. Methods: In early 2019, 1000 IBD patients were surveyed about the use of conventional and complementary142 Global Advances in Health and Medicineprocedures, including the use of and experience with medicinal cannabis. Prevalence and associations with socio- demographic and health characteristics were analyzed using SPSS. Results: Of 1000 enrolled participants, 412 respondents participated in the study (mean age 49.1 /C617.0 years, 55.8% women, 43.8% ulcerative colitis and 54.3% Crohn's disease). A total of 71 participants (17.2%) said that theyhad used cannabis for recreational purposes in the past, and11 participants indicated current recreational use (2.7%); 17participants each (4.1%) said that they currently used can-nabis or have used it to treat their IBD in the past. Cannabis users reported lower quality of life and higher anxiety or depression than nonusers. Current users reported greaterefficacy of cannabis than former users, with the biggesteffects reported for pain, appetite, and mood. The mostcommon side effects included marijuana high, drowsiness and a dry mouth, the main reasons for stopping the treat- ment were lack of (legal) acquisition, as well as the absenceof symptoms. A majority of patients did not inform theirtreating physicians about the cannabis use. Conclusion: The use of cannabis in the treatment of IBD is not very common and is not discussed by the majority ofusers with the treating physicians. Further research isneeded to generate evidence for the therapeutic use of(medicinal) cannabis in IBD. P07.34 Integrative Therapies to Pediatric Inpatient Marrow Transplantation Center:Experience With Written Narratives Contact: Massola, ester.azevedo@einstein.br Abstract Purpose: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been used in children as treatment for an increasing number of hematological diseases and solid tumors. Pediatrics requirescomplex multidimensional interactions between physicians,multidisciplinary team, patient, and family, especially in longhospitalizations such as in BMT. Integrative therapies (ITs) teach inpatients and caregivers tools for self-care, stress, and anxiety management, helping to elicit the relaxationresponse. Experience report of the Integrative Medicine(IM) Group in compassionate care for children and theirfamilies during BMT using a qualitative approach in a private tertiary hospital. Methods: Since 2013, 123 pediatric patients underwent BMT; 80% of those were between ages of 0 to 11 (mean ages was 6) and 57% were males. The median length of hospital stay was 44 days. For nonmalignant diseases, indi-cation of BMT was in diagnosis in 35% (27). Malignant ALL 35% (16), solid tumors 26% (12),and lymphoma 15% (7). The IM Group is part of the hos- pital's multidisciplinary team, IT sessions take place in the patient's room by hided body therapists. T echniques such asyoga, touch therapy, empathic listening, and play are used with compassionate care for inpatients and their families. Sessions last 40 minutes, 3 times a week. They were invitedto write a narrative about IM care voluntarily. Results: In written narratives, parents reported and \"calm.\" IT go beyond symptom manage- ment and are related to bonding, autonomy, and building a sense of security.Conclusion: Qualitative approach evidenced the effective- ness of intervention from the point of view of those involved in care process. IT with compassionate careoffers noncognitive paths to achieve peaceful inner state, may be able to elicit sensations of wellbeing, relax and calm, helping patients and families positively in long hospital-izations and dealing better in BMT . P07.35 Drawing Parallels Between Complementary and Alternative MedicineProfessions Regulated Then and Now Jeremy Y. Ng 1and Julia Abelson1 1Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,CanadaContact: Jeremy Y. Ng, ngjy2@mcmaster.ca Abstract Purpose: This study seeks to explain the regulation of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) health pro- fessions, through the comparison of 4 distinct examples in Ontario, Canada including chiropractors, naturopaths,homeopaths, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prac- titioners. These 4 professions were specifically selected to analyze whether parallels could be drawn between thosethat were regulated nearly 100 years ago and those that were regulated less than 6 years ago.Abstracts 143Methods: This study analyzes the agenda setting and policy development stage of the policy process, or in other words, what happened between stakeholders before each of these CAM professions achieved regulation. Alford's model ofdominant, challenging and repressed structured interests (DSIs, CSIs, and RSIs, respectively) is used to describe the competition that took place between various players within the health-care system and their position in the health policy process. Alford's theory serves to explain these rela-tionships between and among members of both conven- tional and CAM professions. Results: Parallels could be drawn between the CAM prac- titioners regulated in the 1920s and those recently regulat- ed. Each of the 4 CAM professions has existed as a RSI atsome point in their history, however, over the last century, and has sought to align themselves with various (or even become) CSIs in order to be recognized as a regulated health profession. Conclusion: While exceptions certainly exist, this analysis would suggest that beyond time and financial resources, unregulated CAM professions may increase their likelihood of becoming regulated if they (1) gain popularity/strong sup-port from patients or the general public; (2) organize them- selves sufficiently that they pose a direct threat to 1 or more scopes of practice desirable by the DSIs; and/or (3) are willing to adopt standards in education, training, and ethics that may (initially) reduce their scope of practice or profession's membership or slow their profession's growth. P07.36 Utilization Patterns of Integrative Medicine Modalities Among Patients With Obesity inthe PREMIER Study Jacinda Nicklas and Jeff Dusek6 1University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 2Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 3Department of Family Medicine, UC Health Integrative Medicine Center, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado 4Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 5Department of Family Medicine and Community Health University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts 6University Hospitals, UH Connor Integrative Health Network, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Jacinda Nicklas, jacinda.nicklas@ucdenver.edu Abstract Purpose: Obesity is associated with increased burden of disease and use of allopathic medicine. Previous studiessuggest that adults with obesity are less likely to use inte- grative medicine (IM) modalities than normal weight adults. Using data from a large observational study of IM clinics, we sought to determine which IM modalities were used by patients with obesity and to examine their changes in patient-reported outcomes over time. Methods: The PRIMIER (Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Interventions Effectiveness Registry) study enrolled 4954 patients from August 2013 to October 2017 across 17 U.S.-based IM sites. Recruited patients com- pleted online surveys, including the PROMIS-29, a validated survey instrument for patient reported outcomes (physical function, pain interference, and fatigue), and patient activa- tion measure (PAM). We analyzed a subgroup of 636 patients with a body mass index (BMI) /C2130 kg/m2who com- pleted 2 or more surveys and evaluable EHR data over 1 year of follow-up. We assessed their baseline conditions, modality use, and change in self-reported patient outcomesover time. Results: Patients with obesity had a mean BMI of 35.9 (standard deviation /C65.4) kg/m 2, age of ( /C613), were 81% females, 83% white, and 9% black. Patients completing their baseline survey were most likely to report being seen for chronic pain (22%), acute pain (10%), a wellness visit (9%), and fibromyalgia/myofascial pain (7%). The most common modalities used at baseline were IM physician con- sult (35%), followed by acupuncture supplements/bota- nicals/vitamins (9%). Patients with obesity showed signifi- cant improvements from baseline to 12 months in physical function ( P\u00bc.0375), pain interference ( P\u00bc.0057), fatigue (P\u00bc.0001), and patient activation ( P/C20.0001). Conclusion: IM patients with obesity in a large cohort study were most likely to be seen for pain and most likely to utilize physician consults and acupuncture. Overall, there was a significant change in patient-reported outcomes. P07.37 Veteran Perceptions of Care Delivery and Research Methods in a Lot Clinical Trial of Hiropractic for Low Back Pain: AQualitative 1Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research, Davenport, Iowa 2Iowa City VA Health Care System, Iowa City, Iowa 3The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 4Duke University, Durham, North Carolina144 Global Advances in Health and MedicineContact: Stacie Salsbury, stacie.salsbury@palmer.edu Abstract Purpose: Low back pain (LBP) is a common condition among military veterans seeking treatment in Departmentof Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care facilities. As chiroprac-tic services within VA expand, well-designed, pragmatictrials, and implementation studies of the clinical effective-ness and program uptake of such interventions are needed.This study evaluated veterans' perceptions of the feasibilityof care delivery and research processes in a pilot trial con-ducted in preparation for a federally funded, large-scale,multisite, pragmatic randomized clinical trial of chiropracticdosage for LBP in VA. Methods: The design was a qualitative study within a single-arm, pilot trial of chiropractic care for LBP conductedwithin 2 VA chiropractic clinics (NCT032547219). We con-ducted semistructured in-person or telephone interviewswith trial participants near the end of their participationin the 10-week trial. Interviews were audiorecorded, tran-scribed, and analyzed using inductive and deductive qualita-tive strategies. Qualitative content analysis explored theacceptability and feasibility of trial methods and informedrecommendations regarding VA-based chiropractic care. Results: T wenty-four of 40 veterans completed interviews (response rate 60%). Findings provided critical informationfor planning a VA-based clinical trial of chiropractic care andoffered insights into the current delivery of chiropracticservices in this setting. Care delivery themes included treat-ment scheduling challenges (wait times, treatment frequen-cy, and staffing); doctor-patient relationships with VA chi-ropractors (active listening, adjusting ability, self-carerecommendations, and understanding VA culture); andhealth-care communication within VA (interprofessionalcommunication and electronically mediated patient commu-nications). Clinical trial planning suggestions focused onimproving the relevance, burden, and timing of selectedoutcome measures; enhancing on-line data collection viaREDCap; refining participant recruitment (altruism andincentives); and creating a healing clinic environment. Conclusion: Our evaluations highlighted veterans' percep- tions of the benefits of VA-based chiropractic services, iden-tified areas for improvement in service delivery, and offeredsuggestions for conducting a large-scale, veteran-focusedclinical trial of chiropractic care.P07.38 Utilization of Complementary and Integrative Health Services in Veterans With Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Pain in VA: Where Can We Do Better? Karen Seal1, Daniel Bertenthal2, Jennifer Tighe2, and Natalie Purcell2 1San Francisco VA Health Care System, San Francisco, California 2San Francisco VA, San Francisco, California Contact: Karen Seal, karen.seal@va.gov Abstract Purpose: In response to the opioid epidemic, Veterans Affairs (VA) accelerated implementation of Whole Health(WH) and Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH)services for veterans. We describe CIH utilization patternsin veterans with moderate-to-severe chronic pain. Methods: From August 15, 2018 to August 15, 2019, at 5 VA health-care systems across the United States, we usedthe VA electronic health record to categorize CIH utiliza- tion in veterans with moderate-to-severe chronic pain (Numeric Rating Scale /C215): (1) any CIH utilization; (2) CIH clinical (3) Coaching; and (4) other CIH services. We describe sociodemographic and other factors associated with CIH utilization. Results: Among 34 848 veterans with moderate-to-severe chronic pain, over one-quarter (N \u00bc10 389, 27%) had used any CIH services. Of these, CIH wellness services (eg, Y oga,Tai Chi, etc) were the most frequently used (15%), followedby WH coaching and education (13%) and clinical services (eg, chiropractic, etc). CIH utili- zation varied by veteran subpopulations. Women versus men, younger versus older, and urban versus rural veteransused more CIH services. Veterans prescribed opioids mostfrequently were the least likely to utilize any CIH, but whenthey did, they used CIH clinical services (eg, acupuncture; chiropractic) than wellness services. In contrast, veterans with pain not prescribed opioids used more CIH wellnessservices and WH coaching than CIH clinical care. Nearlyone-third of veterans with chronic pain and 1 or moremental health problems used some form of CIH. Conclusion: A large proportion of veterans with chronic pain, including those with comorbid mental health prob-lems, are using CIH. Nevertheless, VA needs to improve access to CIH among rural and older veterans and to encourage veterans prescribed opioids to use more activeCIH modalities as part of their pain care plans.Abstracts 145P07.39 Adverse Events Attributed to Traditional Korean Medical Practices: 1999 to 2016 Hyeun-Kyoo Shin1 1Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Republic of Korea Contact: Hyeun-Kyoo Shin, hkshin@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: In many countries, medical practices that are categorized as traditional, complementary, and/or alterna- tive are common and the focus of current advocacy.Although some traditional medical practices appear benefi- cial, many remain untested and there is little relevant mon- itoring or control. Our knowledge of the adverse effects ofsuch practices is therefore very limited. This hampers the identification of the safest and most effective traditional practices and medicines. Methods: Adverse events recorded in the Republic of Korea between 1999 and 2010\u2014by the Food and DrugAdministration, the Consumer Agency or the Association of T raditional Korean Medicine\u2014were reviewed. Records of adverse events attributed to the use of traditional med-ical practices, including reports of medicinal accidents and consumers' complaints, were investigated. Results: As part of the national system of pharmacovigi- lance, Food and Drug Administration collects data. Only 5 adverse drug reactions were recorded by theAdministration in 1988, but the number of such adverseevents recorded each year has since grown, from 148 637 between 1999 and 2002 to 228 939 in 2016. Between 1999 and 2016, Consumer Agency received complaints from con-sumers\u2014about drugs and other medical treatments in gen- eral. Over the same period, the percentage of each year's resolved disputes that were related to traditional Koreanmedicine\u20142.2% (6 of 271) in 1999 and 2.6% (20 of 761) in 2010 and 4.2% (32 of 762)\u2014showed little variation. Conclusion: In the Republic of Korea, traditional medical practices often appear to have adverse effects, yet almost all of the adverse events attributed to such practices between1999 and 2010 were missed by the national pharmacovigi- lance system. The Consumer Agency and the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine should be included in thenational pharmacovigilance system.P07.41 Chronic Pain Management in Integrative Group Medical Access toNonpharmacologic Ariana Thompson-Lastad, ariana.thompson-lastad@ucsf.edu Abstract Purpose: Major U.S. medical associations and government agencies have called for expanded access to complementary and integrative health (CIH) for chronic pain, yet lack ofinsurance reimbursement has been a major barrier to CIH implementation. In response, some safety-net clinics have begun implementing integrative group medical visits (IGMVs). These models aim to ameliorate health-care dis- parities through combining CIH, peer support/education, and standard primary care. We used multisited qualitative research to understand conditions that make IGMVs for chronic pain feasible in safety-net settings and identify con- ditions that limit their expansion. Methods: We draw on data from 2 qualitative research projects and conducted at organizations serving ethnically diverse, low-income, multilingual patient populations. We conducted 114 hours of ethnographic observations of IGMVs at 11 clinics in the San Francisco and Boston areas and interviewed 30 IGMV staff and 25 patients. Field notes and interviews from each project were coded separately using grounded theory methods. After data collection wascompleted, we analyzed overlapping codes from the 2 data sets to understand implementation of IGMVs for pain management. Results: We found 3 conditions that made IGMVs for chronic pain feasible in safety-net settings: (1) the current opioid crisis, (2) uncertainty surrounding chronic pain and its treatment, and (3) clinicians with specific commitments to IGMVs. IGMVs have been spearheaded by individual clini- cians rather than organizational or policy changes, and as such, their expansion has been limited. T wo conditions char- acterized this restricted expansion: (1) uncertainty about who could benefit most from particular treatments and (2) continued stratification of CIH access. Despite these constraints, IGMV patients and staff responded to varying levels of institutional support with mutual innovation. Conclusion: Our research points to the potential of IGMVs for treating chronic pain and decreasing opioid use while demonstrating that IGMVs continue as an innovation by individual providers rather than broad reforms.146 Global Advances in Health and MedicineP07.43 Current Status of North Korean Traditional Medicine Research\u2014Using BibliometricAnalysis of a North Korean TraditionalMedical Contact: Eunhee Yi, ehyi@kiom.re.kr Abstract Purpose: The health-care system in North Korea is not working properly due to lack of financial resources and medicines. As the using of traditional medicine \"Korean medicine\" which is relatively less affected by sanctions,and related to the ideology of the regime has been increased in North Korea. The aim is to analyze the current status of North Korean traditional medicine research through the analysis of a North Korean traditional medical journal: KOREAN MEDICINE . Methods: T o research output, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of KOREAN MEDICINE research from 2016 to 2019. This includes 999 papers in 14 issues of the Journal of KOREAN MEDICINE published from past 3 years. We ana- lyzed the papers and structurally extract information regarding the papers to create data. The main items of data are research purpose, research method, disease, treat- ment, Western medicine, and number of study subjects. We analyzed what research has been conducted according to each year, each treatment, and each disease. Results: In North Korea's Journal of KOREAN MEDICINE , the most researches on diseases of the digestive system (KCD K00-K93) accounted 16.9%. common intervention was nondrug therapy (55.9%), drugs (40.0%), and diagnostic methods (4.1%). The purpose of the study was 81.6% of the studies to find out the therapeutic effect, and 48.5% of the study methods had a control group; 17.4% of traditional medicine studies were on treatment or diagnosis in collaborative with western medical therapies. Conclusion: North Korea is actively using traditional med- icine to prevent deterioration of health, and research is also active. North Korean traditional medicine research seems to be trying to develop new therapies, including traditional acupuncture and moxibustion, as well as electronic devices, pharmacopuncture, needle-embedding acupuncture, and Spa therapy. There is also active research in collaborative practice between traditional Korean medicine and western medicine.P07.44 Standardization of Integrative Therapy T erms for Clinical Documentation: A Data-Driven Approach Robin Austin 1, Sheng-Chieh Lu1, and Connie Delaney1 1School of Nursing, University of Minnesota, Edina, Minnesota Contact: Robin Austin, quis0026@umn.edu Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this research is to evaluate the representation of integrative therapies within the most comprehensive international standardized clinical health- care terminology, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical T erms (SNOMED CT). Methods: Integrative therapy terms were extracted from multiple sources and organized using the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and former National Center Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) classification structures. Validated terms were mapped to SNOMED CT . Results: A total of 1209 integrative therapy terms were extracted. After removing duplicates and nonvalid terms, 579 terms were included in the analysis and 243 (42.0%) of the terms were mapped to SNOMED CT . Across NCCIH and NCCAM classifications, natural products had the most terms represented in SNOMED CT , while whole systems of care (34%), within NCCAM, has the least. Conclusion: Integrative therapies and NCCAM classification struc- tures show levels of detail of terms represented within SNOMED CT. Mapping integrative therapy terms to standardized terminologies such as SNOMED CT has numerous benefits such as improving data capture and sup- porting sharable data exchange between clinical documen- tation and data used for research. This is an initial step to understanding representation of integrative therapies and implications for designing clinical systems to support and facilitate integrative nursing practice. Future research will focus on validating and comparing the mapping of integra- tive therapies with current clinical data and develop recom- mendations for integrative therapies not represented by SNOMED CT .Abstracts 147P07.45 Different Consumption Patterns and Perceived Helpfulness of Traditional Medicine, Complementary, and Alternative Medicine in Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseAcross 4 South Asian Regions Jessica Ching 1, Kam Leung Chan2, Xiaolin Liu3, Julajak Limsrivilai4, Chien Ng7 1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China 2School of Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China 3The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China 4Department of Internal Medicine, Maihol University, Bangkok, Thailand 5School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China 6Hong Kong Institute of Integrative Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China 7Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, ChinaContact: Jessica Ching, jessicaching@cuhk.edu.hk Abstract Purpose: The use of complementary and alternative med- icine (CAM) in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is common in western countries but not many data in South Asia. T raditional medicine (TM) is recognized by WorldHealth Organization as one of CAM, we aim to compare the consumption patterns and perceived helpfulness of TM, CAM in IBD in 4 South Asia regions.Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey conducted from April 2018 to February 2019 in Hong Kong (HK), Kunming (KM), Hangzhou (HZ), and Thailand (TH). Subjects withIBD were invited to answer the questions about their dem- ographics, consumption of TM and CAM treatment for IBD, and the corresponding helpfulness. Statistical tests wereused for the comparison across 4 regions. Results: One-third (205 of 633) of subjects participating in the survey had received or taken TM or CAM for IBD inwhich 37.7%, 42.0%, 16.3%, and 17.5% subjects in HK, KM, HZ, and TH were users, respectively. There were significant differences in age, education, income, disease type andstatus, hospitalization, use of 5-ASA, steroid, immunosup- pressants and biologics (all /C200.05) of TM, or CAM users across 4 regions. The consumption patterns of TM or CAMsuch as manipulation Among all treatments, TM (52.7%), probiotics (26.8%),vitamins/minerals (17.1%), and acupuncture (17.1%) have perceived highest helpfulness. Conclusion: Although KM, HK, and HZ are cities in China, the consumption n HZ was even lower than Thailand, whereas the consumption rate in KM was the top followed by HK. The characteristics of TM or CAM users for IBDwere different across 4 South Asia regions. TM, probiotics, vitamins/minerals, and acupuncture were perceived with the highest helpfulness which is in line with the consumptionrates. P07.46 Patients' Ongoing Use of Provider-Based Care for Chronic Spinal Pain: An Exampleof Ongoing Chiropractic Care Patricia Herman 1 1RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California Contact: Patricia Herman, pherman@rand.org Abstract Purpose: Several provider-based nonpharmacologic thera- pies are now recommended for chronic low-back pain (CLBP). However, health-care and coverage policies provide little guidance or evidence regarding the long-term use ofprovider-based care. As evidence on how patients use ongoing chiropractic care, we present the results of 4 stud- ies that examine patients' treatment goals, willingness-to-pay for pain reduction, predictors of visit frequency, and its impact on outcomes. Methods: Observational data were collected on patients every 2 weeks for 3 months, and at baseline for chiroprac- tors, from a large U.S. sample of chiropractic patients with nonspecific CLBP and CNP . Analytic techniques such asmultilevel modeling were used to account for data nesting. Results: Our analytic samples ranged from 1557 (91.2% of all surveyed) to 1665 (97.5%) patients with CLBP and/orCNP . The majority (70%) of these patients have a goal of pain management rather than cure. They are willing to pay $46 per month per 1-point reduction in current pain forCLBP and $37 for CNP . Comparing these estimates to patients' actual use of chiropractic care indicates these patients are \"buying\" perceived pain reductions from whattheir pain would have been without seeing their chiroprac- tor\u2014that is, they value maintenance of their current mild pain levels. Patients' visit frequencies vary by their level offunction, stage (start, ending) of care, and (for CLBP) having chiropractic coverage. Visit frequency also varied by their chiropractor's treatment approach and years of experience.Finally, there was a slight improvement in pain and function148 Global Advances in Health and Medicineover the 3-month period, but only visits >once per week were associated with significantly better improvement. Conclusion: These patients value pain management and being able to maintain their current mild pain levels.Patients with worse function may need more visits permonth, but only more-than-weekly visits significantlyimprove rather than simply maintain outcome levels. P07.47 Integrative Approaches to Pediatric Chronic Pain in an Urban Safety-Net Hospital: Cost Savings, Clinical Benefits, and Safety Elizabeth Sommers1, Paula Gardiner2, Salvatore D'Amico2, Laura Goldstein2, and Caitlin Neri2 1Boston Medical Center\u2014Integrative Medicine, Cambridge, Massachusetts 2Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Elizabeth Sommers, elizabeth.sommers@verizon.net Abstract Purpose: Chronic pain experienced by children and ado- lescents represents a significant burden in terms of health, quality of life, and economic costs to U.S. families. In 2015,the Boston Medical Center (BMC) Interdisciplinary PainClinic initiated an Integrative Medicine (IM) team modelto address chronic pain in children. T eam members included a pediatrician, child psychologist, physical therapist, acu- puncturist, and massage therapist. Children were referredto the pain clinic from primary care and specialty serviceswithin BMC, which is the largest safety-net hospital in the northeastern U.S. For this observational assessment, con- sent and assent were obtained from parents and pediatricpatients. Individualized treatment plans were recommendedby the IM team. Methods: Self-reported survey and electronic medical record data were collected about socioeconomic demo-graphics, pain, use of medical and IM services, and qualityof life. We compared health and quality of life indicators and costs of care for each participant from the year before entering our study with these same indicators for the sub-sequent year. Results: Eighty-three participants were enrolled. Participants ranged in age from 4 to 22 years (mean14.7 years). Eighty percent of the group were females.Forty-two percent of the sample were White; 30% were Hispanic/Latino, and 28% were African-American. Primary pain were abdominal (52%), headache (23%), mus-culoskeletal (18%), and other (7%). Quality P\u00bc.049) and pain interference decreased (Wilcoxon P\u00bc.040). Major economic drivers of cost were Emergency Department (ED) visits, in-patient hospitaliza- tions, and consultations with medical specialists. For the46 participants who completed the project, the following cost savings were noted: $27 819 (surgical procedures), $17 638 (ED visits), $25 033 (hospitalizations), and $42 843(specialist consults). No adverse events were reported byany of the participants. Conclusion: Our experience demonstrated that the use of IM approaches in an interdisciplinary team approach is safe,feasible, and acceptable to families. P07.48LB Conventional and Complementary Health- Care Utilization Among U.S. Adults WithCardiovascular Disease or CardiovascularRisk Factors: A Contact: Anna Koch, a.koch@kliniken-essen-mitte.de Abstract Purpose: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and their risk factors need guideline-oriented treatment to provide thebest benefit for patients. These guidelines include recom-mendations for regular checkups, realized by general med- ical practitioners. Additionally, individuals with CVD/CVD risk factors tend to use complementary methods for theircondition. There is limited information on the association between complementary health-care utilization and the adherence to recommended conventional health care. Methods: In this cross-sectional analysis of the nationally representative 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; n \u00bc26 742; response rate 80.7%), we examined the prevalence of conventional and complementaryhealth-care utilization within the last 12 months in individ- uals with CVD and/or CVD risk factors and the interactions between the 2 categories of health care. Results: Of all participants, 38.1% reported risk factors for CVD and 13.2% a CVD diagnosis (groups show an overlap). Overall, prevalence of visits to conventional and comple- mentary medicine providers and the use of mind-bodymedicine was high within the analyzed population.Individuals with CVD and/or CVD risk factors using com- plementary health care were as likely or more likely to consult general practitioners (CVD: odds ratioAbstracts those not using com- plementary health care. Those using complementary healthcare were as likely to adhere to medical checkup as thosenot using complementary health care. Conclusion: Complementary medicine use seems to be positively associated with a higher adherence to conven-tional health care and recommended checkups. P07.49LB Development of a Multistakeholder- Informed Integrative Health-care ServiceDelivery Manisha Thakkar3 1Southern Cross University, Lismore, New South Wales, Australia 2Flinders University of SA, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia 3Endeavour College of Natural Health, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia Contact: Matthew Leach, matthew.leach@scu.edu.au Abstract Purpose: Despite the growing interest in integrative health care (IHC) across the globe, there has been little investiga-tion into the preferences of diverse stakeholder groups foran IHC model of care. Our work served to examine the understanding, attitudes and preferences of health consum- ers (HC) and health-care providers (HCP) for an IHC ser-vice delivery model, and to translate these learnings into anoperational framework for IHC. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we invited adult HCs and HCPs from any nursing, medical, allied, tra-ditional, and complementary medicine discipline acrossAustralia, to complete a 55-item online questionnaire. Results: The survey was completed by 409 respondents. There was a shared understanding of, and positive attitude toward IHC among HCs and HCPs. In terms of an IHCservice delivery model, respondents advocated for the pro-vision of diverse health care and support services acrossmultiple centers, to individuals mainly presenting with chronic/terminal conditions. There was a preference of services to be charged as fee-for-service, paid using a splitpayment system, and managed by a customized team ofclinicians following triage by a nonmedical staff member.These results were translated into an operational frame-work for IHC. Conclusion: This study presents for the first time, an operational framework for an IHC service delivery modelthat is informed by the preferences of diverse stakeholder groups. T ranslating this framework into other jurisdictionsis a logical next step of this work. P07.50LB Sunscreens Formulated in the Home May Be an Effective and Economical Alternative to Commercial Sunscreens Debra Breneman1and Alyssa Breneman2 1University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 2Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York City, New York Contact: Debra Breneman, jbreneman@cinci.rr.com Abstract Purpose: Because many consumers cannot afford to pur- chase/routinely apply commercial sunscreens, with moreconsumers adversely affected by the effects on sunscreencosts of Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposedrestrictions on ultraviolet (UV) filters, and due to increasedconsumer concerns regarding the safety of sunscreen ingre-dients, this study was conducted to determine the efficacyand cost of sunscreens made in the home. Methods: Homemade sunscreens were formulated using a readily available base recipe consisting of almond oil, coco-nut oil, beeswax, and red raspberry seed oil (RRSO). Afterheating, increasing percentages of zinc oxide (ZnO) and/ortitanium dioxide (TiO2), both mineral UV filters consideredsafe by FDA were added. The amount of UV radiation trans-mitted through 24 home-formulated and 4 sun protectionfactor (SPF) 30 commercial mineral sunscreens was mea- sured using an Oriel SOL-UV-6 solar simulator and a Solarmeter Standard UVA \u00feB digital radiometer. Costs of the sunscreens were compared. Results: T welve home-formulated sunscreens tested (those with higher percentages of ZnO and/or TiO2, allwithin FDA safety limits) had mean UV transmission values lower than the mean transmission values of 3 of the 4 commercial sunscreens, and several homemadesunscreens had UV transmission values equivalent to thebest-testing commercial sunscreen. The cost of 8 oz ofthe 12 best-performing homemade sunscreens rangedfrom $4.12 to $6.97; the cost of 8 oz of the 4 commercialsunscreens ranged from $21.04 to $58.00. Conclusion: These data provide preliminary information on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of home-formulatedsunscreens, which could lead to improved sun protectionavailability to those who cannot afford to routinely applysunscreen, and thus could potentially decrease the inci-dence of photocarcinogenesis in these individuals.150 Global Advances in Health and MedicineInterestingly, although the primary effectiveness of the homemade sunscreens was undoubtedly due to the ZnOand/or TiO2, a minor part of the UV transmission blockagemay have been due to base ingredients; coconut oil, almondoil, and RRSO have SPF values reported from 4.6 to 50. P07.51LB Outpatients' Treatment Needs and Service Satisfaction: Questionnaire Survey Targeting Patients in Breast Department of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Third Affiliated Hospital Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Third Affiliated Hospital, Beijing, China 3Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Chunli Lu, jennylu@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: The survey aimed to understand outpatients' treatment needs and service satisfaction and provide refer-ences for promoting traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)medical practice. Methods: We conduct a questionnaire survey over December 2019 to February 2020 in breast departmentof Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Third AffiliatedHospital. The questionnaire comprised items concerningoutpatients' chief complaints, diagnosis, motivations for turning to TCM and this department, treatments they believe benefits themselves, and satisfactions about medicalconditions, professional ethics, health promotion, privacyprotection, medical cost, and so forth. Results: The response rate was 100%, for a total of 51 usable protocols. The chief complaints were mainly aboutpain and masses associated with breastfeeding. The diagno-sis is mostly related to lactation with 25 patients diagnosedas breast engorgement, 6 patients as acute mastitis, and 5 patients as breast abscess and cracked nipples, respectively. The items topping in the patients' concerns were the dis-persal of masses and pain, followed by the influences onbreastfeeding and nipples problems. The predominant rea-sons for turning to TCM were beneficial effect and refer-ences. Some patients also wanted to receive TCM balancingbodies and they would not like antibiotics, hormone, and antituberculous medicine as interventions. And the first 3 items about why patients preferred to this departmentwere focused on national key disciplines, other patients'references and satisfied treatment effect. In addition, 89.2% patients believe tuina helping milk efficiently removalbenefits themselves most, followed by Chinese herbs intakeorally and percutaneously. The satisfaction rates wereabove 90%. The unsatisfaction complaints centered onless staff allocation, demand for a green channel withfever patients, systematic health education, and perfectingfacilities. Conclusion: Most patients are in lactation and concern about their conditions. Given the particular physical condi-tions, we should provide them with more humanistic treat-ment by optimizing staff allocation, perfecting facilities, andoffering education periodically.

P07.53LB Integrative Health Promotion in Primary Care: Perspectives of Providers in theWWAMI Region Cynthia Price 1, Allison Cole1, and Malaika Schwartz1 1University of Washington, Seattle, Washington Contact: Cynthia Price, cynthiap@uw.edu Abstract Purpose: This project was designed to guide future edu- cation and research to help promote integrative healthpractice within primary care. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used involving administration of a 19-item survey focusedon familiarity with integrative care approaches, experiencereferring to or co-managing care with an integrative practi-tioner, perceived barriers to integrative care at the clinic,and education needed to support increased integrativehealth practice. The survey was distributed to primarycare providers (medical doctors, doctors of osteopathicmedicine, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) throughthe WWAMI region Practice and Research Network(WPRN), serving the states of Washington, Wyoming,Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI). Eleven clinicalsites participated across 3 states: Washington, Wyoming,and Idaho. Results: T wo hundred eighteen providers (45% response rate) completed the survey. Eleven clinical sites participatedacross 3 states: Washington, Wyoming, and Idaho. T wohundred eighteen providers (45% response rate) completedthe survey. Results indicated that providers (a) were familiarwith a wide variety of integrative health approaches, chiro-practic was most familiar (73%) and the least were ayurveda(23%) and curanderismo (8%); (b) talked with patients aboutthe possible benefits of, or recommended, an integrativeapproach at least some of the time (75%); and (c) had min-imal overall experience co-managing patient care with anintegrative health practitioner (42% had ever). On theclinic level, approximately 57% indicated clinic leadershipsupport for integrative health services, and 81% knew ofat least 1 integrative approach being offered. Respondentswanted to learn about the safety/efficacy of integrative approaches (78%), local practitioners to refer to (83%),and about providing an integrative approach themselves(51%). Conclusion: In summary, while there was overall support for and familiarity with integrative care, more education on integrative approaches is needed to support integrative care services and referral among primary care providers. P07.54LB Patient Perspectives on Development of a Mobile Health Application to Improve Dietary Supplement Tracking and Reconciliation Elana Post1, 1University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 2Department of Family Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 3Program on Integrative Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina Contact: Elana Post, elpost@email.unc.edu Abstract Purpose: T o assess patients' views on facilitators and bar- riers to using a mobile health application (mHealth app) to collect and share dietary supplement (DS) information withtheir health-care providers. Patient views will inform thecreation of a mHealth app to improve DS patient-provider communication and DS tracking and reconciliation in the electronic medical record (EMR). Methods: Utilizing a health behavior theory conceptual model, we conducted 3 focus groups with members of patient advisory groups from several academic medicaldepartments. We asked questions about DS safety, providercommunication, and comfort with technology use. Sessionswere recorded and transcribed for coding, then content was organized into themes to predict future mHealth app utilization. Results: Focus group participants (N \u00bc15) included 8 women and 7 men; all were >45 years old with at least a college education. There was 1 Asian American and 14White Participants. Participants were concerned about DSsafety and inaccurate recording in the EMR. Reasons includ- ed (1) doctor's reluctance to discuss DSs; (2) time con- straints of medical visits; (3) doctor's lack of training regard-ing DS, prompting a desire for providers with enhanced DS152 Global Advances in Health and Medicinetraining (eg, pharmacists, dietitians, naturopathic doctors). In discussing development of the mHealth app to remedy DS tracking and reconciliation, additional key concernsincluded (1) preserving and enhancing patient's health autonomy; (2) accessibility for the disadvantaged; and (3) privacy. Advantages regarding a mHealth app include (1) enhancing patient-provider communication; (2) providing reliable DS information; and (3) integrating DSinformation in the EMR to identify safety concerns, such as drug-supplement interactions. Conclusion: Overall, participants believe their DS infor- mation is inaccurately represented in the EMR leading to safety issues, which negatively impacts overall quality-of-care. An app to simplify and improve DS entry and recon- ciliation was of interest, as long as it maintained health autonomy and privacy. P07.55LB Participating in Meditation and Tai Chi Improves Physical Functioning, Anxiety Levels, and Ability to Participate in Social Role Activities over Time: VA PRIMIER and Jeffery Dusek8 1Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island 2Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, ENRM Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bedford, Massachusetts 3Veterans Administration, Los Angeles, California 4Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research, Bedford VAMC, Bedford, Massachusetts 5VA Greater Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 6VA New Jersey Healthcare System, East Orange, New Jersey 7Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, Washington, District of Columbia 8University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Rani Elwy, rani_elwy@brown.edu Abstract Purpose: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is ded- icated to providing a Whole Health approach to care, including offering complementary and integrative health (CIH) services. BraveNet is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-registered practice-based researchnetwork of 17 leading civilian is BraveNet's prospective, nonrandomized, obser- BraveNet partnered to con- duct PRIMIER among Veterans participating in any CIH approach at 2 VA medical centers. This report primarilyprovides results from Veterans but also compares to results from civilians on patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Veterans involved in any CIH approach were invited to participate in a patient-reported outcomes(PROMIS-29) repeated survey at 5 time points: baseline,2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Surveys were completed inperson, by telephone or mail, as needed. Mixed hierarchical models reporting least square means with repeated varia- bles were used to test the hypothesis that participating inany CIH approach would improve Veterans' overall health,controlling for age, male sex, site, participation in other CIH approaches, and surveys completed. Results: A total of 401 surveys were received from 119 Veterans (72% male, age range: 29-85 years) across the 5 time points. Veterans completed an average of 3.4 surveys. Physical functioning scores significantly improved at 2, 6, and12 months with participation in meditation over time.Veterans' anxiety was improved at 2 and 6 months whenthey received Tai Chi. Participation in social role activities improved at 2 months when involved in Tai Chi. Comparison to the civilian PRIMIER results will bepresented. Conclusion: Knowing that meditation and T ai Chi improve outcomes among Veterans should allow for clinicians,Veterans, and family members to use this knowledge toimprove patient-clinician communication about engaging in CIH treatment approaches. Our ability to compare PRIMIER results across Veterans and civilian populationswill provide essential knowledge for the CIH field. P07.56LB Costs Associated With Mindfulness Meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Alzheimer's Disease Caregivers Tanya Bentley1, Daisy Castillo1, Nina Sadeghi1, and Michae Irwin1 1University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California Contact: Tanya Bentley, tanyabentley@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Of 5 million Alzheimer's Disease (AD) caregivers in the United States, 60% experience insomnia. The ongoingCARES trial evaluates the noninferiority of mindful aware-ness practices for insomnia (MAP-I) versus cognitive behav- ioral therapy for insomnia (CBT -I) among AD caregivers with insomnia (N \u00bc99). This analysis estimated costs asso- ciated with each intervention. Methods: Micro-costing was used to itemize and abstract costs of each intervention. Personnel, patient time, supplies,Abstracts 153and equipment were inventoried, and unit costs were applied. Caregiver time costs, including travel time, werebased on US Labor Bureau home health aide nationalmean hourly wages; instructor and staff costs were basedon the trial's institutional hourly wages. Group, per- participant, and total intervention costs were calculated with and without booster session costs to reflectreal-world implementation. Program costs assumed 50 par-ticipants distributed over 7 groups. Sensitivity analyses eval-uated robustness of estimates. Results: Per-participant, group, and program costs for the CBT -I intervention were $3991, $14 $2100 per participant, $4311 per group, and $30 263 per program. When costs for booster programs were excluded,MAPS-I provided savings of $1249, $2613, and $18 375. Forboth interventions, the highest fixed cost category wasinstructor background training and the highest variablecost categories were instructor and participant time. Results were most sensitive to CBT -I and MAPS-I instructor salaries and background training costs. When salaries wereassumed equal and background training costs were exclud-ed, MAPS-I insomnia may save up to $1800 per caregiverwhen compared with CBT -I, the current treatment stan-dard. With this potential for cost savings, results of theongoing noninferiority CARES trial are critical for increasing insomnia treatment dissemination and improving outcomes among the AD caregiver population. P07.57LB Anxiety, CO2 T olerance, and Breath Practice in High School Students: Feasibility and Observations of a 6-weekSlow Breathing Program Tanya Bentley 1, Robert Wilson2, Brian MacKenzie2, and Scott Russell3 1University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 2Health and Human Performance Foundation, Virginia Beach, Virginia 3Girard School District, Girard, Ohio Contact: Tanya Bentley, tanyabentley@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: One in 3 American adolescents meet the criteria for anxiety, and suicide is the second leading cause of death globally among 15- to 29-year-olds. Research supports con-nections between breathing manipulation and emotionalstates, and tolerances to endogenous carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels and anxiety. We observed students' short and long-term anxiety and CO 2tolerance (CO 2T) during a slow-breathing program at a rural Pennsylvania highschool. Methods: A 6-week, slow-breathing program was admin- istered to to students in 2 health/phys-ical education (HPE) classes. Three times/week, an HPEteacher led students through 5 minutes of 5-second inhales,5-second breath holds, 10-second exhales, and 5-secondbreath holds. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)Trait (\"overall\" anxiety) Scale was administered at thebeginning and end of the 6 weeks. The short version ofSTAI-State (\"in-the-moment\" stress) Anxiety Scale and atimed-exhale CO 2T measure were administered once/ week before and after the breath practice. Results: Of 26 students, 20 (73%) completed all 6 weekly state anxiety and CO 2T measurements; 6 completed 5 of 6; and 1 completed 4 of 6. After 6 weeks, 73% (n \u00bc19) of participating students showed improved trait anxietyscores (mean 12.3% improvement). Before versus afterthe breathing exercises, state anxiety, and CO 2T scores improved among all participants: A weekly average of 12%and 11%, respectively; A 6-week average of 15% and 8.6%,respectively. From weeks 0 to 6: Mean daily (pre-and-postbreathing practice) CO 2T scores improved on average 30%; Both pre- and post-breathing CO 2T scores improved by 44% and 37%, respectively. Conclusion: A 6-week high school program of thrice- weekly, 5-minute group slow breathing was feasible andwas associated with short- and long-term adaptations tostress and endogenous CO 2. Prospective studies are war- ranted to confirm the potential benefits of simple, low-costapproaches such as these toward ending the stress manage-ment crisis among today's youth. P07.58LB Evidence-Based Evaluation of Safety of Genetically Modified Food\u2014A Report on Adverse Events of Carcinogenesis Beijing, China 2School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 3School of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China154 Global Advances in Health and Medicine4Center for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 5School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 6Center for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 7ICIMH Reviewer 8London South Bank University, London, UK Contact: Chen Shen, shenchensophia@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: T o assess the incidence of adverse effects/events of genetically modified (GM) food consumption by anevidence-based evaluation of safety of GM food. Methods: The Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, and 4 Chinese electronic databases were searched from January 1,1983 to October 4, 2019. Clinical studies and animal in vivo studies were included. The whole study focuses on the inci- dence of adverse effects/events of GM food consumptionand it is still ongoing, and data extraction has not been completed yet. This abstract focuses on adverse events on carcinogenesis which has been selected through full- text screening. The baseline information was collected based on NoteExpress 3.0. Results: Of the 9328 citations, 172 articles with 22 kinds of GM food were included after 432 full-text reading. However, no human clinical study met the inclusion criteria.Finally, only 2 mouse/rat feeding studies have been reported to trigger cancer/tumor. Seralini GE 2012, which has been retracted but republished, did a long-term toxicity study on a Roundup-tolerant GM maize (from 11% in the diet), cul- tivated with or without Roundup, and Roundup alone for2 years in rats. It found that females in the treatment groups almost always developed large mammary tumors more often than and before controls. As for males, 4 timesmore large palpable tumors than controls were presented which emerged up to 600 days earlier. Velimirov A 2008 revealed a life term study where mice in the 3 groups were fed with transgenic maize NK603xMON810 (from 33.0% in the diet), control isoline diet and GM-freeAustrian corn reference diet, respectively. The survival rate was not significantly different, while cancer (leucosis) was the common cause of death. Conclusion: A majority of studies failed to detect adverse events of carcinogenesis, while animal studies occupy the lowest hierarchy of evidence. Further clinical trial such as cohort study is still warranted.P08: Research Methodology P08.01 Micro-Course on Natural Product Case Reports: Guidance for Publication Barber1, Heather Zwickey2, Cathryn Booth-LaForce3, and Ryan Bradley4 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 2National College of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 3University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 4National College of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: Melissa Barber, mbsharee@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: The purpose is to deliver guidance on \"best practices\" for clinical case report publications that includeobservations related to the use of natural products (eg, dietary supplements, herbal medicines). This guidance is necessary to improve the level of detail in case reportssuch that these observations from practice can moreeasily inform future research.Methods: We applied current pedagogical models in online education to the delivery of a micro-course focused on thepublication of case reports, with a specific emphasis on casereports reporting on natural products. Unified guidance forcase reports on natural products was created by reviewing published intervention guidelines, checking for redundancy, and synthesizing relevant elements. Published guidelinesrelated to natural product reporting was mostly in the con-text of clinical trials, including TIDieR (T emplate forIntervention Description and Replication), extensions toCONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting T rials)checklist for herbal interventions and Chinese medicineherbal formulas, the CARE (Case Report) explanation andelaboration document, and the SPIRIT (Standard ProtocolItems: Recommendations for Interventional T rials)Statement. Results: An online training micro-course focused on natu- ral product case reports was developed on the Moodlelearning management system that includes: recordedvideos, landmark publications, and a resource library.Experiential activities encouraging application of therecent material are available. Learners also have access toCareCapture, a REDCap-based template designed to orga-nize the process of case report development. Learners areable to track their progress using embedded evaluation aids. Video content includes an overview video to case reports and a video focused on natural products with an emphasison required elements to publish.Conclusion: Improving the quality of published case reports on natural products may be one strategy to developAbstracts 155research hypotheses and improve interprofessional knowl- edge related to natural products. Online education tools provide one strategy to assist in the dissemination of thisimportant training. P08.03 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Chinese Herbal MedicineBotanical Tincture for Irritable BowelSyndrome Clinical Trial Young Pyo Jang 1,2, Sang Cheol Park2, and Marc Brodsky3 1Department of Oriental Pharmaceutical Science, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 2Department of Life and Nanopharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea 3Stamford Hospital, Stamford, Connecticut Contact: Marc Brodsky, mbrodsky@stamhealth.org Abstract Purpose: Botanical tincture (BT) is an alcohol and water extract of 8 Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs). Objective was to assay major chemical components for each botanical present in BT that may be tested over time per UnitedStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory requirements for this FDA-approved Investigational New Drug for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Methods: BT contains 8 botanicals mixed together in a permeable mesh bag container extracted in 40% to 60% alcohol at a ratio of 1 part botanical:5 parts alcohol (1 gbotanicals/5 ml alcohol). For the analysis, each botanical was extracted individually in 40% to 60% alcohol at a ratio of 1 part botanical:5 parts alcohol. Botanical productsin the permeable containers were removed after 1 week. All tincture samples were evaporated 10 times (10:1). The sam- ples were filtered through a 0.45 micrometerpolyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) syringe filter before being injected for analysis. A Waters Alliance 2690 high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system linkedwith a photodiode ter equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) used for chromatographic and mass (MS)analysis. Results: Eight compounds were identified through HPLC- PDA-ESI-MS by comparing ultraviolet (UV) spectra andhigh-resolution mass number. Since major components had different UV absorption characteristics, 3 different chromatograms were extracted with 3 differentwavelengths.Conclusion: A method to assay major chemical compo- nents for each botanical in BT may be used for quality con-trol and stability testing of BT, an experimental drug to treatIBS symptoms. P08.02 Standardization, Personalization, and Real- world Practice in Pragmatic Trial forIntegrative Medicine: The MethodologicalDesign of a Semi-individualizedRandomized Controlled Trial for DiabeticKidney Disease Kam Wa (Chris) Chan 1and Sydney Chi Wai Tang1 1Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China Contact: Kam Wa (Chris) Chan, chriskwc@hku.hk Abstract Purpose: Pragmatic trials have been advocated across dif- ferent specialties in the past few decades in a hope to gen- erate real-world evidence to inform decisions in clinical practice. Although pragmatism in clinical trials has beenintroduced for more than 50 years, the balance betweenflexibility in trial design and scientific rigor remains a key challenge to the trial design. Also, the discordance in epis- temology between conventional and traditional medicinewarrants special attention in trial design to reflect real-world practice of different streams of medicine. Methods: We gathered the perspectives of patients and physicians of conventional and traditional medicine, evalua- tion of previous service program, and data from registry-based study to inform the design and evaluation ofSCHEMATIC, an on-going semi-individualized pragmaticrandomized controlled trial evaluating a Chinese medicine clinical protocol for diabetic kidney disease, a medical con- dition currently with no specific treatment(NCT02488252). Results: The methodological design including intervention, outcome measurement, flexibility of protocol, and hierarchy of analysis were based on and optimized by expert consen-sus, preliminary data from previous service program andqualitative stakeholder analyses. The trial design closelyresembled real-world practice of integrative Chinese- western medicine and was merged into the existing infra- structure of public out-patient clinics which can be easilytranslated to routine clinical service. The first half ofSCHEMATIC subjects have completed the study and theattrition is well-controlled. Conclusion: Expert consensus, stakeholder analysis, real- world registry-based data, and pilot programs are key to the156 Global Advances in Health and Medicinedesign and translation of pragmatic clinical trials for integra- tive medicine. P08.04 A Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the PROMIS 4-Item Sleep DisturbanceMeasure among Law Enforcement Officers BA Ashley Eddy, Kaylie Green, MS 1, Jenna Flowers, MS2, Josh Kaplan, MS2, and Michael Christopher, PhD2 1Pacific University, Forest Grove, Oregon 2Pacific University School of Graduate Psychology, Forest Grove, Oregon Contact: Ashley Eddy, eddy9851@pacificu.edu Abstract Purpose: Poor sleep has been shown to negatively impact overall health and functioning. Law enforcement officers (LEOs) are at an increased risk for poor sleep and relatednegative outcomes due to occupational stressors. Poorsleep quality has been shown to negatively impact LEO health, performance, and community safety. The Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS TMSD) was developed to assess self-reported perceptions of sleep including per- ceived quality, satisfaction, and difficulties falling asleep.1 Existing validation studies have found good psychometric properties within the general population; however, due to the unique stressors of law enforcement, and because cur-rent research on sleep disturbance in LEOs is limited, fur- ther validation of this measure for this specific population is necessary. Methods: The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the 4-item PROMIS-SD in a sample of LEOs (n \u00bc111). factor analysis suggest that the orig- inal one-factor solution provides an excellent fit to SBv 2(2)\u00bc11.20, P\u00bc.003, goodness-of-fit index \u00bc.99, com- RMSEA value is indic- ative of poor fit, RMSEA can be artificially inflated for models with low degrees of freedom.2The 4-item PROMIS-SD demonstrated good reliability of convergent validity via correlations in the expected direction with the Five Facet MindfulnessQuestionnaire ( r\u00bc/C0.09; P\u00bc.37), Organizational Police Stress Questionnaire Operational Police Stress Questionnaire ( r\u00bc.37;P<.001). Conclusion: Results suggest that the 4-item PROMIS-SD is a valid and reliable measure of sleep disturbance among LEOs. Implications for clinical and research use of the 4-item PROMIS-SD in law enforcement and other first responder populations will be discussed. P08.05 Health Coaching for Obesity and T ype 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Literature Review andResearch Quality Appraisal Joel Edman 1, Sebastian Harenberg2, and Gary Sforzo2 1Edman Wellness Services, Media, Pennsylvania 2Ithaca Ithaca, New Contact: Joel Edman, edmanwellness@comcast.net Abstract Purpose: Health coaching (HC) promotes healthy lifestyles and may be particularly helpful for clients, patients, and employees with chronic disease. The HC research on obe-sity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is particularly extensive and holds significant clinical promise. This literature, how- ever, is relatively early in development and sometimes lacksacceptable consistency and rigor. The purpose of this article is to review HC studies for obesity and T2DM while assess- ing the quality of this literature. In the process, we havedeveloped a research scoring system that we apply to the reviewed studies. Methods: A comprehensive review of the health coaching literature was completed to reveal randomized controlled trials for obesity and T2DM. Most studies were identified as part of the Health Coaching Compendium, but more recentpapers were also searched and included. General findings for obese and T2DM clients/patients were compiled. A comprehensive quality assessment scoring system for HCresearch was devised with both research design and HC intervention criteria. Highlights of 3 studies exemplifying desirable HC research qualities for obesity and T2DM arepresented. Results: Clinical results for health coaching for obese and T2DM clients/patients are provided and discussed.Preliminary results of reviewed studies suggest that HC is inconsistently defined, applied, and monitored so that health outcomes and potential benefits significantly vary.Highlights of the 3 highest scoring obesity and T2DM stud- ies are presented to illustrate HC best practices and allow other researchers to replicate their methods and findings.Conclusion: Health coaching is a promising and important approach to clients/patients, particularly those with obesity and/or T2DM. T o achieve the best health outcomes, how-ever, clarification of HC best practices must be achieved through well designed and effectively applied HC research.Abstracts 157These are essential for the growth, development, and acceptance of HC in the current health-care system. P08.06 Utilizing Design Thinking to Sculpt an Innovative Meditation to LowerPatient Anxiety: and Anne-Marie Duchemin1 1The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio 2The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Maryanna Klatt, maryanna.klatt@osumc.edu Abstract Purpose: The problem we seek to improve via this funded research study is patient anxiety in preoperative settings. Preoperative anxiety affects patient experience and hasbeen found to be a predictor of severe postoperative painand chronic pain after surgery, shown to influence the suc- cess and quality of a patient's recovery. Methods: Utilizing a design thinking approach, 4 former patients were interviewed to assess perception of the level and source(s) of anxiety in the preoperative area, and what might address these issues. Based upon the userinterviews, a 10-minute guided meditation was audio recorded and placed on a tablet to either deliver the med- itation or silence for the patient. Research methodologysuccess also depends on the health-care professional staff in the preoperative arena. Based upon a preoperative nurs- ing staff focus group, researchers and nurses in tandemdesigned the flow of the protocol to be seamless, sensitive to the typical preoperative work flow. Participants will be surgical patients in the Perioperative Environment of theDepartment of Orthopaedics. Ortho Trauma Surgery sees 3 to 4 patients daily, with 2 to 3 patients being eligible for the study (an ability to speak and understand English, con-scious of upcoming surgery). Approximately 200 patientswill be offered participation in this pilot research to help reduce preoperative anxiety. Half will be randomly assigned to the control group (silencing headphones), and the otherhalf will be randomly assigned (through randomization soft- ware) to the experimental (audio meditation) group, with vital signs and anxiety levels recorded pre/post intervention.Depending on patient willingness to participate, we expect between 60 and 100 in each group. Results: Study commences December 1, 2019. Results will follow. Conclusion: The preoperative procedures developed and optimized to conduct implementation of this study,including the guided meditation, could have tremendous applications for other preoperative environments and external health-care organizations, as research design was based upon user input. P08.07 Analysis of Feasibility and Value of Gathering Missing Data of RCTs Publishedin China: A Qualitative Study on theT Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 3Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK 4School of Nursing, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 5Shanxi University of TCM, Taiyuan, China 6Beijing University of TCM, Beijing, China 7School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Jing Li, lj@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: The reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in China have been considered of lowquality, due to misunderstanding and misuse of methodolo- gy, and so on. Articles published in China play an essential role in the area of TCM. In addition, the absence of research details makes it difficult to conduct secondary research. We try to evaluate the feasibility of the telephone interview for obtaining missing information of clinical trials. Methods: This research is based on a systematic review of Chinese herbal medicine for adverse effects induced by che- motherapy in people with breast cancer. We included RCTs identified in Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM), ChineseScience Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang. T wo researchers independently screened. Disagreements were discussed and reached consensus. We included 440 studies. T elephone interviewers made efforts to contact the study authors and recorded the details of the telephone interview. Results: The investigators conducted telephone interviews with the authors of 440 studies, researchers contacted 131 study authors, and 309 did not. Among the authors con- tacted, 47 of them refused to answer, and 84 of them were interviewed. Among the interviewed studies, 18 (22.43%)158 Global Advances in Health and Medicinewere RCTs, 54 (64.29%) were non-RCTs, and 12 (14.29%) were still uncertain. In the non-RCT studies, there were 42 (79.25%) retrospective studies, and 11 (20.75%) used incor-rect methods of randomization. After the telephone inter- view, 63 items in ROB assessment changed from unclear to high/low risk, which accounts for 84% of the original unclearitems. Conclusion: When publishing an article, it is necessary to report whether a retrospective case study or a prospectiverandomized controlled trial. The telephone interview may be useful in filling the missing data, but the proportion of the interviewed studies is not high. How to deal with thearticles whose authors we can't reach is the focus of future research. P08.08 Clinical Research Missing Data Imputation Method: A Methodological Review Changhao Liang1and Mingkun Yu1 1Beijing of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Changhao Liang, 18678783891@163.com Abstract Purpose/Objectives: Missing data in clinical trials not only increase the complexity and difficulty of statistical analysis but also lead to bias in the results of the analysis. Missingdata are ubiquitous in clinical trials, but current methods are not systematic and have not received sufficient attention from researchers in China, especially the lack of systematicguidance for filling in the missing data in clinical trials of Chinese medicine. We hoped to collect suggestions from published methodological papers to proposed methods fordealing with missing data in the analytic phase and improve the quality of the Chinese medicine research. Methods: Published studies were comprehensively searched from their inception to September 2019: Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science Journal Database (VIP) ChineseScience, Wanfang Database, SinoMed Database (see Figure 1). We systematically evaluated the methodological study on the missing data imputation published since theestablishment of the database. Results: A total of 99 methodological studies were includ- ed. For methodological issues missing data, it can be dividedinto 2 major categories, including the method to deal with particular type of clinical trial and presentation of data imputation methods comparison. The results showed thatmultiple imputation is widely recognized to deal with miss- ing data in this study.Conclusion: This article provides insights on the type of missing data, traditional methods, and multiple imputationas alternative methods to deal with missing data, includingtheir shortfalls and advantages. We recommend more con-sideration to the use of multiple imputation methods to reduce the incidence of biased conclusions. Of course, for the sake of caution, in the clinical research statistics of tra-ditional Chinese medicine, it is better to adopt differentmethods according to different types of missing data. If nec-essary, use multiple missing data processing methods foranalysis, comparison, and sensitivity analysis to confirm its reliability. P08.09 How Do You do a Comprehensive Search for Randomized Controlled Trials in Traditional Chinese Medicine ThatPublished in University Beijing, China Contact : Xuehan Liu, xuehan_liu@foxmail.com Abstract Purpose: With the increasing amount of randomized con- trolled trials (RCTs) of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),authors make more effort for specific drugs or therapies. T oshare experience in searching comprehensively for RCTs inTCM published in Chinese to reduce the manpower neededfor research synthesis. Methods: We compared search strategies that were based on subject words (strategy 1) and those based on TCMjournals (strategy 2). We chose TCM journals from thecatalogue of Chinese core journals. We searched theChinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) data- base (most commonly used Chinese database) by using both strategies. We selected the top 500 records formanual screening. We compared the 2 search methodsfor inclusion rate. After screening the articles manually,we used TCM words to search on in articles retrievedfrom strategy 2, to compare the differences between the articles in both strategies. Results: We got 11 184 records using strategy 1 and 2291 records using strategy 2, and the top 500 records wereselected into group 1 and group 2. A total of 426 RCTs(85.2%) were included in group 1 and 437 RCTs (87.4%) were included in group 2. We found that 276 RCTs (63.16%) in group 2 used words about TCM as subjectwords. Manual screening was easier when using strategy 2.Abstracts 159Conclusion: Many RCTs in TCM from TCM journals did not use TCM words in the abstract, and Strategy 2 shows a little higher inclusion rate, so we can use strategies that were based on TCM journals when searching ChineseRCTs of TCM. More high-quality journals should be foundif initial retrieval records are not enough. Exclusive wordsshould be considered carefully when searching CNKIdatabase. P08.10 The Components of Complex Interventions for Health Care: Synthesis of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China Contact: Sisi Ma, masisi@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: Our main aim in this synthesis was to derive new conceptual understandings of complex interventions'components. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for qualita- tive studies on components of complex interventions in July2019. Embase, Cochrane library, ChineseNational Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Science Journal Database (VIP), and Sino Medwere searched. Meta-ethnography was used to analysisdata. The first, second-order constructs were extractedfrom the initial studies. Then, the second-order constructswere translated across the included articles to form the third-order constructs. Results: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of the complex interventions were nonpharmacologicalintervention, only 1 for traditional Chinese medicine. The qualitative data collection methods were mainly individual interviews, focus group, and observation. Among thesestudies, cancer accounted for 22%, following mentalhealth for 14% and stroke for 8%. The remaining studiesdealt with dementia, diabetes, respiratory related diseases,low back pain, childhood obesity, chronic diseases, chronicmusculoskeletal conditions, multiple sclerosis, critical ill-ness, intimate partner violence, and childhood psychologicaldevelopment. These studies were conducted mainly in United Kingdom, which accounted for 50%. The remaining studies were conducted in Ireland, Sweden, Germany,France, Belgium, Spanish, Italy, United States, Canada,China, and Chile. Finally, 6 third-order constructs weredeveloped: implementation, psychological support, biologi- cal support, cognitive and behavioral support, environmen-tal support, and social support. These 6 dimensions wereinterrelated and inseparable. Moreover, 18 main themesemerged from the codes. We also found a focus theme:humanistic care. Conclusion: Our study shows that the components of complex interventions embody the biological-psychological-social-environmental-cognitive behavior med-ical theory, which will provide a reference for buildingcomplex intervention elements in the future. The complexintervention model may help with the development of out- come indicators for clinical trials. Further systematic research on the outcomes of complex interventionsneeds to be carried out. P08.11 Survey of Attitudes T oward Medical Cannabis Use Among Older Adults Alison Ian Fischer-Laycock1, and Priya Mendiratta1 of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas Contact: Alison Oliveto, olivetoalison@uams.edu Abstract Purpose: Medical cannabis by prescription is increasingly available in states like Arkansas, yet few data exist regardingits acute and chronic effects in older adults. This studydetermined initial feasibility of conducting cannabis researchin older adults by surveying their attitudes about cannabisuse, level of functioning, and interest in participating in acannabis study. Methods: Electronic flyers with link to the online survey in REDCap were emailed to registrants in ARResearch.org(research participant registry) and posted on social mediasites. Information collected included demographics, medi-cal/psychiatric history, substance use history, interest incannabis use, current medications, activities of daily living,and interest in participating in research that involves getting cannabis. Descriptive statistics summarized the data; chi square tests examined whether any factors influenced inter-est in cannabis research. Results: Survey data collection is ongoing. Thus far, 700 ARresearch registrants were invited to participate in the survey on 17 October, 2019. Within 24 hours, 40 surveysby those >50 years (avg 57.5 years, 60% were Sixty percent, and 80%reported interest in medical cannabis use, nonmedical can-nabis use, and research participation involving cannabis,160 Global Advances in Health and Medicinerespectively; 80% reported prior nonmedical cannabis use; and 87.5% reported using at least one prescribed medica- tion, with most common indications being pain in extrem- ities (25%), high blood pressure (30%), and mood disorder (35%). Those interested in research involving cannabis weremore likely to have at least one medical prescription (P<.02). Conclusion: Preliminary results suggest high levels of interest in cannabis research participation; however, high prevalence of prescribed medication use may contraindicate participating in a study involving cannabis. These preliminary findings suggest that feasibility of cannabis research in older adults may be complicated by current medical conditions common among older adults. Study designs will need toconsider these factors to optimize study rigor and partici- pant safety. P08.12 Chinese Herbal Formula for the Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: AnOverview of Systematic Jianping Liu3, and Chuang Liu1 1The Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, Liaoning, China 2Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, Liaoning, China 3Center for Evidence Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Lijian Pang, hahaya123@126.com Abstract Purpose: No evidence has been verified that western med- icine can significantly alleviate the main clinical manifesta- tions and improve quality of life (QoL) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Chinese herbal formula (CHF) is widely prescribed as an adjuvant medicine to treat the disease in China currently. Nevertheless, clinical prac- tice has not been informed by evidence from relevant sys- tematic reviews (SRs). Therefore, this overview aims at summarizing available evidence from SRs on CHF for thetherapy of IPF . Methods: A systematic search was employed in 8 databases from their inception until June 2019 for SRs. The primary outcomes we focus on include St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, traditional Chinese medi- cine (TCM) symptom (dyspnea, cough) scores, and adverse events. The research screening, data extraction, and meth- odological quality assessment were conducted by 2 individ- uals separately, and disputes were adjudicated by a thirdsenior reviewer. Methodological quality of SRs was assessed according to AMSTAR 2 and quality of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach. Results: About 10 SRs were included. Most of the SRs suggested that CHF had promising benefits for cases with IPF , such as improving St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, and TCM symptom scores like cough and dyspnea with few adverse reactions.However, the overall quality of evidence in the SRs affected the reliability of the results. Moreover, evaluation of methodological quality was poor. The main flaws of the methodology quality included the following: not providing an explicit statement of prior design, performing an incom-prehensive article search, not accounting for excluded stud- ies fully, providing an unsatisfactory discussion of any het- erogeneity observed in the results, not carrying out an adequate investigation of publication bias, not reporting potential sources of conflict of interest. Conclusion: Current SRs indicated potential benefits of CHF for the treatment of IPF , especially in improving QoL and symptoms. However, high-quality evidence is warranted to support the application of CHF in treating IPF . P08.13 The International Cohort on Lifestyle Determinants of Study and Bradley1 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 2The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 3University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 4The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 5Endeavour College of Natural Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia 6Endeavour College of Natural Health/University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia Contact: Courtney Pickworth, kpickworth@nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: The World Health Organization estimates that 60% of factors related to health and quality of life are asso- ciated with lifestyle. What constitutes a \"healthy lifestyle\" is not universally agreed upon by all segments of societydespite recommendations from government organizations and health-care experts. Students enrolled inAbstracts 161complementary and integrative health (CIH) programs rep- resent a unique population of adults who are likely to behigh utilizers of CIH and thus may provide valuable insightsinto the impact of their behaviors on health outcomes. Methods: The International Cohort on Lifestyle Determinants of Health (INCLD Health) is a longitudinalcohort study designed to assess health behaviors and prac-tices among adults studying CIH. The aims of the study are(1) to evaluate the impact of dietary and nutrition-relatedpractices, especially those emphasized in CIH communities(eg, fermented foods, local produce) on microbiome pop-ulations, overall quality of life, and health status; and (2) toidentify possible relationships between stress and stressmanagement on sleep, mood, quality of life and healthstatus. Clinical examinations occur at baseline, 6 months,1 year, and then annually thereafter. Measures include bio-metrics; serum and salivary biomarkers of cardiovascularrisk, reproductive health, and physiological stress response;nutritional status measured by a digital food frequencyquestionnaire and a supplemental \"specialty diet\" question-naire; the Perceived Stress Scale; PROMIS-29 quality and a developmental Multidimensional Wellness); plus 16S RNA microbiota sequencing. Results: INCLD Health was institutional review board- approved in late 2018, and recruitment began inSeptember 2019. T o date, over 200 students haveexpressed interest, and examination visits are active.Cross-sectional baseline data for the cohort to date willbe presented. Conclusion: The INCLD Health Study is a unique cohort of international adults that will evaluate self-care behaviors and the use of CIH practices in relation to short- and long- term health.

The study presented in this poster assesses the feasibility of a self-care app, My Wellness Coach (MWC), in student athletes. This motivational-based app focuses on 7domains of health, including Movement, Nutrition,Spirituality, Resilience, Relationships, Sleep, andEnvironment. The goal is to evaluate the impact of theapp on student athlete health and well-being outcomes using a combination of data from wearable devices, sweat biomarkers, such as cortisol, and standardized well-beingsurveys. Methods: Student athletes in varsity sports, club sports, redshirt year, transitioning from sport, and adaptive athlet- ics were recruited for a 12-week health promotion program using the MWC app to promote behavior change.Participants completed well-being surveys, an exercise labsession, and wore a WHOOP heart-rate variability, activityand sleep quality wrist-worn device for 3 days atbaseline, 4-weeks, and 12-weeks. User experience surveys were completed at 4 and 12 weeks. Results: Positive improvements in mental health, sleep, and well-being were reported by the participants. The highadherence to the protocol in the selected target population provides enthusiasm for extending the study to additional high stress/performing populations and the greater studentand other populations. Conclusion: Positive improvements in mental health, sleep, and well-being were reported by the participants. The high adherence to the protocol in the selected target population provides enthusiasm for extending the study toadditional high stress/performing populations and the great-er student and other populations. P08.16 A Mapping Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis on Chinese HerbalMedicines for Ulcerative Colitis Yuxin Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China162 Global Advances in Health and Medicine3Centre for Studies in Constitution Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 4Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Yuxin Sun, nothingsyx@163.com Abstract Purpose: T o identify, describe, and organize the current available evidence about Chinese herbal medicine on ulcer- ative colitis. Methods: We performed a search of the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Chinese CBM (Chinese Biomedical Literature) Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP Information, and Wanfang Database to identify systematic reviews (SRs) with or with- out meta-analysis published between establishment of data- bases and July 2019. T wo independent literature reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data. Methodological qual- ity of the included systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. We used tables and a bubble plot to display the results. Results: The map is based on 58 SRs that met eligibility criteria. The quality of the included SRs showed critically low quality. The corresponding results mostly favored the intervention arm. The oral administration and enema with Chinese and Western medicine was the intervention most widely studied. Oral combined enema is the most widely used route of administration in the trials. We defined the clinical efficacy in detail, including clinical effectiveness, total effective rate, cure rate, significant efficiency and ineffective. Compared with conventional western medicine, 56 studies reported positive outcomes. The other 2 studies reported no difference in clinical efficacy compared with conventional medicine of western medicine. There were 33 studies reporting safety outcomes, 7 of which reported a negative incidence of adverse reaction rate, with the rest being pos- itive. Safety outcomes were not reported in 24 studies. Publication bias was not investigated in 11 studies. There were 27 that did not report funding support, and 14 of them were dissertations. Conclusion: This evidence mapping was built on the basis of SRs, which qualified by the AMSTAR 2 tool as of critically low quality. Further evaluation of the effects of Chinese herbal medicine alone or in combination with Chinese and Western medicine and multiple administration routes is necessary.P08.22 A New Study Design Approach for Complementary Alternative MedicineClinical Trials: A Methodological China Contact: Mingkun Yu, yumingkun163@163.com Abstract Purpose: T o explore the characteristics of clinical studies used objective performance criteria. We hoped to provide a more information about it for subsequent clinical researchers. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase for all articles which uses objective performance criteria in the international (see Figure 1). Full-text screen- ing and data extraction were conducted by 2 reviewauthors (MKY and MY). We extracted relevant information such as the article baseline, the study baseline, the objective performance criteria, the outcome index, and so on. Results: A total of 51 papers were included. The first arti- cle using the objective performance criteria was publishedin 2001, no related articles were detected during the period 2002 to 2009 (see Figure 2). In addition, 26 articles (26 of 51, 51.0%) were published in 2017 to 2018, IF \u00bc201.23. From 2001 to 2018, 40 single-arm clinical trials, 4 retro- spective studies, 2 observational studies, 2 randomized con- trolled trials, 2 diagnostic trials, and 1 prospective case sum- mary analysis were published. Studies with cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease accounted for 86%(see Figure 3), and studies on the effectiveness or safety of medical devices accounted for 76.5% of all. Regarding the objective performance criteria, the objective performancecriteria was mostly derived from the data of clinical trials of other similar products (29 of 51, 56.9%), national standards (10 of 51, 19.6%), and meta-analysis of multiple clinicalstudies. Conclusion: The objective performance criteria can often be an effective alternative in situations where comparisons cannot be achieved. However, there were different ways to use the objective performance criteria in different studies. However, there were currently few methodological studies on the objective performance criteria. In existing studies,the objective performance criteria was widely used in many kinds of trials such as in single-arm clinical trials, retrospec- tive, observational studies, randomized controlled trials,and prospective case summaries. More than half of the objective performance criteria were determined by the pre- vious randomized controlled trial.Abstracts 163P08.23 Methods to Improve the Retention of Participants in Clinical Trials: A Methodological China Contact: Mingkun Yu, yumingkun163@163.com Abstract Purpose: We hoped to collect suggestions from published methodological papers to improve the subject retentionand the quality of the clinical trials. Methods: Published studies were comprehensively searched from their inception to April 2019: PubMed, theCochrane Library, Embase, Chinese National KnowledgeInfrastructure Database (CNKI), VIP Chinese Science andT echnique Journals Database, Wanfang Database, SinoMedDatabase (see Figure 1). Results: A total of 52 methodological studies were includ- ed (see Table 1). Moreover, 19 different subject-dependentfactors affecting subject retention and 15 methods ofimproving subject retention were detected and outlined(see T able 2). Our research also finds that there is no sci-entific, systematic, and overall evaluation system for themethodological research on retention; and the criticalrole of such quality assessment indicators is ignored in clin-ical trials, such as the number of centers, the type of dis-ease, and the specific details of the trial treatment (thefrequency of follow-ups, the frequency of blood draw, etc). Conclusion: The shedding and missing data on the reten- tion for clinical trials have greatly undermined the value ofclinical trials. The strategies used to improve the retentionof participants in clinical trial vary from disease to disease,from country to country, and from trial to trial. Our studydivided the factors that influence the retention and themethod of improving the retention into recruitment,informed consent, and follow-up phases. At the sametime, we made recommendations. In particular, investiga-tors need to pay attention to factors about whether thesubject is fully informed, the disease, randomness, and drug.These may affect the retention. We also suggested that inclinical trials, researchers should pay attention to methodssuch as motivational interviews to improve the retention.P08.24 Core Outcome Sets of Integrity of Modern and Traditional Chinese Medicine on Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Yanan Sun1, Changhe Yu2, and Liyun He3 1Xuanwu Hospital, Beijing, China 2Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing, China 3China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China Contact: Changhe Yu, yakno2@163.com Abstract Purpose: T o develop the Core Outcome Set (COS) of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (TCM-COS-CHB), whose frame includes the core outcome domains, outcomes, the instruments measur-ing outcomes, and the time points of measurement. Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hepatitis B participant sample was con-ducted, and the main data were extracted including general information about the identity of the reference, specific information regarding the study and information pertainingto the potential outcomes and their measures and measur- ing time. And then, 2 rounds of expert panels were imple- mented. At the first meeting, participants were firstly askedto complete the ratings about the importance of various potential domains and outcomes in 2 rounds of question- naires, and then to review and make a consensus relating tothe core domains and underlying outcomes. A consensus meeting was conducted to rate specific outcome instru- ments identified and measuring time.Results: Nine hundred sixty literatures were included in the systematic review, and 123 outcomes with their mea- suring time and 20 instruments were identified. The resultsof expert panel were that the domains and their own out- comes were serum indexes fetoprotein, prothrombin time, prothrombin activity, inter- national normalized ratio), virus index (5 index of hepatitisb, quantity level of HBVDNA), quality of life (CLDQ), safety indexes (renal function test, blood routine test [RT], urine RT, stool RT, electrocardiogram), imaging indicators (ultra-sounds of liver and spleen), the adverse reaction/adverse events, and TCM patterns. The measuring time points were baseline, treatment periods of 1st, 3rd, 6th, and12th month, and the follow-up of sixth month. However, the consensus of instruments has not been reached due to different equipment, methods applied in differentresearches. Conclusion: TCM-COS-HBV representing the minimum outcome set at least to be measured in the clinical trials164 Global Advances in Health and Medicineof TCM treatment for CHB patients was established by the consensus and could be recommended in the RCTs. P08.25 Analysis of the Randomized Controlled Trials of Chinese Medicine Non-DrugTherapy for Essential Hypertension Basedon the Comparison Between 2 ResearchInstitutions in the Community and Hospital Li Yuqi 1, Jing Li1, Shibing Liang2,3, Qiao Shuyu1, and Shang Yaxi1 1Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Shanxi University of TCM, Taiyuan, China 3Beijing University of TCM, Beijing, China Contact: Li Yuqi, liyuq@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: T o investigate current status and characteristics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Chinese medicinenonpharmacological therapy for essential hypertension(ESH) in community health-care institution (communities), compared with the hospital. Methods: We searched RCTs for ESH in Chinese data- bases published in 2013 to 2018. Then, we compared pub- lication, demography and RCTs design characteristics of RCTs in communities and hospitals. Results: A total of 85 studies (85 RCTs) were included. In addition, 19 RCTs were carried out in the community while 66 RCTs in the hospitals. Moreover, 68% (13 of 19) RCTs in community gathered in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, andHangzhou, 4 high-income cities. The mean sample size of community and hospital were 144 and 102. There were 11 kinds of interventions in community studies, including auric-ular acupoint pressing, traditional Chinese medicine com-prehensive nursing, message, and so on. There are 8 kinds of interventions in hospital RCTs, such as acupuncture, auric- ular pressing and traditional Chinese medicine comprehen-sive nursing. The auricular pressure treatmentcourse (m69d, 95% confidence interval [CI]: the hospital (m25d, 95% CI: 16-36 days). Studies in the community 26% (5 of 19) reported follow-up,which was higher than in the hospital 5% (3 of 66).Compared with hospitals, community studies use fewer safety indicators 11% (2 of 19), more syndromes indicators 37% (7 of 19), quality of life 32% (6 of 19), and outcomesindicators of hypertension 11% (2 of 19). Conclusion: Compared with hospitals, RCTs for ESH in the communities may have the large sample size, long dura- tion of intervention, and easy follow-up, and are beneficialto the observation of outcome indicators such as improve- ment in syndromes, quality of life, and outcomes of hyper-tension. However, the number of RCTs studies in the com-munity is lower than that of hospitals. The types of TCMinterventions and safety indicators are limited, which maybe related to the limited traditional Chinese medicinehealth technology and resources in the community. In the future, government departments and research institutions need pay attention to the development and research ofChinese medicine in the community. P08.26LB Assessing Equality of Delivery Mode for Mindfulness Programming: State University College of Medicine, Columbus, Ohio 2The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 3OSU Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio Contact: Maryanna Klatt, maryanna.klatt@osumc.edu Abstract Purpose: The demand for pragmatic and evidenced-based programming to address Healthcare Professional (HCP)burnout has grown exponentially. At a large academichealth system in the Midwest, Mindfulness in Motion(MIM) (one such Mindfulness program meeting these crite- ria) has consistently produced significant positive outcomes pre-post 8-week intervention on measures of burnout andperceived stress, while significantly improving work engage-ment and resilience. Over the last 18 months, the waitlistfor MIM has had an average of 250 \u00feparticipants. T o address the need for large scale dissemination of MIM,videos were created and facilitators were trained to deliverthe videos and to conduct the community-building portionof MIM. The purpose of this research was to determine if in-person delivered MIM yielded significantly different results compared to partial-video delivered MIM. Methods: Each MIM cohort was conducted with a trained intervention fidelity checker. Participant outcomes of cohorts of in-person delivered MIM (n \u00bc137) were com- pared to participant outcomes of partial-video deliveredMIM (n \u00bc83) cohorts. Paired t-tests were performed on all outcome measures to determine if significant differencesin outcome measures were detected based on method ofintervention delivery. Results: Fidelity checks reflected a 100% adherence rate to intervention protocol. Utilizing the Perceived Stress Scale,there was a nonsignificant difference ( P\u00bc.0764) betweenAbstracts modes. Index subscales showed nonsignificant differences in emotional exhaustion(P\u00bc.3513) and personal accomplishment ( P\u00bc.4600); how- ever, depersonalization yielded significant differences (P\u00bc.0023) between the 2 delivery modes. The Connor Davidson Resilience Scale showed a nonsignificant differ- ence ( P\u00bc.4920) for outcomes using delivery mode as the independent variable, as did the Utrecht Work EngagementScale ( P\u00bc.3392). Conclusion: Scalability, afforded by partial video-delivery of an effective/pragmatic mindfulness intervention to increase health and wellness outcomes, is vital to address the current HCP burnout crisis. In-Person versus Partial-Video Delivery yielded similar results on all but 1 variable. P08.27LB Characteristics of Systematic Reviews of Yoga Interventions: A Bibliometric L for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland, Laurel, Maryland 2Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany 3Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen-Mitte, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany 4Global ARCH, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 5University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 6University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, United Kingdom Contact: L. Susan Wieland, lswieland@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Y oga is a popular mind-body practice often used for treatment or prevention of health conditions. Many ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) of these yoga interventions have conducted inrecent years. We aimed to comprehensively identify and describe the characteristics of all available yoga SRs. Methods: We searched 8 databases from inception to November 19, 2019; 2 authors independently screened and selected records for inclusion. We extracted bibliographicdata and research topics for all protocols and reviews. Forcompleted SRs focusing solely on yoga, we extracted infor- mation on conclusions (positive, neutral, negative). Results: We identified 319 ongoing and completed SRs of yoga interventions; 157 (49%) focused solely on yoga and 162 (51%) included searches for yoga as part of a broader inter-vention class (eg, exercise). SRs were published in 2003 to 2019; 171 (54%) were published in 2016 or later. SRs origi- nated from 32 different countries; 81 (25%) originated fromthe United States. SRs were most often published in specialty journals (n \u00bc158; 50%), complementary and alternative med- icine journals (n \u00bc70; 22%), or SR journals (n \u00bc60; 19%). The most common topics were psychiatric (n \u00bc71), cancer (n\u00bc38), musculoskeletal (n \u00bc36), cardiovascular (n \u00bc32), metabolic (n \u00bc19), and neurological (n \u00bc19), while the most common populations specified were women (n \u00bc42), older people (n \u00bc15) and young people (n \u00bc11). Most SRs focused on yoga stated that yoga had positive effects; only 1 SR had clearly negative conclusions. Conclusion: Many SRs of yoga are conducted as part of a review of a broader class of interventions. There are severalSRs of yoga for some conditions (eg, chronic low back pain,breast cancer) and there is likely extensive duplication ofSRs covering identical research questions. We will present further information on the characteristics of yoga SRs and suggest how these results taken together may inform theresearch agenda in yoga RCTs and SRs. P09: Other Research P09.01 Synergism in Hippocratic Wound Infection Theory and the Antimicrobial Efficacy of the Barbarum Plaster Against Staphylococcus aureus and Columbia 2College of 3Georgetown, Hakima amrih@georgetown.edu Abstract Purpose: Traditional medical systems such as Greco- Roman, Traditional Chinese, Ayurveda, Greco-Arabic/ Persian, or Unani medicine offer a wealth of knowledge that could be useful if revisited and modernized for our21st century health-care system. Although ancient woundinfection remedies rely on an interaction among ingredients to create an effect larger than the sum of the individual ingredients, empirical tests tend to focus on the efficacyof individual ingredients, resulting in an ineffective analysisand negative outcome of ancient treatments. This interdis- ciplinary study focused on the analysis of the wound infec- tion protocol in the Hippocratic Corpus through the theoryof synergism as illustrated in the barbarum plaster and the166 Global Advances in Health and Medicineevaluation of the influence and modification of Hippocratic ideas as represented in Celsus' De Medicina. Methods: First, ancient manuscripts describing wound healing have been reviewed and classically analyzed.Second, the mixture (barbarum plaster) was experimentally reconstituted in the laboratory and tested on Staphylococcus aureus andPseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms using an in vitro synthetic wound model of soft tissue infection. Descriptive statistics were used. Results: The classical analysis of ancient texts revealed that the barbarum plaster had been described as an effective treatment of open wounds for centuries. The reconstruc- tion and application of the mixture led to a significantinhibition of growth of in vitro bacterial biofilms, using the synthetic wound model of soft tissue infection. When com- pared to antibiotics (ie, ampicillin), the barbarum plasterwas shown to possess superior antimicrobial potency. Conclusion: Through the classical analysis, synergistic con- cepts were found to be integrated within the foundation ofancient Greek and Roman wound theories, and the bar- barum plaster was found to be considered the most effective treatment in Celsus' De Medicina. This pilot study highlightedancient physicians' knowledge of ingredient interactions and demonstrated a need to call on ancient medical sources for the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. P09.02 Exploring the Impact of Hospital-Based Integrative Therapies on SymptomManagement and Well-being Support Lauren Hix1, Michael Amy Wegner1, Fisackerly1, and Jeanette Greene1 1UF Health, Gainesville, Florida 2University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida Contact: Lauren Arce, arcelb@shands.ufl.edu Abstract Purpose: Hospitalized patients experience distress related to disease symptoms, side effects of treatments, andhospital-related stressors. Medications countermeasurethese problems, but a purely pharmacologic approach is incomplete. Although there is evidence that integrative therapies are effective in managing certain symptoms andside effects, the body of knowledge is limited, especially among pediatric inpatients. This observational, pragmatic, convergent mixed-methods study seeks to determine theimpact of an existing inpatient integrative therapies service by exploring what patients seek to address during sessions and how well the interventions address those concerns.Methods: Although the integrative therapies team con- ducted usual care an immunocompromised pediatric unit,the study team extracted data from practitioner progress notes. Quantitative data is being analyzed to examine how pain and other concerns are influenced by the interventions.Thematic analysis of patient and caregiver comments is underway to deepen the understanding of the impact of the provided therapies on the patient experience.Results: Preliminary analysis of data collected from 72 par- ticipants during the 15 month study period is promising. Participants who reported pain were evaluated pre- andpost-session using a validated, age-appropriate 0- to 10- point scale. The mean postsession pain reduction for par- ticipants aged 5 to 17 years was 3.3, while participants aged18 to 26 years experienced a mean reduction of 2.4 (P<.0001). Participants who reported concerns such as nausea or anxiety were asked at the end of the sessionwhether the issue was \"the same, worse, better, or gone.\" Among 350 observations, burden was improved or resolved by the end of most sessions, with no improvementreported in only 3 observations ( P<.0001); furthermore, burden was never increased postsession. Emerging themes identified by the qualitative analysis include functional gains,enhanced somatic awareness, improved self-efficacy, and demonstrable benefits despite obstacles such as session interruptions, lack of initial patient/family buy-in, and inabil-ity of some patients to communicate verbally with integra- tive practitioners. Conclusion: TBD. P09.03 The Concept of Qi in Tai Chi and Qigong: Pseudoscientific, but So What? George Bao1 1Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, New York Contact: George Bao, geb9031@med.cornell.edu Abstract Purpose: Qi, often translated as \"vital energy,\" is a central concept in Tai Chi and Qigong that has puzzled physicians,scientists, and patients in the West. Qi is not falsifiable by the scientific method and thus cannot be subject to scien- tific inquiry. Understandably, scholars in various disciplineshave criticized it as \"pseudoscientific.\" Even as medicalresearch reveals the health benefits of T ai Chi and Qigong, many wonder how to treat this foreign and seem- ingly outdated concept when promoting these meditativepractices. Integrative health professionals must be equipped to discuss this concept intelligently. Although some T ai Chi and Qigong practitioners insist on the existence of Qi,Abstracts 167more skeptical thinkers suggest that a scientific understand- ing should replace this \"superstitious\" idea. Both sides, however, should consider a few subtle, clarifying pointsoften missing from the discussion. First, as an ancient meta-physical concept, Qi is not intended to be subject to modern scientific scrutiny, and science's inability to verify its existence does not affirm its nonexistence. In fact, underthe philosophical system of idealism, Qi cannot be said to be less real than things that are verifiable by science. Similarly, under the instrumental and pragmatic view of sci-ence, health professionals and scientists should be cautious not to declare what is metaphysically real or not real but instead what is useful and not useful. Second, even thoughQi may be pseudoscientific, it remains useful and indispens- able to the correct practice of Tai Chi and Qigong. Tai Chi and Qigong practitioners routinely imagine and perceive theflow of Qi to guide their movements, breathing, and mental activity. As such, Qi and related metaphysical concepts serve as a useful mental model during practice, and beliefin their existence may be viewed as an \"expedient means\" to allow one to achieve one's health goals.

P09.04 Costus pictus Therapeutic India 2Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Vadodara, India 3Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Delhi, India 4B. V. Patel PERD Centre, Ahmedabad, India Contact: Abstract Purpose: Diabetes is a complex multifactorial disease. The prevalence of diabetes throughout the world is increasing, nearly half (46%, 415 million) of the adult population is living with diabetes and the majority of them are with Type 2Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). T2DM-mediated alterations in the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) of the drugs are responsible for the lack of rationalized therapeu-tic management of it. Because of this, the majority of the T2DM cases progress to associated comorbidities depend- ing on patient related factors. Therefore, transdisciplinaryand clinically translational approaches are required to address such issues. Methods: We used system approach taking T2DM and T2DM associated gastroenteropathic complications as acase example. We developed a clinically simulated animal model of T2DM with NSAID-induced gastroenteropathy at different phases of exaggerated the NSAID-gastroenteropathic com- plication that increases with respect to its progression. T2DM significantly increases the systemic exposure of met-formin with respect to its progression and/or presence of NSAID-gastroenteropathy. Post T2DM 60-day metformin treatment was able to prevent significant rise in areaunder curve (AUC0- 1) and maximum concentration (Cmax) and decreases clearance (CL) and volume of distri- bution (Vd), unlike 0- and 120-day (with and without NSAID-gastroenteropathy). Therefore, based on our previ-ous experiences and literature, we selected Costus pictus as a potential lead with multi-targetability to manage this com- plex multifactorial disease. Phytoconstituents of C. pictus also holds an ability to target altered Cytokines-Hormones-Neurotransmitters-T ransporters interplay. C. pictus efficiently prevented T2DM altered PK-PD ofmetfomrin. Conclusion: These in vitro-in vivo studies for therapeutic adjuvant potential of C. pictus with metformin in diabetic rats with gastroenteropathic complications show beneficialdrug(s)-herb(s)-disease(s) interactions. The degree of ther-apeutic rationalization may be increased with respect to different phases of T2DM and/or associated comorbidity. P09.08 Intensive, Multidisciplinary Lifestyle Modification Program (IM Fit) forOverweight/Obese Cancer Survivors: APreliminary MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 2University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas Contact: Aimee Christie, ajchristie@mdanderson.org Abstract Purpose: Overweight/obesity is associated with increased risk of cancer recurrence, increased severity of treatment- related effects, and decreased functional health. Lifestyle modification, including proper nutrition, physical activity,168 Global Advances in Health and Medicineand stress management, improves multiple health outcomes in cancer survivors. We developed and implemented anintensive lifestyle modification program for overweightcancer survivors through our Integrative Medicine Center. Methods: The program consisted of 12-weekly 4-hour group sessions and 3 individual sessions with a clinical psy-chologist, dietitian, and physical therapist. Eligibility criteriawas body mass index (BMI) >25. Assessments included measures of psychosocial health, physical function, andnutritional intake, as well as weight and body compositionat pre- and postintervention. Paired ttests were used to examine change from pre- to postintervention. Programimplementation and data collection is on-going. Results: T wenty-nine participants were included in IM Fit with a dropout rate of 10%. Program completers were mostly female (92%), with an initial mean BMI of 35.5 (range: 25.8-61.8), mean age of 62.7, with most commoncancer history being breast cancer (62%). Participants aver-age weight loss was 8.4 lbs (range \u00fe2.2 to/C023.3), with a significant reduction over time between pre weight (mean- \u00bc211.3, SD \u00bc57.3) and post weight (mean \u00bc202.9, Approximately 75% of program com- pleters completed averageactivity increased from to1915 min/week, P<.01. Paired ttests also showed signifi- cant reductions in servings per week of white bread, chips,and desserts, with an increase in servings of beans.Depression and anxiety scores decreased (improved) byapproximately 3 points, P<01. Conclusion: Delivering a multidisciplinary, outpatient life- style modification program was feasible and demonstratedpositive changes in physical, nutritional, and emotionalhealth. The IM Fit program provides a framework for theinclusion of a formal lifestyle modification program as partof oncology care. P09.09 Nurse-Led dunhan01@nyulangone.org Abstract Purpose: Ostomy changes can be stressful for both patient and registered nurse (RN), potentially impacting patient andnurse satisfaction. NYU Langone Health built a new hospitalin 2018. We used the new technology to teach nurses how tomodify the hospital environment to reduce stress and anxietyfor themselves and their patients during ostomy changes.Methods: This program was implemented over a 7-week period. A preintervention survey was conducted to assessRN perception of ostomy changes and their perception ofpatients' responses at baseline. RNs were educated on howto access relaxation videos, how to utilize the videos tocreate a soothing environment, and how to performrelaxation breathing techniques with patients. A postinter-vention survey was conducted to assess impact of the inter-vention on the RN and their perception of patients'responses. Results: Results showed lessened stress for the RN during ostomy changes and that nurses perceived their patients'stress, anxiety and anticipatory anxiety to also decreasewhen using the intervention. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that incorporating relax- ation breathing, imagery, and music to create a healing envi- ronment during the ostomy change process may decrease the stress of the RN and that nurses perceive it to improvepatient experience. P09.11 Ayurvedic Bio-cleansing Method (Panchakarma) 1Ayurvedic Southern California University of Health Science, Whittier, California 2Faculty of Ayurveda, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India 3Southern California University of HealtH Sciences, Whittier, California Contact: Anupama Kizhakkeveettil, anukv2017@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: This work is aimed at reviewing the research pertaining to the Ayurvedic bio-cleansing methods(Panchakarma) in the management of skin disorders. Methods: Literature search was conducted using the term Ayurveda OR Panchakarma AND skin conditions ORKushta. The studies published in English language till 2019September were included in the review. The search enginesused for this review were PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, andCochrane Center Registry of Controlled T rials. Referencesof selected articles were searched for any additional studies.Additional search was conducted for possibilities of under-standing the mechanism of action of bio-cleansing methodbased on recent scientific developments. Results: Literature search provided 14 citations. We have included case reports, case series, as well as randomizedclinical trials for the purpose of this review. These studiesindicate that Ayurveda interventions can be used for theAbstracts 169management of different skin conditions. Majority of the published studies indicate that Ayurvedic bio cleansing has been shown to have beneficial results on treating eczemaand psoriasis. Detailed explanation is available in classical textbooks Ayurveda regarding the use of Panchakarma for the skin conditions. Ayurveda offers a multimodal approach to the treatment of skin diseases with herbal supplements and Panchakarma therapies (bio cleansing and rejuvenation) coupled with yoga to restore the harmony of the body, mind, and self. This work explains Ayurvedic pathology ofskin conditions and theoretical and practical application of Panchakarma in Dermatology as well as evidence that sup- ports its use in skin diseases. This review systematically discusses and enumerates Ayurvedic protocols for manage- ment of skin condition using bio-cleansing methods, fromclassical text books of Ayurveda as well as effectiveness of these therapies from scientific research. Conclusion: Information from the classical textbook of Ayurveda and scientific evidence indicate that Ayurvedic bio cleansing may be helpful in the management of the skin conditions. P09.12 Stibium Metallicum Praeparatum Purpose: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) one of the most limiting side effects of cytotoxic cancer therapy and often leads to adaptations in the che- motherapeutic protocol. Despite a high incidence of CIPN,up to 83% of patients treated with paclitaxel, no agents are recommended for the prevention of CIPN. Based on expert consensus, Stibium 6x is applied in anthroposophically extended medicine to prevent and to treat CIPN. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the incidence of CIPN in patients undergoing a cytotoxic cancer therapy and receiving Stibium 6x as a preventive therapy. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study between January 2017 and August 2019 at the out- patient clinic of the Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine at the University of Bern, Switzerland. All patients starting a therapy with Stibium6x to prevent CIPN and willing to participate in the study were included. CIPN was evaluated at each visit of the patient using a short-form of the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20, a 20-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of neurop-athy symptoms experienced by patients.Results: In total, 50 patients were included, of which 8 (16.0%) patients were lost to follow-up. Among the 42 remaining patients, 23 (54.8%) developed CIPN symptomsduring the chemotherapy. Among the 16 (32.0%) patientstreated with paclitaxel, 3 (18.8%) were lost to follow up,and 8 (61.5%) developed CIPN symptoms during the chemotherapy. Conclusion: This study shows an overall incidence of CIPN of 54.8% and an incidence of 61.5% in patients treatedwith paclitaxel. As compared to the high incidence usually described in patients treated with paclitaxel, the lower inci- dence observed in this study suggests that Stibium 6x maybe beneficial as a treatment option to prevent CIPN. Thisstudy will be used for the planning of a randomized con- trolled clinical trial. P09.13 Acupuncture for Chronic Hepatitis B Dezhao Kong1, Ning Liang2, Ping Liu2 1The Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shen Yang, Liaoning, China 2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 3Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, Liaoning, China 4The Affiliated Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China 5The Cochrane dezhaok2007@163.com Abstract Purpose: T o assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture versus no intervention or sham acupuncture in people withchronic hepatitis B. Methods: We included randomised clinical trials compar- ing acupuncture versus no intervention or sham acupunc-ture in people with chronic hepatitis B. We presented thepooled results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the risks of bias using risk of bias tools. We evaluated the certainty of evidence usingGRADE.170 Global Advances in Health and MedicineResults: We included 8 randomised clinical trials with 555 randomised participants. All included trials compared acu- puncture versus no intervention. All trials used heteroge- neous co-interventions applied equally in the comparedgroups. All trials were assessed at overall high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low due. None of the included trials aim to assess patient- centred outcomes. We are uncertain whether acupuncture, compared with no intervention, has an effect regarding adverse events considered not to be serious (RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.43-1.06; I2\u00bc98%; 2 showed a reduction in detectable HBV-DNA (a non-validated surrogate out- come; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 1 trial, participants). Conclusion: The clinical effects of acupuncture for chronic hepatitis B remain unknown. In view of the wide usage of acupuncture, any conclusion that one might try to draw in the future should be based on data on patient and clinically relevant outcomes, assessed in large, high-quality rando- mised sham-controlled trials with homogeneous groups of participants and transparent funding. P09.14 Analysis of the Citation of Evidence in Traditional Chinese Medicine ClinicalPathway Huizhen Li 1, Meijun Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China 2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 3Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China Contact: Huizhen Li, 1360663155@qq.com Abstract Purpose: The clinical pathway originated in the United States. Since the introduction of China in the late 20th cen- tury, it has developed rapidly. The Traditional Chinese Medicine clinical pathway has started later than the Western medicine clinical pathway. This research aims at ana- lyzing the citation of evidence in Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinical Pathway and provides suggestions for the revision of the clinical pathway of traditional Chinese medicine.Methods: Search published T raditional Chinese Medicine clinical pathways from the website of the NationalAdministration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. T wo reviewers independently extracted the information includ- ing publish time, TCD code of the disease, evidence beingcited and its publish time, and so on. Cross-checking the information correctly, analyze the number and type of ref- erenced evidence, the time interval between clinical path-way and referenced evidence, and so on. Results: As of June 2019, a total of 405 Traditional Chinese Medicine clinical pathways had been released. The clinicalpathways involve internal, surgical, gynecological and pedi- atric diseases. Moreover, 405 pathways all refer to evidence, and each pathway cites a median of 3 evidence. More than90% of the pathways cited evidence in the diagnostic andtherapeutic evaluation sections, and less than 2% of the pathways cited evidence in other therapies and rehabilita- tion and nursing parts. Types of evidence cited: mainly stan-dard indicator, guideline, textbook, consensus opinion, ancient book, and clinical research. Standard indicator's citation frequency is the highest (683), followed by clinicalpractice guideline (488) and textbook (236). Evidence time- liness: 89.25% of the evidence reported publication time. Time interval between standard indicator and pathway isthe longest. Conclusion: The published Traditional Chinese Medicine clinical pathways are formulated based on evidence, but thecitation rate of evidence in the different parts of pathway is quite different, some clinical pathway does not report the evidence cited normatively. And some evidence is less time-sensitive. P09.15 The Analysis of Disease Spectrum of Traditional Chinese and Western MedicineClinical Pathways in China Ning Liang 1, of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China 2China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China 3Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, China Contact: Ning Liang, liangning229@163.com Abstract Purpose: Clinical pathways play an important role when promoting the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) paymentsystem. China has already published a series of clinical path- ways separately in traditional Chinese medicine and in west- ern medicine, which seem to be not suitable for the currentAbstracts 171integrative medical system. Therefore, it is important to analyze and compare all the published traditional and west- ern clinical pathways, and the analysis of disease spectrum can help to understand the possible dominant diseases of traditional and of western medicine, and to provide refer- ences for developing future integrative clinical pathways on disease selection. Methods: We searched the websites of Chinese Medical Association (https://www.cma.org.cn/art/2016/12/9/art_41_ 18009.html) and National Administration of T raditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/) to obtain the clinical pathways published before May 2019. T wo authors independently extracted the basic characteristics including title, involved disease, publication institution, and publica- tion date. T wo authors classified the clinical pathways based on 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) system. Descriptive analysis was per- formed to analyze publication trend and disease spectrum. Results: A total of 1212 western clinical pathways involving 20 disease categories were obtained from 2009 to 2017. The top 3 disease categories were cancer, digestive system, and circulatory system diseases. Moreover, 418 Chinese medicine clinical pathways involving 18 disease categories were published from 2010 to 2018. The top 3 disease cate- gories were digestive system abnormalities, and genito- urinary system diseases. For the 2 categories perinatal period originated conditions and factors affecting health status and exposure to health-care institutions, only western medicine clinical pathways were available. The number of western clin- ical pathways is higher than Chinese clinical pathways; how- ever, there are some diseases which only have Chinese clin- ical pathways but not western medicine pathways. Conclusion: The disease spectrum covered by current clinical pathways involving blank filed and dominant diseases should be considered for future integrative clinical pathways development.P09.16 Reporting of Protocol Rationale and Content Validity in Randomized ClinicalTrials of Tai Chi: A Systematic Evaluation Daniel Litrownik Gilliam2, Gloria Medical Center, Somerville, Massachusetts 2Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brookline,Massachusetts 3Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 4Osher Center for Integrative Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts Contact: Daniel Litrownik, dlitrown@bidmc.harvard.edu Abstract Purpose: Mind-body exercise interventions are typically multimodal, complex, and pluralistic, and few have beendeveloped with the goal of therapeutically targeting a spe- cific medical population. It is thus important that clinical trials evaluating mind-body interventions provide some jus-tification for the use of the specific protocol being evaluat- ed. This article reports the results of a systematic review of the quality of reporting of protocol rationale and contentvalidity for using a specific Tai Chi protocol in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Electronic literature searches were conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and the Cochrane Library from inception through June 2015. Search terms were Tai Chi, Taiji, Tai Chi Chuan; searches were limitedto English-language RCTs. Inclusion and exclusion of trialswere reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We assessed the level of reporting with respect to T ai Chi protocol validation using a 5-point grading system based onwhether (1) a specific protocol was mentioned, (2) rationale for the specific protocol was stated and supported, and (3) formal evaluation for content validity was conducted. Results: There was significant heterogeneity in the quality of reporting related to protocol rationale and content valid- ity. Moreover, 171 publications were identified. Studies metbetween 0 and 4 validity criteria (out of possible 5, more indicating better quality), with a mean of 2.52 ( /C6SD 1.2), median of 3. T wenty (12%) trials did not mention a specificTai Chi protocol, 10 (6%) trials met 0 of 5 criteria, and 47 (31%) studies met 4 of 5 criteria. Formal validity assess- ments were employed in only one trial. Conclusion: The poor quality of protocol rationale and content validity reporting limits our ability to accurately evaluate the evidence of Tai Chi as a therapeutic interven-tion. The development of formal guidelines for developing172 Global Advances in Health and Medicineand reporting intervention validity for multimodal mind- body exercises like T ai Chi is recommended. P09.17 International Standardization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Yuqi 1Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China 2School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Beijing, China Contact: Yuqi Liu, akihabara@126.com Abstract Purpose: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely practiced in nearly 200 countries and regions and over one-third of the world population has tried TCM. So the international standardization of TCM has gained more and more concerns. However, there is lack of an overall blueprint. This study aims to explore the current situation of the international standardization of TCM and proposes an overall planning for the future. Methods: Search the websites of 2 main TCM international standardization platforms, World Health Organization (WHO) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and collect information from some countries and regions. Then analyze the data based on the contents of the international deliverables. Results: WHO published 9 guidelines in TCM and WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific developed 5 guide- lines and standards. Of all the 14 guidelines and standards, 8 related to the safety, quality and appropriate use of Chinese herbal medicine; 3 focused on the acupuncture, including acupoint location, clinical research and basic training and safety; the last 3 were for terminologies, methodologies on research and evaluation, and developing consumer informa- tion on proper use of traditional medicine. The 11th version of Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) released in 2018 and the conditions of TCM were added into. ISO-TC249 pub- lished international standards, mainly on the quality andsafety, 26 were about the Chinese materia medica, 11 for acupuncture needles and other medical instrument, and 2 for terminological system of TCM. Moreover, 6 countries and regions have issued the pharmacopeia for TCM or Chinese materia medica, including China, Europe, Japan, Republic of Korea, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. Conclusion: The quality, safety and safe use of the Chinese materia medica are the firstly concerned in the world, the quality, safety and safe use of acupuncture, andterminologies are followed, and the regulations of educa- tion and training are needed in the future. P09.18 The Study on Developing the Evaluation Scale for Gastrointestinal Heat Retention Syndrome in of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Third Affiliated Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Xueyan Ma, 1366119843@qq.com Abstract Purpose: Gastrointestinal heat retention syndrome (GHRS) refers to a condition that is associated withincreased gastrointestinal heat caused by a metabolic block in energy. It is a state of digestive dysfunction, which is common in children. Symptoms are thick coating, dry stool, abnormal appetite, reduced frequency of defeca- tion, restlessness at night sleep, and halitosis. GHRS isclosely related to recurrent respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, and recurrent functional abdominal pain, and so on. However, there are no evaluation criterion toassess the degree of GHRS. This study is aimed to develop an evaluation scale for GHRS in children. Methods: A cross-section study has been conducted in Beijing. Children with GHRS aged from 3 to 14 years old were enrolled. The information included general informa- tion, the degree of GHRS, and 38 symptoms of the subjects. In addition, 24 of the symptoms were classified into 4grades by frequency or extent, while others were classified into 2 grades (the presence or absence of the symptoms). Five methods were used to select symptoms. Discrete ten-dency analysis, correlation coefficient analysis, Cronbach's a coefficient analysis, and factor analysis were used according to Classical T est Theory, and Samejima Graded Response Model was used according to Item Response Theory (IRT). If the symptoms were deleted by 2 or more methods, thesymptoms were deleted. Results: A total of 453 children were enrolled. Moreover, 7 symptoms, 10 symptoms, 2 symptoms, 5 symptoms, and 17 symptoms were, respectively, deleted by discrete tendency analysis, correlation coefficient analysis, Cronbach's acoef- ficient analysis, factor analysis, and IRT . In addition, 13 symp- toms were deleted by 2 or more methods. The evaluationscale for GHRS consisted of 25 items, including red tongue, yellow fur, heat in the palms and soles, dry stool, difficult defecation, and insomnia with restlessness, and so on.Abstracts 173Conclusion: The evaluation scale for GHRS in children including 25 symptoms has been developed in this study. P09.19 Efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Among Breast Cancer Patients: A Meta-analysis Yan Ma1, Daniel L Hall2, Qingqing Gloria Y Yeh4 1Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 3Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 4Department of General Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MassachusettsContact: Yan Ma, dr.yan.ma@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Insomnia is highly prevalent among breast cancer (BC) patients. While cognitive behavioral therapy forinsomnia (CBT -I) is the gold standard treatment for insom-nia, this treatment poses unique challenges for BC survivorsdue to lasting difficulties of diagnosis, treatment, and survi-vorship. Although CBT -I is available in integrative oncology settings, its efficacy on reducing BC survivors' insomnia remains unclear. Our review therefore aimed to assessthe evidence for the therapeutic effects of CBT -I on insom-nia in BC.Methods: A literature review search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and ClinicalTrials.gov was per- formed in August 2018. Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) that included BC patients with insomnia and atleast 1 validated self-report measure of sleep quality wereincluded in the review. Comprehensive Meta-AnalysisVersion 3.0 (Biostat, Inc., USA) was used for statistical anal-yses, and standardized mean differences (SMD) were calcu-lated as the primary measurement. Results: We included 13 RCTs (total N \u00bc1302, 7 studies involves phone or remote technology as delivery format, 5with active control, 4 with long-term follow-up), Most CBT -Iinterventions incorporated at least 3 of the main compo-nents (sleep hygiene, stimulus control, and sleep restriction).Pooled effect sizes CBT -I delivery formats, length/numbers of -I sessions). Conclusion: As an integrative oncology intervention, CBT - I is efficacious for reducing insomnia in women treated forBC, with medium-to-large effect sizes that persist afterintervention delivery ends. Given the variability in the CBT -I components tested in RCTs, future studies should investigate the optimal integration of CBT -I componentsfor managing chronic insomnia during BC survivorship. P09.20 Attitudes and Perceptions of Massage Therapy Among Undergraduate Pre- Professional Health Students Donya Nemati1, Samantha Zabel2, Abby Church2, Amber Comer2, and Niki Munk2 1Department of Health Sciences, Indiana University School of Health and Human Sciences, Indianapolis, Indiana 2University of Indiana\u2014IUPUI, Indianapolis, Indiana Contact: Donya Nemati, dnemati@iu.edu Abstract Purpose: Determine attitudes and perceptions of a pre- professional health sciences student population towardmassage therapy. In addition, we sought to determine indi- cators for negative or neutral massage therapy perception. Methods: Cross-sectional survey study for undergraduate pre-professional health sciences students. The Attitudes T oward Massage scale (ATOM) was used and includes 2 subscales (healthful and pleasant) and 7 supplementalitems pertaining to sexuality and gender preference of mas-sage therapists. Additional questions collected lifetime mas- sage consultation and usage. Results: Massage therapy utilization prevalence was 35.6% (lifetime) and 18.6% (last 12 months) for the N \u00bc129 par- ticipants. Overall positive attitudes toward massage therapy was reported (mean \u00bc36.1/C65.0). Participants who had used massage therapy in their lifetime or/and in the past12 months expressed more positive attitudes toward mas-sage than those who had not (lifetime: 37.7 /C64.8 P\u00bc.03). Participants who had never consulted a massage practitioner in their lifetime had higher proportions of neg-ative/natural attitudes and perceptions toward massage(22.9% vs 8.7%; P\u00bc.04). Men were more likely to prefer a massage therapist of the opposite sex compared to women (38.9% vs 2.1%; P/C20.0001). Conclusion: Massage experience positively impacted mas- sage attitudes and perceptions for pre-professional healthstudents. While male therapists were generally perceived174 Global Advances in Health and Medicinewell in our sample, when given the choice, both participant genders indicated preference for female massage therapists.These preferences may point to potential gender biasesamong those seeking to become health professionals.With the massage field working toward more integration into mainstream health care, gender biases could limit the extent to which patients are referred to male massagetherapists or hinder career opportunities for male thera-pists. Further research is needed to understand how healthprofessionals develop their perceptions and attitudes aboutmassage therapy; particularly with regard to gender prefer-ences and how gender bias may impact massage professio-nals and patient referrals. P09.21 Complementary and Alternative Medicine Mention and Recommendations Are Lacking in Hypertension Guidelines: A Systematic Review Jeremy Y Ng1, Kevin Gilotra1, and Jason W Busse1 1Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Contact: Jeremy Y. Ng, ngjy2@mcmaster.ca Abstract Purpose: Despite the therapeutic success of antihyperten- sive medications such as angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors, up to 25% of patients with hypertension haveself-medicated with complementary and alternative medi-cine (CAM), meaning that health-care professionals shouldbe mindful of such patient practices. Given this need cou-pled with the fact that the mention of CAM or the quality of CAM recommendations, if any, is unknown in clinical prac- tice guidelines (CPGs) about the treatment or managementof hypertension, this study sought to determine this. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify CPGs about the treatment or management of hypertension.MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Guidelines InternationalNetwork databases were searched, along with the NationalCenter for Complementary and Integrative Health website,to identify published between 2008 and 2018. T wo indepen-dent reviewers evaluated the quality of reporting for eachguideline that provided CAM recommendations, and the specific section providing CAM recommendations, using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II(AGREE II) instrument. Results: From 1387 unique search results, 18 guidelines on the treatment and/or management of hypertension werefound; however, only a single CPG contained mention andrecommendations of CAM. With regard to scaled domain percentages, this overall guideline scored better than theCAM section in every domain (overall, CAM): (1) scope andpurpose (88.9%, 66.7%), (2) clarity of presentation rigor of develop-ment (35.4%, and (6) editorial independence (4.2%, 0.0%). Conclusion: The quality of CAM versus overall recom- mendations could not be assessed in hypertension CPGs,the quantity of such recommendations is severely lacking incurrently existing guidelines. Given that it is known that ahigh proportion of patients with hypertension self-medicate with CAM, current hypertension guidelines' lack of CAM treatment or management recommendations reflects alarge gap for both clinicians and patients. P09.22 Few Complementary and Alternative Medicine Recommendations Exist in Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Practice Guidelines: A Systematic Review Jeremy Y Ng1, Vanessa Kishimoto1, and Jason W Busse1 1Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Contact: Jeremy Y Ng, ngjy2@mcmaster.ca Abstract Purpose: Up to two-thirds of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) use complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) therapies. Given the high prevalence, an evaluationof the prevalence of CAM in evidence-based clinical practiceguidelines (CPGs) is absent from the literature. The objec-tive of this research was to determine the mention of CAM, and assess the reporting quality of recommendations, among CPGs for MS. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and GIN databases systematically and also searched theNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website for guidelines about the treatment or man- agement of MS published between 2008 and 2018. T woindependent reviewers identified whether a guideline pro-vided CAM recommendations, and if so, both the entireCPG and the CAM-specific section were assessed withthe Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II(AGREE II) instrument. Results: From 147 search results, 12 unique CPGs were eligible, and 6 mentioned CAM of which 4 made recom-mendations regarding their use. Among the 4 CPGs, theAbstracts 175average scaled domain percentages from AGREE II were (overall, CAM): (1) clarity of presentation (90.3%, 83.3%), (2) scope and purpose (87.5%, 86.8%), develop-ment (80.0%, and (6) stakeholder (55.6%, 39.6%).Conclusion: While the inclusion of CAM recommenda- tions in MS guidelines does exist, they were only present in one third of all eligible guidelines. The quality of CAMrecommendations versus overall recommendations was not assessed due to the low number of guidelines found. As it is commonplace for MS patients to seek CAM, while a fewguidelines are available that provide clinicians and patients with CAM treatment guidance, a gap still exists as the majority of guidelines do not. P09.23 Complementary and Alternative Medicine Recommendations in Clinical PracticeGuidelines for T ype 2 Diabetes AreLimited: A Systematic Review Jeremy Y Ng 1, Kiran Verma1, and Jason W Busse1 1Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario,CanadaContact: Jeremy Y Ng, ngjy2@mcmaster.ca Abstract Purpose: Between 25% and 57% of patients with diabetes report using complementary and alternative medicine(CAM). Health-care providers that attend to such individu- als may refer to clinical practice guidelines in order to assist patients in making evidence-based decisions; however, theavailability and quality of recommendations regarding CAM for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is uncertain. We therefore sought to identify, and evaluate the quality of, recommendationspertaining to CAM in guidelines for the treatment or man- agement of T2D. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Guidelines International Network databases, as well as the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website, to identifyT2D treatment or management clinical practice guidelines published between 2008 and 2018. T wo independent reviewers evaluated the quality of reporting for each guide-line that provided CAM recommendations, and the specific section providing CAM recommendations, using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II(AGREE II) instrument.Results: Of 2467 unique search results, 17 guidelines proved eligible, 2 of which included recommendation forCAM. Among the 2 CPGs, the average scaled domain per- centages from AGREE II were (overall, CAM): (1) scope and purpose (81.9%, 73.6%), (2) clarity of of development (45.8%, 32.1%). Conclusion: The inclusion of CAM recommendations is infrequent among T2D guidelines. The quality of CAM rec- ommendations versus overall recommendations was not assessed due to the low number of guidelines found.Given that a high proportion of diabetes patients use CAM, current T2D guidelines' neglect of CAM treatment or management highlights a major gap in guidance for clini-cians and patients. P09.24 Assessment of the ReCode Protocol: An Alternative to the MonotherapeuticApproach in Patients With EarlyAlzheimer's Disease Bianca Palushaj 1, Mikhail Kogan2, Jon Hikson3, and Julie Wendt3 1Stanford University, Palo Alto, California 2George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia 3Center for Integrative Medicine, George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia Contact: Bianca Palushaj, bianca.moiseff@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: T o explore and treat the networks of physiologic imbalance that contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by using the ReCode Protocol, or Reversal of CognitiveDecline. Said program is the brain child of Dr Dale Bredesen, at Bucks Memory Institute, University of California, Los Angeles. Methods: Thirty-three patients are followed by an inter- disciplinary team of medical doctors, naturopathic doctor, nutritionist/health coach, and mind-body-spirit practition- er. The initial evaluation aims to identify potential drivingfactors; labs include comprehensive nutritional and meta-bolic assessment as well as toxicity and hormonal testing, including but not limited to: B12, Vit D3, Zinc:Copper pregnenolone, and cortisol. Patients complete cognitive and metabolic assessments every 3 to 6 months. The treatment protocol consists of 2 core components: (1)Universal life style optimization measures such as stress176 Global Advances in Health and Medicinereduction and mindfulness training, diet changes, and cog- nitive and physical exercises to enhance neuronal functionand regeneration. (2) Individualized treatment of underlying drivers. Some common contributing factors include sleep apnea, heavy metal toxicity, and hormonal deficiencies.Treatment principles may vary from standard of care, for example, even subclinical hypothyroid (usually not treated due to lack of evidence) will be corrected with or withoutthyroid replacement. Results: In addition to longitudinal MOCA data, we will present biomarkers in table format as well as relevant envi- ronmental exposures and contributing clinical diagnoses. Conclusion: The purpose of this research is to empower patients, caregivers, and clinicians by showing that AD can be slowed or even reversed. As we come to better under-stand the metabolic and physiologic networks involved inAD, we can educate on and practice preventive AD care. In the era of personalized medicine, we hope to better under- stand how to approach and tailor personalized programsfor AD. Furthermore, the idea of multiple drivers underly- ing 1 disease phenotype is a principle that can be applied beyond AD as well. P09.25 Enhancing Collaboration Through an Integrative Health and Medicine Organizational Integrative Health, Chicago, Illinois 2Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine, San Diego, California 3Southern California University of Health Sciences, Whittier, California 4Virtual Health Library on Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Health Practices 5Integrative, Complementary, and Traditional Health Practices Section of the American Public Health Association Contact: Beth Rosenthal, brosenthal@integrativehealth.org Abstract Purpose: The rise of Integrative Health and Medicine (IHM) in the last 2 decades has drawn attention from both the public and policy makers. Several IHM organiza-tions have been working together to strengthen their impact. Collaboration can be further enhanced with knowl- edge about interprofessional IHM organizations. Here, wepresent an overview of IHM interprofessional organizations with a shared vision for advancing health and well-being. Our intention is to cultivate awareness of eachorganization's distinct mission and goals, and enhance visi- bility among health-care users, policy makers, educators,practitioners, and the general public by creating a visualresource with information about these IHM interprofes- sional organizations. Methods: This project was initiated by the Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health (ACIH) and put togeth- er by an interprofessional and interorganizational team who knew one another from involvement in the Integrative,Complementary, and T raditional Health Practices Sectionof the American Public Health Association. The idea forthis visual was inspired by a research poster (Public Health through Integrative Complementary Traditional Health Practices\u2014Vinjamury, Ndao, Sommers) and conver-sations with leaders from The Student Alliance forIntegrative Medicine. We sought to include interprofes-sional organizations that were national or international in scope, representing multiple IHM disciplines, with a vision for advancing health and well-being. Results: The visual was first produced as a pdf in May 2019. It is now posted on various IHM organizations' websites, used as a handout at conference exhibit tables, and has beenaccepted for presentation at multiple conferences. Conclusion: This collaborative resource is meant to be a launching point for building bridges toward enhanced coor-dination and partnerships. The act of creating this resourceis in itself an example of interprofessional and interorganiza-tional collaboration. We welcome broad sharing\u2014down- load the pdf (https://integrativehealth.org/publications) and use freely. P09.26 Alterations in Heart Rate Variability associated with IBS or IBD: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Adam Sadowski1, Douglas Hanes2, and Corina Dunlap3 1National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 2Helfgott Research Institute, National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon 3Helfgott Research Institute, National College of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon Contact: Adam Sadowski, adam.sadowski@student.nunm.edu Abstract Purpose: Approximately 20% of individuals are affected by Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) globally, and another 5 mil- lion are affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Disruptions in the gut-brain axis in these conditions canincrease inflammatory cytokines, affecting the integrityAbstracts 177and motility of the intestinal lumen as well as autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Heart rate variability (HRV) can assess the state of the sympathetic and parasym-pathetic function of the ANS, but it remains unclear how HRV is associated with IBS and IBD. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the literature comparing HRV of subjects with IBS or IBD to HRV in healthy controls. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL EBSCO, and the Cochrane Database for eligible studies up to December 2018, using medical subject headings and keywords for IBS, IBD, and HRV. We included any study that cross- sectionally compared a recognized measure of HRV between a group with either IBS or IBD and a group ofmatched healthy controls, prior to any intervention. Studies were screened and data extracted from included articles by 2 authors using predefined criteria. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for each outcome, with effect size reported as standardized mean difference (SMD). Results: One hundred fifty-four studies were screened, 28 included for review (comprising n \u00bc2384 participants), with n\u00bc19 providing data suitable for meta-analysis. Analysis showed significantly lower high-frequency (HF) power inIBS patients compared to controls \u00bc0.23 (0.02, 0.44), P\u00bc.03, I 2\u00bc37%) and parasympa- thetic nervous system activity, is lower in both IBS and IBD, but conclusions are limited by the small number of studies that provide usable data as well as heterogeneity in primary study methods and measures. P09.27 Functional and Bodily Distress Syndromes: In Search for Common Causes andEffective Salles Araujo 1and Justin of California, Los Angeles, Santa Monica, California 2UCLA Center for East West Medicine, Santa Monica, California Contact: Thais Salles Araujo, thaissalles9@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Patients with functional syndromes often have exhaustive diagnostic evaluations, medical stigma, poorquality of life, and are commonly seen by integrative health practitioners. These conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyal- gia span many medical and surgical subspecialties, yet are often overlooked or managed as isolated and separatediagnosis. We reviewed the literature to explore possible common characteristics, root causes, and holistic treatment approaches to improve care for these patients. Methods: We conducted a critical literature review of PubMed from 1990 to 2019 using common search terms related to functional syndromes and integrative medicine. Narrative synthesis and relational conceptual maps wereused for analysis. Results: A conceptual map was created that showed how functional syndromes and somatoform disorders span mul-tiple and overlapping organ systems. A new research term \"bodily distress syndromes\" (BDS) is being used to re-group symptom categories includingcardiopulmonary/autonomic arousal, gastrointestinal arous-al, musculoskeletal tension and general symptoms (brain fog, fatigue). BDS are believed to share predisposing (eg, childhood trauma), precipitating (eg, infection, emotional/physical trauma, chronic stress), and perpetuating factors (eg, illness worry, central nervous system sensitization). BDS patients tend to have better outcomes with integrativemedicine therapies that involve active participation (eg,yoga, T ai Chi) compared to passive therapies (eg, acupunc- ture, manual therapies). Mainstream therapies that are more effective are central acting psychopharmacologicagents and psychological therapies including cognitive behavioral therapy and psychotherapy. A proposed common shared mechanism is dysfunctional emotionalawareness and interoception\u2014the sense of the internal state of the body, similar to posttraumatic stress disorder patients. We propose a novel therapeutic paradigm thatblends mainstream therapies and integrative approachesfocused on trauma healing, mind-body awareness and embodied movement practices. Conclusion: There is increasing appreciation of the over- lapping characteristics of functional syndromes. BDS grouping provides a larger view to potentially better evaluate, manage, and address root causes of these patients' syndromes withholistically focused integrative therapeutic approaches. P09.28 Safety Andrographis Paniculata Preparations Based on Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Yaxi Shang, 893270589@qq.com178 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: T o comprehensively evaluate the safety of Andrographis paniculata (AP) preparations. Methods: Four Chinese databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library)were searched. All types of clinical research which reportedadverse drug reactions (ADR) or adverse events (AE) aboutAP preparations were included. Data related to ADR andAE were extracted and summarized. The quality of includedstudies were assessed, and causal determination of ADR and AE were conducted. Results: We included 240 studies, including 109 random- ized controlled trials (RCTs), 18 clinical controlled trials(CCTs), 4 case series (CSs), and 109 case reports (CRs). Five studies were about compound preparations. The remaining 235 were about injections (227 studies, 96.60%)and oral preparations (8 studies, 3.40%) made from extractsof AP . The AE incidence of injections was 3.84%. All seriousAEs and ADRs were caused by injections. In RCTs, CCTs,and CSs, 9290 patients were treated with AP preparations,and 454 AEs occurred, which mainly manifested as gastro-intestinal symptoms (42.19%), skin symptoms (26.79%), andother allergy symptoms. The total incidence of AE was4.89%, and all of them were nonserious. In CRs, 156 AEsand ADRs occurred, which mainly manifested as anaphylac- tic shock (86 cases, 55.13%), skin symptoms (28 cases, 17.95%), and other allergy symptoms. Fifty-three of themwere nonserious, and 103 were serious, which mainly man-ifested as anaphylatic shock and acute renal impairment.Most AEs and ADRs relieved after suspending the drugand receiving symptomatic treatment. Only a few seriousconsequences occurred after using injections, including 4deaths and 1 vegetative state. Due to the limited informa-tion provided in studies, the causal association betweenmost AEs and AP preparations could not be inferred. Only 8 cases could be inferred as ADRs. Most of the includ- ed studies were of low quality. Conclusion: Various AEs of AP preparations have been reported in clinical studies, involving multiple systems, butonly a few of them can be inferred as ADRs. Most of the AEs were nonserious and could relieve after suspending the drug and receiving treatment. All serious AEs and ADRswere related to injections. The standardization of reportingADRs should be strengthened in the future.P09.29 Clinical Aromatherapy Pennsylvania Contact: Lisa Squires, squiresl@email.chop.edu Abstract Purpose: T o provide nurses evidenced-based tools for nonpharmacological relief of pain, anxiety, nausea andsleeplessness. Methods/Background: Pediatric Nursing has limited resources to address nonpharmacological management ofpain, anxiety, nausea, and sleeplessness. While nurses part- ner with Child Life to address specific encounters, there is a need for nurse initiated interventions to address pediatricsymptoms. Recent literature supports the use of aroma-therapy as a nursing administered intervention for pediatricpatients. Area of Focus: T o evaluate the implementation of aroma- therapy for inpatient gastroenterology and inpatient andoutpatient oncology patients by nursing. Project Process: Integrative Health, a CHOP program that sup- ports holistic wellness, formed an interprofessional teamto evaluate the evidence for safety and efficacy of aroma-therapy. After a thorough search of the literature and con-sultation with key stakeholders, 2 different oils were select-ed and a vendor was chosen. Education in the form of a computer-based learning module and an in-person class was developed for a train-the-trainer approach. The trainerswere responsible for training all nurses on the unit. Results: A pilot was initiated from June 25, 2018 to October 18, 2018. At the end of October 2018, 95 evalua-tions were collected, focus groups were conducted andEPIC data related to patient outcomes were obtained.Results showed that 41% of patients rated the aromather- apy as very beneficial, 33% said somewhat beneficial, and 4% had complete resolution of symptoms. Conclusion: Aromatherapy can be a safe and effective means for reducing pain, anxiety, nausea, and sleeplessness. Aromatherapy has been expanded to units within the hos-pital in collaboration with medical and nursing leadership.Abstracts 179P09.30 Do Music Sessions on an Inpatient Psychiatry Unit Have an Effect on Patients?A Pilot Study Carsen Sulzer 1, South Shore, University of Connecticut, Brockton, Massachusetts 2University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut 3School of Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut Contact: Carsen Sulzer, carsen.sulzer@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Psychiatric pharmacology agents, although remarkably effective, are known for their wide range of adverse effects. Thus, it is important to identify safe, effec- tive ways to potentially augment such mental health treat- ments and minimize harm. UConn's Inpatient Psychiatry Unit treats adult patients in an acute stabilization setting. We evaluated the impact of incorporating music in therapy group settings on our inpatient psychiatry unit. The studyaimed to assess if music interventions would enhance patients' therapeutic experience on the Unit. Methods: This institutional review board-approved pro- spective pilot study evaluated music's effect on patientsadmitted to our Psychiatry Unit. Self-report, paired pre- post surveys were implemented to collect data on patients' responses to 3 different types of sessions: (1) recorded music, (2) live music, and (3) control (standard group ther- apy without music). Patients rated how they felt at the time of survey for 9 outcome measures. Results: T wenty group sessions were conducted (7 recorded music, 8 live music, and 5 control) with 90 (53% male) patients participating in the study. Their character- istics and pre-session survey responses were similar across session types, excluding voluntary admission status. Adjusting for pre-session responses, we discovered signifi- cant differences among session types scales were more positive after live music ses- sions compared to control sessions. Conclusion: Patients appeared to respond most positively to live music sessions when compared to either the recorded music or control sessions. The session type-specific differ- ences were related to patients' perceived mood and quality of life. This pilot study shows music had some efficacy in enhancing hospitalized psychiatric patients' overall well- being. Future studies plan to explore whether music playedto the entire milieu (versus small-group setting only) might further positively impact patients and/or psychiatry staff.P09.31 Assessment of the Reporting Quality of Cost-Effectiveness Studies of Chinese Herbal Medicine Aidi Injection for Cancer Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Ming Yang, yangming@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: T o evaluate the reporting quality of cost- effectiveness studies of Chinese herbal medicine Aidi injec-tion on cancer care. Methods: We identified literature by electronic searches of the Chinese Network Knowledge Information (CNKI),Chinese Science Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Data, SinoMed, PubMed database, The Cochrane Library, and Embase. We included the literature of Aidi injection(Chinese herbal medicine) on cancer care. T wo researchers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the quality based on the Consolidated HealthEconomic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) state- ment. A third reviewer helped with dealing the conflicts when necessary. Results: Eleven cost-effectiveness studies in Chinese were included, focusing on lung cancer, liver cancer, ovariancancer, and cervical cancer. Aidi injection was combinedwith chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoemboliza- tion or radiotherapy in these studies. Three of them were synthesis-based estimates and others were single-basedstudies. All of them identified the study as economic eval- uation, and most of them reported the base case popula- tion, interventions being compared and the outcomes usedas the measure of benefit in the evaluation. Around half of the studies provided a structured abstract, a broader con- text, cost being evaluated, time horizon over costs andconsequences, and key findings of the studies. Only a few of the studies reported methods part with settings, dis- count rate, measurement of effectiveness, resources andcosts estimation, choice of model, assumption, and analyt- ical methods. For results and others, the study parameters, characterising uncertainty and heterogeneity, funding, andconflict of interest were seldom reported. Conclusion: The reporting quality was not satisfied and most of the studies were therapeutic effect evaluation com-bined with a simple cost-effectiveness analysis. Further studies with details on estimating resources and costs, model choice, assumptions, analytical methods, study180 Global Advances in Health and Medicineparameters, characterizing uncertainty, and heterogeneity are needed, contributing to the health-care decision- making of Chinese herbal medicine Aidi injection. P09.32 Exploration the Underlying Mechanism of Aidi Injection in Non-Small Cell LungCancer Based on Network University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Dongzhimen Hospital, Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China, China Contact: Tao Yang, 20180941129@bucm.edu.cn Abstract Purpose: T o explore the underlying mechanism of Aidi injection in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on network pharmacology. Methods: In our study, we used the network pharmaco- logical method to predict its underlying complicated mech- anism of treating NSCLC. Firstly, we obtained relative compounds of Aidi injection based on studies had been reported and collected potential targets of these com- pounds by Pubchem and Pharmmapper database. Then, we built the NSCLC target database by TTD and Genecards. Based on the matching results between Aidi injection potential targets and NSCLC targets, we built a protein-protein interaction network to analyze the interac- tions among these targets and screen the hub targets by topology. Furthermore, ClusterProfiler, a package of R, was utilized for the enrichment analysis on GO and KEGG. Results: A total of 10 active compounds and 40 predicted targets of Aidi injection were picked out. The results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of Aidi injection mostly participated in the complex treating effects associated with proliferation, migration and invasion, and angiogenesis. In addition, 15 hub nodes by topological analysis as potential targets of treatments, implying the underlying mechanisms of Aidi injection acting on NSCLC. Conclusion: Aidi injection could intervene the NSCLC through the molecular mechanisms predicted by network pharmacology, involving cell proliferation, migration and invasion, tumor angiogenesis, and so on.P09.34 Chinese Herbal Medicine for Treating AIDS-related Rashes: A Systematic of for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China 2Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China Contact: Ruoxiang Zheng, zhengruox@foxmail.com Abstract Purpose: T o evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of Chinese Herbal Medicine and its combination treatmentwith standard western medicine treatment for AIDS-related rashes. Methods: Four Chinese and 4 English Databases in Chinese and English were searched for randomized con-trolled trials (RCTs) about Chinese Herbal Medicine treat- ing AIDS-related rashes. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Ameta-analysis of articles that meet the inclusion criteria wasperformed using RevMan 5.3. Results: Seventeen articles were included, covering 18 RCTs and involving 1528 patients. Result of Meta-analysis revealing: under type of Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM)combined with standard Western medicine treatmentversus standard Western medicine treatment, in respectof effective rate in CHM treating Quality Index(DLQI), RR \u00bc/C03.30, 95% CI \u00bc[/C03.78,/C02.18]; in respect of incidence of adverse events, RR \u00bc0.5, 95% CI \u00bc[0.05, 5.41]. Under type of CHM versus standard Western med- icine treatment, in respect of the effective rate, RR \u00bc1.19, 95% CI \u00bc[0.96, 1.47]; in respect of DLQI, RR \u00bc/C05.9, 95% CI\u00bc[/C08.97,/C02.83]; in respect of incidence of adverse events, RR \u00bc0.18, 95%CI \u00bc[0.04, 0.74]. Under type of CHM versus blank respect of the effectiverate, RR treating AIDS-related rashes and is superior to standard western medicine treat-ment (SWMT) when combined with SWMT, but we areuncertain of the rate when it comes to CHM versusSWMT. (2) CHM or CHM with SWMT has more advan-tages on the improvement of dermatology Life quality of patients, whereas if only using CHM can improve that qual- ity is uncertain. (3) On the result of reducing the incidenceof adverse events, CHM is superior to SWMT; however,CHM combined with SWMT comparing with SWMT isAbstracts 181uncertain. Due to the inferior quality of literature we included, the result obtained is low on reliability. P09.36 Integrating Mindfulness at Boston Medical Center: A System-Level Approach to Reduce Stress and Enhance Vitality for Clinicians, Senior Leadership, and Employees Gabrielle Farquhar1and Scarlet Soriano1 1Boston Farquhar, gabrielle.farquhar@bmc.org Abstract Purpose: Boston Medical Center private, not-for- profit, 487-bed academic safety-net hospital. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an evidence-based 8-weekmindfulness course, has been shown to reduce stress andenhance vitality. The aim of this pilot program was to testthe feasibility and effectiveness of an MBSR-variant course (adapted from Dr Mick Krasner and Dr Ronald Epstein's Mindful Practice Program) on professional fulfillment,employee engagement, and burnout within a safety-net hos-pital setting. Methods: We employed specific implementation strategies to maximize the course's potential cross-functional impact.The program consisted of a series of 8-week 1.5 hour man-ualized sessions that combined practice of mindfulness tech-niques with facilitated group discussions on the applicability of mindfulness in health care, modifying to fit the participant demographics. Participants were asked to complete shortquestionnaires measuring professional fulfillment (PFI),burnout (MBI-10), and employee engagement pre, post-,and post-2 months following the intervention. Results: T wenty-six clinicians from 15 different depart- ments and divisions enrolled in the pilot course. Burnoutamong the clinician participants decreased from 56% to 25%and maintained at 25% following the course. Professional fulfillment increased from 19% to 56% and maintained at 56% following the course. T wenty-one administratorsfrom 18 different departments enrolled in the secondcourse. Employee among BMC leadershipincreased from 47% to ( Pvalue: .23). Repeated measures analysis for the clinician cohort and follow-updata for BMC leadership and employees is being collectedand will be ready for presentation in April 2020. Conclusion: Key stakeholder engagement, program adap- tation, and program champions were effectiveimplementation strategies. An MBSR-variant program of 1.5 h/sessions without a retreat appears to be feasible andeffective for decreasing burnout and increasing professionalfulfillment for both clinicians and administrators.Furthermore, an MBSR-variant program seems to enhance employee engagement for administrators. P09.37 Discontinuation of Antidepressants and Recurrence of Depressive Symptoms: A Qualitative and Quantitative Groningen, Groningen, the Rogier Hoenders, hjr.hoenders@lentis.nl Abstract Purpose: Many patients have difficulty during or after grad- ual discontinuation (tapering) of antidepressant medication.Changes in clinical status during or after tapering can berelated to withdrawal, relapse, or both. These changes canbe sudden and nonlinear and therefore difficult to predict. 1 Investigating such changes is needed to better guide patientsduring tapering and to prevent relapse. The precise timingand shape of changes can be investigated using datasets thatmeasure symptoms of depression and continue during theentire tapering period. Methods: Fifty-six participants who were in full remission tapered their antidepressant medication. Depressive symp-toms were measured weekly using the depression subscaleof the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) for 6 months (26 measurements per participant; 1456 in total), and also 5 times a day using an experience sampling protocol for aperiod of 4 months (533 measurements per participant;29 846 in total). Qualitative experiences of participantswere inquired during 3 to 4 weekly phone calls in theresearch period and during an evaluation interview at the end of the study. Results: A significant and clinically relevant increase in depressive symptoms compared to baseline was found in 59% (33) of participants ( P<.05). T en patients (18%) described the increase in depressive symptoms as sudden,which was confirmed by a significant rise in the SCL-90score within one week ( P<.005). Significant increases sometimes occurred in a timeframe of less than a day. Conclusion: Both gradual and (very) sudden increases in depressive symptoms occur frequently after tapering182 Global Advances in Health and Medicineantidepressants. Sudden increases also often seem to happen without a clear trigger. High-frequency measure- ments may help to better predict those at high risk for relapse during tapering, which has important clinicalimplications. P09.38 The Feasibility of Intermittent Fasting and/ or Glucose Administration Among OlderAdults to Improve Health Outcomes Alisa Johnson 1, John Marks2, Harold Rocha2,3, Adam Woods4, Roland Staud5, Andreas Keil3, and Kimberly Sibille6 1Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence, Department of Community Dentistry & Behavioral Science, University of Florida,Gainesville, Florida 2Department of Aging & Geriatric Research, Institute on Aging, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 3Department of Psychology, Center for the Study of Emotion & Attention, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 4Department of Clinical & Health Psychology, McKnight Brain Institute, Center for Cognitive Aging & Memory, University of Florida, Gainesville,Florida 5Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 6Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence, Department of Aging & Geriatric Research, Institute on Aging, University of Florida,Gainesville, Florida Contact: Alisa Johnson, alisa.johnson@ufl.edu Abstract Purpose: Chronic pain drives maladaptive plasticity in brain regions involved in affective and somatosensory proc-essing, posing significant treatment challenges. Pairing rec-ognized complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) interventions with strategies that increase neuroplasticity and optimize the brain's ability to learn may improve treat-ment outcomes. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of 2 promising noninvasive, nonpharmacological optimization strategies,intermittent fasting (IF) and/or glucose administration, com-bined with a recognized CIM intervention, relaxation/ guided imagery, among older adults with chronic pain. Methods: Thirty-two adults (M \u00bc63.9/C68.4; 56% male), with chronic pain (ie, pain on more days than not in thepast 3 months or more), were randomized to 3 sessions of: (1) intermittent fasting (16 h; n \u00bc11), (2) glucose adminis- tration following a 2-hour fast (n \u00bc11), or (3) normal intake control (n \u00bc10), plus relaxation guided imagery, over a 2-week period. Measures included anthropometric and lab- oratory assessments, clinical pain, cognitive functioning, psychological variables, and a semistructured exit interview.Results: T wenty-nine adults, aged 51 to 80 years, complet- ed the study. Three participants were withdrawn due tononstudy-related issues (n \u00bc1 glucose administration; n\u00bc2 control). Blood sugar levels across sessions indicated participant adherence to fasting schedules. Most partici- pants (72.7%) reported that fasting was not difficult and82% said that they would be willing to fast again forhealth improvement. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of intermittent fasting and/or glucose adminis-tration as potential CIM treatment optimization strategiesin older adults with chronic pain. A growing body of evi- dence supports the role of IF to bolster neuroplasticity which may enhance CIM interventions in chronic pain andother health outcomes (eg, cognitive and metabolic func-tioning). This study was a first step in exploring intermittentfasting and/or glucose administration as noninvasive, non- pharmacological strategies to bolster CIM treatment response. P09.39 Group Acupuncture Therapy With Yoga Therapy for Chronic Pain in UnderservedPopulation: Feasibility Pilot Study Arya Nielsen 1, Raymond Schoonover2, and Benjamin Kligler1,2,8 1Department of Family Medicine & Community Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Woodstock, New York 2Institute for Family Health, New York, New York 3Maryland University of Integrative Health, Laurel, Maryland 4School of Nursing and Health Studies, Monmouth University, West Long Branch, New Jersey 5Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City, New York 6Pacific College of Health and Science, New York, New York 7Family Medicine & Community Health, University of Massachusetts Medical School, New York, New York 8U.S. Veterans Health Administration Integrative Health Coordinating Center Contact: Arya Nielsen, arya@guasha.com Abstract Purpose: Acupuncture and yoga have both been shown to be effective in chronic pain. Our goal is to assess the feasi- bility of combining group acupuncture with modified yoga for chronic neck, back, or osteoarthritis pain in safety netsetting.Abstracts 183Methods: Recruit 150 outpatients from referred primary care patients with chronic pain (lasting 3 or more months)from 3 primary care centers, affiliated with Montefiore Medical Group and Institute for Family Health in the Bronx and Harlem, respectively. Participants will receive10 acupuncture sessions in a group setting. After the third acupuncture session, a Y oga therapy session will immediate- ly follow at the same site in an adjacent room, for 8 sessions.Acupuncture will last 30 to 40 minutes and include palpa- tion, acupuncture needling, T ui Na, Gua Sha, and auricular treatment, utilized in AADDOPT -2 trial. Y oga will last 25 to35 minutes and include specific focus on breathing, relaxa- tion, stretching, and strengthening with a developing sense of positive self-efficacy. Y oga positions (asanas) will draw onthose used in trials for upper body/neck pain, low back pain, and for knee osteoarthritis pain. Measures include Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form, pain-free days, Center forEpidemiologic Studies-Depression scale, Altarum Consumer Engagement Scale, and PROMIS-10; secondary measures include Patient Global Impression of Change(PGIC) and medication utilization. All patients will receive usual care. Clinically meaningful change is defined as 30% improvement in BPI.Results: Sixty-one of 150 have completed informed con- sent and initiated care (40%). (Analysis of our preliminary data including demographic will be included in Congresspresentation.) Challenges include telephone outreach during recruitment with lower socioeconomic participants and site coordination integrating acupuncture with yogatherapy. Conclusion: Integrating group acupuncture with modified yoga is feasible for underserved chronic pain patients. Ourpilot and lessons learned integrating care will help to inform the design and methodology of a larger pragmatic trial. P09.41 Beyond Miracles: A Qualitative Study of the Healing Effects of Pilgrimage to Lourdes Emmylou Rahtz1, Sara Contact: Rahtz, e.rahtz@exeter.ac.uk Abstract Purpose: Pilgrims have been visiting Lourdes, France, since 1858 when a vision of the Virgin Mary appeared. T oday, Lourdes hosts 6 million visitors annually, many of themseeking healing. We sought to understand the experiencesof these pilgrims: what they feel, what changes occur within them, and how they explain these experiences. Methods: In June 2017, we spent 10 days carrying out fieldwork in Lourdes: interviewing \"malades\"\u2014sick pil-grims\u2014and the many volunteers and health-care professio-nals who support them. We spoke to over 60 people,amassing 33 interviews, 10 focus groups, 19 participantdrawings, and extensive ethnographic notes. Using thematic analysis, we collaboratively identified key concepts and themes in this rich data set, following the \"Consolidatedcriteria for reporting qualitative research\" (COREQ). Results: A key theme was connection and sense of com- munity, both between volunteers and the malades theycared for, as well as bonding between the volunteers.Some had noetic experiences, connecting to somethingbeyond the self. A schoolgirl said \"I came and I prayed toMary and then she touched me a lot and I felt like I was actually talking to her. And then I was compelled to come again.\" Altruism was important: everybody gives to every-body else and seeks self-improvement, both at Lourdes andwhen they return home. One woman described \"a time toreflect on how I could be different and improve myself.\"People experienced changes in how they saw and acceptedillness and in their self-perception. Lourdes offers the chance to reset oneself. Conclusion: While many hope to be cured at Lourdes, instead they are often healed through other enriching ele- ments of the experience. People do not visit purely in the hope of a miracle: their motivations are more complex anddiverse, and healing can be experienced through connec-tion, giving, and self-renewal. P09.42 Integrating Massage Therapy and Physical Therapy in an Outpatient Pediatric Oncology Setting Tiffany Silliman Cohen1, Stacey Caviston1, Tracey Jubelirer1, Contact: Tiffany Silliman Cohen, sillimanct@email.chop.edu Abstract Purpose: Nonpharmacological-based pain therapies including massage therapy (MT) and physical therapy (PT) are an important component of integrative care models for pediatric cancer patients. Objectives: T o integrate MT and PT with standard treatment in order to improve function,reduce pain, and alleviate stress in pediatric cancer patients. Methods: In September 2018, a pilot initiative offering MT half a day a week in the outpatient pediatric oncology clinic184 Global Advances in Health and Medicinewas implemented. Through multidisciplinary collaborations particularly with nursing and PT, the certified pediatric MT determined patients who would benefit from both therapies to optimize pain control, muscle strength, balance, and physical functioning. Massage interventions included mas- sage, caregiver education, and instruction on self-massage. Follow-up encounters included assessment of symptoms, reinforcement of techniques and need for additional support. Results: Fifty-one patients aged 24 months to 24 years; 209 total encounters, 3 to 10 patients per day. Indications : body pain, muscle tightness, nausea, stress, relaxation, supportive care. Patient/family feedback :\"...helped her calm her anxiety about treatment and helped her back pain go away. I (mom) was happy to learn this technique so I can use it at home;\" \"It feels great, almost puts me to sleep. I look forward to them.\" Clinical staff feedback : \"I think having massage therapy in clinic has been extremely beneficial for our patients and their families. Many of our patients are in clinic for multiple hours ...it has been extremely easy to incorporate mas- sage therapy into this structure.\" 31/31 evaluations collect- ed indicating massage therapy was a very supportive inter- vention. No adverse events. Conclusion: This pilot has shown that it is feasible and beneficial to add pediatric MT into an outpatient oncology clinic. Integrating a complementary therapy such as MTwith PT can help to improve pain, stress, and tight muscles. In addition, it is well received by patients, families, and medical team. P09.43 Implementation of PCORI-Funded Research Through Dissemination toClinical Acupuncturists Jennifer Stone 1and Remy Coeytaux2 1Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 2Wake Forest University, Winston Salem, North Carolina Contact: Jennifer Stone, jemeador@iu.edu Abstract Purpose: This protocol was developed as a result of the Society of Acupuncture Research's PCORI EngagementAward SAR 2019: Health Care Policy and Community Health: Closing the Loop. The overall objective of this study is to provide licensed acupuncturists in the United States with the results of Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded research which will enhance clinical decision making. Licensed acupuncturists (LAcs) in the United States traditionally have little or no access to scientific literature. Dissemination of the PCORIwebsite to the LAcs in the United States will provide them with basic knowledge about federally funded acupuncture research that they have not yet been exposed to. In addition to the results of PCORI-funded studies, the PCORI webpages are unique in that they include valuable additionalinformation on the project and peer review. Giving theLAcs a clear path to the PCORI website will teach themthat the federal government does indeed fund acupuncture studies and will make it easier for them to revisit the site in the future to search for additional studies. Methods: We will disseminate results of PCORI-funded acupuncture studies and related scientific content to24 000 licensed acupuncturists in the United States. LAc's receiving the PCORI content will be surveyed before and after on the value of the research being disseminated andthe value of acupuncture research overall. Results: Results of the original PCORI Engagement Award are in process, and manuscript will be completed by December 2019. PCORI implementation survey will be completed by January 1, 2020. Survey will be sent at thecompletion. Data on clicks and downloads from the PCORIstudy webpages will be collected and analyzed. Conclusion: Supplying the LAc's with scientific evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture in the clinic will enhance their clinical decision making by providing themwith tools that will result in better health outcomes forpatients of acupuncture. P09.45 Euphrasia Eye Drops as a Treatment Option in Preterm Infants With First Signsof Congestion of the Integrative Medicine, Bern, Switzerland 2Department of Neonatology, University Hospital of Bern, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland 3Department of Pharmacy, Hospital of Freiburg, Freiburg, Switzerland 4Division of Gynaecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine, Women's University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland 5Neonatology Division, University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland 6Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland Contact: Ursula Wolf, ursula.wolf@ikim.unibe.chAbstracts 185Abstract Purpose: T o investigate the efficacy of Euphrasia eye dropsVRin preterm infants with congestion of the nasolacri- mal duct (CND), as compared to placebo. Methods: We conducted a randomized double-blind con- trolled trial at the Children University Hospital of Bern,Switzerland. Preterm neonates with first signs of CND, defined as white, yellow, or green ocular discharge with or without tearing and reddened eye were included.Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the Euphrasia armor the placebo arm. Euphrasia or placebo was administratedat a dose of one drop in each eye 4 times a day over a period of 96 hours. If no ocular discharge was apparent for over 24 hours, the therapy was stopped. Success of treat-ment was defined as no ocular discharge at 96 hours and nouse of topical antibiotic therapy. Results: Between May 2011 and December 2016, 84 neo- nates were randomized. One neonate was excludedbecause it was born at full-term and 3 neonates wereexcluded because they had no ocular discharge at inclusion. Among the 80 remaining neonates (38 in the Euphrasia arm and 42 in the placebo arm), 48 (60.0%) were boys, the meanpostnatal age was 21 /C616 days. Our results indicate no sig- nificant difference regarding the success of treatment at96 hours between treatment arms (19 [52.8%] in the Euphrasia arm vs 21 [51.2%] in the placebo arm, P\u00bc.89). Resolution of reddening was observed in 23 of 24 (95.8%)eyes in the Euphrasia arm and in 15 of 15 (100.0%) eyes inthe placebo arm ( P\u00bc.99). Relapse tended to be lower in the Euphrasia arm (2 of 23 [8.7%] eyes vs 3 of 15 [21.4%] eyes in the placebo arm, P\u00bc.35). Conclusion: This study does not provide evidence for effi- cacy of Euphrasia on the CND. However, results suggest that Euphrasia may prevent relapse of reddening and thus improve the comfort of patients. P09.46LB Current Explorations of Nutrition and the Gut Microbiome: A ComprehensiveEvaluation of the Review Literature Leigh Frame 1, Elise Costa1, and Scott Jackson2 1George Washington School of Medicine & Health Sciences, Washington, District of Columbia 2National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland Contact: Leigh Frame, leighframe@gwu.edu Abstract Purpose: Context The ability to measure the gut micro- biome led to a surge in understanding and knowledge of itsrole in health and disease. The diet is a source of, fuel for, and influencer of composition of the microbiome.Objective: T o assess the understanding of the interactions between nutrition and the gut microbiome in healthy adults. Methods: Data Sources PubMed and Google Scholar searches were conducted in March and August 2018 limited to English, 2010 to 2018, healthy adults, reviews. Data Extraction: A total of 86 articles were independentlyscreened for duplicates and relevance, based on preidenti-fied inclusion criteria. Results: Research has focused on dietary fiber\u2014micro- biota fuel. The benefits of fiber center on short-chain fattyacids, which are required by colonocytes, improve absorp- tion, and reduce intestinal transit time. Contrastingly, pro- tein promotes microbial protein metabolism and potentiallyharmful by-products that can stagnate in the gut. The micro-biota utilize and produce micronutrients; the bidirectional relationship between micronutrition and the gut micro- biome is emerging. Conclusion: Nutrition has profound composition, in-turn, affecting wide-ranging metabolic, hor- monal, and neurological processes. There no consensuson what defines a \"healthy\" gut microbiome. Futureresearch must consider individual responses to diet. P09.47LB Whole Health Implementation Evaluation: Through the Eyes of Clinical T eam Members and Administrative Informants Jolie Haun1, Julie McMahon-Grenz1, Bridget Cotner1, Christine Melillo1, Jolie Haun, jolie.haun@va.gov Abstract Purpose: The Whole Health Initiative is a redesign of health care that focuses on meeting Veteran-identifiedhealth plan goals rather than focusing on treating disease. The purpose of this article is to identify potential implemen- tation barriers and facilitators for this patient-drivenapproach. Methods: Purposeful and snowball sampling methods were used to identify 45 participants from 5 design sites and oneflagship site. Semistructured interviews were conducted,and demographics collected from each participant. Data analysis was performed using a rapid assessment matrix approach. Results: Majority of respondents reported the following to be the primary facilitators for Whole Health implementa-tion: (1) providing education for staff and (2) establishing186 Global Advances in Health and Medicinecollaborative relationships among staff at all levels. Barriers to implementation included (1) administrative barriers such as developing position titles, (2) clinical barriers such as time limitations with Veterans, and (3) a lack of policies and procedures such as having Whole Health templatesfor the health-care record. Respondents reported the fol- lowing to be both facilitators and barriers: (1) leadership support such as communicating and providing resources and (2) having a progressive culture because Whole Health Implementation requires buy in from staff and Veterans. Suggestions to improve Whole Health implemen- tation included (1) incorporating a faster hiring process and(2) establishing Whole Health as a service under the hos- pital director. Conclusion: A cultural transformation is needed to imple- ment Whole Health into service delivery in a large integrat- ed health care system. Although whole health is a valued approach to care by clinical care team members and admin- istrative leadership, support for such a large-scale transfor-mation will require additional resources, training, and refined administrative processes for successful implementation. P09.48LB Patient-Specific \"Immune Repair\" Improves Glycemic Control Antigen burden has been variably implicated in the loss of oral tolerance and induction/maintenance of dia- betes. We hypothesized that identification of patient- specific antigen-burden, reduction of identified immune- reactant exposure, an alkaline diet, and micronutrient replenishment to enhance repair would improve sis control. Methods: A 6-month \"best practices\" dia- betes management alone (control arm, 13 in each cohort) with a test group who, additionally carried out the above patient specific comprehensive \"immune repair\" protocol (test arm, 14 T ype 1 and 13 Type 2 diabetics). Immunoreactant load was studied by an ex vivo lymphocyte response assay (LRA by ELISA/ACT). Glycemic control was assessed in terms of changes in HbA1c, glucose and insulinlevels, and statistically analyzed in 27 patients with Type 1 and 26 patients with Type 2 diabetes. Results: Immune reactivities were seen in almost all sub- jects. The most common single immune reactant was cowdairy (69%of T ype 2 and 28% of Type 1 diabetics; P<.01; Figure 1). Average glycated hemoglobin levels fell in bothtype 1 (8.7% reduction in test vs 5.2% in control) and type 2(13.3% reduction in test vs 2.6% in control; P<.05) diabe- tes. The reduction in type 1 diabetics correlated withreductions in immune reactivities. T est subjects alsoreported fewer hypoglycemic episodes and reduced insulinrequirement. Mean insulin levels reduced by 18% in testsubjects as against 12% in controls with Type 2 diabetes\u2014supporting the role of oral tolerance in insulin resistance. Conclusion: Immune reactivities to acquired antigens in diabetes are significant and patient-specific. Protocolsaddressing individualized needs show promise in achievingimproved glycemic control\u2014goal of modern diabetes man-agement. We propose a practical, comprehensive, integrat-ed approach toward managing diabetes that could prove tobe more cost and outcome effective than current conven-tional diabetes care alone. P09.49LB Competitive Market Landscape Analysis\u2014 Dietary Supplement Mobile HealthApplication Catharine Faurot3 1Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 2Department of Family Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 3Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Program on Integrative Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina Contact: Catharine Nguyen, cathari@unc.edu Abstract Purpose: Dietary supplements (DS) tracking and reconcil- iation in the electronic medical record (EMR) is infrequentand often inaccurate. Electronic tracking and reconciliation of DS is important for understanding how DS are being used in the health-care environment. Importantly, accurateDS information can be used to warn patients and providersabout DS-drug interactions to decrease adverse events andincrease DS appropriate use. A mobile health application(mHealth app) could improve fidelity of DS informationproviding point-of-care information to providers. WeAbstracts 187conducted a market analysis of current DS mHealth apps to evaluate if current products were sufficient to track DSinformation. Methods: We searched Apple and Google Play App sites using the terms, \"supplement and tracking,\" \"dietary andtracking,\" \"medication and tracking,\" An matrix was conducted to narrowdown apps with DS barcode scanning ability and/or EMRinterface. Results: We reviewed hundreds of apps and identified 5 mHealth apps that met our inclusion criteria: Amlia,CareZone, DoseCast, MangoHealth, and Medisafe. Amlia,contained most elements we considered essential to anmHealth app, but is currently off-market for re- engineering. CareZone links to automated pharmacy eCommerce for medication adherence but lacks an EMRinterface. DoseCast tracks adherence by linking medica-tions to a pharmacy or provider but lacks an EMR interface.MangoHealth tracks medication adherence through manualentry, not barcode scanning. Medisafe tracks medicationadherence through health data sharing with HumanApplication Program Interface between patients, providers,and pharmacies but lacks barcode scanning. Conclusion: The market has an unmet need for DS track- ing and reconciliation apps that possess all of these capabil-ities: (1) barcode scanning; (2) comprehensive DS databaselinkage; (3) DS list generation; and (4) EMR interface, to best meet the needs of patients and providers. Currently, no DS app meets all of proposed requirements. P09.50LB The Effects of Live Music Interventions on Self-Reported Pain and Anxiety Symptoms in Medical and Surgical Inpatients Jessica Pouranfar1and Dhruvil Pandya1 Pouranfar, jessica.pouranfar@gmail.com Abstract Purpose: Previous data show that benefits of music ther- apy reducing distress in individuals with various diagnoses including oncology, palliative, hospice, postsurgical, post- stroke, pediatric, psychiatric, and more. We explore theeffects of live music therapy on self-reported symptoms ofpain and anxiety in patients receiving inpatient care with alladmitting diagnoses in surgical and medical units. Methods: Music therapy consults were provided for patients admitted to the hospital after needs were assessedby each patient's primary team (medical doctor, advancedpractice nurse, registered nurse, CM, SW). For patientsexperiencing pain and/or anxiety, a live music intervention was implemented by a music therapist from 2016 to 2020.Each session lasted 20 to 60 minutes, depending on thepatients' symptoms. Patients verbally rated pain and/or anx-iety on a 10-point scale (0-10) pre- and postintervention.Data were collected on consecutive patients. Results: A total of 308 consecutive patients underwent music therapy while inpatient from 2016 to 2020, includingvarious diagnoses from which 190 (62%) were females. Inaddition, 254 /308 (82%) of total patients rated their pain, preintervention, at an average score of 6.8 /10 and postin- tervention at an average score of 4 /10 (41% change from baseline). Moreover, 79/308 (26%) of total patients rated their anxiety preintervention at an average score of 7.0/10and postintervention at an average score of 3/10 (57%change (23%) of the patients 9/79 (11%) with anxiety fell asleep during inter-vention. These patients had average preintervention scoresof 6.7 (pain) and 7.3 (anxiety). Conclusion: Our data show that live music interventions by a music therapist, when initiated by the patient's primaryteam, for inpatients with various admitting diagnoses inmedical and surgical units, showed improvement in pain(41% decrease) and anxiety (57% decrease) compared totheir baseline. Randomized studies are necessary to furtherassess the impact of live music interventions on overallmanagement of pain and anxiety in inpatient medical and surgical settings. P09.51LB Effects of an Individualized Worksite Wellness Program at a Small Integrative Health University: A Pilot Program Katherine Smith1, Claudia Joy Chelsey Health, Laurel, Maryland Contact: Katherine Smith, ksmith2@muih.edu Abstract Purpose: This mixed methods quasi-experimental pre- post pilot intervention explored the feasibility and out- comes of an individually tailored 12-week integrative work-site wellness program that was built around health coachingand health education principles and included yoga, Qi Gong,acupuncture, meditation, and discounted sessions for mas-sage and naturopathic appointments. Methods: Fifteen Maryland University of Integrative Health employees participated in a 12-week worksite wellness pro-gram comprised of 3 hour-long health coaching/health edu-cation sessions and 1 free hour a week at work to spend on188 Global Advances in Health and Medicinetheir own wellness using integrative modalities available to staff. Pre- and postintervention and at 6-month follow-up,participants (n \u00bc15) filled out the validated WorldHealth Organization\u2014Five Index (WHO-5),and 17-item mixed methods YOU Wellness Survey. Eightparticipants also took part in a 60-minute focus group post-intervention that was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Results: From pre- to postintervention, scores on both the PSS and WHO-5 improved at a level demonstrating statis-tical significance. On the YOU Wellness Survey, statisticallysignificant improvements were found in satisfaction withhealth and wellness, employment satisfaction, self-reported job productivity, and job morale from pre-to post-intervention. No significant differences were found betweenpre- and postfindings in regards to absenteeism. There wasa slight decrease in number of days of missed work (4 ormore days) due to not feeling well (26.7% pre to 13.3%post). This sample size was too small to determine trendsof significance in presenteeism. Participants reported that1:1 health coaching/education sessions, accountability, per-sonal connection, and dedication of time to health were themost helpful components of the intervention. Conclusion: Launching and implementing an individualized integrative worksite wellness program based on healthcoaching and health education techniques appears feasiblein a small university for health care professionals. It mayhave a positive effect on stress, well-being, and job-relatedoutcomes. P09.52LB The Outpatient Acupuncture Program in the Wellness and Integrative Health Center at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Annie Budhathoki1, Melissa Zappa1, Shelley White1, Lawrence Marsco1, Anna Beck1, and Pamela Hansen1 1University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah Contact: Annie Budhathoki, annie.budhathoki@hci.utah.edu Abstract Purpose: The Linda B. and Robert B. Wiggins Wellness and Integrative Health Center (WIHC) at HuntsmanCancer Institute (HCI) provides services to cancer patients,cancer survivors, caregivers, and staff members. The WIHCoffers compassionate support, diverse treatments, and well-ness guidance to enhance ones' quality of life throughevidence-informed practices. Located in Salt Lake City,Utah, HCI's Wellness and Integrative Health Center hasprovided outpatient services to people affected by cancersince 2005 with the success of delivering over 25 000 visitsannually in 2019. The outpatient acupuncture program col- laborates with other health-care teams to reduce cancersymptoms and treatment related side effects, including non-pharmacological pain management, to reduce the use ofopioids. Methods: The Acupuncture program was initiated in 2005 by Dr Pamela Hansen with a desire to provide nonpharma-cological treatment options for people affected by cancer. In2012, a full-time licensed acupuncturist, Annie Budhathoki,DAOM, LAc, was hired and continued to build the acupunc-ture. She trained and hired 5 acupuncturists to cover asneeded until 2019. Due to an increase in growth, she wasable to justify hiring another full-time licensed acupunctur-ist, Melissa Zappa, MSTOM, LAc. In the last 12 months, theoutpatient acupuncture program provided over 3300 acu-puncture treatments in the WIHC. Results: These data will include the number of patient visits per week and year and the rate of growth of the programover the last 5 years. This poster will elucidate the outpa-tient acupuncture program development, implementationstrategies, and collaborative insights\u2014additional data pre-sented on patient demographics and program utilization. Conclusion: This poster outlines the outpatient acupunc- ture program growth. It will inform and present informationabout the robust nature of the acupuncture program withinthe Wellness and Integrative Health Center. P09.53LB Preliminary Results of a Scoping Review of Integrative Medicine Interventions inUnderresourced Populations in the United States Jennifer Rioux 1, Niki Munk2, Kieran Cooley3, Rachel Hinrichs4, Lisa 1AYTI, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 2University of Indiana\u2014IUPUI, Indianapolis, Indiana 3The Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 4Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 5College of Nursing University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 6Massage of Northern Ohio Practice-Based Research Network, Cleveland, Ohio Contact: Jennifer Rioux, jgrioux@yahoo.com Abstract Purpose: This scoping review's primary objective is to summarise and critically appraise the available evidence onIntegrative Medicine (IM) practices in underresourced USpopulations and summarize data on outcomes.Abstracts 189Methods: This first-ever scoping review of IM clinical trials in underserved populations in the United States, includedsearch terms: homeless, uninsured, native American, refu-gee, low income, poor, poverty, or underserved. Inclusionintervention criteria were Acupuncture, Oriental Medicine,Chinese medicine, Asian medicine, herbal medicine,chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathic medicine, natu-ropathy, complementary medicine, alternative medicine,integrative medicine, integrative health, yoga, yoga therapy,ayurvedic medicine, ayurveda, homeopathy, certified profes- sional Midwives, and direct-entry midwives. IM paradigms and components; study designs and methodology; controls;population; intervention and setting descriptors; modes ofdelivery; training of intervention providers; health out-comes; study funding; and innovative study features weresystematically extracted. Results: In this study, 47 articles through 2019; 40 unique research projects; 6 research projects with 2 to 3 paperswere identified. Findings demonstrate that research in low-income/underserved populations should explore all social precursors of disease and a cascade effect, in which co- occurring vulnerabilities create fertile soil for both chronicand acute conditions. Data show relationships betweensocial precursors and poor diet, lifestyle and habits thatexacerbate poor mental health and substance use, contrib-uting to lower overall quality of life. Structural inequalities,discrimination and lack of social support play major roles inthe health status of the populations studied. Conclusion: Data show that IM interventions are being implemented in 2 primary populations: magnifying preven- tion and risk reduction strengths of the paradigm for youth;and effective treatment for lifestyle-related chronic condi-tions in adults >/\u00fe45 years. The data draw attention to advantages and benefits of multimodal interventions forconditions that are multivariate in nature. Innovative fea-tures of IM study designs include a focus on empower-ment/agency; attentional control; self-regulation/compassion; resilience and improved self-efficacy; as movement therapy and self-care skills. P09.54LB A Single-Arm Pilot Clinical Trial of a 4- Month Whole Systems AyurvedicNutrition and Lifestyle Intervention forBreast Cancer Survivors Cairn Wu 1, Wendy Hartogensis1, Frederick Hecht1, and Anand Dhruva1 1UCSF Osher Center Francisco, California Contact: Cairn Wu, cairn.wu@ucsf.eduAbstract Purpose: Improving patient reported outcomes, including quality of life (QOL), for the estimated 16.9 million USbreast cancer (BC) survivors is an important goal.We tested the feasibility and acceptability of a manualized intervention based on Ayurvedic medicine for BC survivors. Methods: Eligible participants with Stage I-III BC, treated within the past year, received chemotherapy as part of their treatment, and were in remission when enrolled. The 4-month individualized Ayurvedic intervention includedcounseling on nutrition, lifestyle, yoga, and marma (acupres-sure) during 8 one-on-one visits with a practitioner.Feasibility and acceptability were the primary outcomes. Quality of (STAI), stress (PSS), and spiritual well-being(FACIT) were measured prior to the intervention and atthe end of month 4 as part of acceptability. Effect sizes (ES)were calculated along with paired t tests comparing baseline to end of month 4 timepoints. Results: Participants (n \u00bc32) had a mean age of 48 (SD\u00bc10), and 66% had stage II BC. Retention at 4 months was 84%. Among those who completed the intervention(n\u00bc27), adherence was high (99.5% visits attended). Large improvements were seen in QOL emotional (ES:0.84, P\u00bc.0002); were seen in Global No adverse events observed. Conclusion: This novel Ayurvedic whole systems, multi- modal intervention was feasible and acceptable for BC sur-vivors. Meaningful improvements were seen in QOL andclinical symptoms that warrant further investigation with alarger randomized controlled trial to assess causality. P09.55LB Development of a Pilot Inpatient Acupuncture Program at Huntsman Cancer Institute Annie Budhathoki1, Melissa Zappa1, Melissa Banner1, Lawrence Marsco1, Shelley White1, and Anna Beck1 1University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah Contact: Annie Budhathoki, annie.budhathoki@hci.utah.edu190 Global Advances in Health and MedicineAbstract Purpose: History and aims of the pilot inpatient acupunc- ture program at Huntsman Cancer Institute, including pro- gram development, implementation strategies, and collabo- rative insights. Methods/Background: In the Fall of 2018, after receiving an \"Imagine Perfect Care Grant\" from the University of Utah, The Linda B. and Robert B. Wiggins Wellness and Integrative Medicine Center at Huntsman Cancer Institutebegan the inpatient acupuncture program. Inpatient (IP) acu-puncture treatment occurs on a case-by-case basis on allinpatient floors of the Huntsman Cancer Hospital. The IP acupuncture program actively integrates with the Supportive Oncology, Pain Management, and Nursing teams. IP acu-puncture collaborates with other health-care teams toreduce cancer symptoms and treatment-related side effects including, nonpharmacological pain management. Results: Dr Annie Budhathoki, a full-time acupuncturist in the Wellness Center, advocated for and developed IPacupuncture treatment. Dr Budhathoki volunteered her time to create and implement the pilot program now offered 4 days per week. Patients, caregivers, nurses,social workers, advanced practice clinicians, and physicians initiate an order for IP acupuncture visits. An attending phy- sician or an advanced practice provider place orders in apatient's electronic medical record (EMR), and the acupunc- turist gets notified through and EMR system called EPIC. Conclusion: Future aims of the program include expansion of access and availability to acupuncture in the inpatient setting; funding for additional resources including more hours, additional staff; data collection and future researchon the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute postsurgical pain, nausea, insomnia, digestive issues, and anxiety in an inpatient setting. Information presented in this poster willinclude program development, implementation strategies, and collaborative insights\u2014additional data presented on patient demographics, pain scores, and Advances in Health and Medicine "}
