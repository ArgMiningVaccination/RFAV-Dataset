We're here to support you and your family throughout your treatment, and we created this manual as one of the first steps in that process. We hope you find it helpful. 8 9 Steps of autologous transplant The cell that is being transplanted is the stem cell , which is made in the bone marrow. Stem cells are immature cells that grow and mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets , or plasma cells. Stem cells are an essential part of a person's immu ne system. Names you will hear include: Bone marrow t ransplant (BMT) Marrow transplant Peripheral blood stem cell transplant Stem cell transplant Hemopoietic s tem cell t ransplant Type of t ransplant There are several types of transplant. You may hear othe rs discussing a process different from yours. Below is a chart reviewing each type. This chapter will then go into detail. Type of t ransplant Cell s ource Goals Allogeneic Related Another person Family member Deliver highest dose of chemotherapy & radiation to eliminate disease. New cells replace patient's immune system. Unrelated Another person Usually anonymous Mixed Chimerism (Mini) Related Another person Family member Deliver moderate dose of chemotherapy & radiation to set up a mixed immun e system. New immune system attacks cancer. Unrelated Another person Usually anonymous Autologous Patient If patient has cancer: Deliver highest dose of chemotherapy & radiation to eliminate disease. If patient has an autoimmune disease: Halt progr ession of disease and reset the immune system. The transplant process can be divided into steps. Each step has its own purpose and challenges. The steps are: Planning: This step begins when you first think about transplant as a treatment option. You sta rt to organize yourself and your family and friends to undertake this journey. Preparation: Once you arrive at the clinic, you will begin the process of medical evaluation, orientation, informed consent, and get ready to begin conditioning therapy. Family members or friends prepare to assume the caregiver role. Conditioning: High -dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are given. Transplant: Stem cells harvested from the bone marrow or collected from the circulating bloodstream are infused. Before engraf tment : You will receive close m onitoring, supportive treatment, and management of complications while waiting for signs that the transplanted stem cells are engra fting (growing and developing). 10 After engraftment: This is the time after the first signs of engraftment when your new white cells, red cells, and platelets are being produced and the immune system is starting to recover. You still need close monitoring a nd supportive treatment. Long -term recovery: You will leave the c linic and further care and t reatment will be provided by your hometown physician. The challenges in this stage include managing possible late complications and resuming life at home. Prepar ation When you first arrive, you and your family will go to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance outpatient clinic to begin the pre -transplant evaluation. You will learn the proposed treatment plan, meet with the healthcare team, and get answers to your questi ons about treatment. You and your family members can attend classes on how to manage symptoms at home and prevent infection. All of this is to prepare you for the next step: conditioning therapy. As a courtesy to the large number of patients with weakened immune systems in the clinic, please refrain from bringing family members or caregivers with even minor infection symptoms (cold or otherwise) into the clinic. Also, please do not bring any animals but service dogs to the clinic. First clinic appointments Your first visit to the clinic will consist of meeting your primary physician and your team nurse. Your nurse will take your vital signs, draw blood, take a short history, and give you an orientation of the clinic. Your primary physician will complete a health history and physical examination. You will be given a schedule of visits, and consent forms that give permission to conduct the pre -transplant evaluation. In the first few days, you will meet with a social worker who will answer questions you may have about your housing and social issues, describe resources you may access, and offer support for you and your family members. Arrival conference (meeting with physician and members of your care team) After the health history and physical exam are done, you will be scheduled for a confer ence with your attending physician . This usually takes place on the second day after you arrive at the clinic. You may invite members of your family to attend. We discourage small children from attending. The att ending physician will talk to you about the process of having a bone marrow transplant. He or she will d iscuss the plan of treatment including the risks and benefits. Evaluation and work -up The evaluation for transplant includes blood draws for tissue ty ping and clinical tests, a bone marrow aspiration and possible biopsy, chest X -rays, an electrocardiogra m (ECG), pulmonary function tests, and other tests the physician may order. You will meet with a dietitian and possibly have a dental checkup. When the results of these tests are available (5 to 7 days) you will be scheduled for placement of a central veno us line catheter. Informed consent conference You will be scheduled for a second conference to review your test results before you proceed with trea tment. The physician must share information with you so that you will be well informed and able to make th e decision to go ahead with transplantation. The conference provides you and your family the opportunity to ask questions. After the conference, you ( or your legal guardian) will be asked to sign consent forms giving permission to proceed with treatment. 11 You and your family will: Receive copies of all protocol consent forms for the protocols in which you are participating; Be offered copies of all proto cols for the protocols in which you are participating; and Be offered a copy of the dictated \"Data Revie w Conference\" summary. Central venous line placement You will be given specific instructions about what to eat or drink before the procedure. Your nur se will also guide what medications you can take before the procedure. You will return to the clinic the next day so that one of the nurses can teach you how to take care of your line. Mobilizati on and c ollection of stem c ells In order to collect stem cells, it is necessary to stimulate the bone marrow to produce larger than normal numbers of stem cells an d release them into the blood stream. The process is called \"mobilization.\" To stimulate the bone marrow, we use chemotherapy plus growth factor or growth factor alone. The process of mobilizing stem cells with chemotherapy has a du al purpose in that it ca n reduce the number of tumor cells in your body, as well as mobilize cells for collection. Chemother apy is most often given in the c linic follow ed by daily growth factor injections for 1 to 2 weeks until your counts have recovered, and the stem cells have been collected. These injections are usually given by clinic nurses but may be given by the patient or caregiver. Mobilization chemotherapy wil l cause a temporary drop in circulating blood cell counts. While your blood cell counts are low, you will be more susceptible to infection. You may need to receive red blood cell and/or platelet transfusions during this time to keep the number of these cel ls in your bloodstream at safe levels. Blood cell counts will be drawn daily. Other side effects of mobilizati on chemotherapy may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, hair loss, fatigue , and a sore mouth. The most common side effects of growth factor therapy are bone or muscle pain and headache. For some people, these symptoms may be mild, while others may experience more severe discomfort. Medications can be prescribed to alleviate these symptoms. Blood cell counts generally begin to recover within 10 to 14 days from the first day of chemotherapy. When your counts begin to recover, you will be s cheduled for your first apheresis procedure. In apheresis, a cell separator, similar to those used in blood banks, is used to obtain t he specific cells we want to collect. After blood from the patient enters the machine, it circulates through a centrifuge. Centrifugal force causes the different types of blood cells to separate into layers. The white cell layer is collected while the rema ining blood cells and plasma return to the patient. You may lie in bed or sit in a recliner chair during apheresis. Patie nts with central venous lines can read, sleep, play cards, do handiwork, watch television, and listen to music, books, podcasts, or an y other quiet activity. Patients who have intravenous lines inserted daily for collection can watch television, listen to music, books, podcasts , or do any quiet activities which do not require use of the arms. A companion is welcome to stay with you durin g the procedure. You may bring a snack with you to eat during apheresis. If needed, a commode or urinal may be used at the bedside. The procedure takes about 3 hours. 12 The apheresis procedure itself is painless; in fact, most people report no noticeable or unusual sensations during the procedure. Some may experience mild side effects such as chilling, a tingling sensation on t he face or body, and lightheadedness, which are easily corrected. Adverse reactions are extremely rare. Your stem cells are then an alyzed and frozen until needed. It may require several days of apheresis to collect enough stem cells for your transplant. During this collection phase, we will continue daily blood draws and growth factor injections. The entire process of mobilization an d collection takes approximately 2 to 2 \u00bd weeks. You will then have a 1 to 2-week period of rest prior to starting the nex t step of your treatment plan. Debulking c hemotherapy Sometimes an extra cycle of chemotherapy is given to further reduce the number of tumor cells after your stem cells have been collected and prior to the transplant. This is called debulking chemothera py. Its purpose is to decrease the number of tumor cells as much as possible before you go into the transplant phase. High -dose r egim en The transplant regimen consists of a combination of high -dose chemotherapy agents and sometimes radiotherapy. The purpo se of the chemo/radiation therapy is to eradicate all cancer cells, or to replace the existing immune system with a new one. The exact regimen is specific for different types of disease, the stage of the disease as well as individual factors. Your specifi c regimen or protocol will be discussed with you and your attending physician. In some cases, a \"tandem\" transplant, or 2 different regimens, are given a few months apart, each one followed by an infusion of stem cells. In most cases, these various trans plant regimens are given in the clinic and are well tolerated on an outpatient basis. Each patient is assessed on a day -by-day basis and will be admitted to the hospital if the need arises. Hospitalization may be required if you develop fevers, chills , or increasing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth/throat sores , or fatigue. Total body i rradiation (TBI) is an odorless, soun dless, invisible therapy that cannot be felt. You will feel fatigued and might feel nauseated after the treatment. Anti -emetic medic ation (relieves nausea) given before or after your treatment, will ease your symptoms. Some patients find that their fatigu e and nausea increase with the number of treatments. If you have had a significant amount of localized irradiation in the past, your treatment may require that we shield these areas from further exposure. If this is true, a different form of radiation the rapy may be given. Family and friends must wait outside of the radiation room if they wish to be near you. This is to decrease the risk of potential irradiation exposure. Your nurse will watch you on camera and you can talk back and forth through a speaker system. If you hav e any questions or if you need anything during therapy, just ask. 13 Effects of high -dose t herapy All chemoth erapy and radiation have effects on normal cells as well as on diseased cells and unpleasant effects can be expected. Each of the chemotherapy drug s have different effects, and those will be explained when your therapy program is planned. Side effects ofte n experienced include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, fatigue, hair loss , and skin changes. Some of the side effects o f chemotherapy occur r ight away and some occur 1 to 2 weeks later. Medications are used to manage and control most side effects. Ex pected delayed side effects include a drop in blood cell counts , which increases the risk of infections and bleeding. Nausea and vomiting are majo r concerns for patients. Several drug therapies are available to relieve nausea and keep you comfortable. Dia rrhea can occur after chemotherapy and is treated with fluid an d electrolyte replacement. H air loss is temporary , and your hair should start growin g back a few months after the transplant. Conditioning Conditioning consists of high -dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation. The purpose of conditioning therapy is to remove cancer cells or to remove the remaining immune system, so that new marrow can grow . Conditioning can be received in the clinic or in the hospital. Your nurse and physician will discuss your treatment plan with you. Chemotherapy All chemotherapies and radiation have some effects on normal cells as well as on diseased cells , and unpleasant effects can be expected. Each of the chemotherapy drugs has different effects. The spe cifics of the chemotherapy prescribed for you will be explained when your therapy program is planned. Common side effects include nausea, v omiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, fatigue, hair loss, and skin changes. Some of the side effects of chemotherapy happen r ight away and can be managed with other drugs. Nausea and vomiting are major concern s for patients. Several drug therapies are available t o relieve nausea and keep you comfortable. Diarrhea can result from chemotherapy and is treated with fluid and electr olyte replacement. Hair loss is temporary, and your hair should start growing back a few months after the transplant. Safe management of chemotherapy at home Because chemotherapy (chemo) is made up of dangerous elements that can harm you, it is important to take precautions, especially at home. Only you (the person receiving treatment) or your caregiver should touch chemo and the items used to deliver it, such as syringes and needles . Pregnant women, children, and pets should avoid touching chemo and cont aminated waste. In this section, we'll teach you how to handle your medication safely at home. Note: If you are taking biotherapy or immun otherapy, some of the information below may not apply to you. If this is the case, you care team will review the info rmation that you should know . 14 Storing your chemo Below are some tips for storing chemotherapy safely: Keep your chemo pills in their original container; do not transfer them to a pill box. Do not crush or open your chemo medication. Some medications need to be refrigerated or kept away from light; check your medicine labels for special instructions; follo w additional instructions from your care team. Store your chemo and equipment in a safe place and out of reach of children and p ets. Do not store ch emotherapy in your bathroom because humidity may damage the drugs. Disposal of your chemo Because chemotherapy is dangerous, it shouldn't be thrown away in your trash. If you are receiving intravenous (IV) chemo at home, IV equipment and gloves should be put in the hard, plastic containers that come with your supplies. The container should say \"Chemotherapy Waste\" or something similar. If the waste is too large to fit in the plastic container, put all sharps in the hard, plastic container. Put the other e quipment in a separate, leak -proof plastic bag (such as a garbage bag) and seal it tightly with rubber bands. The comp any suppl ying your chemo and equip ment will tell you who will remove the waste containers. If you take oral chemotherapy, ask your care team how to dispose of it or refer to How to Safely Dispose of Prescription Medications and Sharps . Managing chemo spills The company that supplies your IV chemo will include a spill kit with your medicine. If your chemo spills, follow the instructions on the kit and inform your care team. If, for some reason, you don't have a spill kit available, follow these steps: Put on 2 pairs of disposable gloves. Clamp the IV tubing. Turn off the pump if you 're using one. Place the following in a leak -proof plastic bag, such as a garbage bag: o All the tubing and containers o The pump o The carrying case, if you have one Soak up the spill with paper towels. Clean the area with soap and water. Rinse with clean water. Put all the supplies used to clean up the spill in a sep arate leak -proof plastic bag. Remove your gloves and wash your hands with soap and water. Call you care team for instructions on how to manage the spilled chemo, the equipment, and the dirty cleaning supplies. 15 Other instructions Body wastes Your uri ne and stool contain chemotherapy while you're receiving treatment, and for up to 2 days after you've finished treatment. Traces of chemoth erapy may also be p resent in vomit, vaginal fluid, and semen. You may use the toilet (septic tank or sewe r) as usual. For the first 48 hours (2 days) after you receive chemo, flush the toilet twice with the lid closed each time you use it. Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water each time you use the bathroom. Laundry Wash your clothing and bedding normally unles s they become soiled with chemotherapy. If that happens, put on disposable gloves and handle the laundry carefully to avoid getting chemo on your skin. Soiled items should be washed separately from other clothes. If you don't have a washing m achine, place the dirty items in a sealed, leak -proof plastic bag until they can be washed. Skin care Chemoth erapy can irritate your skin . If chemo spills on you , thoroughly wash the area with soap and water, and dry it. If irritation develops that lasts more than 1 hour or if you get a rash, call your care team. Wea r gloves when working with chemo, chemo -soiled equipm ent, or waste to prevent it from touching your skin . Eye care If chemoth erapy gets into your eyes, flush them with water for 10-15 minut es, and contact your care team immediately. Questions and answers Is it safe for family members to have contact with me during chemotherapy? Yes. If you wish to, spending time with others is encouraged. Living, eating, and doing activities with others is safe. H ugging and closed mouth ki ssing is safe, too. Is it safe for my family to use the same toilet as me? Yes. We understand your family may have concerns, but as long as any chemotherapy waste is cleaned from the toilet, it is safe to share a bathroom . What should I do if I don't have control of my bladder or bowel s? Use a disposable, plastic-backed pad, adult or pediatric diaper, or sheet to absorb urine or stool. When it gets soiled, put on gloves, remove the soiled piece , remove the gloves, and then wash your skin with soap and water. If you have an ostomy, you or your caregiver should wear g loves when emptying or changing the bags. Empty any urine or stool into the toilet, and close the lid and flush the toilet twice. Di scard disposable ostomy supplies in the chemotherapy waste container. What if I u se a bedpan, urinal, or commode? If you're using one of these, it's important for y our caregiver to wear gloves when they empty and clean the containers . Your caregiver should rinse the container with water after each use and wash it with soap and water at least once a day. What if I vo mit into a basin ? It's important for y our caregiver to wear gloves when emptying and cleaning your basin. Your caregiver should rinse the basin with water after each use and wash it with soap and water at least once a day. 16 Is it safe to be sexually active during my treatment? Please ask your care team this question, as this depends on the type of treatment you are on. Because traces of chemoth erapy may be present in your v aginal fluid or semen for up to 48 hours after treatment, you made need to take special precautions. Is it safe to throw I V chemotherapy in the trash? No. Chemoth erapy waste is dangerous and should be thrown away separately. If you are receiving IV chemoth erapy at home, you should have received a special waste container for the chemoth erapy and equipment (such as used syringes, needles, tubing, bags, cassettes, and vi als). This container should be hard plastic and labeled \"Chemotherapy Waste\" or something similar. Can I travel with my chemotherapy? Traveling with chemo is usually fine but ch eck with your care team or home in fusion suppli er to confirm it is OK. Ask your care team for a letter that says you need to travel with your medications and that it's safe for you to do so. The letter should list the names of your medi cations. Some chemoth erapy requires special storage, so you may need to make plans, such as traveling with a cooler . Rega rdless of how you travel (by plane, car, or another mode of transportation ), always seal your chemoth erapy drugs in leak-proof pl astic bags.

TBI is radiation given to the entire body. TBI is given according to your treatment plan. It can vary from 1 to 3 times a day, 20 to 40 minutes at a time, for a length of 1 to 4 days. The treatment length is dependent on your body size and prescribed radiation dosage. However, once determined, the amount of time you spen d in treatment will be the same. What are TBI treatments like? There is no pain or discomfort during your treat ment due to radiation. You will not have any unusual sensations while the radiation machine is on. You do not become \"radioactive.\" A family mem ber, spouse, significant other, or friend may accompany you to the radiation therapy department. However, it is necessary for you to be in a room by yourself during treatment. You may feel alone during your treatment. Monitors are outside so that your nur se and radiation technician see and hear you at all times. You will be given detailed instructions when your nur se teaches you about your radiation course. 17 Side effects Nausea : Most often occurs 1\u00bd to 2 hours after a dose of TBI. You will be started on medication to keep nausea from being too much of a problem. The day before TBI begins; your team nurse will revi ew the medications you should take before each TBI treatment. Dehydration : TBI can cause dehydration similar to being exposed to the sun for to o long. Other side effects such as diarrhea and nausea add to this problem. Some of your hydration may be given through an IV during each day of TBI to help prevent dehydration. Your caregiver will learn to manage the pump at home, but some of your hydrati on can be given in the Clinic. Skin sensitivity : TBI acts as a heat source even though you will not feel this r ight away. You will notice your skin may appear flushed, or darker following radiation therapy. Following treatment, your skin will be more sens itive, especially to sunlight. Precautions are taken to avoid skin burns during treatment. Wear loose fitting clothing to avoid skin burns. Remove all jewelry during treatments. The clamp used to hold your central catheter will be taken off to avoid metal touching your skin. If you wear eyeglasses, the radiation technician will have you remove them during treatment. Do not wear contacts. The nurse or physician will assess your skin frequently. Avoid using lotion and deodorant before TBI. Alopecia : Temporar y hair loss will occur gradually over two weeks following treatment. Parotitis : The parotid glands are located near and in front of your ears. Parotitis is swelling of the parotid gland. Parotitis is not a common side effect but has been seen in TBI patie nts. Symptoms will occur from 4 to 24 hours after TBI. Ice packs and Tylenol help to relieve the discomf ort from the swelling. Parotitis will resolve in 24 to 72 hours following treatment. Diarrhea : Usually develops within the first week following TBI and can be treated with medications. Mucositis : Glands that secrete mucous and the fast-growing cells that line the mouth and throat are altered by TBI and/or chemotherapy and cause dryness, swelling, and a painful mouth and throat. Mucositis is treated with salt-water rinses and pain medication. If pain continues, narcotics will be used. Stem cell mobilization Stem cells are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream. The stem cells that circulate in the bloodstream are called peripheral blo od stem cells, or PBSC's. Normally, small numbers of stem cells circulate in the bloodstream. In add ition to obtaining stem cells by harvesting them from the bone marrow, it is possible to obtain them by collecting them from the bloodstream. However, befor e that can be done it is necessary to stimulate the movement of stem cells into the bloodstream. Thi s is called mobilization. Mobilization of stem cells is achieved by giving the donor special proteins called growth factors. It take s a few days for the body to respond to the mobilization therapy. When blood tests show that the cell count is high enough, collection can begin. Once in a while, a stem cell donor must undergo more than one cycle of mobilization to collect enough stem cel ls for transplantation. 18 Collecting stem c ells Stem cells are collected in the Apheresis Unit . Before beginning collection, the donor must have a catheter (tube) placed into a large vein. The placement of the catheter may take place several days before or right before the collection procedure. The collection of PBSC's takes about three hours. During t he procedure, the donor relaxes in a chair or bed and can watch television or read. The donor's blood is withdrawn through the catheter and circulated through a machine that separates out the stem cells and collects them. The remaining blood cells are ret urned to the donor via the catheter. The procedure is painless. When the procedure is over, the donor can resume normal activities. Transplant Day of transpl ant - day 0 Transplant location The transplant takes place a day or two after the chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment. The goal is to infuse stem cells from which all types of blood cells grow. Stem cells are cells from which all types of blood cells grow. These cells can be collecte d from bone marrow, circulating blood, or umbilical cord blood after a baby's birth. Stem cells are infused through your central venous line in the same way that any blood transfusion is given. The stem cells \"rescue\" your bone marrow from the toxic effect s of the chemotherapy/ radiation regimen . Depending on your treatment plan, your infusion may take place at SCCA's outpatient clinic or at the hospital (also called inpatient care) . If you are at the hospital, you care will either be provided at SCCA Hospi tal or a unit of University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). Both are located at UWMC and provide the same high -level quality of care. Autologous (patient's own) In autologous transplants, the cells are collected from you, cryopreserved (frozen) and stored in a freezer. DMSO is added to the bags of cells before they are frozen to help preserve them. On the transplant day, you are prepared to receive the infusion of cells. Extra fluids are given through the central lin e. Medications are given to preve nt allergic reactions. There is a unique smell and taste associated with the DMSO used to preserve the stem cells. Citrus odors and taste, such as orange slices, help manage the DMSO taste and odor. Some patients are sens itive to DMSO and symptoms of a s low heart rate, low blood pressure, cramps, nausea, diarrhea, or difficulty breathing may occur. Medications are given both to prevent and treat these symptoms. Right before you receive the infusion, your cells are thawed. The nurse attaches IV tubing to the bag of cells and connects the tubing to the central venous line. From time to time during the infusion, the nurse will check your vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature). You may be connected t o a cardiac monitor, so the nurse can observe your heart rate and rhythm. The length of the infusion depends on the volume, or amount of cells to be given. Typically, it takes a short time, 30 minutes to an hour for the infusion. After the cells have all infused, you will receive extra f luids. Uncommonly, patients have red -tinged urine after the infusion. This is because some of the red cells that have been damaged in the freezing process are removed by the kidneys and then passed through the urine causing a reddish color. 19 Syngeneic (fro m a twin donor) In syngeneic transplants, the cells are harvested from your twin on the day before and the day of transplant. This is scheduled to occur after you have completed the high -dose regimen. The twin donor und ergoes a similar procedure as des cribed above for autologous patient mobilization and collection. Twin donors are given GCSF alone to mobilize stem cells. When a sufficient number of stem cells are circulating, collection can begin. Stem cells are collecte d in the Apheresis Unit in the cl inic. Before beginning collection, the donor must have catheters placed into large veins in their arms. The placement of the catheters takes place right before the collection procedure. The collection of PBSC's takes about 3 hours. During the procedure, th e donor relaxes in a chair or bed and can watch television or read. Marrow or stem cells are infused into you as soon as available from the donor, usually within a few hours after harvesting. There is usually more than one bag of marrow or stem cells. Before engraftment Signs that the new stem cells are growing (engrafting) and beginning to produce blood cells are expected from 10 to 28 days after transplant. Often the first sign of engraftment is a rising white blood c ell count. While watching for the first signs of engraftment, you require careful monitor ing. The goals are to support you until you are producing blood cells again, to provide prompt treatment if complications occur, and to prevent infections. Most patien ts experience the uncertainty of waiting for engraftment as stressful; it is common to feel defenseless and vulnerable. Associated with the daily monitoring, medical procedures, and treatments is a feeling of loss of personal control. Coping at this time c an be a challenge. Keep talking to your team about your concerns. Blood c ounts : what are they and what do they mean? Blood component name Function Normal ranges Transplant transfusion guidelines Hematocrit (HCT) % red blood cells per volume of whole bloo d erythrocytes Carry oxygen to the body Give color to the skin Give energy to the body Adult: 37% to 52% Transfuse: If HCT less than 26% or If patient symptomatic Platelets (PLTS) thrombocytes Prevent bleeding Help blood to clot 150,000 to 500,000/mm 3 Transfuse: If less than 10,000, or For bleeding, or If otherwise indicated White blood cells (WBC) Fight infection Adult: 5,000 to10,000/mm3 Not applicable Absolute neutrophil (ANC) neutrophils polys bands segs granulocytes Type of WBC that i s first to respond to potentially fatal infections Over 1,000 Very rare occurrences; Only if life threatening infection is present with no signs of white cell recovery 20 Normal blood c ounts Blood counts are numbers that show the amount of blood cells circ ulating in the blood stream. Blood will be drawn from your central line to check the level of your counts. The blood counts that are monitored closely are the t otal number of white blood cell s (ANC), the hematocrit, and the p latelet count. Effects of che motherapy and radiation on blood counts The amount of chemotherapy and radiation used in conditioning cause s the bone marrow to stop producing cells for a time. Your blood counts will be low during this period. After your blood counts are drawn, your physi cian will determine your transfusion needs. When your stem cells begin to engraft, your blood counts should start to rise. The actual time for recovery of cells will vary from person to person. Red blood cell transfusions When your red blood count is low , the physician will order packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. This consists of a bag or bags of conce ntrated red blood cells , each transfused over 2 to 4 hours. This blood has been typed and cross -matched with yours to minimize the chance of reactio n. This means that the RBC donor and you have a compatible blood type. It's still possible that you may have a reaction. Symptoms include fever, chills, hives, itching, and/or breathing problems. If you have any of these symptoms during transfusion, be sur e to report them right away to your nurse. All blood products are tested for infectious diseases such as he patitis, HIV, (human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS), and West Nile. If you are cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative, you will receive CMV safe blood, als o known as leuko -reduced blood products. Platelet t ransfusions Collection of platelets is done at the Puget Sound Blood Bank. Platelet transfusions come from three types of donors: Random pooled platelets: From 2 to 6 volunteer donors in the community, w hich are pooled in the same bag Random apheresis platelets (RAP): From 1 volunteer donor in the community. Matched apheresis platelets (MAP): From 1 HLA matched unrelated donor in the community. Infections Infections remain one of the major complications of transplantation. You are high risk for infections because of low white blood cell counts and a poorly functioning immune system. All people have different types of bacteria, viruses, and yeast growing on their skin and in their bodies. Many of these o rganisms are needed for proper functioning of our bodies. Our immune system controls the growth of the organisms so that they do not make us sick. The source of infection in many patients is their own organisms. Routine cultures are important because the r esults keep physicians informed about the bacteria, viruses, and yeast you have growing in your body that may be causing infections. Culture results help physicians to prescribe the right antibiotic when you have an infection. It is not unusual for you to have negative culture results and still clinically look and feel like you have an infection. 21 Another source of infection is organisms from other people. Hand washing plays a key role in stopping the spread of infection from one person to another. It is i mportant that everyone entering and leaving your hospital or clinic room washes their hands, inc luding yourself. This is why visiting between you and other patients is not allowed in the hospital and why your family members should not go into other patient s' hospital rooms. The medications used to treat infections include antibiotic, antifungal, an d antiviral medications. Respiratory viruses, which cause the common cold or the flu in people with normal immune systems, can lead to pneumonia in transplant p atients. These viruses include parainfluenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). If you develop symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, such as stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, chills, fatigue or fever, we will get a naso -pharyngeal and throat (NPT) culture to determine if there is a specific viral infection. You will be in isolat ion as soon as symptoms develop and remain in isolation until the cultures are negative and you no longer have symptoms. Family members or friends with cold or flu symptoms should stay away from you until they are well. Cytomegalovirus (CMV ) Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection is a member of the herpes family and is very common. Between 50% to 80% of the US population have had a CMV virus infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). CMV infections are rarely serious in otherwise healthy children and adults and usually cause only mild symptoms, if any. Once a person has a CMV infection, the virus usually lies dormant (inactive) in the body but can b e \"reactivated\" and cause serious illness in people who have weakened immune system s due to illness, chemotherapy, or transplant. All stem cell transplant patients are monitored weekly for reactivation, regardless if they are CMV positive or negative. Thi s is done with a blood test called CMV PCR. In stem cell transplant recipients, the antiviral drug ganciclovir or foscarnet can be given intravenously to treat the reactivation. It will be recommended to continue monitoring for CMV reactivation for one yea r after transplant. This can be coordinated with the patient's referring physician. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome is a disease caused by injury to the liver, which involves the partial blockage of blood flow through small veins. Congestion results in post -sinusoidal obstruction and liver damage. The cause of this problem is the chemotherapy and/or radiation used to prepare you for transplant. High levels of conditioning therapies are needed for successful transplant . Such intensive therapy can damage otherwise healthy tissues in addition to its desired effects. The liver is especially susceptible. The signs of SOS are fluid retention, weight gain, and an increase in liver function test values. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems The chemotherapy and/or radiation used in the high -dose regimen a lso affect the entire GI tract. These side effects range from mild sore mouth and throat, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea, to more severe forms, which can include inflammation and mucos al breakdown throughout the GI tract. Narcotics are used for pain control, and intravenous nutrition (TPN) is often indicated. These side effects get better with engraftment. 22 Lung problems You will be monitored closely for signs of any breathing difficult ies due to fluid overload, pneumonia, or side effects of chemotherapy or r adiation. Daily physical examinations and routin e chest X -rays will be done . Skin p roblems The skin is a sensitive organ often prone to some damage from chemo and radiation. These s ide effects range from a mild redness like a sunburn to red, dry , and peel ing skin. Kidney p roblems Kidneys are organs that produce urine, remove bodily waste, and process some drugs out of the body. Some drugs affect kidney function. Your nurses and phys ician s keep a close watch on your kidney function through blood tests, the careful monitoring of the quantity and quality of urine, and frequent measurement of body weight. These and other factors help guide them to prevent and treat kidney problems and he lp return kidney function to normal. After engraftment As your new immune system develop s, the goal is to support your recovery and manage any complications that may arise. Your immune system is immature, and you are still vulnerable to infections. You may need infusions of red blood cells or platelets, as well as fluids and nutritional support until you are eating and drinking enough. It is common to fee l tired during this phase. Even though you feel tired, try to keep as active as possible. Being active helps prevent some complications. You may also feel \"down\" or depressed at times during the recover y period. You may grieve because of changes in physical functioning or dependence on others for care or even changes in relationships with your fami ly mem bers. These are all common reactions to the intense experience of having a transplant. You also may experience decreased concentration at this time. See the sections on Fatigue, Depression, and Memory and Concentration for more information. Progress may seem slow. You may feel frustrated because you want to get well r apidly . It takes time to recover. Former patients tell us that they coped by taking one day at a time. They found that if they set a simple and realistic goal to achieve each day, it was easi er for th em to see the progress . It is helpful to talk with staff about what are realistic goal s. As you recover and no longer need close monitoring and treatment, the team will help you to prepare to leave and return to th e care of your regular physicia n. Despite the eager anticipat ion, you may experience separation anxiety as you prepare to leave ! Failure to e ngraft Failure of the transplanted cells to grow and develop is an uncommon complication. At first, there may be signs of engraftment such as inc reasing blood counts, but later the blood counts decreas e. Generally, it takes a number of weeks after the transplant to find out the success of the graft. It takes longer for some patients to engraft than others. The production of blood counts is not a st eady climb. Blood counts normally fluctuate after transp lant. Also, certain medications influence the production of blood cells. If failure to engraft is indeed the diagnosis, then you will be offered other therapies. Some treatment plans (research proto cols) are specifically focused on this situation and aim to boost the production of blood cells. Other treatment plans invo lve stopping the drugs which interfere with bone marrow function or the infusion of reserve marrow or more stem cells if available. 23 Transitioning back to SCCA You may be hospitalized ( also called inpatient care ) during your transplant. If needed, your inpatient care will either be provided at SCCA Hospital or a specialized unit at University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). Both a re located at UWMC and provide the same high -level quality of care. A transition nurse will meet with you and your caregiver to help with plans for discharge from the inpatient unit and transition back to the SCCA clinic . After discharge, clinic nurses wil l again coordinate your care. Before leaving the inpatient u nit, you and your caregiver will receive the information you need and have an opportunity to learn and practice the skills to manage your ca re at home. Classes are taught covering these skills, a nd we want your caregiver to know that he or she is welcome to attend any of the classes a second time to \"brush up\" on information or skills. A transition nurse will schedule your first clinic v isit before the day of your discharge from the hospital . You will be scheduled to see a physician or physician's assistant and your team nurse at the clinic at least once a week, and other times as needed. This clinic visit includes an exam and time for yo u to share your questions and concerns with staff. Also, on your first clinic visit, you will be given your usual weekly schedule for clinic times, blood dr aws, and routine chest X-rays. You will have a nutrition visit scheduled. You may also need to be at the clinic for care other than your scheduled weekly visit . Preventing i nfection Even though you are well enough to recover at home, your immune system is still recovering, and you will need to take precautions to guard against infection for up to a year or longer after your transplant. There are many strategies you can use to decrease infection risk to yourself during this time: Hand h ygiene According to the CDC, clean hands are the single most important factor in preventing the spread of germs and the infections they can cause, especially in people with weaken ed immune systems. These are the most important times for you and people around you to clean your hands: Before preparing or eating food ( use soap and water ) Before touching your eyes, nose or mouth ( soap and water or alcohol hand sanitizer ) Before and a fter changing dressings that cover wounds or medical devices implanted in your body (like the Hickman cath eter) ( soap and water or alcohol hand sanitizer ) After using the restroom ( use soap and water ) After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing ( soap and water or alcohol hand sanitizer) After touching hospital or clinic surfaces such as bed rails or hand rai ls, door handles, counters, elevator buttons, phones, pens ( soap and water or alcohol hand sanitizer ) 24 For hand hygiene to be effective, it must be do ne carefully, so here is how we recommend that you do it: If using soap and water: Note: Soap and water should be used whenever the hands are visibly dirty or after using the restroom. Soap and water should also be used after touch ing someone with a gastrointestinal infection like Clostridium difficile, nor ovirus or rotavirus If using alcohol hand sanitizer: Hand sanitizer is a quick, easy way to reduce the number of germs on your hands. Please be sure to use alcohol hand g el or foam that is at least 60% alcohol. A word about finger nails: please keep them short and do not wear artificial nails. Long nails and artificial nails can attract fungus growth. Nail polis h may be worn as long as it is unchipped. (Nail polish chi ps are good germ collection areas.) We advise against getting manicures during the transplant process. 1. Dispe nse one or two pumps of gel or foam into palm of one dry hand. 2. Rub hands to gether covering all surfaces of hands and fingers until dry, about 15 seconds. 25 Avoid c rowds The more people you come into contact with, the greater the opportunity to encoun ter infections from others, including other patients. For this reason, it is best to minimize social gatherings and visiting places that will have crowds. If it is necessary to go to a social gathering or public location, try to plan your outing and visit for when it will be least crowded. Bring your own hand sanitizer. Avoid being near anyone with obvious infectious symptoms (coughing, sneezing, etc.) Avoid shaking hands and touching items touched by other people (pens, door handles, elevator buttons, and shopping cart handles). After touching items touched by other people, clean your hands as soon as possible with hand sanitizer. Temperature t aking Call the clinic or after -hours clinic for a temperature that is greater than or equal to 38.3 C or 100.9F, or a temperature of 38.0 C or 100.4F for 1 hour, by mouth. When taking an axillary (under the arm) temperature with children, call if the temperature is 37.9 C or 100.3 F. Do not take Tylenol\u00ae until you have talked with a nurse or physician. Repo rt a shaking chill without a fever. Plants Avoid plants. Do not keep fresh flowers and plants in your home. The organisms that may grow in water, dirt, and on plants can cause infections. After the immediate post -transplant period, you may have plants i n your home, but you are discouraged from touching them. Pets Avoid being around any animals that did not live with you before your transplant. Do not clean up after animals and wash your hands after touching an animal or if an animal touches you. Avoid all contact with birds and reptiles. (They are known to car ry salmonella.) Delegate the majority of pet care to other family members or friends. Please do not bring pets to the clinic. Avoid dusty and moldy areas Aspergillus is a mold that is widespread in nature, especially in decaying matter, water , and soi l. In patients with weakened immune systems, Aspergillus can cause infections o f the lungs, sinuses or brain. Aspergillus can be found in dust, such as that at construction and remodeling s ites If you live near construction, keep your windows closed. If yo u use air conditioning, please ensure machines are cleaned regularly according to manufacturer's instructions. Keep your car windows closed when driving past construction sites. Avoid being around home remodeling projects Housecleaning that will disturb du st and mold --vacuuming, dusting, scrubbing down showers \u2014should be done by other people when you are not around Clean your hands after touching items that may be dusty. Water c oncerns Some germs grow especially well in wet, room -temperature or warm areas. Here are some things to avoid: Decorative fountains Hot tubs Swimming pools, lakes, rivers Room humidifiers or dehumidifiers (both have reservoirs with standing water where bacteria may g row) Please see the Water Safety Guidelines section for more infor mation about safe household water use. 26 Vaccination o f caregivers and f amily members Although no vaccination is completely effective in preventing a disease, vaccinations are the most effec tive tools available to prevent the following diseases: Influenza (\"the flu\") Varicella (chicken pox) (for those who have not already had chicken pox) Measles (for those born after 1957) Mumps (for those born after 1957) Rubella Tetanus Diphtheria Pertussis (\"whooping cough\") Pneumococcal Vaccinated caregivers and fami ly members will be less likely to become infected with the above diseases and expose the patient with a weakened immune system. Other health maintenance activities Daily exercise Regular exercise is important to your recovery. Physical therapy may b e ordered. If you are taking prednisone (steroids), you may need physical therapy to maintain your muscle strength. Sun safety Use sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 when yo u are outside and apply it to all exposed skin areas. Even if it is no t especially sunny out, it is important to protect your skin from the sun's rays. Your skin is sensitive to the sun for 2 to 3 months after transplant. There is an increased risk of skin cancer after a transplant, so you must continue to use sunscreen for the rest of your life. A GVHD rash appears from sunburn, even from slight overexposure. Symptom management Review the Managing Care at Home section for more information on symptom mana gement. The Quick Reference Guide in the pocket of this manual should be used for reference. If in doubt, give us a call. Keep your emergency card with you. Readmission You may need to be readmitted to the hospital for management of symptoms that cannot b e safely taken care of in the home setting or the clinic. As soon as y ou are medically stable, the medical team will work with the Transition nurse to have your care returned to the clinic. 27 Departure Departure conference and clinic visit You and your family will have a summary conference with the attending physician and pr imary nurse. At this conference, you will be given recommendations and/or instructions for continued self -care and monitoring at home. You will also have the opportunity t o ask any remaining questions about your condition or your return home. You may be of fered protocols for your long -term care at home at this conference. Following this conference, you will have one final clinic vis it with your physician , primary physician or physician's assistant, and nurse. Long -term follow -up (LTFU) departure class Afte r you have left the clinic and you are home, the LTFU staff will be a resource for you and your physician.

Please wear a two -piece outfit, as you will be asked to remove all your clothing a nd jewelry above the waist. You will be given a gown that opens in the front to wear during your exam. Before your mammogram exa m Wipe off any deodorant, talcum powder, or lotion under your arms or on your breasts. These can appear on the mammogram as sp ots. You will be given special wipes at your appointment to cleanse your underarms and breast. You will be asked to remove all jewelry and clothing above the waist, and you will be given a gown or loose -fitting material that opens in the front. Please t urn your cell phones and/or pagers off when your exam begins. Report any unusual findings, such as a lump, thickening, redness, or swelling, to your physician and the technologist. Tell your physician and technologist if there is any chance you may be preg nant. Some women avoid having a mammogram because of anxiety or fear. Remember that having a mammogram is a way for you to stay healthy. The mammogram can catch problems early, which often leads to a complete cure. 38 MRI screening form Your physician has o rdered an MRI exam for you. Call (206) 606 -1434 if you may be pregnant or weigh more than 300 pounds. Review and complete \"MRI Patient Screening Form\" for additional conditions that may affect the exam. In most cases, surgical staples, clips, pins, a nd screws are not a risk during MRI if they have been in place for more than 4 to 6 weeks. If there is any question of metal fragmen ts in the eye, an X -ray may be done to check for them. To prevent a delay or cancellation of your exam, if you have ANY of the following implanted devices, allergies or may be pregnant (see complete list below) please tell your team coordinator or call (206) 606-1434 to review your eligibility for your exam. Pacemaker / defibrillator Cerebral (brain) aneurysm clip* Cochlear implant* Cardiac stents* Implanted or external drug pump (including chemotherapy) Breast tissue expander If pregnant, # of weeks:_______ Dialysis or renal failure Allergy to CT contrast or gadolinium Drug or contrast allergies Please bring the wallet ca rd that identifies the implanted devices. 39 Preparing for nuclear medicine bone scan or MUGA exam Increase your fluid intake before and after the injection. Try to drink 3 to 4 glasses of your preferred drink after the injection. Empty your bladder f requently. There are no eating or drinking restrictions. If you are unable to remain still for 45 minutes, please spea k with your referring physician for pre - medication. You will be given a document that states the period of time during which the small amo unts of radiation remaining in your body are capable of detection by radiation monitoring equipment. This amount of ra diation poses no danger to the public and is allowed by the State of Washington medical use regulations. Women who are pregnant or bre ast feeding should not have this exam. 40 Preparing for an ultrasound exam If the abdomen will be studied, you must no t eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before your exam. Medications may be taken with a small amoun t of water. For pelvic exams, you must drink at least 16 ounces of water before the exam to fill your bladder. Do not go to the bathroom until instru cted by the technologist. If you are diabetic, check with your physician or nurse about dietary and medi cation restrictions. 41 Participating in research Clinical missions In choosing to come to SCCA, you directly benefit the knowledge gained by previous patients who participated in various research studies. You, in turn, may be asked to participate in s imilar research studies. The results may benefit you as well as future patients. By working together, results can be improved. We believe that the goals of patient care, teaching, and research work together for the benefit of patients. How research studie s are developed Research studies are first developed by a staff member working in a specialized field of study. A proposal is written and shared among staff members working together, and then among the members of a scientific staff review committee. After review, the rese arch proposal is turned into the Institutional Review Board. Their task is to ensure that being in the study is reasonable in terms of benefits and risks. They also review the written consent form to be sure that it clearly describes what w ill be done and the possible risks. Informed consent You will be asked to sign a written consent form for each research study in which you participate. Your signature indicates that the study has been explained to you, that you understand the risks, that you have had a chance to ask questions, and that you freely agree to participate. Consent forms also state that you remain free to withdraw your consent. Benefits and risks of research It is often a possibility that you will personally benefit by partici pating in resear ch studies. There is also the possibility that you will not benefit or that a harmful reaction may occur. Some studies involve assigning patients to a treatment by a process called \"randomization.\" This means that treatment will be decided by random comput er selection. This is often done when it is not known whether one treatment is better than another. Comparisons are often made between a \"new\" treatment and a \"standard\" treatment. Randomization is a way to avoid any bias that might influen ce results of th e comparison. It increases the confidence that any differences seen between groups reflect the effect of the treatment rather than other factors. You may feel uncomfortable about having aspects of your treatment decided by random computer selection. You mi ght believe that the \"new\" treatment is likely to be better than the \"standard\" treatment, or you might be concerned that the \"new\" treatment may increase the chance of side effects. For either of these reasons, you may prefer to choose one treatment or th e other. These feelings are understandable, however, we hope you will understand that there is no factual basis for any preference between treatments in this situation. If there were, we would not need to do a research study to find out whi ch treatment is actually better. Long -term participation in research Being involved in research will likely extend beyond your stay, especially if you have problems that need ongoing treatment. We are able to carry on this research by working with your ph ysician. You may be asked to return for a periodic check -up. Research results Information gained from research studies is reported at scientific meetings and published in medical journals. In this way, we are able to share results with other professionals . 42 Confidentialit y Patient confidentiality is always protected. Names and initials are not disclosed in any report. Records are kept locked and access is limited to authorized staff. Questions about research Care is taken to ensure that your treatment is not endangered by participation in research. If you have concerns about being in any research study, we hope that you will feel free to ask questions. Your continued participation remains essential, and we are grateful for your willingness to work with us. If you would lik e to know more about clinical research, please ask your nurse or physician. Financial interest in medical research Medical researchers occasionally have financial relationships with private industry, such as: Owning shares of stock Servin g on advisory boa rds or consulting for companies Receiving consulting fees and payments A medical researcher who has such an interest or relationship is required to disclose it. Institutions carefully review these disclosures. Decisions are made as to whe ther the study ca n be carried out by the medical researchers and whether the personal financial interests and relationships can continue. We do this to safeguard patients and the integrity of the medical research. Connection with private industry For man y years, medical researchers and private industry have worked together to study ideas that might become useful to science and patients. Drug companies and biotechnology firms sometimes pay for medical research studies. This financial support can lead to ne w ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat illness. Our commitment to you SCCA and its member institutions are committed to protecting the rights and well -being of participants who volunteer for medical research studies. SCCA's member institutions have polici es and pr ocedures for the disclosure, review, and management of the financial interests and relationships between medical researchers and private industry. If you wish to learn more about policies and procedures Each member institution has its own methods for revi ew of financial relationships and interests. If you wish to learn more about these policies and procedures, you may contact the resources listed here.

You will be asked to sign an authorization form to release your person h ealth information. There is no charge for records released to you or your physician. Sick family members, friends , or caregivers Family members, friends or caregivers should not come to the clinic if they have any of the following symptoms: Runny or stuff y nose Post nasal drip Shortness of breath Cough Wheezing or chest tightness Sore throat Sneezing Watery eyes Ear pain Fever Diarrhea, nausea , or vomiting New rash Please contact your care team if you have any family members, friends or caregivers (who ar e in regular physical contact with you) who have any of the above symptoms. Even if it is thought that the symptoms are only related to allergies, please contact your team. All respiratory virus infections begin with symptoms that are like allergy symptoms . It is possible to have allergies and a respiratory virus infection at the same time. Your care team will give you further instructions about how to manage the situation. Please remember that a respiratory virus infection with mild symptoms in a person w ith a healthy immune system can become a more serious infection if passed to a person with a weakened immune system. Service dogs, therapy dogs, and pets Healthcare facilities and other places that serve the public must allow people with disabilities to b e accompanied by their service dogs. At SCCA, service dogs can accompany handlers in all areas of the clinic, except for in r ooms where invasive procedures and imaging take place. A service dog is a dog that is individually trained for the purpose of assi sting or accompanying a disabled person's sensory, mental, or physical disability. The special training service dogs receive is more than obedience training or positive reinforcements that are given to family pets. A therapy dog is trained to provide aff ection and comfort to people. A therapy dog's primary job is to allow people (who may or may not have disabilities) to make physical contact with it and enjoy that contact. Service dog handlers are protected under the ADA because of the disability the ha ndler experiences. Although the emotional benefits of therapy dogs are significant, physical contact to the dog by many indiv iduals in an infection concern in cancer centers that serve large numbers of patients with severely weakened immune systems. This is one of the reasons why SCCA does not allow therapy dogs, other therapy animals, or pets. Please do not bring therapy dogs, therapy animals or pets to SCCA. 47 Fresh flowers and plants Fresh or dried flowers and plants are not allowed in the clinic beca use of the organisms that grow on them and in their dirt or water, which can cause infections. Latex free balloons and silk f lowers are okay. Make sure there is not decorative moss around silk flowers. Only artificial moss is allowed.

You can get a validation sticker at the nurses' station . 49 Food services Nutrition Services will prov ide meals and snacks. You will receive a pre -printed menu daily, from which to orde r your meals. The menu you receive is designed to comply with your diet order. Other food choices are available from a special write -in list. Food safety is important, so it is preferred that your food and beverages be served from the kitchen. If you feel y ou require foods from outside the hospital, talk with your dietitian or physician. We may be keeping a record of your food and fluid intake. These records allow the dietit ian to determine the amount of calories, protein, and fluids you consume. Your dieti tian and physician use this information to assess if you need additional IV fluid or nutrition support. During your hospital stay, family members and visitors are encoura ged to visit the Plaza Caf\u00e9 on the first floor. There are also espresso bars located on the first and third floors. Family members should not eat from the patient's tray.

SCCA Hospita l and UWMC smoking p olicy Your daily routine You may wonder what the norm al routine day is like while you are an inpatient . What procedures are often done? What tests are usually run? What routine activities will be a part of everyday life on the unit? These questions will be explained in more detail by the inpatient nurse, but in the meantime, here is what you can expect: Routine blood tests Early morning, before 3 am, the nurses will draw daily routine blood tests from your central line. We will distu rb you as little as possible, but our medical team needs to review your laboratory findings as early in the day as possible. Some routine tests will be drawn other times of the day as well. Vital signs Your temperature, pulse, respiration, an d blood press ure (vital signs) will be taken every four hours. Sometimes they are taken more often if we need to monitor you more closely. 50 Physical examinations The nurses and physicians will need to listen to your heart, lungs, and abdomen with the steth oscope. The nurse will look at your mouth daily and more often when you are likely to experience mucositis, an inflammation of the mouth. Daily weight A daily morning weight check is important to monitor the amount of fluid in your body. You may need to have your wei ght checked twice per day. Bathing Daily baths or showers are required to help cleanse the body of bacteria. This may help lower the chance of infection. Your nurses will work with you to fit your bath or shower into your schedule. Central line care The central line dressing will be changed when needed to guard against bacterial growth. This gives us a chance to inspect the skin around the central line. Measuring output Your urine, stool, and emesis (vomit) will be measured and tested. Tes ts wil l be done on a regular basis. Please do not dispose of this output; the nurse will do it for you. Exercise We encourage you to arrange with the nurse a time to take a walk and exercise in the halls. Your physician may order Physical Therapists to wo rk wit h you to help you keep your activity level up. Nutrition Dietitians will talk to you about your food likes and dislikes and provide specific recommendations based on oral and/or gastrointestinal symptoms . Nutrition support, either through a feeding tube o r through your central line, is recommended if you are not able to eat. Medications and IV fluids Many medications will be given through your central line such as antibiotics, anti -nausea medications, or medications to prevent graft -versus -host dise ase. Fluids will be given if you cannot drink enough to meet your body's needs. Chest X -rays Chest X -rays are done weekly to check your lungs. Rounds Every morning, your physician and other members of the team will do rounds, a grou p discussion with each patient. This is to check on your progress and to make changes in your therapy if needed. This is a good time to ask any questions you may have and to discuss your plan of care. Every hour during the day and every 2 hours at night, a nurse or patient care technician (PCT) will visit your room to check on your well -being, monitor your comfort and pain, help you to the bathroom, and make sure you can reach the things you need. 51 Transfusions Blood and platelet transfusions will be given to you as needed unti l you are able to make your own blood cells. Your blood counts will be checked every morning. Making the transition to the SCCA clinic A transition nurse from the SCCA clinic will meet with you and your caregiver to help with plans for discharge from SCCA Hospital or UWMC . Your care will then be coordinated by your team nurse until you are discharged to your home physician. Visitor guidelines Open visiting hours There are no set visiting hours. We encourage families to keep their own health in mind and to get a good night's sleep. A nurse will contact family members at home if any problem occurs. Family members should make sure that the Nurses' Station has their correct phone number on file for emergency use. Preventing infection You and your family members are not allowed to visit oth er patient rooms. This helps to prevent the spread of infection. You are encouraged to walk around the nursing unit, but should avoid other patients, their families, and the areas where people gather. Family members or other visitors should not use the bat hrooms in the patient rooms. To prevent infections, public restrooms are located on al l nursing units. Here are some additional infection prevention steps: Clean hands frequently by washing with soap and water or by using alcohol hand sanitizer. As a minimum standard, everyone should wash or use hand sanitizer upon entering and exiting th e patient's ro om. Clean hands are safe hands. Keep surfaces clear of belongings. Some organisms can survive a long time on the surfaces and equipment in the pa tient's room. It is very important that these surfaces be cleaned daily by our Environmental Ser vices (ES) staff. The ES staff cleans bed rails and other items close to the patient if the patient is not present. To help them do a complete cleaning, please leave the room if possible. Take a shower, a walk , or sit in a chair. Minimize the number of per sonal belongings in the room . To help keep your room as clean as possible, we encourage patients to have cards and pictures posted on the wall of their room. Ot her items should be placed in the bedside cabinet. Family members can help by taking items sent to the patient by other family members and friends back to the home or apartment shortly after the patient sees them. Clean or wash your belongings . ES staff do es not clean your belongings. Daily, a family member or friend should wipe off the patient's bel ongings with a cloth or paper towel dampened with soap and water. Items such as clothing or quilts should be washed periodically or when they become soiled. Here are a few reminders of procedures which also prevent the spread of infection: Place used tiss ue in the trash can (not on other surfaces such as the bedside table or floor). Wash hands frequently (before eating and after using the bathroom or urinal). 52 Families and other visitors need to take special precautions during respiratory virus season. A s ign-in sheet will be placed at the nurses' station desk. Families and visitors will need to sign in daily. The questions regarding flu and cold symptoms will h elp determine whether or not visitors are sick. If visitors are sick, they are not allowed to vis it the unit. This is for the safety of all of the patients with weakened immune systems, and for staff who could risk infecting these patients if they catch a cold or the flu. Child visitors Any family member or visitor who has a fever or cold, or who is not feeling well, should not visit. Even minor colds and infections carry a risk to the patient. Children, in particular, are known to get many viruses. Pl ease evaluate the health of children, and their exposure to other children who may have been ill, before letting them come to the hospital . Children with any symptoms of respiratory virus infections should not visit. Since allergy symptoms and respiratory virus symptoms are very similar, children should not visit even if it is thought that their symp toms are allergy -related. These guidelines are for child visitors: Children must wash their hands like any other visitor. Children who are ill or might be are not allowed to visit. Children (or adults) who have been exposed to chickenpox and who have not h ad chicken pox before are not allowed to visit. If children have received live -virus oral polio vaccine, they cannot have contact with the patient for at leas t six weeks. If a child needs a polio vaccination, the inactivated polio vaccine can be given by injection. Children may not go into the room of another patient. Children under 6 years old must be with an adult when playing in the family room. Toys from th e family room may not be taken into the patient's room. The hallway is not a play area for childr en. No running, screaming, or yelling is allowed. Children are not allowed to play with hospital equipment such as wheelchairs and stretchers. Fresh flowers a nd plants Fresh or dried flowers and plants are not allowed on the hospital unit because of the o rganisms that grow on them and in their dirt or water, which can cause infections. Non -latex balloons and silk flowers are okay. Make sure there is no decorati ve moss around silk flowers. Only artificial moss is allowed. Money and valuables Money and valu ables should not be left in your room or the family room because of the risk of theft. Using the family room All who use the family room must help to keep it clean. Please label your food in the refrigerator with your name and the date. Food left too long will be thrown away. Getting help from a nurse Please use the \"nurse call button\" for help if an alarm rings in the patient's room. The patient will have medications and fluid running on infusion pumps. These pumps have alarms that will beep for various reasons. Family members should not correct the pump alarms. Recording intake and output If you have water or ice, notify the nurse of the amount given. It is important to keep accurate records for each patient's fluid intake and output. Therefore, never e mpty a urinal, bedpan, or emesis basin. 53 Medications Family members should never give medications to the patient without instructions from the nur se. Release of medical information Inpatient health record information can be obtained from Health Informatio n Management at UWMC. There is no charge to send copies to your physician. 54 55 Chapter 3 - Managing Care at Home \"There are only four kinds of people in this world: Those who have been caregivers Those who are currently caregivers Those who will be caregivers Those who will need caregivers\" -Quote from Rosalynn Carter's colleague Rosalynn Carter's book Helping Yourself Help Other s begin s with the above quote. Education and support have been developed to meet the needs of you and your caregiver s. Edu cation offer ed includes weekly group classes, videos, individualized instruction, and written materials. Support is offered by team members i ncluding nursing, social work, and spiritual health . Please review the next two sections for details of caregiving. 56 57 Suggestions for coping with care at h ome Ask qu estions . If you are not sure, call using the important phone numbers provided . Remember tha t you are a member of the team and your input is important. Keep your nurse and physician informed. Review the symp tom sheets provided and call for help if needed . Review hints for self -care. Ask your family and friends for help before you are too fatigued. Keep a list of what friends can do and delegate. For example, one person could drive you to an appointment, anot her could make a meal and another could go to the grocery store. Some people have more time than others; this is where your list would be helpful. Organize your day into manageable segments. Develop a schedule each day/week with the caregiver who is provid ing the care. This process allows family members or friends to be in agreement with the goals for the day or week. If everyone is working with the same agenda in mind, the tension within a family usually decreases. Remember, the staff at SCCA is here to s upport you as well. Tell your physician or nurse if you need more support. Call the social worker for emotional support. Use webs ites to keep family and friends informed: www.caringbridge.com or www.carepages.com Outline of typical caregiver r esponsibilities Making arrangements: Transportation Financial Tracking appointments Giving emotional support: Being physically present Giving encouragement Providing physical care : Identifying changes in patient's condition Reporting patient's symptoms to healthcare staff Obtaining medical care if needed Monitoring patient compliance in self administration of oral medications Recording medications taken/administered Acquiring and m aintaining medical supplies Performing tasks such as central line care Administering fluids and medicati ons using an intravenous pump Maintaining the home environment: Cleaning Food preparation Shopping 58 Patient advocacy : Gathering information and assuri ng that pertinent information is given to medical staff Helping with decision -making Providing assistan ce/support to others: Serving as a communication link with other family members or friends Imparting information to children Providing child care Takin g care of the caregiver Caregivers are encouraged to take care of themselves through exercise, proper diet, and adequate sleep. Caregivers can benefit from breaks. You may be at risk to become ill if you do not take care of yourself. Here are some helpfu l tips from Rosalynn Carter's book, Helping Yourself Help Others : Listen to your friends. Be open to others' observations. Let go. Know your limits. Focus on your loved ones' strengths. Learn relaxation techniques. Take care of your health. Maintain a life outside your caregiving role. Insist on private time. Build a caregiving team. Rely on your sense of humor. Appreciate the benefits of leisure time. Help your loved one find a support group. Seek professional help. Appreciate your own efforts. Seek spirit ual renewal. Develop a plan of c are The nursing staff will work with you to develop a unique home care plan . You have a nurse available 24 hours a day to answer questions. You may utilize multiple family members and friends during different stages of transplant. You and your caregiver need t o develop a schedule and division of tasks that is satisfactory to both of you. You can participate in self -care, as long as you feel well enough to do so. You both can learn to operate the ambulatory pump. When a diff erent person (including the patient) t akes over line care, they should review the steps with a nurse. The home care plan should meet safety needs. The following recommendations give an idea of the different levels of caregiving needed throughout the tr ansplant and recovery process. Each patie nt and family organizes their routines different. Some patients and families like to keep a logbook of activities, infusions, and medications. Please see the example s of a home care schedule at the end of the manual . 59 Recommendations for c aregiver support We hope these recommendations will assist families in anticipating the need for caregiver support. N eeds change throughout the transplant process. Inpatient p hase: Patients do not require caregivers, but do apprec iate and benefit from em otional support from family and friends. Clinic phases and support levels: Caregivers are very important in providing care when the patient is ambulatory. Consistent support: Caregiver is present most of the time; breaks should be less than three -four hou rs. Adult patients, but not children, can be left alone if they have access to the phone, the ability to contact emergency services, operate ambulatory pumps, get to the restroom, and have access to food and fluids . Criteria for rec ommending a consistent c aregiver for the patient are: During conditioning (including Dilantin administration), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy First 1 to 2 weeks in the SCCA clinic after initial discharge after transplant Three different IV infusions s uch as hydration, medications, or parenteral nutrition (PN ot TPN) over a 24 -hour period Neutropenia (ANC < 500) Altered mental status: drowsy, confused, impaired judgment, poor memory Weakness/limited mobility (cannot walk without assistance) Sliding sca le insulin (when starting therapy) Intermittent support: Does not need a caregiver for most hours within a 24 -hour period. A caregiver is available 2 -3 times per day to provide assistance with dressing changes, medicatio ns, transportation, and processing i nformation provided during conferences or clinic visits. Minimal support: Patients do not require a caregiver, but do benefit from emotional support during clinic visits and conferences. Patient and caregiver e ducation Patient and caregiver education is a n integral part of treatment and services offered. Informational, educational, and support services are available to patients, family members, and caregivers. You have the right to information regarding health status, di sease, treatment options, the treatm ent process, managing and monitoring health in the home setting, and maintaining health after treatment. The education program has three major components: Individual teaching Classes Videos (online at youtube.com/c/SCCA PatientEducation ) Individual teachi ng is offered on topics such as care of the central line, medications, blood glucose monitoring, and specific needs that may arise during the treatment and recovery process. Educational classes focus on gaining an unders tanding about the treatment process and developing the skills needed for the patient's treatment, and recovery in the home setting . 60 Class d escriptions Classes are scheduled by the clinical support staff. A personalized list of appointments and scheduled classes is placed in your patient mailbox. Classes that are recommended for your designated caregiver(s) are listed on your appointment sheet. Managing care at home and review of transplant process This class includes an overview of the bone marrow/stem cell transplant process, review o f the patient/caregiver role and resources and how to prevent infection. Content of this class includes managing symptom s (mucositis, dehydration, diarrhea, bleeding, and breathing problems) and adjusting to recovery at home. We will also discuss what to e xpect at different phases of your transplant. Food safety class The content of this lecture and discussion class includ es the rationale for food safety, foods to omit, safe food selection, proper food handling techniques including cooking, preparation, an d storage. Long -term recovery class Information on how to manage care after leaving SCCA is presented. Content includes immune system recovery, assessing symptoms, treatment of graft -versus -host disease, guidelines for daily living and coping with the com mon psychological reactions after transplant . Guidelines for preventing infection What is an infection? Infections are caused by germs, which are also called microorganisms or microbes. Germs cause illness by entering the body and multiplying. Typical germs that can infect transplant patients are bacteria, viruses, and fungus (molds a nd yeast). During your transplant, your immune system will be weak, so you will be at a higher risk for getting infections. Infections in people who are receiving a trans plant can be more serious than in those people who are otherwise healthy. It is crit ical to limit exposures to that might increase your risk for acquiring an infection, and to seek help when you do develop infectious symptoms. While it is not possible to p revent all infections, there are a number of simple steps that you and your family/c aregiver can take to help prevent many common infections. While this section cannot cover all scenarios or possible situations, it includes basic information on how to prev ent infections during your transplant. Clean your hands often Cleaning your hands is one of the best ways to prevent infections. Hand hygiene is key, especially during the first year after your transplant and/or while taking immunosuppressive medicines ( medicine that weakens your immune system). You and anyone you come into contact with, including all members of your household, your physicians, and nurses, should clean their hands frequently. Do not be afraid to ask if visitors or any healthcare staff i f they cleaned their hands before they meet with you. 61 There are two options for cleaning your hands. Standard washing with soap and water is a great way to clean your hands. Alcohol hand sanitizer (hand gel such as Purell\u00ae) is another good way to reduce the number of germs on your hands. For home use, be sure to select a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy. Also, keep in mind that these hand sanitizers do not preve nt some gastrointestinal infections, such as C. diff and norovirus. P ersons with these infections and their caregivers should wash their hands with soap and water instead. Keep your nails short. Germs like to hide under fingernails. Avoid the use of arti ficial nails. At the SCCA clinic , CA Hospital, and UWMC , hand sanitizer is located in elevator lobbies, waiting rooms, and exam rooms. Please use hand gel frequently while at the clinic or hospital. When should you clean your hands ? It is important to clean your hands frequently througho ut the day, particularly when you are in public places (the clinic, restaurants, shopping, common areas/waiting rooms, etc.). Some specific times that are important to make sure you clean your hands: Before eating Before and after preparing food After to uching pets or animals After sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose After going outdoors Before and after any central venous catheter care or intravenous infusions Before taking oral medicines Before entering and leaving an exam room Before entering and leaving the clinic building Before and after getting on a shuttle How to wash your hands with soap and water It may sound a bit funny, but washing your hands properly is important. Read throug h the steps and practice them. Make this process a habit. Wet your hands with warm water and apply soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Scrub your hands for 15 to 20 seconds \u2014about the time it takes to hum the \"Happy Birthday\" song from beginning to end twice. Rinse your hands with water. Dry your hands with a clean or disposable towel or air dryer. If possible, use a towel to turn off the fauce t. How to apply hand sanitizer (hand gel) Apply one to two pumps of hand sanitizer to the palm of one hand. Rub your hands together. Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fin gers until your hands are dry. Make sure you get the product betwe en your fingers and on the back of your han ds. 62 Cleaning At least once a week and as needed, clean the kitchen and bathroom with a bleach solution. Make the solution daily with 1 -part bleach to 10 parts water. The solution needs to be made daily to make s ure that the bleach solution is effective. You can also buy a pre -made bleach solution, such as \"Clean -Up Cleaner with Bleach\" spray made by Clorox\u00ae. Key kitchen areas to clean are: Sinks, which can be very dirty because grime and mold often stick to thei r surfaces Faucets and faucet handles Countertops Cutting boards Refrigerator and microwave handles Stovetops All areas that hands have touched or where food has been prepped Personal hygiene Personal hygiene is necessary to help prevent infection. You ma y shower or bathe daily, as lo ng as you don't submerge your central venous catheter under water. Details on central line care are provided later in this manual. Cover your line as instructed. Daily cleansing with soap and water is the first line of defense against bacteria on the skin. Ill family members You should not be in the same home as an ill family member. Dental care To prevent infection, daily oral (mouth) care is needed. Keep your mouth clean by brushing your teeth twice each day with toothpas te. Ask your physician or nurse if it's okay to gently floss your teeth. Tell them if your gums bleed or if you have new sores in your mouth. Your physician or nurse may give you a special mouthwash to help clean your mouth. Most patients who are going thr ough a transp lant see a dental specialist; ask them any questions you have about your dental hardware (dentures, bridges, retainers) or issues you have with oral care. Safe eating Both how you prepare your food and what you eat play a role in keeping you healthy. Your physician and dietitian may recommend a special diet to follow depending on your situation. You might need more protein or calories, or you might need to avoid certain foods such as fresh produce. Follow that diet and these other tips to prev ent infection s: Do not share cups, glasses, or eating utensils with other people. Cook food thoroughly. Leftovers should be stored in small containers and refrigerated within 2 hours of cooking. Reheat leftovers thoroughly. Keep food at its proper temper ature. Keep h ot foods hot and cold foods cold. Avoid salad bars, buffets, deli counters, and food in bulk bins (if it isn't cooked) . Follow recommendations and check the guidelines for dietary restrictions. Ask your dietitian questions if you don't know i f something y ou are eating is safe. Keep foods fresh and buy in small amounts to avoid spoilage and mold contamination if possible. Do not eat or drink foods that are beyond their expiration date. 63 Prevent i nfections by avoiding high r isk activities Avoid activities such as gardening, raking, mowing, farming, or direct contact with soil and plants. These activities create plant or soil aerosols which increases e xposure to fungi and bacteria. Potted plants should be avoided. You should avoid working in green hous es or managing plants at home. Ask friends and visitors to avoid bringing fresh flowers and potted plants as gifts following your transplant. You cannot have plants or flowers in your home . Avoid close contact with people who ha ve respiratory illnesses (cough, cold, etc.). Be especially careful around school -aged children and those that attend daycare, since they are often exposed to other children who are ill. You should not be in the same home as someone with a respiratory vir us. Avoid crowded areas where you are unable to control the d istance between you and others, such as at movie theaters or sporting events . Avoid construction sites, including homes or buildings that are being repaired or remodeled. These dusty environment s increase your exposure to molds. Avoid tobacco and marijuana use. The use of these substances, along with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (second -hand smoke), increases your risk for bacterial and fungal infections. Avoid wood -burning fireplace s, because wood contains fungus. If a wood stove is your only source of heat, have someone else touch the wood and manage the fire. Avoid house cleaning that will disturb dust and mold, causing it to be stirred up in the air (such as vacuum cleaning, dust ing, and scrubbing down showers). If cleaning needs to be done, it is best to clean when you are not in the home, and use a wet washcloths or wipes as they capture dust. Do not use feather dusters. Once you have the energy, it is not harmful to iron, wash clothes, dry clothes, an d wash dishes. Avoid the use of a room humidifier due to bacteria that live in water. If you like to use air conditioners (AC) and fans during warm weather, they should be cared for properly as they can bring dust and mold in to yo ur home. Regular inspect ion and cleani ng of the AC unit is critical. AC Filters should be changed regularly per manufacturer recommendations. Avoid swimming in recreational water such as ponds, swimming pools, lakes, whirlpools, and hot tubs. Avoid: o Changing a baby's diaper o Touc hing bird droppings o Cleaning a fish tank o Emp tying and cleaning litter boxes o Cleaning up after pets You may feel \"safer \" wearing a mask when you are outside, but you are not required to wear a mask when you go o ut. This is a personal choice. If you choose t o wear a mask, you should still avoid situations as described above, which might increase your risk of infection Preve nt infections spread from animals Wash your hands immediately after petting your animals. It is not ne cessary to part with your pets. You should delegate the majority of pet care to other family members or friends. It is important to minimize direct contact with animals, especially animals that are ill, and avoid getting any ne w pets during your transplant. Do not sleep with pets. 64 If you have a cat, do not place the litter box in kitchens, dining rooms, or other areas where food preparation and eating occur. H ave someone else handle the daily litter box cleaning during the first year after transplant and when you are taking immunosuppress ive med icines to reduce your r isk of acquiring toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease. K eep your cats inside and do not adopt or handle stray cats. It is recommended to avoid contact with reptiles ( turtles, snakes, lizards), ducklings, or chicks to prevent exposure to a bacteria called Salmonella. If you have other pets, please discuss this with your team. Vaccinations It is beneficial for family members and household contacts to be vaccinated to prevent exposure to vaccine - preventable diseases. Recommended v accines help to prevent important diseases such influenza (flu), pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, tetanus, diphtheria, and pneumococcal. Have your family members, caregivers and close contacts see their physicians to make s ure the y are up to date on all of the recommended adult vaccines. Children should also be up to date on all childhood vaccines. Some vaccines, such as MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), varicella (chicken pox), and shingles (Zostavax\u00ae) vaccines, are live virus v accines. It is often safe for persons in your household to receive these but make sure you discuss the timing of these vaccinations for your family members with your team. Some of these live vaccines pose a very small risk of household transmission, so if a family or household member develops a rash after receiving the chicken pox or shingles vaccine; notify your physician or nurse It is very important that family members and household contacts receive the flu (influenza) shot every year. The flu v accine is the best way to prevent the flu. The clinic offers the flu vaccine at no charge to family and household contacts. If your family or household contacts opt to receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (Flumist\u00ae), avoid contact with that person for five days as the nasal spray vaccine contains a weakened live flu virus that could spread to you. Recent outbreaks of pertussis have been seen throughout the US, including Washington State. Due to the risk of pertussis (also known as whooping cough) in transp lant pa tients, make sure that your family, caregivers and visitors check with their physician to see if they are up to date on this vaccine (also known as Tdap - tetanus/ diphtheria /acellular pertussis). Be sure to notify your team if you have been expose d to an infection, if your caregiver or family member is ill, or if they have recently been diagnosed with an infection. How does the clinic work to prevent infections? Infection prevention is a very high priority at the clinic and a cornerstone of preve nting major post -transplant complications. All infections cannot be avoided, but here are some of the steps taken to ensure that you receive care in a safe environment: All staff cleans their hands whil e performing patient care. If you would like to confir m that the staff caring for you has cleaned their hands, we encourage you to ask them. Staff know that we all need to work together to prevent infections. By asking, you are helping us maintain a high s tandard of care. In the clinic, isolation precautions are used as a way of stopping the spread of germs from one person to another. You may be placed on isolation if you have an infection that can be transmitted or harmful to other people. 65 If you are in isolation, staff will take extra precautions to ensure that those germs do not spread. Staff may place you in an exam room right away, clean their hands more often, and wear protective equipment, like gowns, gloves, and masks. If you are in isolation, make sure to remind staff when you arrive at clinic or are admitted to the hospital. We take cold and flu season very seriously. When you check -in for your clinic appointments, at certain times of the year you and your family/caregiver may be asked if you hav e cold or flu symptoms like a cough or runny nose. If you do not have symptoms of cold or flu, you will be given a sticker to wear that indicates that you have been screened. If you have symptoms, you will be given a mask to wear and you will be placed in isolation to prevent the spread of cold and flu viruse s. You may notice patients wearing masks. Patients with cold and flu symptoms are encouraged to wear a mask while walking through the clinic. This helps to prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses. If you have cold or flu symptoms, it is especially impo rtant that you avoid riding any of the shuttles. Even if you think it may be only allergies, let your team know and your nurse will give you taxicab vouchers to use until your cold and flu symptoms go a way. The flu vaccine is provided in the clinic at no charge to caregivers and household members of transplant patients. Information about flu vaccine clinics are posted starting in October each year References Preventing Infections in Cancer Patients.

To avoid getting dizzy, move slowly when getting up from a lying position. Sit up for several minutes before standing. Information adapted from: Pharmacia and Upjohn Company 67 Anxiety Just the facts It is very common for a person to feel anxious when facing a new or stressful situation. We all feel worried at times in our day -to-day lives. You may experience anxiety as nervousness, tension, panic, fear, or feeling like something bad is going to happen. Anxiety can also be experienced as physical symptoms such as upset stomach, sweaty palms, fast heartbeat, shaking or flushed face. Although it is normal to feel anxious when facing a life -threatening illness and intensive treatment, there are things that may help decrease the feelings of anxiety. The goal is to reduce anxiety, not eliminate all anxiety. Your goals Learn how to cope with anxiety. Get professional help whe n needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurs e during clinic hours today. Feelings of dread and apprehension for several days. Physical symptoms such as sweaty palms, shaking, rapid heartbeat, etc. Keep in mind that these symptoms can be side effects of treatment. Wide mood swings that you cannot con trol. What you can do at home Learn how to cope with anxiety. Recognize that anxiety during treatment is normal and so is getting help for it. Try to understand what thoughts a re triggering the anxiety. For example, if you are anxious about a medical pro cedure, ask yourself what it is about the procedure that is upsetting. Staff may be able to assist and help you find ways to cope with your anxiety. Getting the facts can help. For example, if you are worried about pain or discomfort, there is information available on how to manage symptoms and side effects. Thinking about doing things that are pleasant and relaxing can help reduce anxiety. Relaxation is a skill that can be used to counteract anxiety. Get professional help when needed If anxiety doesn't improve despite your efforts to reduce it, discuss it w ith your physician, nurse or social worker 68 Bleeding Just the facts Chemotherapy slows the production of platelets. Platel ets help the blood to clot and stop flowing if there is an injury. Bleeding problems can be triggered by certain medications, injurie s, vigorous exercise, or deep massage when your platelet count is low. Your goals Prevent bleeding. Control bleeding if i t starts. Call for professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: Uncontrolled, constant bleeding. Patient is unconscious. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the c linic or the after -hours c linic now if: New or increased bleeding or bruising. Bloody urine. Little red or purple spots on the skin Unable to stop nosebleed Bloody diarrhea. Vomiting of blood. Patient falls or is injured. One or more feminine pads per hour are used. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. Little red or purple spots on the skin or in the mouth. New bruising. What you can do at home Prevent bleeding: Do not take over -the-counter medications without first consulting your physician, nurse or pharmacist. Certain medications can increase your risk of bleeding. Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (Aleve\u00ae), Alka -Seltzer\u00ae, or cold remedies containing these drugs. Talk to your physician or nurse before taking any over -the-counter medications. T his is only a partial list of medications that can affect your platelets. Take blood pressure medications as ordered; high blood pressure can trigger bleeding. Use a soft bristle toothbrush. Do not use razorblades; use electric razors for shaving. Use caut ion to avoid falls. No vigorous exercise; follow activity guidelines from physical therapist or physician. 69 Do not engage in deep massage. Do not blow nose hard or scratch inside of nose. Women who are menstruating should use pads, not tampons. Women are no t to resume sexual intercourse if they have experienced breakthrough bleeding (any vaginal bleeding) within 2 weeks. No anal sex until platelets are stable. No rectal insertion of suppositories, enemas, or thermometers. Control bleeding if it starts Apply pressure to the bleeding site. For example, for a nosebleed, press the nostrils together firmly with the f ingers. Or wrap ice in a soft cloth and press it firmly against the nostrils. Hold pressure on bleeding site for a full 5 minutes before checking to see if bleeding has stopped. Remain calm. Call for professional help when needed If a nosebleed doesn't st op after 30 minutes of applying pressure, contact the SCCA clinic, SCCA Hospital, or UWMC. When transporting a patient with a bleeding problem, keep pressure on the bleeding site. Keep the patient quiet and minimize activity. 70 Body i mage changes Just the facts Treatment can affect your body and your life in ways that may be hard on your self -esteem. Weight loss or gain, loss of stamina, skin reaction s, and puffy face \u2014all of these can be distressing if you think of your body as being who you are. Fortunate ly, most of the side effects of therapy, which affect appearance and stamina, are temporary. The first step in coping with body changes is to direc t your energy and thoughts toward what you can and will do for yourself. Paying attention to skin care, diet, exercise, and positive attitudes are healthy ways to cope with body image changes. Finding w ays to express your feelings about the changes is very important. Your goals Maintain a confident and positive self -image. Take care of skin. Build stamina with exercise. Wear attractive and comfortable clothing. Get professional help if needed. Import ant signs and symptoms: Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. Feeling very sad most of the day, very angry, or losing interest in life because of body changes. Not taking care of self (not exercising, dressing, or caring for sk in). What you can do at home Maintain a confident and positive self -image. Express your feelings to trusted family members, friends, physician, nurse, or social worker. Talk with other people who have had similar treatment about what they did and how they coped with changes in body image. List your best poin ts, and then list your options on how you would like to try to maintain a good body image. Laugh! Humor is a fine way to cope. Treat yourself to funny movies, TV shows, books, or even people. Consider using a hair alternative Buy or borrow a wig. Most off ices of the American Cancer Society can tell you how to obtain or borrow a wig. Many of them have a \"Wig Bank.\" Use a headwrap. Making headwraps out of scarves is easy. A headwrap can complemen t your looks. The emphasis should be on color and texture rathe r than on complicated tying techniques. The book Beauty and Cancer by Diane Doan Noyes and Peggy Mellody, gives instructions on headwraps, skin care, makeup, clothing, nutrition, and exercise. Try turbans, scarves, hats, or caps. Head coverings protect aga inst drafts, enhance appearance, and help retain body heat. Visit or call the Resource Center to schedule a wig fitting. 71 Wear attractive and comfortable clothing Wear colorful clothing. Chem otherapy and radiation tend to make skin pale, sallow or ruddy. Colors and interesting patterns can decrease the intensity of skin changes. If your face becomes very round or puffy, wear a \"V\" shaped neckline. If you have lost a lot of weight, try a round or oval neckline. Avoid any garment that might puncture or brea k the central intravenous line such as front clasping underwire bras or pins. Soft fabrics drape best over catheters. Take care of skin Select skin care products that you like and are inexpens ive, fragrance -free, hypoallergenic and alcohol - free. Cleanse s kin twice a day. Mild soap and water is the most basic cleanser, especially good for oily skin. Cleansing creams are good for dry and normal skin because of their moisturizing effect. All clean sing products should be applied gently to avoid pulling the del icate surface of your skin. Use caution to avoid bruising the skin. Use a moisturizer to help skin retain its moisture. Avoid hot water. Wear sunscreen or protective clothing when outside. Repo rt any skin changes such as rash or inflammation to the physici an or nurse. Build stamina with exercise Exercise daily. Exercise is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce stress, increase stamina, and impart a feeling of well-being. Begin slowly with low intensity exercise, such as walking. Your body w ill tell you what your limits are. A good rule of thumb is you should never be out of breath. You should be able to talk while exercising. Get professional help Talk with y our physician, nurse, or social worker for a referral to a counselor. 72 Breathin g problems Just the facts Difficulty breathing may occur during your treatment. Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, and cough. A number of things can cause breathin g problems: infection in the lungs, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding. The most comm on cause is infection. Do everything you can to prevent irritation and infection in the lungs. Exercise and breathing clean air helps the lungs function optimally. Your goal s Keep your lungs healthy. Call for professional help when needed. Emergency sign s and symptoms Call 911 immediately if you are: Unable to breathe Choking/not able to move air Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if: Trouble breathing/shortness of breath Gets \"winded\" more easily with normal activit y Feeling as if you can't get enough air. Troubled breathing when lying flat. Wheezing with breaths . New or recurrent coug h. Uncontrollable or continuous cough. Tightness or wheezing with each breath. Coughing blood or green/yellow sputum. Important sign s and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today: New or recurrent cough. Gets \"winded\" mor e easily with minimal activity. What you can do at home Keep lungs healthy: Do not smoke or be around smoke. Exercise daily. This h elps expand the lungs and improves oxygen exchange and blood flow. Sitting in an upright position allows the lungs expand and exchange oxygen better. For example, during the day, sitting is better than lying flat. Standing up and moving really let the lung s expand. Avoid wearing any clothing that restricts breathing. Avoid contact with any person who has signs of respi ratory infection (cold, fever, sneezing, runny nose, etc.). Call for professional help when needed Call for help right away when you have a problem with breathing. The sooner treatment can be started, the more likely the treatment will work. 73 Change and u ncertainty Just the facts The treatment process is one filled with changes and uncertainty. When will this be done or how can I plan ahead? Answers to these questions are difficult because each patient responds differently to treatment. Complications are hard to predict. You can learn to adapt by taking it day by day. Your goals Adapt to change. Cope with uncertainty. Important signs and sy mptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today: Having feelings of dread and apprehension for several days. Physical symptoms such as sweaty palms, shaking, rapid heartbeat, and so on. Keep in mind that these symptoms can also be caused by side effects of treatment. Wide mood swings that you cannot control. What you can do at home Adapt to change: Identify the change that is taking place and any options you have. Discuss these changes with family and staff. Ask staff for explanati ons. Keep track of questions and information in a notebook. Cope with uncertainty When planning for t he future, limit the time span as much as possible. If plans need to be made, consider alternative plans. Talk about your hopes and disappointments with someone who listens. 74 Constipation Just the facts It is common for a person with cancer to develop constipation, especially when opioids (narcotics) are being used. Bowel movements can become infrequent, hard , and small in volume. It is important to avoi d letting this become a problem. Constipation can develop because of inactivity, some pain m edications, changes in the body, lack of fluids/fiber , and depression. Excessive use of laxatives can make the colon less sensitive to its natural reflexes, so alw ays discuss use of laxatives with your physician or nurse. Your goals Prevent constipation a nd recognize symptoms early. Get professional help when needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today: Distended abdomen and/or abdominal pain. No bowel movement for more than 2 to 3 days. Dizziness and/or confusion. Back pain. Leaking stool. Fever. No bowel movements with nausea and vomiting. What you can do at home Preventing constipation: Drink plenty of fluids. Try to drink at least 8 cups of liquid daily. Drinking hot water upon rising in the morning can stimulate the bowels. Eat food that is high in fiber when possible. Fiber includes: fruits, figs, dates, prunes or prune juice, vegetables, and grains. Ask your nurse if you would like a consultation with the dietitian. If you are taking pain medication, ask your physician or nurse about the use of laxatives and stool softeners. Keep as physically active as possible. Ask your physician or nurse if you need a laxative. 75 Dehydration Just the facts Dehydration means there is not enough fluid in your body. It occurs when you don't have enough fluid intake or have excessive fluid loss from diarrhea, vomiting, fevers and /or sweating. Your body does not funct ion well without enough fluid. Dehydration can cause complications such as increased weakness, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, and confusion. Your goals Fluid intake. Call for professional help when needed. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the a fter-hours clinic immediately if: Dizzy or lig htheaded. Fainting. Confused. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. Decreased urination, dark urine, strong smelling urine. Increased weakness. Decreas e in eating and drinking. New or increased vomiting. What you can do at home Drink fluids . Call your team i f you detect early signs of dehydration ; you may be able to correct the problem by drinking more. Limit caffeinated beverages such as: coffee, cola, diet cola, hot or iced tea, and hot chocolate. Check with your dietitian or nurse for goals or restrictions. Get professional help when needed Monitor for signs of dehydration such as decreased amounts of urine and dark urine. Report symptoms to the phys ician or nurse promptly. 76 Depress ion Just the facts Dealing with a life -threatening illness causes a roller coaster of emotions. Most patients experience feelings such as helplessness, despair, and sadness during treatment. Symptoms of depression can also include loss of appetite, change s in sleep patterns, lack of energy, and inability to focus. If you have had symptoms of depression or have been on anti -depressants before in your life, be sure to inform the physician, nurse, or social worker. Your goals Acknowledge that it is normal to have feelings of sadness at times. Allow yourself to feel sad at times. Identify when you need help with depression. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. Feeling sad most of the time for several days. Feelings interfere with your ability to care for yourself. You have thoughts about hurting yourself. Mood swings that you cannot control. What you can do at home Allow yourself to feel sad at times. Talk about these feelings with someone who listens (family member, volunteer). Talk with other patients in your situation (ambulatory support groups, phone contact, Internet). Use spiritual resources. Get professional help when needed Psychiatrist and psychologists can pr ovide: Evaluation of cause of depression (sometimes medications can cause depression). Medication to manage depression. Counseling. Ask your physician, nurse, or social worker for a referral. 77 Diarrhea Just the facts Diarrhea is frequent bowel movements with t he stools having a more or less fluid consistency. Diarrhea is caused by chemotherapy, radiation, medications , and sometimes emotional distress. It is important to report diarrhea because it can lead to dehydration and loss of electrolytes. It is no t alway s possible to prevent diarrhea. Your goals Prevent dehydration. Prevent infection. Call for professional help when needed. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if you are experiencing: Constant or uncontrolled di arrhea. New onset of diarrhea. Fever and abdominal stomach cramping. Whole pills passed in stool. More than 5 bowel movements a day. Stool that is bloody, burgundy, or black. Abdominal cramping. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today: New onset of diarrhea. Diarrhea more than 5 times a day. Mild abdominal stomach cramping. Whole pills passed in the stool. What you can do at home Prevent dehydration: Drink fluids (in suggested amounts). Follow dietary recommendations. Note any food allergies or intolerances and discuss with the physician, nurse or dietitian. Prevent infection and irritation. Wash hands often with soap and warm water. Keep anal area clean with mild soap and water. Do not use o intment or creams on the anal area unless directed by the nurse/physician. Use white, non -perfumed toilet paper. Call for professional help when needed Describe the type of diarrhea to health care staff by including frequency, consistency, color, and presence of cr amping. 78 Exercise and blood value precautions Sometimes it is not safe to exercise during cancer treatment, especially if you have a blood cancer. Your blood values for platelets (called platelet count), h ematocrit, and hemoglobin tell us what type of exe rcise is safe for you. The charts below explain exercise guidelines you should follow based on the range of your blood tests . Exercise guidelines based on platelet counts Platelets are a type of cell found in your blood that help your bloo d clot. Platele t count range Exercise guideline 50,000 - 100,000 Cardiovascular exercises and strength training with weights/elastic tubing are okay. Do not exercise if you have any signs of bleeding (i.e. from the nose). Contact your care team if you have any signs o f bleeding. 20,000 - 49,999 If you have no signs of bleeding , cardiovascular exercise and strength training with weights/elastic tubing are OK as long as you are not straining or holding your breath. Straining can increase your blood pressure and risk for stroke or major bleeding. Talk to your physician before getting a massage. Gentle comfort massage is typically okay as long as your skin is not fragil e or prone to easy bruising for other reasons (such as chronic steroid medications). Deep tissue massage is not okay. Less than 20,000 You may have an increased risk of bleeding with certain types of exercise The bleeding could become serious and even life threatening. Do not do any intense cardiovascular exercise (power walking, running, cycling, danci ng, etc.) or strength training with weights or elastic tubes. 10,000 - 19,999 Strength training without weights/elastic tubing or strain, and cardiovascular exercise without strain are OK if you are steady on your feet and have no signs of bleeding. Less than 10,000 Do not do any cardiovascular exercise and strength training until your platelets are in a s afe range. You may walk around your room and go to the bathroom with help from a caregiver if you are steady on your feet and have no sign of bleeding . Exercise guidelines based on hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb ) Hct is the number of red blood cells in your body. Hgb is the amount of oxygen your blood can carry . Exercising when your Hct and Hgb are too low may cause shortness of breath, muscle fatigue, or dizziness. Hct/Hgb range Exercise guideline Hct less than 25% Hgb less than 8.0 Talk to your doctor, physical therapist, or occupational therapist about what type of exercise is safe for you. They may recommend restrictions in strength trainin g or cardiovascular exercise. When your Hct or Hgb are below these ranges, you may need a red blood cell transfusion. It can be difficult to predict how much a transfusion will increase the level of Hct and Hgb, so a follow -up blood count is recommended. 79 Fall prevention Just the facts You may be at risk for falls because of: Different environments than you are used to. Medications that make you tired, dizzy, or confused. Weak muscles from taking steroid medications. Low red blood cells or a low blood pressure that could make you dizzy. If you have a history of confusion with any medications for nausea or pain control let your physician or nurse know. We want to prevent falls both in the clinic and at home. Review this information with family members and friends who are part of the team to k eep you safe. Your goals Prevent injury. Prevent permanent disability. Prevent death. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately at home if: You fell and are bleeding. Any loss of consciousness occurs or you experience any loss of consciousness. You think you have a broken bone. You have fallen and hit your head, have low platelets, and/or are on anti -coagulant medications. Do not attempt to get up alone, because you might hurt yourself. Important sign s and symptoms Report sympt oms to your physician or nurse during clinic hours today: If you have fallen, even if you think that nothing is wrong. What you can do at the clinic Wear safe shoes! This is one of the most important things you can do to prevent falls while you are here. Our floors can be very slippery.

Fatigue is a daily lack of energy, an unusual or excessive whole body tiredness not relieved by sleep. There are a number of possible causes for fatigue: the intensive treatments, medicat ions, a lower than normal number of circulating red blo od cells, stress, decreased nutrition, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, taste changes, heart burn, diarrhea, disruption of normal resting and sleep habits, or feelings of depression. It usually takes tim e to work out ways to live with fatigue. Your goals Establish regular rest and sleep periods. Conserve energy. Get professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: If you are the caregiver and cannot wake your patient. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if: Dizzy. Too tired to get out of bed or walk to the bathroom. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. Fatigue is getting worse. Staying in bed all day. Other symptoms occur with i ncreased fatigue. Increased weakness or exhaustion. Drowsiness or confusion. Loss of balance. Catching your breath. What you can do at home Establish regular rest and sleep periods. Set up a regular daily schedule for nap and sleep times. Keep active duri ng the day to sleep better at night. Play soft music, put on the TV as a background sound, engage in meditation or prayer, or ask a nurse or family member for a back rub to help you sleep or rest. Keep a diary for one week to monitor fatigue levels. Note w hat you think may be contributing factors 82 Conserve energy Rest between bathing, treatments, and exercise. Do things or be active only for a short time. Plan activities such as exercise, vis its, or trips when feeling the most rested and energetic. Decide o n the most important activities for the day. Be realistic. Regular exercise helps reduce fatigue; it sounds contradictory, but it helps. Eat snacks between meals to keep up energy. Plan ahead and organize your work. 83 Fever Just the facts A fever and chill s are signs of possible infection. A patient is very vulnerable to infection after chemotherapy, radiation, or while on immunosuppressive medications, and when blood counts are low. Act promptly when a fever occurs because the patient cannot fight infectio n when his/her number of white blood cells is low. Your goals Monitor the patient's temperature. Call for professional help when the patient has a fever. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the c linic or the after -hours c linic now if: Temperature taken by mou th between 38 to 38.2C (100.4 to 100.8F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 38.3 C (100.9F) or above. Temperature t aken under the arm between 37.5 to 37.7C (99.5 to 99.9F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 37.8 C (100F) or ab ove. Chills or s haking chills , with or without a fever . Cold symptoms (runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing, coughing). Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today: Any new redness or swelling on the skin or at an intravenous (IV) site. Cold symptoms (runny nose, stuffy nose, watery eyes, sneezing, coughing). New abdominal or back pain. Toothache. Cloudy or foul -smelling urine. Pain with going to the bathroom. Sinus pain. What you can do at home Monitor the patient's temperature. Take the patient's temperature twice a day, morning and evening. Take oral (mouth) or axillary (under the arm) temperatures only. Do not take rectal temperature as the thermometer may injure membranes inside the rectum. Keep a reco rd of the patient's temperature. Use the thermometer for the patient only. If using a glass thermometer, wash the ther mometer after each use with warm (not hot) water and soap. Get professional help when the patient has a fever Always check with the clini c before trying measures to bring down a fever. Do not give Tylenol\u00ae (unless directed by the physician or nurse). When transporting a patient with chills to the c linic or the after -hours c linic, keep the patient warm and comfortable. 84 Where to take temper ature The best way to take a temperature is to place the thermometer into the mouth under the tongue in the sublingual pockets. The s ublingual pockets are in the lower jaw, under the tongue (see image below). If you have any questions, please ask your phys ician or nurse. 85 Fever and Temperature Conversion Chart Note: Do not take Tylenol\u00ae unless instructed by your care team. Call for chills or shaking chills, with or without a fever. \u00b0F \u00b0C Directions for oral temperature (taken by 96.8 to 99.2\u00b0F (36.0 to 37.3 \u00b0C) This is the normal temperature range. Call for chills or shaking chills. 97.8 36.6 98.0 36.7 \u00b0C) Re-check in 30 to 60 minutes for a temperature in this range. Call for chills or shaking chills. 99.6 37.6 99.8 37.7 100.0 37.8 38.2\u00b0C) Call when temper ature in this range continues for 1 hour or longer. Call for chills or shaking chills. 100.6 38.1 100.8 38.2 100.9 38.3 Greater than or equal to 100.9 \u00b0F (38.3 \u00b0C) Call when temperature is this high or higher. 101.0 38.3 101.2 38.4 101.4 40.0 And above 86 Hand -foot syndrome Just the facts Hand -foot s yndrome (HFS) is a side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. HFS symptoms may be caused by the breakdown of chemic als that are used in chemotherapy. HFS is a skin reaction which often affects hands and feet, although it can also affect other areas where there is increased pressure or war mth (like the buttocks, groin, armpits , or under the breasts). Your goals Avoid ti ght fitting shoes or gloves. Control skin irritations with moisturizers and avoid activities that can make HFS worse. Call for professional help when needed, especially if pa in becomes a problem. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today: Palms or soles of the feet are red or tender. Skin of palms and soles peeling. Numbness, burning, or tingling sensation. What you can do at home Prevent dryness and irritation: Before treatment, a pedicure is suggested if you have preexisting buildup of hard skin and calluses on your feet. Apply moisturizer to your hands and feet frequently , especially in the creases. to wool), Aveeno\u00ae cream, Eucerin\u00ae cream, and Lubriderm\u00ae. Avoid heat. Bathe or shower in lukewarm water. Soak hands/feet in basins of cold water for 15 minutes 3 to 4 times pe r day when possible. Take cool baths and put gel ice packs on affected areas. Avoid activities that cause irritation due to even slight rubbing or pressure on the skin. For example, vigorous washing, gripping tools, typing, driving, or playing musical ins truments. Do not apply any adhesives or dressings such as Band -Aids, since adhesive will irritate skin further. Sit or lie on padded surfaces of chairs or mattresses. Raise legs whenever possible with cushions. Place a pillow between knees or wear pajamas if rubbing of legs occur during sleep. Avoid any unnecessary and vigorous exercise. Wear loose fitting clothing and shoes with comfortable soles. Do not walk barefoot. Alleviate symptoms if they start Place palms or bottoms of feet on an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas to provide temporary relief from pain and tenderness. Alternate on a nd off for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. You may u se gel insoles that can be co oled before insertion in shoes. Apply moisturizing cream of choice after the area has been cooled for maximum comfort. If your physician suggests a steroid cream, apply it after t he skin has been cooled and apply moisturizer over the top of the steroid cream for maximum effectiveness. If blistering and ulceration starts, apply gentle moisturizers on your hands and feet and contact your physician or nurse, who may suggest further th erapies. 87 Talk with your nurse about how to c hange your activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, etc.) if the HFS is severe. Contact your physician regarding other over the counter or prescription options to relieve symptoms of hand -foot syndrome. 88 Memory and concentration Just the facts Chan ges in memory and concentration are common throughout treatment. The changes may be temporary. Your memory and concentration may improve as your treatment is completed and when you star t feeling better. Many fac tors a ffect memory. Memory and concentratio n problems may be situational and vary from day to day due to stress, pain, medications, menopause, anxiety, aging, depression, and fatigue. Since you may have good and bad days, you may want to use routine stra tegies to assist you when you are having a ba d day. It can be a frustrating and taxing problem. Your goals Learn how to cope with changes in memory and concentration. Get professional help when needed. Neuropsychologists evaluate memory. Ask your physici an to make sure that your medications are not causing the problem. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if: Disoriented. Confused . Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hour s today: Forgetting things more quickly and more often than usual. Harder to read more than a paragraph or a page at a time. Hard to keep your mind from wandering. What you can do at home Learn how to cope with changes in memory and concentration: Write d own important information. Keep these notes on a notepad that is small enough to keep with you at all times. Establish consistent daily routines. Have regular sleep time and eat nutritious snacks and meals. Manage your stress. Keep distractions to a minim um. Ask people to repeat things. Keep a list of questions for your physician. Write the answers down. Tape record important conversations or conferences. Get important information in writing. Ask people to write it down for you. Place notes around the hous e to remind you of things. Keep an appointment calendar and one central memory book. Use a device to remind you to take your medications such as a watch or cell phone timer that can be programmed to go off at times when medications need to be taken. Keep things in a designated place, (f or example: always keep your keys in the same place). 89 Be understanding and patient with yourself and know that these temporary changes are to be expected. Ask your physician to review your medications. How can I keep my mi nd active? Below is a list of resources you might want to utilize to enhance your cognitive abilities. Although age takes its toll on most everyone in this area, there are things you can do to regain some of your mental plasticity and prevent any further decline in your cognitive faculties. Puzzle books : Crossword puzzles are known to improve mental skills. Sudoku : Similar to a crossword puzzle, but with numbers instead. Card games : o Start with a shuffled deck of cards and a stopwatch. Sort the cards into separate piles, one for each suit (diamonds, clubs, spades, hearts). Do this three times daily. A typical young adult can do this in 35 seconds. Keep practicing this task until you can do it in that amount of time! o Play and l earn other card games such as b ridge, rummy, pinochle, canasta, cribbage, black jack, or solitaire. Games : Play stimulating games such as chess, checkers, Scrabble\u00ae, and any other games you enjoy. If you or your child has a Nintendo\u00ae, try the game Brain Ag e, developed by neuroscience re searchers to improve mental abilities and hand/eye coordination. Hobbies : Learn a new skill such as knitting or crocheting, or a new sport. Try writing and brushing your teeth with the opposite hand than you usually do. Conversation : Enjoy a conversation with a friend and discuss world events. Languages : Learn a new language. Rosetta Stone\u00ae has CDs that you can purchase in various languages. Read books : Join a book club, or attend a book reading. A couple of suggestions incl ude: o The Better Brain Book by D avid Perlmutter and Carol Colman o Whole Brain Thinking by Jacquelyn Wonder and Priscilla Donovan o Carved in Sand by Cathryn Jakobson Ramin (the story of her struggle with early onset memory loss). Website suggestion : www.posits cience.com/ is a website where you can try out a couple of the exercises from their Brain Fitness Program. This program has been used to help veterans with traumatic brain injuries recover some of their capabilities. Get professional help when needed If problems persist or affect day -to-day living to a large degree, discuss the symptoms with your physician or nurse. Ask your physician or nurse about a neuropsychological referral and neuro -rehabilitation treatment. 90 Mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes) Just the facts Mucositis a nd mouth pain are common physical problems for chemotherapy and radiation patients. Chemotherapy and radiation lead to inflammation of cells of the tongue, lips, mouth, throat and gastrointestinal tract. Saliva usually becomes thicker and more mucous -like. Mouth sores or bleeding in the mouth may occur also. The experience varies from mild discomfort to severe pain, which makes eating, drinking and sleeping difficult. Your ability to fight infection is temporari ly reduced by the therapy (chemotherapy and/o r radiation). The inflamed mouth is a possible site of infection. Swelling may make it hard to swallow. If swelling is severe it may become hard to breathe. Your goals Call for professional help when needed. Prevent infection. Control pain. Maintain nutri tion and fluid intake. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: Not breathing Severe difficulty breathing. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic now if: Having difficulty breathing. Bright red in the mouth. Pain not controlled by medicat ion. White patches or sores appear on gums or mouth. Difficulty swallowing food or fluid. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. White patches or sores appear on gums or mouth. Start to have difficu lty eating or drinking. Increased sensitivity to foods or significant dryness. What you can do at home Prevent infection and irritation: Rinse mouth often with salt -water solution every 1 to 2 hours. Rec ipe: 1 quart water, \u00bd to \u00be level teaspoon salt. If t he salt solution causes stinging or burning this may be relieved by diluting it or adding 1-2 teaspoons of baking soda. Rinsing with salt/soda solutions may also help reduce thickened secretions and shoul d be done before eating, drinking or taking medicati ons by mouth. Spit secretions out often and especially before eating, drinking or taking medications by mouth. 91 Brush teeth twice a day with a very soft bristle toothbrush as long as you are able. If it b ecomes too painful or significant bleeding occurs, a child's toothbrush or toothettes (sponge brushes) can be substituted. Resume using your normal toothbrush as soon as possible as it is more effective at keeping the bacteria under control and causes less trauma. Continue to floss daily as long as it is co mfortable and no significant bleeding occurs. Avoid using commercial mouthwashes. Many contain alcohol or peroxide, which can dry and irritate your gums and the tissue in your mouth. Control pain: Topica l anesthetics such as Lidocaine viscous gel can be u sed to help control pain. They can be used as a rinse or applied directly to localized areas of soreness. These are prescribed by the physician. They are jelly -like liquids which numb the mouth. These g els can be used full strength or diluted 1:1 or 1:2 if they cause stinging or burning. Fill a small container such as a medicine cup with the solution. Take a small amount (5 to 10 ml) and swish and hold the solution in the mouth for 15 to 30 seconds. Rep eat sequence until you have used the entire volume o f the cup. Repeat as often as needed. Do not swallow the solution. For single or small areas, try applying the gel with a cotton tip applicator or gauze square once for 15 to 30 seconds then reapply in 30 to 60 second intervals for a total of 3 to 5 minu tes. Use the gel at least 15 minutes before or after eating. When used right, the medicine may provide 30 to 45 minutes of pain relief. Take pain medication as instructed. Tell the physician or nurse if pain medication does not seem to be controlling you r pain. For chapped lips apply lanolin creams, Chapstick\u00ae or Blistex\u00ae and lip balms which contain lanolin. Place ice packs on painful areas such as cheeks, lips or throat for 10 to 15 minutes every 2 hours. Avoid pretzels, chips, tomato juice, and orange j uice or hot drinks. All oral rinses can be kept in the refrigerator or placed in an ice bath. This can be soothing, help to reduce swelling or control bleeding. Maintain adequate nutrition and fluid intake: Warm fluids: soups , chicken or vegetable broth, t ea Cool fluids: smoothies, shakes, iced tea, diluted juices 92 Nausea and vomiting Just the facts Many patients experience nausea and vomiting at some time during the treatment process. It is one of the side effects of the chemotherapy and radiation. Contr ary to what most people think, nausea and vomiting have little to do with your stomach. They are actions controlled by certain centers in your brain and are involuntary. Willpower alone cannot stop n ausea and vomiting. A number of things can trigger nause a and vomiting: Chemotherapy agents Radiation Persistent pain Poor kidney and liver function Medications such as some narcotics Infections of the gastrointestinal tract Electrolyte disturbances Graft -versus -host disease Thankfully, just as medicine has ad vanced against cancer, great progress has been made in preventing and treating nausea and vomiting. Some patients have little or no nausea and vomiting and keep eating during most o f the treatment process. Anti -nausea (antiemetic) medications are often sta rted before radiation and chemotherapy and then continued on a regular schedule. Even if you do not feel nauseated, you should take the medicine. The fact that you have not vomited means that the medicine is working. Many antiemetics can make you feel tire d or sleepy. Some people will feel jittery and restless. Your goals Take anti -nausea medicines. Maintain nutrition and fluid intake. Call for professional help when needed. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if: Havi ng uncontrolled (constant) nausea and vomiting. Blood or \"coffee ground\" appearing material in the vomit. Medicine not kept down because of vomiting. Weakness or dizziness, along wi th nausea/vomiting. Severe stomach pain while vomiting. Important signs an d symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today if: Nausea persists without control from anti -nausea medications. Projectile vomiting. 93 What you can do at home Prevent nausea and vomiting or manage symptoms well: Take your ant i-nausea medicine as instructed before nausea starts. Before chemotherapy, lie down in a quiet place for 15 to 20 minutes and relax. Wear loose fitting clothes. Use distraction, relaxation, or deep -breathing techniques such as tapes, visualization, or hyp nosis techniques. Try breathing through your mouth. Keep your mouth clean. Rinse with water often. Rest in a chair after eating, keeping head elevated. Take anti -nausea medicatio ns Some anti -nausea medicines can cause drowsiness or sleepiness. Do not driv e a car or operate any dangerous equipment while you are taking them. Do not drink alcohol while taking anti -nausea medicines. Because anti -nausea medicines can make you drowsy, i t is advisable to have your caregiver stay with you throughout this treatment period. Maintain nutrition and fluid intake Eat small meals during the day so your stomach is not too full. Eat and drink slowly so only small amounts enter your stomach at one time. Avoid eating and drinking one hour before and one hour after chemothera py. Stay away from sweet, fatty, or fried foods. Drink cool, clear fruit juices. Eat dry foods like toast or crackers to help ease nausea. Avoid odors that bother you. If foo d smells make you sick, avoid being in the kitchen when food is being prepared. Avoid food served at extreme temperatures. Keep a wide choice of food available. Call for professional help when needed If you notice that the anti -nausea medicine does not se em to control your nausea, call your physician or nurse. Additional medications m ay be used to better control your nausea. If the medicines seem to make you nervous, jittery, or cause any unusual sensations, let your physician or nurse know. Do not increa se the amount of medicine you take without checking with the physician, nurse, or pharmacist. Do not take any over -the-counter medicines without checking first with your physician or nurse. 94 Pain Just the facts You may experience pain during the course o f your illness. Most pain can easily be treated with pain medication and/or other treatments. Your oncologist and nurse will assist you to find the best possible way to control your pain. On occasion your physician may ask a physician who specializes in ca ncer pain management to manage your pain. Pain is an unpleasant sensation that only you can feel. It is what you say it is. A change or increase in pain does not necessarily indicate that your cancer has returned or is progressing. Pain may be caused by a number of things including cancer, treatment of the cancer, or a medical problem not related to the cancer diagnosis. Myths about narcotics/opioids: Some people will think they will become addicted. Research has shown that this is not true. If you use your pain medication the way your physician prescribes it, it is very rare for you to become addicted. Some patients do not want narcotics because they fear the side -effects. Nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, constipation, and itching are common side effects, but these can easily be managed by changing your medication or adding other treatme nts. Patient rights and responsibilities As a patient of SCCA, you have the right to: Information about pain and pain management. Have your pain treated promptly. Have phys icians and nurses who believe your report of pain. As healthc are providers, we exp ect you to Describe and rate your pain. Ask about pain management. Discuss options with your physician or nurse. Ask for pain relief when you first experience pain. Inform u s if pain treatment is not working. Help us develop a treatment plan for you. Your goals Report your pain. Rate your pain. Keep track of what triggers it and what makes it better. Have pain treated promptly. Maintain optimal level of physical activity. Assessment of your pain Your physician or nurse will ask you to \"rate\" your pain usi ng a simple method. Remember, only you know what and where your pain is, and you need to help us help you. 95 Your physician or nurse will ask you to \"point\" to th e area of your pain. They will also ask you the following questions: What will cause the pain ? What do you think will get rid of the pain? What is the quality of your pain (burning, radiating, throbbing, or stabbing) ? It is the staff's goal to provide y ou with the best possible treatment of your pain. We ask that you help us do so by telling us a bout your pain when you first experience it. How can we treat your pain? Your pain can be treated/managed in many different ways. Your physician may choose to p rescribe Tylenol\u00ae, ibuprofen, or narcotics/opioids such as morphine. Sometimes he/she may choos e to use a local anesthetic. The method depends on the location and severity of your pain. Non -drug methods of pain relief Hot or cold packs Massage/therapeutic touch Hypnosis Relaxation and music therapy Pain medication may be given different ways Pills Patch (like a bandage placed on the skin) Intravenous SQ (under the skin) PCA-intravenous (a small computerized pump that lets you control ho w much pain medication you receive) Epidural (a small tube inserted into your back) Some pain medications should be taken on a regular basis (long -acting medication), while others should be taken only when you begin to feel t he pain (break -through medicat ion). Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if you have: Severe chest/arm pain Severe squeezing or pr essure in chest Severe sudden headache Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if you have: New or uncontrolled pain New headache Chest discomfort/heart \"flip -flop\" feeling Pounding heart Painful central line site or area of \"tunnel\" Burning in chest or stomach Strong stomach pain Pain with infusion of medications or fluids into central line 96 What you can do at home Maintain your treatment plan; take medications as ordered. Do not increase your dose of medication without t alking to your nurse or physician. Keep a pain journal. Use hot or cold packs. Find a relaxation technique that works for you such as meditation, guided imagery, hypnosis, massage, or therapeutic touch. Listen to relaxing music. Taking care of your pain wi ll help you sleep better, feel stronger , and be better able to cop e with your illness. Continue activities that are meaningful to you. These activities may help you notice less pain or discomfort. Before taking pain medication or opioids, ask your nurse or physician about ways to prevent constipation. 97 Peripheral neuropa thy Just the facts Peripheral neuropathy is damage to nerves that can span from your fingers to your toes. Peripheral means nerves beyond the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral nerves take i nformation to the muscles, organs, skin, and joints and then take information back to the brain. \"Neuro\" means nerves. \"Pathy\" means abnormal. When this occurs it can cause pain and numbness, or a sensation that is similar to burning or tingling. In many c ases symptoms improve with time. There are many different causes. Some chemotherapy medications can cause this problem. Other causes include: traumatic injury, medical illnesses such as diabetes, infectious conditions, and toxic compounds. Your goals Mon itor onset of symptoms. Protect your hands and feet. Get professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: You are the caregiver and cannot wake your patient. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hour s clinic now if: You are unable to move your legs. You have fallen. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today. Change in sensation symptoms: numbness, tingling, tremor, burning, loss of sensation, gait imbalance (unstable walking), sensitivity to touch, wea kness, tiredness and heaviness. Movement s ymptoms: lack of muscle control, falling, muscle twitching, cramping, foot drop, and muscle atrophy. Autonomic s ymptoms: failure of the nerves to work correctl y can result in abnormal blood pressure and digestive p roblems such as nausea, blurred vision, and dizziness. You can meet with a physical therapist if you are having problems with your balance. Ask your team to schedule you for a Physical Therapy appointm ent. Home equipment and/or devices to help you walk independently may be recommended for you if you have mobility problems. Discuss with your physician, nurse, and physical therapist safety measures you should put in place. Avoid extreme temperatures. Peri pheral neuropathy may make areas of your body more sensitive to hot or cold. Wear shoes, slippers, gloves, and other clothing to protect your skin from changes. Use extra care when using hot, sharp, or potentially harmful objects. You may be more at risk for clumsiness and prone to injury if you have reduced sensations. Avoid falls. Review the \"Fall Prevention \" symptom sheet in this manual. If you have sensation changes, you are more at risk for falls. Check your feet eve ry day, looking carefully at the bottom of your feet and toes for any changes. 98 For lack of sensation in your hands: Check temperatures with your inner forearms to avoid burns. Always use protective padding for cooking and rubber gloves for cleaning. Keep finger nails short to avoid te aring. Keep hands moisturized to avoid skin breaks from dryness. Coping with peripheral neuropathy Your physician will try to determine the source of the problem. Ask your physician questions. Let your team know how much t he neuropathy impacts your life. There are techniques for coping with pain and discomfort. In many cases, symptoms improve with time. Websites www.neuropathy.org 99 Sexual health Just the facts Treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery and radiation may cause changes that can affect intimacy and sexuality, including desire and body image. We want to be sure you're prepared for the physical and emotional changes that you may experience during this time. We encourage you to: Your goals Discuss any restrictions and questions with your care team. Keep an open mind about the possibility of needing to adjust to physical and emotional sexual changes that occur; communicate openly with your partner(s). Have a pleasurable experience (free from pain or ri sk). Prev ent infection . If you are sexually active, it is important to prevent infection and pregnancy. Talk to your care team if you experience: Pain, di scomfo rt, or bleeding during or after sex Fear about sexual activity Lack of desire that is affecting your relationship Women: vaginal dryness, discharge, pelvic pain, or menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes or loss of menstrual cycle Men: pain during penetration or ejaculation, abnormal discharge, changes in your ability to get erection s or ejaculate What you can do at home Optimize positive feelings of intimacy : Plan sexual activity for the time of day when you are feeling your best. If you are ta king pain medication, take it at an hour when it will be in full effect during sex. Talk a bout expectations and what might feel good, or what to avoid. Consider other forms of intimacy \u2014holding hands, snuggling, kissing, self-stimulation and talking can happen at any stage of cancer treatment. Find a position or activity th at puts as little pressure as possible on the sensitive or painful areas of your body. Let your partner know if any kinds of touching causes irritation or pain. Use a sexual lubricant to help dry skin areas be slippery. PREGNANCY AND CHEMOTHERAPY Chemotherapy can have harmful effects on pregnancy. If there is a chance you could become pregn ant or father a child while undergoing chemotherapy o r radiation , talk to your care team about birth control. 100 Prevent infection: Wash hands and genitals before and after any type of sexual activity. Use a water -based lubricant to keep the vagina or rectum from becoming irritated. If you have anal sex, use condoms and a water -based lubricant to help prevent infection and tissue irritation. Avoid sexual contact with pe ople who have infectious diseases (colds, flu, cold sores) or sexually transmitted infections. If you are not in an exclusive relationship, use a condom or other barrier protection during sexual activity to reduce the risk of infection. This includes oral , anal, and vaginal sex. Urinate before and after sex. This rinses out bacteria that may cause infection i n the urinary tract. Common questions about sex during chemotherapy Is it safe for me to kiss while I'm receiving chemotherapy or after treatment? To reduce the risk of in fection, avoid k issing anyone who has open mouth sores, cold sores, a cold, the flu, or symptoms of a respiratory infection. When do I need to avoid sexual activity? When platelet counts are less than 50,000. This is due to the ris k for bleeding. When white blood counts are low. Neutrophil (ANC) count should be more than 500 to prevent infection with most sexual activity. An ANC of 1000 or more is needed for anal sex. If there is vaginal or rectal bleeding, sores in the mouth, vagin a, or rectum. When a sexual partner has infectious diseases (colds, flu, cold sores) or sexually tr ansmitted infections. Depending on your treatment, traces of chemotherapy may be present in your body fluids during treatment and for a short period of time after. Your care team may recommend that you avoid sexual activity or use safety precautions (condo m or other barrier protection) during this time. Contact your care team with questions. Why don't I have m uch sexual desire? Lack of desire (also called lack of libido) and fatigue can be a normal response to the stresses of treatment, some medications, and changes in hormone levels . Talking to your partner or a counselor may help, and sometimes hormone replacement can be helpful. Talk to your care team so th ey can help you find what will work for you. Will I be infertile after treatment? Factors that influence fertility include: type and dose of chemotherapy, radiation, and other medications; if you have had a transplant; and, your age at time of treatment . Women often stop having periods but resume their menstrual cycle after treatment; some women resume normal menstrual cycles but are still unable to become pregnant due to damage to eggs in the ovary; still, other women may experience complete menopause. Men often stop making sperm completely or have very low sperm counts duri ng and for several months after cancer treatment. Not every male will resume normal sperm production and may be infertile. Testing of sex hormones, sperm counts, or ovarian function i s needed to see if your fertility is intact. If you're interested in pre serving fertility, talk with your care team before treatment. This gives you the opportunity to store sperm, eggs, or embryos when appropriate. 101 Will I be infertile after treatment? (continued) A fertility specialist (reproductive endocrinologist) can provide more information about your fertility status and the options available to you before and after treatment. Fertility services are not always covered by insurance, but financial ass istance may be available. Don't let fear of cost prevent you from asking what services are possible. What options do I have to store my eggs or sperm? For men , sperm banking is the standard approach. Sperm can be collected several different ways, but the simplest is to provide a sample of ejaculated semen. Sperm can be safely frozen for many years. For women , the standard approach is to collect eggs, which can require hormone therapy and a medical procedure. This process can take up to 2 weeks. Eggs can be frozen individually or fertilized with sperm to create embryos before freezing. Eggs and embryos can be safely frozen for many years. 102 Sexual health resources Brochures and books SCCA's Patient and Family Resource Center on the 3rd floor of the clin ic offers brochures and books that you can check -out.

Problems with sleep are associated with fatigue. Up to 50% of pati ents with cancer have sleep problems. Your goals Prevent insomnia. Call for professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if patient is unconscious. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours number now if: You h ave not slept in days. What you can do at home Promote sleep: Keep a regular schedule. Create a bedtime routine. Use a preferred relaxation technique such as reading, or taking a warm bath or shower. Back rubs or massages may be relaxing. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine before bed. Maintain a healthy diet. Decrease negative associations with bed time. Do not stay in bed when not sleeping. Do not lie in bed while worrying. Do not exercise right before bedtime. Avoid electronic devices b efore sleep such as cell phone, television , and computer. Use the bed for sleep and sex only. Create a peaceful environment in which to sleep by decreasing noise, dimming lights, adjusting room tempe rature, and keeping bedding and pillows clean, dry, and w rinkle -free. Try not to drink fluid before bed and empty bowel and bladder before bedtime. Minimize daytime naps. Listen to relaxation tapes and or peaceful music before bed. Call for professional h elp when needed If you are not sleeping. 104 White b lood cells Just the facts A white blood cell count with differential provides information about your white blood cells. White blood cells help protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses that cause i nfection. It is important to protect yourself against inf ection. When your white blood count is low, your body is more prone to infection. Your goals Recognize signs of infection. Get professional help when needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a physician or nurse during clinic hours today : Shaking or chills. Cough. Temper ature taken by mouth between 38 to 38.2C (100.4 to 100.8F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 38.3 C (100.9F) or above. Temperature taken unde r the arm between 37.5 to 37.7C (99.5 to 99.9F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 37.8 C (100F) or above. Sore throat. A general feeling of tiredness or \"flu -like\" symptoms. Painful or frequent urination. What you can do at home Preventive measures: Look at your mouth and skin for signs of infection. Ex ercise excellent mouth care. See \"Mucositis \" information sheet. Brush your teeth after each meal and at bedtime. Use a soft -bristle toothbrush and be careful to avoid injury to the gums. Avo id use of mouthwashes that contain alcohol. Keep your skin clean and avoid cuts and scratches. Report any changes in skin including rashes, sores, and cuts. Wash hands frequently. Wear gloves when washing dishes. Shave with an electric razor. Use lotion for dry skin. If you have hemorrhoids, ask your physician or nurse for advice before you self -treat. Check with your physician or nurse regarding dental work. Information adapted from: Pharmacia and Upjohn Company 105 Food safety guidelines Overview Foodborne illness, or \"food poisoning,\" is any illness caused by eat ing a food that is contaminated with a bacteria, virus, mold or parasite. Examples of organisms that can cause a food borne illness are E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria. Sources of foodborne illness may be the food handler, the environment (such as a contaminated work surface) or the food itself. Bacteria and other organisms exist commonly in foods. Most of these organisms are of little risk to the average healthy person. Howe ver, persons undergoing chemotherapy, radiation, or a hematopoietic cell tran splant are at increased risk for infections, including foodborne illness. By following safe food practices, patients and caregivers can reduce the risk of foodborne illness. All hematopoietic cell transplant patients are recommended to follow the \" Immuno suppressed Patient Diet \". In addition, it is recommended that all patients follow the food safety guidelines discussed below. If you have any questions regarding food safety and diet guidelines, talk to your dietitian. Steps to food s afety Wash hands and surfaces often Avoid cross -contamination of foods Keep foods at safe temperatures Tools for food s afety Food and refrigerator thermometers Hand soap Clean towels (cloth or paper) Bleach solution (for washing countertops, cutting boards and other items) *Dilute bleach s olution : Mix 1/3 cup unscented household bleach with 3 1/3 cups water. (This will make a total of 3 2/3 cups of bleach solution.) This solution must be remad e daily. Hand hygiene Wash hands frequently with soap and warm, running water and rubbing motion (friction) for 15 seconds before and after every step in food preparation. This is critical before and after handling raw meat, seafood and poultry. Wash h ands before eating and after using the rest room, handling garbage, and touching pets. Dry hands with a paper towel or cloth hand towel that is changed daily. 106 Kitchen c leanliness Overview Replace di shcloths and dishtowels daily. They should be laundered in the hot cycle of your washing machine. Sanitize sponges daily and after conta ct with raw meat, fish and eggs. You may soak them in the dilute bleach solution* for five minutes, heat them in a micro wave oven on high for one minute, or run them through the dishwasher. Use liquid dish soap and very warm water when hand -washing dishes, pans, and utensils. Air -dry dishes instead of towel -drying them. Wash counters, utensils, and can openers with soap an d hot water immediately after use. After washing, they can be sanitized using the dilute bleach solution.* Keep the refrigerator clean. Clean spills immediately. Wash shelves and doors weekly using the dilute bleach solution.* Make sure food storage are as remain clean. Rotate food stock so older items are used first. Check expiration dates. Do not use foods past the expiration dates. Throw away any bulging, leaking or cracked cans, or those deeply dented in the seam area. Do not taste these foods. Keep appliances free of food particles (including the microwave oven, toaster, can opener, blender and mixer blades). Blender blades and the bottom ring should be removed from the blender after each use and washed in hot, soapy water. Keep food storage area s clean. Do not store any food supplies under the sink. Do not store chemicals and cleaning solutions over or near food supplies. Cutting b oards Wash cutting boards with hot, soapy water after each use; then rinse and air -dry or pat dry with fresh paper towels. Non -porous acrylic, plastic or glass boards and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher (laminated boards may crack or split). Sanitize both wooden and plastic cutting boards with the dilute bleach solution.* This should be done every time the board is used for raw meat, fish and poultry. Sanitize cutting boards used for other purposes at least once weekly. Flood the sur face with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for at least 2 minutes, then rinse and air -dry or pat dry with fresh paper towels. Alternatively, use a commercial sanitizing agent (that contains bleach) and follow the directions on the product. Replac e worn cutting boards, including boards with cracks or grooves. 107 Safe food handling: from the grocery store to your h ome Grocery s tore Shop for shelf -stable items first (shelf -stable refers to unopened canned, bottled, or packaged food products that can be stored at room temperature before opening; the container may require refrigeration after opening.) Select fro zen and refrigerated foods last, especially during the summer months. Check \"Sell By\" and \"Use By\" dates on dairy products, eggs, cereals, cann ed foods, and other goods. Select only the freshest products. Check packaging dates and \"use by\" dates on fresh meats, poultry, and seafood. Do not purchase if they are outdated. Do not use damaged, swollen, rusted, or deeply dented cans. Check that pac kaged and boxed foods are properly sealed. Select fruits and vegetables that are not moldy, bruised or damaged. Fresh fruits and vegetables should look fresh. Wilted salad greens may be an indication that the product is old and not properly handled. Avoi d unpasteurized juice (unless prepared at home with washed produce). Choose shelf -stable salsa rather than salsas found in the refrigerator section of the grocery store. Avoid unpasteurized milk, yogurt, cheese, other unpasteurized milk products, including Mexican -style cheese made from unpasteurized milk (such as queso fresco). Do not use foods with any mold present , including blue cheese. Avoid unrefrigerated, cream - and custard -filled pastry products, such as fresh bakery cream pies, \u00c9clairs, cream -filled donuts and pastries. Commercial, shelf -stable items such as Danish pastries are allowed. Follow the \"use by\" date and store them according to the manufacturer's guidelines after opening. Avoid foods from \"reach in\" or \"scoop\" bulk food containers. Avo id food from any type of bulk food container if it will not be cooked prior to consumption. Do not taste unpackag ed food samples. Choose eggs that are refrigerated in the store. Do not use cracked eggs . Pasteurized eggs, liquid pasteurized egg products ( such as EggBeaters) and powdered egg whites may be used in recipes calling for raw eggs in foods that will not be cooked. Place meat, poultry and fish in plastic bags. Ask to have these items placed in separate bags from the fresh produce and ready -to-eat foods when at the checkout stand. Never leave perishable food in the car. Refrigerate or freeze them promptly. Home Wash the tops of canned foods before opening. Clean the can opener after each use. Throw away eggs with cracked shells. Throw away food s older than their \"use by\" expiration dates. Throw away entire food packages or containers with any mold present, including yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, fruits (especially berries), vegetables, jelly, bread, cereal and pastry products. 108 Fruit and vegetable h andling All fresh produce (whether organic, natural or general produce) may carry dangerous ba cteria or other organisms that can cause food borne illness. Bacterial contamination can occur in the fields from the use of natural fertilizers (such as animal manure) or from human contact during produce harvesting, transporting and in the grocery store . The term \"organic\" or \"natural\" refers to growing without the use of che mical fertilizers or pesticides and has no relationship to the cleanliness or safety of the produce. Use the following guidelines for handling all raw produce, including organic, organically grown, \"natural\" and general produce: Refrigerate fruits and vegetables promptly. Do not purchase produce that has been cut at the grocery store (such as melon or cabbage halves). This is particularly true for produce that will not be cooked prior to eating. Rinse produce thoroughly under clean, running water just before use, includin g produce that is to be peeled (such as bananas, melons and oranges) or cooked. Do not wash fruits and vegetables with soaps, detergents or chlorine bleach solutions. Produce can absorb these cleaning agents. Commercial produce rinses (such as Fit Fruit and Vegetable Spray) are not recommended since they have not been shown to be more effective for removing bacteria off the produce than washing under running water. Scrub produce that has a thick, rough skin or rind (such as cantaloupe or potatoes) or has visible dirt on the surface using a clean vegetable scr ubber. Rinse leaves of leafy vegetables (such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage) individually under running water. Packaged salads, slaw mixes and other prepared produce, even when marked pre -washed, shoul d be rinsed again under running water; a salad spinner o r colander can be used to make this easier. Check for \"use by\" dates. Do not eat any raw vegetable sprouts (avoid all types, including alfalfa sprouts, clover sprouts, mung bean sprouts, and so on) d ue to high risk of Salmonella and E. coli contamination. Cooked mung bean sprouts are acceptable. Throw away fruits and vegetables that are slimy or show mold. Review the processing procedure if preparing home -canned foods. Be sure the procedure is appro priate for the acidity of the food, size of the bottle, and elevation above sea level. Look for mold and leaks. Check seals. If you suspect a home -canned food may not have been properly processed (for example, if the lid bulges or if the food has any ba d odor or unusual characteristics after opening), THROW IT AWAY. It is recommended to use home canned foods within one year of canning as chemical changes may occur. Avoid cross c ontamination Use a clean knife for cutting different foods (for example, use different knives for cutting meat, produce and bread ). During food preparation, do not taste the food with the same utensil used for stirring. Use a clean utensil each time you taste food while preparing or cooking. In the refrigerator, stor e raw meat separately from ready -to-eat foods. When grilling, alw ays use a clean plate and utensils for the cooked meat. 109 Keep foods at safe t emperatures Proper thermometer u se Test a thermometer's accuracy by putting it into boiling water. It should read 212oF. Read the manufacturer's instructions. Insert the meat th ermometer into the middle of the thickest part of the food to test for doneness. T he entire part of the stem, from the dimple to the tip, must be i nserted into the food. For thin foods, insert the thermometer sideways. A refrigerator thermometer should be placed on a shelf toward the back of the refrigerator. It should read 40o F or less. Refrigeration Keep the refrigerator temperature between 34 F to 40F. Keep the freezer temperature below 0 to 2 F. Never leave perishable food out of the refrigerator for over two hours . Throw away food left out longer than two hours. Marinate foods in the refrigerator. Thaw foods in the r efrigerator, never on the counter. Thaw meat, fish or poultry in the refrigerator away from raw fruits and vegetables and other pr epared foods. Place on a dish to catch drips. Cook defrosted meat right away; do not refreeze. If you are in a hurry you ca n thaw meat in the microwave. The meat must be cooked immediately after thawing . Cool hot foods uncovered in shallow containers in the refrigerator. Cover storage containers after cooling. Make sure that covers seal tightly. Throw away all prepared foo d after 72 hours (3 days). Use labels or masking tape to write dates on containers. Freeze foods that will not be used within 2 t o 3 days. NEVER TASTE FOOD THAT LOOKS OR SMELLS STRANGE! Cook foods a dequately Cook meat until it is no longer pink and the juices run clear. These are signs that the meat may be cooked to a high enough temperature. However, the only way to be sure th at the meat has been cooked to the proper temperature is to use a food thermometer (s ee \"Recommended minimum cooking temper atures \" table on the next page). Thoroughly heat until steaming (165 \u00b0F) all hot dogs and \"ready to eat\" luncheon meats, cold cuts an d \"deli -style\" meats before eating. Do not eat raw, lightly cooked, or soft boiled eggs. Do not eat uncooked foods containi ng raw or undercooked eggs, such as raw cookie dough, cake batter or salad dressings containing raw or coddled eggs. Pasteurized eg gs and liquid pasteurized egg products (such as EggBeaters) may be used in recipes calling for raw eggs in foods that will not be cooked. Hold food at safe temperatures: hot food above 140\u00b0F, cold food below 40\u00b0F. 110 Recommended minimum cooking t emperature s Microwave c ooking Microwave cooking can leave cold spots in food where bacteria can survive. Rotate the dish a quarter turn once or twice during cooking if there is no turnt able in the appliance. When heating leftovers, use a lid or vented plastic wrap to cover them. Stir several times during reheating. When the food is heated thoroughly (to a minimum of 165oF), cover and let sit for 2 minutes before serving.

Dining Out Safely Eat early to avoid crowds. Ask that food be prepared fresh in fast food establishments (for example, a hamburger should be fresh off the grill, not one that has been sitting under heat lamps). Ask if fruit juices are pasteurized. Avoid raw frui ts and vegetables when dining out. Eat these items when prepared at home, where yo u can wash them thoroughly and prepare them safely. Ask for single -serving condiment packages. Do not use public self -serve condiment containers, including salsa. Avoid sal ad bars, delicatessens, buffets and smorgasbords, potlucks and sidewalk vendors. Be sure that utensils are set on a napkin or clean tablecloth or placement, rather than directly on the table. Check the general condition of the restaurant. Are t he plates , glasses, and utensils clean? Are the restrooms clean and stocked with soap and paper towels? How clean the restaurant looks may tell the amount of care taken while preparing the food. If you want to keep your leftovers, ask the server to bring you a bo x into which you can transfer the food yourself, rather than having your food transferred into a box in the restaurant kitchen. Be sure to take home and refrigerate the leftovers immediately. Other f oods Do not eat soft cheeses such as Camembert , blue -veined, Stilton . Feta, brie, goat and Mexican -style cheese (queso fresco) are OK if heated to steaming. Cut tofu into 1 -inch cubes or smaller and boil 5 minutes in water or broth before eating or using in recipes. (Note: This process is not needed if using pasteurized tofu or aseptically packaged shelf -stable tofu such as Mori -Nu silken tofu.) Choose shelf -stable salsas and salad dressing (shelf -stable refers to unopened canned, bottled, or packaged food products that can be stored at room temperat ure befor e opening; the container may requ ire refrigeration after opening ). Avoid fresh fruit or vegetable salsas and salad dressing found in the refrigerated section of the grocery store. Do not consume raw honey or honeycomb. Choose Grade A honey. 112 Water safe ty guidelines Overview Public water quality and treatment varies throughout the United States, so always check with the local health department and water utility regarding the safety of household and community tap water and ice for use by immun osuppresse d persons. Tap w ater Water from your home faucet is considered safe if your water is from a city water supply or a municipal well serving highly populated areas. Well w ater Well water from private or small community wells is not considered safe for consu mption by persons considered immunosuppressed and at risk for infection unless it is tested daily and found to be negative for coliforms and Cryptosporidium organisms. Examples of ways well water could become contaminated: Construction occurs near the we ll Well depth is shallow Well is located near a dairy farm or large numbers of livestock Flooding has recently occurred in the well area Municipal wells : Drinking well water from municipal wells serving highly populated areas is considered safe because the water is tested for bacterial contamination more than two times each day. Private and small community wells : The quality of well water from these sources cannot be guaranteed unless it is tested daily and foun d to be negative for coliforms and Cryptosp oridium organisms. It is recommended that other approved water sources be used instead , including : boiled water or bottled water (see guidelines below). Not considered safe : Common home water filtration devices do not remove bacteria or viruses. If the we ll water supply is chlorinated per guidelines provided by your local health department, the chlorinated water treated with one or more of the following is considered safe to consume: Reverse osmosis treated Distil lation Filtered through an absolute 1 micr on or smaller filter ( NSF Standard #53 for cyst removal) See \"Water Filters\" (below). Safe water s ources The following sources of water are suggested if your water is not from a city water or municipal well supply: Boiled w ater o At home, safe water can b e made by bringing tap water to a rolling boil for one minute. After processing, the water should be stor ed in a clean, covered container in the refrigerator; discard water not used within 72 hours (3 days). 113 Distilled w ater o Water may be distilled using a steam distillation system. After processing, the water should be stored in a clean, covered container in the refrigerator; discard water not used within 72 hours (3 days). Bottled w ater o Acceptable forms of bottled water have been processed to remove orga nisms known to cause stomach or intestinal infection. Bottled water labels reading \"well water\", \"artesia n well water\", \"spring water\", or \"mineral water\" do not guarantee that the water is safe to drink. Water labeled as having been treated with one or more of the following are considered safe: Reverse osmosis treated Distillation Filtered through an absolute 1 micron or smaller filter ( NSF Standard #53 for cyst removal) To be sure that a specific brand of bottled water has undergone one of the above p rocesses, contact the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) at 1-800-928-3711 , or visit thei r home page at www.bottledwater.org . If the IBWA does not have information on a specific brand, call the bottl ing company directly. IBWA follow more strict manufacturing practices in their water bottling process than those practices currently mandated by the United States Food and Drug Adm inistration. Therefore, water bottled by a member of the IBWA may be prefer able to water produced by non -member bottlers. Water f ilters Most water filtration devices will not make the water safe if the water supply has not been previously chlorinated. If you choose to install water filters on household water taps purchase only filters certified by NSF International. The following specifications must also be met: The filters must be designed to remove coliforms and Cryptosporidium . Any of the following are acceptable o Reverse osmosis filter o Absolute pore size of filter 1 micron or smaller o Tested and certified by NSF Standard #53 for cyst removal The water tap filter must be installed immediately before the water tap Manufacturer directio ns must be followed for filter maintenance and replacement Portable water filters (such as a Brita\u00ae or Pur\u00ae system) as well as refrigerator -dispensed water and ice machine systems do not meet filtration standards. Portable water systems filter out chemic al impurities, not bacteria. If a portable water system (such as a Brita\u00ae pitcher) is used in combination with a safe water supply (to improve water flavor and remove chlorine and other impurities), it is recommended to change the system's filters frequen tly according to manufacturer's guidelines. For a list of approved filtration systems, call t he National Sanitation Foundation International , at 1-800-673- 8010 or visit their home page at www.NSF.org (go to the section entitled \"Home Water Treatment Devices\"). 114 Diet guidelines for immunosuppressed patients Overview You may have decreased immune function because of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or from taking medications to suppress your immune system. This means that you are at increased risk of developing a food - related infection. The purpose of this diet is to help you avoid specific foods that are more likely to contain infection -causing organisms while allowing maximum healthy food ch oices. Choose foods from the \"may e at\" column. Do not eat foods in the \"do not e at\" column. You may want to discu ss the safety of these or other foods with your dietitian. This diet should be followed before and after all conditioning therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation)and while on immunosuppressive medications. Your health care provider and dietitian will let you know when the diet is no longer required. In general, we recommen d autologous transplant patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment follow this diet during the first 3 months after chemotherapy or transplant.

Ask an SCCA dietitian at nutrition@seattlecca.org 118 More n utrition tips The chemotherapy you will receive during your marrow or stem cell transplant will affect your nutrition in many ways. You may find that you are not eating the way you normally do because of nausea, mouth and throat soreness, lack of appetite, or changes in the way foods taste. Use these tips to help you: Keep in mind that your calorie needs are hig her during your transplant. Keep your body nourished even during the times you do not feel like eating. You will be using some medications that can be hard on your kidneys, so it is important to drink lots of fluids. Fluids include all beverages, smoothie s, yogurt, ice cream, popsicles , and sou ps. Your dietit ian will give you a goal for daily fluid intake. Protein is needed for repair, growth, and fluid balance. Regularly i nclude high protein foods such as eggs, milk/dairy products, meat/poultry /fish, beans, nuts, or high protein smoothies . Eat smaller, more frequent meals; snack often, and keep beverages handy at all times. Use a water bottle to keep beverages close all day long. Foods will probably taste differently for a while. Th is will pass, but you may need to make some adjustments to the w ay you eat. Drink beverages with meals or snacks if your mouth is dry. And remember, what does not taste good to day might taste good tomorrow. Tell your physician or nurse if you are having n ausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, or mouth and throat pain. A dietitian can answer questions you might have or help you find the foods that will work for you. Nourishing food suggestions If you do not feel hungry or you have a sore mouth and/or taste changes, eating can be challenging. To make it easier, we have some suggestions for stocking a kitchen with ingredients for fast, healthy, and flavorful meals and snacks: For the refrigerator Yogurt o Look for at least 10 grams prot ein per serving o Consider getting plain yogurt and adding your own fruit and sweetener (such as honey) Ginger Ale, can be taken hot or cold Lemons and limes to enhance flavor Premade, pasteurized smoothies Nut butters (peanut, almond, or cashew) Eggs Cott age cheese: easy to eat and protein -rich Single -serve cheese packages: o String cheese or cheddar o Babybel \u00ae or Laughing Cow \u00ae cheese rounds For the freezer Frozen/microwavable meals. For example: o Whole -wheat macaroni and cheese o Pot pies or single -serve casserole dishes o Oven -baked sweet potato wedges Frozen Magic Mineral B roth - freeze in ice cube trays for single servings. Ask your dietitian for the Recipe Packet for details. Whole fruit popsicles or sorbets 119 Tips on e ating if you have thi ck, viscous saliva: Switch to mostly fluid foods. Drinking more total fluids will he lp to loosen mucous. Club soda, seltzer, hot tea with lemon, or sucking on lemon drops may help to break up the mucous. Milk and dense liquids are sometimes hard to swallow when there is excess mucous. If you have nausea in the morning from mucous build up , try eating a lighter breakfast. Avoid thick nectars and juices, cream soups, and bread products. 3TSome foods to try : Beverages Proteins Seltzer water, diluted nectars and juices Thinned fruit smoothies tea with lemon Clear broth Sugar -free lemon dro ps, sour candies Moist, cooked fish and chicken Thin, broth -based soups Breads and cereals Fruit and vegetables Hot cereals thinned with milk or water Blended fruits or vegetables diluted to a thin consistency High moisture fruits such as melo n 120 Tips o n eating 3Tif your mouth and throat are sore : A soft, bland diet will cause less irritation . Avoid rough, acidic, and spicy foods. Popsicles and slushies (frozen beverages) may help to soothe your mouth and throat and quench your thirst. Try smaller bites of foods that don't take much chewing. Avoid extreme hot and cold food temperatures. Canned fruits are usually softer than fresh, raw fruits and cause less discomfort. 3TSome foods to try: Beverage s and seasonings Proteins Herbal teas Diluted juices Smo othies/shakes Popsicles Low-salt homemade or canned soups (can be put in the blender to change texture) Herbs for seasoning: thyme, basil, oregano, bay leaf Blended meats and casseroles Bland entrees: macaroni and cheese, souffl\u00e9s, bland quiches, spaghett i with cream sauce Pureed foods Milk Eggnog Cottage cheese, yogurt, cream cheese Custard, pudding Breads and cereals Fruit and vegetables Hot cereal; may be thinned with milk Dry cereals soaked in milk Plain , cooked pasta Mashed potatoes with butter Cool fruits, especially watermelon, honeydew, grapes, papaya Canned fruits, blended if needed Pureed baby fruits Diluted fruit nectars Cold blended homemade soups: cucumber, avocado, potato 3T121 Tips on eating if your mouth is dry: Dry foods like meats and br eads will be easier to swallow if served in a liquid, such as gravy or broth. Dip cookies in milk or cocoa , or eat with ice cream. Pour sauces over cake and gravy over breads. Citric acid, found in citrus fruits and fruit juices, may help to stimulate sali va; try adding lemon to tea, water, and soda. Do not eat dry crackers, unless dipped in broth or gravy. Do not eat really hot foods. Keep beverages handy when eating any food to keep your mouth moist between bites. 3TSome foods to try: Beverages/m iscella neous Proteins Beverages with meals Tea with lemon, lemonade Sherbet Sugar -free sour candies Bioten e\u00ae gum, toothpaste, mouth rinse Oral Balance \u00ae mouth gel Tender, moist fish and chicken with gravy or sauce Casseroles French dip sandwiches Milk, milkshakes , malts Eggnog Breads and cereals Fruit and vegetables Cooked cereals Dry cereals soaked in milk Vegetables with sauces Melon, peaches Canned fruits Fruit juices and nectars 122 Calorie and protein g uide For calorie and protein information, ask your dietitian for the booklet, \"A Guide to Good Nutrition.\" Food r ecord Follow these steps: Use a new food record sheet each day ( get more records from your dietitian). Record your name and date. Do not write in the \"Code\" columns. Write down the time you eat or drink each food. Note if the food is vomited up and what time. Turn the food record over and a nswer the questions on the back. Bring your completed food record sheet to each nutrition a ppointment. How to record fluids on your food record: Include water , juice, milk, soup, ice cream, sherbet, Jell -O\u00ae, Kool -Aid\u00ae, soda , and yogurt. Record fluids a s cups, ounces (oz .), or millili ters (mL ). Describe drinks clearly, such as: 2% milk , or whole milk. Specify how much sugar you add when sweetening tea or other d rinks. List each ingredient of special drinks (such as homemade milkshakes). How to record so lids on your food record : Cereal : Measure with a measuring cup. Include the amounts of milk and sugar added. State if milk is used in the preparation of cooked ce reals. Condiments and s nacks : Include these, as they are important sources of calories. Please write them out on your record! Be specific about the amount you use (1 t easpoon, 2 tablespoons, etc.). Examples are: Butter or margarine (on toast, sandwiches, p otatoes, oatmeal, etc.) Mayonnaise or salad dressing Syrup, jam, or honey Olives or pickles Nuts or sunflower seeds Potato chips or other kinds of chips Fruits and vegetables : State whether fresh or canned. Measure cooked ones with a measuring cup or state number (such as 3 French fries). Estimate raw foods, such as \"one medium tomato\" or \"3 carrot sticks\" or \"\u00bd large banana.\" Meat, cheese, and eggs : State how meat or eggs are prepared (fried, roasted, broiled, etc.). State whether you eat the skin of poult ry. List portion size by the dimension or cup: 1 hamburger patty, 3\" diameter x 1/2\" thick ; 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese . Some foods can be listed by the piece: 1 scrambled egg , 1 small chicken thigh without skin , 5 potato chips . 123 How to record soups: State whether homemade, canned, or dehydrated. State if creamed soups are made with milk or water. How to record mixed items: List recipes for casseroles, pasta dishes, sandwich ingredients, and contents of tacos, pizzas, hamburgers, and hotdogs. How to record s pecial products, frozen dinners, etc. : Tape onto your food record the nutrient information from TV dinners, protein powders, canned foods, or other products with which we may not be familiar. How to record brand names foods: Include the these , as the brand name can be helpful. Examples are: \u00be McDonald's Big Mac\u00ae. 1.6 oz Butterfinger\u00ae candy bar . How to record food when eating out: State fast food or restaurant names and the foods and beverages you eat. 124 Herbal and nutrient s upplement s You may b e using nutrient supplements or herbal preparations . Your dietitian and physician will ask about any supplements or herbals you use during their initial evaluation. Stop use of all herbal and nutrient supplements at this time . These supplements may affect treatment or even cause a serious infection. There a re 4 main concerns about the use of nutritional supplements, herbals and other preparations during marrow or stem cell transplantation or high dose chemotherapy: 1. Interactions between preparations and pre scribed medications may reduce the effectiveness of drugs routinely used during transplantation or chemotherapy. 2. Potential contamination of preparations derived from plants may cause bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections because of inadequate purifica tion and sterilization. Even boiling water may not destroy some infectious organisms that can contaminate these products. 3. A few specific preparations have been repeatedly associated with serious toxic side effects to the liver, blood, kidneys, heart , and o ther body organs. 4. The production, distribution, and labeling of herbal preparations and nutrient supplements are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, the dosage may vary from the dose listed on the label. Also, the product m ight contain ingredients not listed on the label. Herbal and botanical p reparations Herbal and bot anical preparations include a variety of products derived directly from plants. They may be sold as tablets , capsules, liquid extracts, teas, powders, and to pical preparations. There are no manufacturing regulations for the cleanlines s or purity of these products. There is a danger the products may be contaminated with fungus, bacteria, parasites or other chemi cals, which can be life -threatening to a person with an impaired immune system, including persons receiving chemotherapy or transplantation. Even boiling water may not kill some organisms that can contaminate these products. It is recommended that you avo id all herbal a nd botanical products during chemot herapy and as long as your immune system is impaired. Make t he decision to use any preparation with your physician , who will consider how the product affects your kidneys, liver, and other organs, your risk of infection , and any interactions it may have wi th other medications. Some herbals may decrease blood clotting. If you have low platelet counts, do not take garlic and gingko biloba. Do not use any produc t that is given as an injection into the central line or as an injection under the skin. Several he rbal and botanical medications have very dangerous side effects and should not be taken under any circumstance. These include: Alfalfa Black Hellebore St. John's Wort Yohimbe and Yohimbine 125 Vitamin and mineral supplements and antioxidants You will be prescribed a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement that provides nutrients at levels approximately those of the Dieta ry Reference Intakes (DRI). In some instances, you may wish to take higher doses of specific vitamins, minerals, or antioxidants. While h igher doses are not suggested, the following is a list outlining the DRI and maximum amounts of supplements recommended . Higher doses may be toxic or interact with other medications. Dietary reference intakes and daily tolerable limits for supplementatio n Recommended vitamin b rands Note: vitamin brands that contain Iron and/or extra C are not recommended . One-a-Day 50 P lus\u00ae Nature Made Mature Balanc e\u00ae 126 Antioxidants A high intake of some antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and \u00df -carotene) may protect against the development of certain types of cancer. However, taking antioxidant supplements during radiation and chemothera py may reduce the effectiveness of these treatments in destroying diseased cells. Therefor e, you s hould stop antioxidant supp lementation before chemotherapy and radiation. Antioxidants may be inappropriate post -transplant because of interactions with medic ations, immunosuppressive therapy, or other vitam ins and minerals in your body. B vitamins The B vitamins (thiamin, acid,) are water -soluble nutrients that assist i n energy production. High levels of supplementation may not be toxic. However, it is important to maintain a balance among th ese B-vitamins. High doses of one may have a negative effect. Specific r ecommendations As your immune system begins to recover an d strengthen, you may be able to include herbal supplements and vitamins in your diet, dependent on the type of transplant you have had. Some people wish to start using the supplements they were taking before transplant. It is critical to check with your h ealth care team before taking any vitamin or herbal supplement, as some may put your still immat ure immune system at risk. 127 Central l ine care What is a central venous catheter? A central venous catheter is a small flexible tube inserted into a large ve in in your chest. It is used to give you fluid, nutrients, medicine, and blood products. It may also be used to get blood samples. A central venous catheter is also called a central line, tunneled catheter, central venous line, or Hickman line . In this document, we will refer to it as a \"central line\". There are m any types of central lines. How is the central line placed? Inserting the c entral line is a minor surgical procedure. It is done in a procedure su ite or an operating room and takes about 1 hour. Your doctor will use local anesthesia to numb your neck and chest. You may also be sedat ed. During the surgery, your doctor will make 2 small incisions. You will have 1 small incision at the bottom of your neck by your collar bone. This is where the centr al line enters your vein. The other incision will be in your upper chest. This is where the central line exits your body. The central line is threaded through a \"tunnel\" under your skin between these 2 sites . You will likely have a few stitches placed to h elp secure the central line. You will have a dressing (bandage) placed on top of each incision site. A small cuff on the central line helps hold it in place in the tunnel underneath your skin. This cuff also acts as a barrier to help prevent bacteria on yo ur skin from traveling up the central line tunnel and into your bloodstream. Will it hurt? Your shoulder and chest area may be sore for a few days after the central line is placed. You may be prescribed a mild pain reliever. It helps to move your shoulder and neck right after surgery to keep the area from getting stiff. What instructions should I follow after my procedure? Do not take over -the-counter (non -prescription) pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) and ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae) without checkin g with your care team first . Secure the line by wearing a tight -fitting tank top/undershirt or sports bra for at least 1 night after placement. Do not lift anything heavier than 5 pounds for 3 days after your surgery. Do not participate in activities th at use your chest muscles such as vacuuming, bowling, weigh t lifting, tennis or golf while you have the central line. You may have sex, but do not pull on the catheter. If you have any questions about your activities, please ask your care team. 128 How do I c are for my central line ? The day after your surgery, you will have an appointm ent to get your dressing changed for the first time. The dressing over the central line exit site will need ongoing care as long as you have the central line in place. This care is described in the rest of this packet. Parts of your central line Ongoing central line care You will need to care for your central line daily to prevent infection. Care involves cleaning your central line, flushing your lumens (lines), protecting y our central line from water, and changing your dressing. The chart below g ives an overview of this care. Central line care How often Clean central line Use alcohol wipes Change tape tabs, if using Daily Flush lumens Daily or with each use Protect lin e from water : Put Parafilm\u00ae on end caps Put AquaGuard\u00ae or Press'n Seal\u00ae over dressing When bathing/showering Change dressing Every 7 days for Tegaderm\u00ae CHG or other clear dressing Every 1 -2 days for gauze and tape dressing 129 Supplies to care for your central line Below are the supplies used to care for your central line. You may receive some of them from a home infusion company or SCCA. If not, all of them are available online, but Press'n Seal, alcohol wipes, plastic tape, and gloves can usually be f ound at a groc ery or drug store. If you have any questions about which supplies you should buy, please contact your care team nurse. Supplies Parafilm AquaGuard or Press'n Seal; you do not need both Alcohol prep pads Plastic tape \u2014do not use paper, cloth, scotch, or masking tape Medical gloves Bulldog clamp 2 lanyards Cloth pouchers medical gloves (SCCA this) Lanyard (SCCA will provide this) Cloth pouch (SCCA will provide this) 130 Important notes on central line care Keep your line safe Keep your bulldog clamp with you at all times. The bulldog clamp is a safety clamp . If the central line leaks, gets cut, or breaks, clamp the central line close to your chest and call the clinic immediately. Secure your central line one of the below ways to prevent accidental removal of the line: o Place central line ends in a clean cloth pouch and secure the pouch with a bulldog clamp to clothing or a lanyard . Pouch es are for one -day use and should be washed daily; OR o Place plastic tape tabs between clamp and cap on the central line and change daily. Use the plastic tape tabs and bulldog clamp to secure the central line to clothing or a lanyard. Always place central line clamp on the thick reinforced area of the line. Protect your line from water Always cover your central line dressing with a plastic covering such as AquaGuard or Press'n Seal to prevent wate r from entering the dressing and exit site . The uncovered dressing and exit site should never come in contact wit h water. Always securely wrap your central line end caps with Parafilm to prevent water from entering the cap top or into the connection to t he central line . If you notice moisture under the Parafilm, ask to have your end caps changed in the clinic. Clean your line Clean your lumens once a day with alcohol wipes after your bath or shower . If using plastic tape tabs to secure your line, replac e tape tabs each day. Your care team will tell you how often to change your dressing and if you will change it yourself or have it changed in the clinic. If your dressing starts to come off, gets wet, or if there is moisture underneath it , it needs to b e changed. Ask to have your dressing changed in the clinic. You may change it yourself if you have been taught how to do this and have the correct supplies at home . Do not Do not remove the end cap s off your central line . Do not let end caps, central line or dressing go under your bath water. Do not go into swimming pools and hot tubs. Do not store central line supplies in a moist (humid) area, such as the bathroom or kitchen. Do not use scissors near your central line . Antibiotic infusions If you are r eceiving antibiotics, your care team will instruct you to alternate your infusions of antibiotic s between the lines of your catheter . 131 Cleaning your central line It is important to clean your central line daily. This helps prevent infection. See instructi ons below for how to do this. Supplies 4 or more alcohol wipes (use 2 per lumen) Plastic tape, if using Instructions 1. If using tape tabs, remove plastic tape tabs. If not using tape tabs, go to step 2. 2. Use 2 alcohol wipes, 1 to hol d the line and 1 to clea n it. Start where the line exits the dressing and wipe towards the end cap. Using the same alcohol wipes, clean the clamps. 3. If using plastic tape tabs, replace them. Fold about \u00bd inch of tape over at each end to make the tab easier to remove. 4. Repeat thi s for each lumen. 132 Flushing your central line Flush your central line with saline and heparin at least once a day or at the end of an infusion. Heparin helps prevent a clot within the central line . The daily heparin flush is still required even if you are on any oral or injectable blood thinners to prevent or treat a blood clot . When to flush your central line Flush each lumen with saline followed by heparin at least once each day and after each use. If you have a blood draw or infusion at the clinic, the central line will be flushed there. Y ou do not need to flush it again at home. If you are doing an infusion at home: o Flush the central line at the beginning of the infusion with saline only. o Flush the central line at the end of the in fusion with saline followed by heparin. How to flush your central line Gather your supplies and then follow steps 1 through 1 6 below. Supplies 2, 10ml saline syringes * 2, 5ml heparin syringes * 2 alcohol wipes 1 pair of g loves *You need a prescription f or saline and heparin syringes. Instructions 1. Wash your hands . 2. Place all supplies on a clean surface. Remove syringes from their packages by peeling the plastic downward. 133 3. Put on gloves. Vigorously scrub the central line end cap with an al cohol wipe for 15 seconds (count one one -thousand, two one thousand, etc.) using a twisting motion as if you were juicing an orange. Take special care to clean the tip of the cap. Allow the cap to dry completely (at least 5 seconds ). 4. Start with the sal ine syringe . Hold the syringe with the cap on, pointed towards the ceiling, and remove the cap of the syringe. Carefully remove the air bubble by gently pulling down and then pushing up on the plunger. Do not touch the end of the syringe because it is ster ile. If you touch it, throw it out. 5. Do not touch the tip of the end cap or the end of the saline syringe with your hand . Insert the saline syringe into the center of the end cap by pushing in and turning clockwise. Suggesti on: A flushing routine that s tarts with the same color lumen is helpful for remembering which lumen has been flushed. 6. Unclamp the central line . 7. Push the plunger on the saline syringe with alternating pressure and release (starting and stopping to create turbulence) to inject the fluid into the central line. This keeps clots from forming in the central line. Leave \u00bd ml of saline in the syringe. 134 8. Clamp the central line (leaving \u00bd ml of saline in the syringe) while keeping your thumb on end of the plunger of the syringe. 9. Remove the syringe. Hold the end cap , not the central line, when disconnecting from your line . Throw syringe away in regular garbage can. 10. Next, use the heparin syringe . Hold the syringe with the cap on, pointed towards the ceiling, and remove the cap of the syringe. Carefully remove the air bubble by gently pulling down and then pushing up on the plunger. Do not touch the end of the syringe because it is sterile. If you touch it, throw it out. 11. Do not touch the tip of the end cap or the end of t he heparin syringe with your hand. Insert the heparin syringe into the center of the end cap by pushing in and turning clockwise. Suggesti on: A flushing routine that starts with the same color lumen is helpful for remembering which lumen has been flushed. 12. Unclamp the central line. 135 13. Push the plunger on the heparin syringe with alternating pressure and release (starting and stopping to create turbulence) to inject the fluid into the central line . This keeps clots from forming in the central line . Leave 2 ml of heparin in the syringe. 14. Clamp the catheter (leaving 2 ml of heparin in the syringe) while keeping your thumb on end of the plunger of the syringe. 15. Remove the syringe. Hold the end cap, not the central line , when disconnecting from your line. Throw syringe away in regular garbage can. 16. Repeat steps for each lumen. 136 Protecting your central line when bathing or showering It is important to protect your central line from water. You will do this by by covering your centr al line end caps with Parafilm and covering your dressing with AquaGuard or Press'n Seal. Repeat the instructions below for each end cap. Supplies Gather your supplies and then follow steps 1 through 9 below. Parafilm AquaGuard or Press'n Seal Clean clot h pouch or tape tabs Alcohol wipes Bulldog clamp Lanyard Instructions 1. Wash your hands. 2. Place Parafilm on central line end cap and tubing connection. Use 4 squares for each side of your central line. a) Peel Parafilm from adhesive cover backing. b) Stretch the Parafil m. This makes it stick to itself. c) Place it over the end cap of the central line. 137 d) Fold Parafilm over the top of the end cap (like you would seal the top of an envelope). Make sure it covers the connection point between th e end cap and the central line. This will make it waterproof. 3. Wrap only around the thicker part of the end of the central line. The Parafilm will fit closely around the end cap and will stick to itself. Make a tab on the end so it will be easie r to remove. Use the heat of your hand and grip onto the wrapped end c ap to mold the Parafilm around the central line. 4. Cover the entire dressing with a square of AquaGuard or Press'n Seal. If you are using Press'n Seal it may be helpful to use a piece large enough to drape over your shoulder. The central line lumens sho uld hang out of the bottom edge of AquaGuard or Press'n Seal. Reinforce the edges with medical tape if it does not stay secure. 5. Place the Parafilm -covered central line ends in a pouch and secure with a lanyard while showering to avoid dislodging the line. You may also secure with a lanyard with the bulldog clamp applied to the central line plastic tape tabs. 6. If you take a bath, the central line should be kept above the water level at a ll times. If you shower, t he dressing should be kept out of the direct stream of water. 7. After bathing, dry the AquaGuard or Press'n Seal with a towel, then remove and throw it away. 8. Dry the Parafilm with a towel, then r emove from central line end caps - DO NOT USE SCISSORS. After removing, check end cap connections to make sure they are secure. 9. If there is moisture underneath the dressing or if it has come loose, the dressing should be changed . 10. Clean both sides of your line once a day with alc ohol wipes and replace plastic tape tabs, if using Secure your central line one of the below ways to prevent accidental removal of the line: 138 o Place central line in a clean cloth pouch and secure the pouch with a bulldog clamp to clothing or a lanyard . Pouc hes are for one -day use and should be washed daily; OR o Place plastic tape tabs between clamp and cap on the central line and change daily. Use the plastic tape tabs and bulldog clamp to secure the central line to clothing or a lanyard. 139 Changing your dressing In most cases, your dressing will be changed in the clinic. You may be taught how to change your dressing at home. If so, please follow the instructions below. While you have your central line, please: Look at your dressing and exit site e very day. Report any redness, drainage, or pain to your care team. Talk to your nurse if your skin is sensitive to the dressing. If you have a Tegaderm CHG dressing: It should be changed every 7 days. The dressing should also be changed if: o The exit site canno t be seen because of drainage or moisture o The gel pad stays depressed when pressed with finger (this means there is too much moisture in the pad) o The dressing starts to come off If you have a gauze and tape dressing: o It should be changed every 24 to 48 hou rs. How to change your Tegaderm CHG dressing 140 Supplies 1 ChloraPrep \u00ae applicat or (also called chlorhexidine ) 7 alcohol pads (4 pads are for cleaning the line -use 2 per lumen - and 3 pads are for removing the dressing) 2 pairs of clean gloves 2 Cavilon No -Sting Barrier Film\u00ae pads or swabs 1 transparent dressing (Tegaderm\u00ae CHG) 1 syringe with saline 1 Sterile gauze pad Plastic tape (if using for tape tabs ) Adhesive remover (optional) Instructions 1. Wash your hands with soap and water a nd put your supplies on a clean work surface. 2. Put on clean gloves. 3. If present, remove plastic tape near central line end caps. 4. Remove existing dressing. If you have a Tegaderm CHG dressing : Remove the old dressing by starting at bottom corner, lif ting up and folding back upon itself, pulling \"low and slow\" or rolling with fingers. When gel pad is reached, use an alcohol pad or adhesive remover if ne eded to loosen gel pad from central line and skin while continuing to slowly pull back on dressing, g rasping both the gel pad and dressing. Do not use scissors. Remove dressing and throw away. If you have a gauze and tape dressing and are switching to T egaderm CHG: Remove the old gauze and tape dressing and throw away. Do not use scissors . 141 5. Report t o your nurse if there is: Bleeding or drainage at the central line site. Redness or swelling at the central line site. Pain or discomfort at the central line site. 6. Remove gloves. 7. Wash your hands again. 8. Put on pair of clean gloves. 9. Wet the sterile gau ze pad with the sterile saline syringe. Using the gauze pad, cleanse the area around the central line exit site. If there is crust, clean it from the central line exit site using an alcohol wipe, if necessary. If there is a scab, you do not need to remove it. 10. Activate the ChloraPrep applicator by squeezing the wings. Scrub around the central line exit site with ChloraPrep applicator using a b ack-and- forth motion for 30 seconds. Allow to dry completely for 1 -2 minutes. Make sure the chlorhexidine you used to clean the central line exit and area around the exit site (in the ChloraPrep One -Step Swab) is completely dry before you apply the Cavilo n No -Sting Barrier Film. Alternate cleaning procedure for chlorhexidine allergy : Use a povidone -iodine swab to cl ean the exit site in a circular motion, starting at the central line exit site and moving outward away from the exit site. Repeat with the other two povidine -iodine swabs, for a total of 3 cleanings at the exit site. Allow to air dry and do not wipe off . If you are sensitive to povidone -iodine, you may remove the iodine with a sterile gauze pad soaked with sterile saline syringe. Alternate cleaning procedure for chlorhexidine Use a 70% alcoho l swab to clean the exit site in c ircular motion, starting at the central line exit site and moving outward away from the exit site. Repeat with the other two povidine -iodine swabs, for a total of 3 cleanings at the exit site. Allow to air dry and do not w ipe off . 11. Open two alcohol wipes for each lumen. Use one to hold the line near the exit site and one to wipe it, start at the exit site and wipe towards the end of the line. Take special care to thoroughly scrub around the connection between the line and the central line end caps. Repeat for each lumen. 12. After cleansing has dried completely, apply Cavilon No -Sting Barrier Film to the area that will be under the transparent dressing. Avoid the exit site and the area that will be under the chlorhexidine gel pad. Allow to dry completely for 1 -2 minutes. 142 13. Apply new dressing. o Apply Tegaderm CHG transparent dressing by peeling the liner from the dressing, exposing the adhesive surface. o Center the dressing and gel pad over the central line exit site and press gently to make it adhere. Make su re the central line comes out of the dressing edge at a notch. o Slowly remove the paper frame from the dressing while smoothing down the dressing edge. o Smooth the entire dressing from the center towards the edge u sing firm pressure to enhance adhesion . If your gloves stick to the dressing, you may remove them. o Remove tape \"wings\" from frame, lift central line, and apply wing across opening of dressing underneath the central line, creating a little hole where the central line comes through. This help s keep the central line secure. o Paint border (outside edges) of transparent dressing with Cavilon No -Sting Barrier Film to create a seal between the transparent dressing and the skin.

If using split gauze: Touching only the corners, place the 2 split gauze with the slits positioned horizontally (in opposite directions) around the central line as close as possible to where it exits the skin . Place the second 2x2 over the line and gauze. Secure gauze to skin with paper tape. 14. Secure the central line one of the below ways to prevent accidental removal of the line: o Place central line in a clean cloth pouch and secure the pouch with a bulldog clamp to clothing or a lanyard. Pouches are for one -day use and should be washed daily; OR o Place plastic tape tabs between clamp and cap on the central line and change daily. Use the plastic tape tabs and bulldog clamp to secure the central line to clothing or a lanyard. 146 Troubleshooting your central line Problem Solution s Line does not flush. 1. Check to see if central line is clamped or kinked. 2. Call the SCCA clinic or after -hours numbers for instructions. Fluid is leaking from t he central line . Central line may be cut accidentally if dressing is removed with scissors. 1. Immediately place a bulldog clamp on the central line as close to the chest as possible. 2. Wash hands and put on gloves 3. Check the central line to find the break. It c an be as small as a pinhole. 4. Clean the break with an alcohol wipe. 5.

Tell the medics to take you to U niversity of Washington Medical Center emergency room (or Seattle Children's , if pediatrics). 147 When your physician prescribes an antibiotic What is an antibiotic? An antibiotic is a drug. It is used to treat some infe ctions. It may also be used to prevent an infection. Antibiotics can save lives. But, they are powerful drugs and should be used only when needed. They must also be taken exactly as your physician prescrib ed. Why do I need an antibiotic? Your care team th inks that you might: Have an infection, or Be at risk for an infection What else do I need to know? We may run tests before you start taking your antibiotic. These tests will help us know which antibiotic will most likely work best for you. We may run mor e tests while you are taking the drug. These tests will help us watch for any side effects. Based on your test results, your physician may: o Change your antibiotic o Stop your antibiotic if it is no longer needed o Important: Take all of your antibiotic pills a s your physician has prescribed. Are there side effects? You may have side effects from your antibiotic. Some may be mild, but others can be more serious. Taking antibiotics can increase your risk for two serious problems: Clostridium difficile infecti difficile (C. diff ) is a type of bacteria. When you take antibiotics, so me of the good germs in your gut are destroyed. This allows the C. diff bacteria to grow. Diarrhe a is one sign of C. diff infection. Tell your care team right away if you have new diarrhea: While you are taking an antibiotic, or Within a few weeks after stopping an antibiotic Antibiotic -resistant i nfections This type of infection is harder to treat w ith antibiotics. Taking antibiotics may increase your risk of getting this type of infection in the future. Your care team will watch you for any signs of antibiotic resistance. To help prevent antibiotic -resistant infections: Take antibiotics only when ne eded, when prescribed by your physician . If your physician prescribes an antibiotic, finish taking all of the pills as instructed. Questions or c oncerns While you 're in the hospital, you may receive your antibiotic through an intra venous ( IV) line. 148 Your questions are important. If you have any questions or concerns about antibiotics or possible side effects, please talk with your care team. Adapted from \"When your physician prescribes an antibiotic\" \u00a9 05/2017, by University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA. Important: Take all of your antibiotic pills as your physician has prescribed. 149 Chapt er 4 - Long Term Recovery \"The actual BMT in the hospit al was doable; the recovery is the hard part.\" -BMT survivor 150 151 How to take care of yourself in the first year \"The most important advice I could ever give to someone dealing with life after transplan t is: waste no time wishing you could get back exactly to whe re you were before transplant. Your life will instantly become more fulfilling and enjoyable the moment you stop being, say 70%, of what you used to be and becoming 100% of what you are now!\" -BMT Survivor The long -term recovery phase may take a y ear or longer. This is the time to reestabli sh your life after transplant. What does re establishing your life entail? It means gradually getting back to your life patterns at work, school or at home, an d making adjustments in relationships with your family and friends. I t may also mean learning to adjust to the therapy needed for chron ic or long -term complications. Former patients have noted that the interruption of life plans, the adjustment in relation ships and preparing to re -enter work and family life c an be d ifficult adjustments to make. You may experience a sense of loss or discouragement. Some people become involved in the quest for deeper meaning in their lives. You may want to seek therapy to hel p you cope with chronic health issues and emotional re sponses to the challen ges of treatment and recovery. You may find that you will benefit from counseling to gain tools for coping with issues of chronic illness or feelings of loss, anxiety, stress, worr y, and depression. Reestablishing your life may vary from difficult and rough to easy and smooth. During their recovery , some patients express a positive view caused by achieving a redirected life, greater compassion for others a nd improved family relations. The majority of survivors report that their qualit y of life is now the same or better than before transplant. On the other hand, some patients struggle and become discouraged as they cope with the various life changes. Despite the intensity of the transplant experience, most patients make effective adjust ments in their life and maintain an optimistic outlook for the future. In addition to the information in this manual, you will receive info rmation from physician s and nurses that will help you manage your care when you leave the clinic. If you wish to c ontinue receiving transplant information, sign up for the quarterly Thriving newsletter incl uded in your discharge packet. You can sign up for this newsletter online at www.seattlecca.org . Scroll down to \"newslette r\" in the bottom right hand corner of the page and enter your email address. Take pride in your journey through an intensive medical treatment but remember that full s trength and fitness will take several more months, o r sometimes years, to achieve. Recovery is usually a gradual process. Continue your programs of rest, exercise , and good nutrition. Transition to home The Long -Term Follow -Up (LTFU) department offers te lephone consultation services to you and your primary physician when you return home. Call your local physician for everyday concerns. Call your oncologist for treatment related issues. LTFU consultation is available at SCCA if you or your physician is concerned about transplant -related side effects or complications. It is a real possibilit y that you may be readmitted to a hospital during your first year after transplant. 152 Self-care steps You can play a proactive role in your own recovery by taki ng responsibility for the following self -care steps. Physician 's visits These include physic al exams, as well as labs and tests (such as blood counts and ki dney and liver function tests). Our standard recommendations are: Weekly visits for the first mon th and every oth er week for the next 2 months. Then go once every 3 to 4 weeks, depending on your progress. Your physician will help you decide. A one year follow -up evaluation is necessary to assess disease status, late complication s, and to receive vaccinations. Call (206) 667-4415 to make your one year follow -up appointment. Skin c are Avoid lo ng (over 1 hour) exposure to sun Apply sunblock or wear SPF clothing even on cloudy days, as you will still be expos ed to ultraviolet radiatio n. Notify your physician if you develop a rash . If dry skin is a problem, it is not necessary to bathe daily. Use oil in bath water . Use lotion . Try natural soap for sensitive skin . Nail care You should not have manicure and pedicures if your immune system is still recovering and on antibiotics. Avoid fake nails and cutting your cuticles. If your ANC ( absolute n eutrophil c ount) is greater than 1 ,500, without need for transfusions and you are off high dose steroid s (greater than 1mg/kg.) , you can have a manicure or pedicure. Make sure a single basin is used, and equipment is steriliz ed after each person.

Continued use of saline rinses can help if your mouth is dry, if you have excessive mucous , or if you are being treated for oral fungus. Rinse your mouth using \u00be teaspoon table salt in 1 quart of warm water. Dental visits See your dentist six months after you return home for an exam to monitor for tooth decay and overall oral care. Routine dental cleaning and dental work should be postponed for at le ast 12 months after transplant. Your dentist should also monitor fo r oral cancer every 6 months . If dental work is neces sary and you are still immunosuppressed you will need an antibiotic based on recommendations from the American Heart Association . 153 Dry mouth See a dentist if you have e xtreme problems with decay. However, fluoride and excellent oral hygiene can minimize or prevent this. Daily home use of fluoride brush -on gels or custom fluoride trays is recommended. Follow guidelines provided by the Oral Medicine department. Saline rins es or other non -prescription products, such as Biotene\u00ae, ca n help to relieve dryness. Mouth changes Contact your physician for any changes such as ulcers, mucoceles (clear blisters on the soft area of the roof of your mouth or the inside of your lower l ip), stinging, burning, dryness, pain, difficulty eating or swallowing, or loose teeth. 154 Common changes \"The new normal is n ot a bad normal, just different. Perspective is everything.\" -BMT Survivor Cognitive c hanges The issue of cognitive changes is r eceiving more research attention. Cancer causes biochemical changes that are now suspected of contributing to cognitive chang es, even before any treatment. High -dose chemotherapy and radiat ion affect cognitive function. Studies show varying incidences of \" chemo brain\" among transplant patients. However, research indicates that the decrease in memory, multi -tasking ability , and attention that characterize post -treatment cognitive changes resolve for a majority of people after about a year. People can return to their pre -transplant cognitive functioning anywhere from one to five years post -transplant. Some people will continu e to have memo ry or fine motor difficulties. If you are still having difficulties with cognitive changes after one year, ask your physici an for a referral for neuropsychological testing so you know what your deficits are and what you can do about them. Rev iew the symptom sheet in this manual. In the meantime, help your memory by keeping a notebook where you put the things you want to rememb er. Make sticky notes about what you do not want to forget, like taking a me dication before you go to bed. Put the stic ky note by something you always remember, like br ushing your teeth. Keep a basket by the door for the things you need to take with you li ke keys or glasses. Sleep Most people have difficulty with sleep at some poin t during and after transplant. It can be hard to get on a regular cycle of sleep and worry tends to increa se as people lie in bed awake. Medication should be a short term solutio n, not a lifetime aid. Tips that help include keeping the bedroom dark and cool, and going to bed and getting up at the same time each day. Get out of bed and do a relaxing activity like reading if you do not sleep after 30 minutes of trying. Learn relaxat ion skills to help your body and mind to relax while you are lying in bed. Depression and other feelings \"People a re entitled to their feelings. And they're entitled to them at every stage of treatment and survivorship. We know from the science of emotio n that the most harmful way, the most damaging way, to manage emotio ns is to try to dictate them.\" -Dr. Karen Syrjala (in Surviving Survivor Stereotype s by Curtis Pesmen) You may continue to experience significant distress following your transplant. Som etimes, this can lead to feelings of sadness or depression and associated symptoms such as worry, anger, and fatigue. Distress can also lead to changes in sleep and eating patterns. Even post -traumatic stress can happen. We recommend making time and saving energy to participate in activities that you enjoy, so life is n ot entirely about your health. Spend tim e with friends and family. If these symptoms continue for more than a couple of weeks, it is important to discuss t hem with your physician or nurse. Some people find that talking to a therapist aft er transplant is very helpful. There is so much that most p eople have been through and have to cope with after treatment. Talking with a therapist can help you reclaim your life and make sense of what you have gone through. 155 Fatigue, weight , and exercise \"Some problems such as fatigue can begin during therapy an d may continue indefinitely, though the duration and severity differs greatly between individuals.\" -Rabiya Tuma, PhD, Treatment Aftershocks Many pe ople report incre ased fatigue after transplant. Exercise is an effective way to de crease this fatigue over time. We recommend a program of daily moder ate exercise, such as walking. Increase the distance and pace as your strength and stamina increase. It is also important to rebuild muscle through a program of gradual ly increasing weight training. Couple this with stretching, yoga and/or gentle fitness classes. See if a YMCA near you has a low cost cancer survivorship program, or ask for a physical therapy r eferral to get an exercise plan from someone who has experience with e xercise afte r cancer treatment. If you exercise at a moderate level and have rebuilt muscle, but your fatigue continues or if your fatigue increases, talk to your physician about other p ossible causes of fatigue. The best exercise is the one that you do regularly! Follow the advice of the nutrition staff. Eat healthy foods. Osteoporosis for transplant recipients Osteoporosis or bone los s may happen in some patients. It is related to ir radiation, use of steroids, inac tivity and low hormone levels. Weight bearing exer cise is recommended to help prevent or stabilize osteoporosis. You may need calcium and vitamin D supplements, o r bone -rebuilding medications. You can discuss this with your local physician . 156 Immune system recovery Adequate immune function takes approximately 1 year aft er transplantation to recover. During this time you are s till vulnerable to infections. Symptoms such as fever, chills, coughing, difficulty breathing, severe diarrhea , or vomiting should be promptly reported to your physician . Cytomeg alovirus (CMV) m onitoring You may need weekly CMV monitoring after treatment. At discharge , you will receive specific recommendations to take to your local physician . Exposure t o others Avoid crowds, especial ly during cold and flu seas on. Avoid peopl e with a contagious infection. Please contact your physician if you are exposed to chicken pox or shingles. Hand w ashing Continue to be as careful about hand washing as you have bee n throughout the transplant process. Perform hand hygiene frequently by washing your hands with soap and water or applying an alcohol -based hand sanitizer that contains 60 -85% alcohol. Ask family and friends to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer when they come into your home. Wear disposable glove s if you must change a diaper. Wash hands after disposing of gloves. Temperature Take your temperature if you are feeling ill, shaking chills or suspect that you have a fever. Note time and circumstances. Notify your physician promptly for: Temperature taken by mouth between 38 -38.2\u00b0 C (100.4 -100.8\u00b0F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F) or above. Temperature taken under the arm (axillary) between 37.5 -37.7 (99.5 -99.9\u00b0F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0 F) or above. Rash Notify your physician promptly if any rash develops. Animals and p lants Avoid contact with body excretions of all anima ls and do not sleep with pets. Do not bring new pets into the home du ring the first year. Established household pets and plants may remain in the home. Gardening is n ot recommended when first returning home. Sexual a ctivity Limiting the number of sexual partners is advised. Use condoms for protection against Se xually T rans mitted Infections (STI). Normal cleanliness should be observed. Use birth control as necessary to prevent pregnancy, as you may not be sterile. Discu ss this with your physician and nurse. If dryness is a proble m, a lubricant may be helpful. Drugs used for impotence should not be used without a cardiac evaluation. 157 Swimming Swimming may expose you to microorganisms capable of causing infections. You should measure the benefits of swimming against the potent ial risks of these infections. If swim ming or wate r aerobics is the preferred or recommended method of exercise, it should be done in a well -maintained p ool with adequate chlorination. Your face should not be submerged under the water. Never swim with a central line in place. Also, do not swim for the fir st 6 months after the transplant . Hot tubs should not be used for the first 6 months after transplant . Travel Take extra medications with you when you travel and consider where you could receive the treatment you need if you became ill. Move around durin g flight or transit time to prevent blood clots that could lead to a major lung problem. Many patients travel home within the fi rst 6 months after transplant. As with any activity involving risk, weigh the specifics of your situation. To minimize risks wh en traveling: Take a copy of critical medical records with you. Seek medical care promptly for new symptoms. Control your environment by avoiding crowds and maintaining infection precautions. If you fly, ask to be moved if you are seated near someone with respiratory symptoms. Carry hand sanitizer and wipes. Other reminders Minimize exposure to dirt and aerosolized material Minimize sun exposure, use sunscreen (SPF greater than 30) Use hat, long -sleeve shirts and long pants if outside for long period of t ime Avoid construction sites Avoid contact with people that: o Have cold and flu symptoms like coughing and sneezing. o Display symptoms of other types of infections such as vomiting or skin rashes. 158 Immunizations Post-transplant immunizations usually starting at one year . These killed -virus and killed -bacterial immunizations include: Tetanus Diphtheria Pertussis Meningococcal Inactivated polio Influenza Pneumonia Haemophilus influenza e type B Hepatitis B Hepatitis A HPV (ages 9 -26) If you do not return for your one -year follow up, ask your physician to contact the Long -Term Foll ow Up department about immunizations. If a household member receives the Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, y ou should b e taking acyclovir. If a household member develops les ions (or pox), you need to be isolated wh ile their lesions are present. Medications Your medications are important to help you maintain your general health. Please take them as prescribed. Bactrim\u00ae (sulfamethoxazole -trimethoprim): This is a broad spectr um antibiotic specifically for the prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for prevention of certain types of bacterial infections (Streptococcus pneumon ia and Haemophilus influenza). - Take this medication if prescribed for at least 6 months after tra nsplant. - Always take Bactrim\u00ae (or an alternate drug) when taking immune suppression medications. Acyclovir or Valacyclovir: These drugs are antiviral agents used to prevent varicella zoste r (shing les). If one of these is prescribed, it should be taken for th e entire first year, and should be given concurrently while on immunosuppression and for six months after completion of taper. Hormones: Hormones may be prescribed for women in premature menopause due to the effects of conditioning therapy. Secondary c ancers There is an increased risk of getting a different cancer in long term su rvivors after transplantation. The risk starts to increase at five years after transplantation. S kin, mouth, thyroid , and breast are the most common sites of secon dary cancers aft er transplant. Cancer screening evaluation is recommended and includes: complete skin examination , oral exams, breast exam and mammogra ms (woman), prostate exam (men), colonoscopy (according to age and history), and others as needed . Original disease resta ging is also recommended at periodic intervals depending on diagnosis. For patients transplanted for CML or acute lymphocytic leukemia PH+, blood monitoring for the BCR/ABL by PCR t est is recommended periodically 159 Reconnecting with life and survivorship \"This has been five years that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but strangely enough, wouldn't trade for the world.\" -BMT Survivor It is normal to feel vu lnerable after returning home. These feelings are valid, but don't push the panic but ton every tim e someone sneezes! It's important for you to see your friends and return to normal activitie s too. Just use common sense \u2014\"when in doubt, don't.\" Some patients, especially those who had a stormy transplant course, find i t hard to plan for the future. Make a specific detailed plan for something you wa nt to do. This helps you to feel like you are moving toward something, not just marking time while you recover. Helpful hints to remember It is healthy to find a \"sil ver lining\" in your situation. It doesn't mea n that you forget the clouds, it's just that the clouds are not the whole story. You are your own best friend. Take care of yourself. Get enough rest , exercise , and good nutrition. Be patient with yourself and others. Watch for changes in your body, hair, nails, eyes, skin, mouth , and joints. Tell your physician about any changes. Try to take one day at a time; focus on your goals for today, particularly after you first return home . Make sure you include something you enjoy in each day. It is normal to feel alone at times; it's true that no one else has been down your road and really knows what it is like for you. Make it a goal to connect with people and do activities you enjoy so that you start to feel like part of your community, even if at first you don' t feel like it. Remember that your caregiver and family have also b een through a major challenge. Check in with them weekly to let each person descri be what they are experien cing. You don't need to fix each other's concerns; just use this as a time to li sten and reflect upo n what each person is feeling. Ask if there is anything that would make things better. Do not be afraid to ask for professional gui dance; you deserve it! Almost everyone receives some kind of help. Check with your employer to see if you have access to an Em ployee Assistance Program. Return one year following your transplant for re -evaluation. Relationships It may be difficult to resume relationships as they were before your BMT because your experience has changed your perspective on lif e. Your illness may have affected the feelings and perspectiv es of the people around you. I t may have produced role changes that can a ffect relationships. People report that these changes can be very positive, but they also c an take some time to sort out. Make sure each person in your family has a chance to des cribe their fears and concerns. Even if it is hard, try to give each person ti me to describe what is going on in thei r lives and thoughts . Caregivers may be used to taki ng care of you and home tasks . These role changes can take time to get back to normal. You can help them along by discussing a wee kly plan of who will do what. As yo u are ready for more responsibility , make this clear to your caregiver. With friends, it migh t help to discuss what is dif feren t in your life and how much the friends hip means to you. Sometimes you may have to reach out to friends rather than waiting for t hem to come to you. 160 Returning to work or school Returning to work or school is very complicated. You need to be ready bot h physically and emotionally. We suggest that you wait 6 -12 months after transplant to return to work or school, but home tutoring or work in a home o ffice can precede these dates. You may be eligible for social security benefits because of your inadequate immune system. This will be the case for at least one year. There are many organizations that assist cancer and transplan t survivors with employment issues. For more information on your employment rights, see the Resources section at the end of this chapt er. The Department of Vocational Rehabilitation offers counseling to for emotional or physical disabilities . Some people are eligible for social security. See below for additional information: Department of Vocational Rehabilitation www.dshs.wa.gov/dvr/ Americans with Disability Act www.ada.gov / Cancer and Careers www.cancerandcareers.org Financial concerns Many people report insu rance and financial concerns. We recommend that you look into social security and private disability insurance. Look online and at the Resources at the end of this chapter for more information on BMT financial concerns. Young adults The road to independence and maturity is more difficult for y oung adults who have been ill. Feelings may fluctuate, sometimes viewing par ents as being overly concerned and involved, and at other times feeling insecure and wanting more parental gu idance and reassurance. Many young adults report that starting to date and sexual activity can bring uncertainty. An excellent resource for young a dults experiencing this is myplanet.planetcancer.org/ Sexuality \"Nobody wants to talk about it. It becomes a self -propelling problem, in that, the longer time goes by, people then also become kind of less connected with that part of themselves.\" -Sharon Bober, PhD Most men and women notice a drop in sexual desire during the first year. Make time for intimacy so that you begi n to re -awaken those feelings. You may have a low energy level or feel unattractive due to the changes that your body has undergone. Partners often hesitate to make sexual advances o ut of concern for your health. Women can have vaginal changes and m en may have erection problems. Medications can be the cause of some of these changes; prob lems may disappear over tim e or after stopping the drugs. Hormones can change for men and women after transplant. For men, it often takes a full year for testosterone levels to return to normal, affect ing both erections and desire. It's important for both partners to talk about their feelings and to be patient with one another. Begin to set aside \"date\" time to be romantic, include touching i n your intimate time together. Start trying sexual activity even if your desire is n ot back to its previous level. If dryness or irritation is a problem, a silicone -based lubricant can be helpful. Water -based lubricants are also safe, but won't last as long. If graft versus host disease or sensitivity is a problem, ask to see a sexuality -after - cancer specialist or look online at BMT websites on s exuality to learn more about what can be done for these problems. After cardiac evaluation, drugs used for erectile problems can be helpful for some men. 161 Survivor syndrome \"Little studied, survivor guilt brings with it a host o f issues that can cause depression, anger and self -blame that may even compromise health.\" -Kathy Latour, Getting Through Survivor Guil t You may have feelings of guilt because you are aliv e when others did not survive. You may also have a strong sense of grief and l oss. Even tho ugh you are glad to be alive, it is normal to feel that you have lost things that you will never again be able to regain. Discussion with a counselor, minister, priest or rabbi can help put this in perspective. If you aren't sure w hat you want to do , or fe el like you want a change, give yourself time to recover while you disc over what you want most . Some people re -evaluate what they want to do for the rest of their li ves. Having survived this adventure, you might decide to try anothe r new one! Survivorshi p clinic Cancer and its treatment can result in some potentially long -lasting or late -onset effects. The SCCA Survivorship Clinic addresses various problems cancer surviv ors may face after therapy ends. These include pain, fatigue, a nd fear of recurrence, living with uncertainty, neuropathy, lymphedema, bone loss, sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, memory issues, and future cancer risk. At the survivorship clinic, our medical staff will talk with you about how to assess and m anage late complications or issues you may be experiencing, and develop a plan to support your future health. As part of your appointment in the Survivorship Clinic you will receive an individ ualized UTreatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan U. This includes an evaluation and information on the prevention of the late effects of your cancer a nd cancer treatment, recommendations and resources for dealing with long -term effects, and suggestions for healthy lifestyle behaviors. Copies of the treatment summary, survivorship care plan, and any recommendations made during the appointment are shared with your health care team, including your oncologist and prima ry care physician . We will work in partnership with these physician s to make sure your survivorship needs are being met. We do not provide testing for recurrence of your cancer; this care will continue to be provided by your oncologist.

I am able to return home; however, my recovery from this procedure can take months. The following is a list of some of the ways you can help with my recovery. My risk for infection continues It will take at least ____ months for my immune system to recover. It's possible that it could take even longer, depending on what medications I will need or what complicatio ns I might experience. I am at a higher risk for infection and will need to pick a ctivities that will minimize my risk of infection. Family and friends need to be up to date with their vaccinations. Please see the vaccination recommendations in the Prepari ng for Transplant booklet. Hand washing etiquette Hand washing is the most effect ive way to prevent infection from spreading. I was taught to wash my hands frequently. My family, friends and visitors will be asked to do the same when in my company. Pleas e don't be offended if I remind you to wash your hands. Time to eat I have to f ollow a special diet while my immune system recovers. If you wish to help by providing meals, I would be happy to give you a list of what I can and cannot eat. Fatigue I will have good days and bad days. I would like to see you; however, short visits will be better for me. Some days I might not be up to visitors, long conversations or involved activities. Exercise can help with fatigue so please offer to walk with me. Memory and concentration The treatment and medications I take can affect my memory and a bility to concentrate. My caregiver ______________ had a lot of responsibility while we were in Seattle. Now that we are home,_____________ will still have caregiver respon sibilities along with all the usual home and work routines. If you would like to help, please see the list of suggestions below: Drive me to and from appointments. Run errands for my caregiver or visit with me so my caregiver can have a break. Take my chi ldren out for an activity. Help with household chores and/or yard work. Remember my caregiver with a phone call or offer to do something fun. Join me for a walk! Walk the dog. And please remember, all of your help and phone calls are appreciated as I move forward with my \" post - transplant \" life! The support of family and friends is an integral part of this transition.
