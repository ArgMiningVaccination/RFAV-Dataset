Permaculture. (Permanent Culture). An ecological design system developed in Australia by David Holmgren and Bill Mollison. There's a permaculture group in my town that I've been to for the second time today in order to become more familiar with the permaculture principles and gain some gardening experience. I had a really good time, it was a lovely evening. Until a key organizer who's been involved with the group for years started talking to me about the covid vaccine. She called it \"Monsanto for humans\", complained about how homeopathic medicine was going to be outlawed in animal farming, and basically presented homeopathy, \"healing plants\" and Chinese medicine as the only thing natural. This really put me off, not just because I was not at all ready to have a discussion about this topic so out of the blue, but also because it really disappointed me. I thought we were invested in environmental conservation and acting against climate change for the same reason - because we listened to evidence-based science. That's why I'd like to know your opinions on the following things: - Is homeopathy and other \"alternative\" non-evidence based \"medicine\" considered a part of permaculture? - In your experience, how deeply rooted are these kind of beliefs in the community? Is it a staple of the movement, or just a fringe group who believes in it, while the rest are rational? Thank you in advance. "}
