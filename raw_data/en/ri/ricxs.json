Recently, studies have reported on the use of RFA to treat other tumors. For some of these, RFA is being investigated as an alternative to surgery for operable tumors. Well -established local or systemic treatment alternatives are available for each o f these malignancies. The hypothesized advantages of RFA for these cancers include improved local control and those common to any minimally invasive procedure (eg, preserving normal organ tissue, decreasing morbidity, decreasing length of hospitalization). 5 Goals of RFA may include (1) controlling local tumor growth and preventing recurrence; (2) palliating symptoms; and (3) extending survival duration for patients with certain tumors. The effective volume of RFA depends on the frequency and duration of app lied current, local tissue characteristics, and probe configuration (eg, single vs multiple tips). RFA can be performed as an open surgical procedure, laparoscopically or percutaneously, with ultrasound or computed tomography guidance. Potential complicat ions associated with RFA include those caused by heat damage to normal tissue adjacent to the tumor (eg, intestinal damage during RFA of kidney), structural damage along the probe track (eg, pneumothorax as a consequence of procedures on the lung), and sec ondary tumors (if cells seed during probe removal). Summary In radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a probe is inserted into the center of a tumor; then, prong -shaped, non - insulated electrodes are projected into the tumor. Next, heat is generated locally by an alternating, high - frequency current that travels through the electrodes. The localized heat treats the tissue adjacent to the probe, resulting in a 3 cm to 5.5 cm sphere of dead tissue. The cells killed by RFA are not removed but are gradually replaced by fibrosis and scar tissue. If there is a local recurrence, it occurs at the edge and can sometimes be retreated. RFA may be performed percutaneously, laparoscopically, or as an open procedure. Bone Tumors For individuals who have painful osteolytic bone me tastases who have failed or are poor candidates for standard treatments who receive RFA, the evidence includes a prospective cohort study and case series. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, quality of life (QOL), medication use, and treatment -related morbidity. A prospective cohort study and case series have shown clinically significant pain relief (defined as a decrease of 2 units from baseline on the Brief Pain Inventory scale) or reduction in opioid use following treatment of painf ul osteolytic metastases. A multicenter, prospective study reported significant reductions in pain through the 6 -month follow -up period, with 59% of patients achieving immediate improvement in pain within 3 days of RFA. The population is comprised of patie nts with few or no treatment options, for whom short -term pain relief is an appropriate clinical outcome. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have painful ost eoid osteomas who receive RFA, the evidence includes numerous observational studies and systematic reviews of these studies. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, QOL, medication use, and treatment -related morbidity. In a systematic rev iew of thermal ablation techniques, clinical success (pain -free) was achieved in 94% to 98% of patients. Most patients (89% to 96%) remained pain -free when assessed during longer -term follow -up. Another systematic review reported similar success rates noti ng an average 8.3% failure rate among patients receiving tomography -guided no randomized trials of RFA for osteoid osteomas have been performed, the uncontrolled studies have demonstrated RFA can provide adequate symptom relief with minimal complications, for a population for whom short -term symptom relief and avoidance of invasive procedures are appropriate clinical outcomes. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outco me. Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma For individuals who have localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that is no more than 4 cm in size who receive RFA, the evidence includes a randomized controlled trial (RCT), numerous observational studies, and systematic reviews of these studies. Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), change in disease status, QOL, and treatment -related morbidity. A recent meta -analysis that included only an RCT and cohort studies found that RFA was as effective as nephrec tomy for small renal tumors, with a reduction in complications. Another recent meta -analysis found that partial nephrectomy (PN) was superior to ablative techniques (the study included RFA but also cryoablation and microwave ablation) in overall mortality and local recurrence but not in cancer -specific mortality. It also found fewer complications and improved renal 6 function with ablation. A meta -analysis from 2022 found that to (RFA, cryoablation, and microwave ablation) in local re currence. Overall complications, decline in renal function, and cancer -specific mortality rates did not differ between ablation and nephrectomy. Although inconsistent, the evidence does suggest that, for small renal tumors, RFA may result in a similar rate of disease progression with a lower complication rate than nephrectomy. However, comparative trials are needed to determine with greater certainty the effects of these treatments in the same patient population. The evidence is insufficient to determine th at the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Clinical input obtained in 2010 supported use of RFA for localized RCC that is no more than 4 cm in size when preservation of kidney function is necessary, and a standard surgical appr oach is likely to worsen kidney function substantially or when the patient is not considered a surgical candidate. Thus, absent other treatment options, RFA for small renal cell tumors was judged to be medically necessary. The clinical input continues to b e supported by the most recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, Kidney Cancer, Version 1.2022 and the American Urological Association (2017) (see supplemental information). Both guidelines emphasize that the use of RFA is associated with m ore optimal outcomes when tumors are <3 cm. Inoperable Primary Pulmonary and Nonpulmonary Tumors For individuals who have inoperable primary pulmonary tumors or nonpulmonary tumors metastatic to the lung who receive RFA, the evidence includes prospective observational studies and systematic reviews of these studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, QOL, and treatment -related morbidity. A multicenter study found that for tumors less than 3.5 cm in size, RFA can lead to a complete response in as many as 88% of patients for at least 1 year. Two -year survival rates have been reported to range from 41% to 75% in case series, with 5 -year survival rates of 20% to 27%. In general, the evidence suggests that RFA results in adequate survival and tu mor control in patients who are not surgical candidates, with low morbidity rates. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Breast Tumors For individuals who have breast tumors who receive RFA, the evidence includes observational studies and systematic reviews of these studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, QOL, and treatment -related morbidity. Evidence has reported var ied and incomplete ablation rates with concerns about postablation tumor cell viability. Long -term improvements in health outcomes have not been demonstrated. Additionally, available studies do not permit comparisons with conventional breast - conserving pro cedures. Further prospective studies, with long -term follow -up, should focus on whether RFA of the breast for small tumors can provide local control and survival rates compared with conventional breast -conserving treatment. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Benign Thyroid Tumors For individuals who have benign thyroid tumors who receive RFA, the evidence includes RCTs, prospective studies, case series, and systematic reviews of these studies. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, QOL, medication use, and treatment -related morbidity. Systematic reviews have demonstrated that RFA results in a significant reduction in thyroid nodule size with a 2020 review showi ng that these changes remain durable through at least 36 months. Complication rates are generally low but include voice changes. The data are limited by significant heterogeneity in meta - analyses, a lack of generalizability to populations outside Republic of Korea and Italy, and a lack of comparators more relevant to practice in the United States. Further studies comparing RFA to percutaneous ethanol injection or surgery would be more informative in determining the potential utility of RFA in patients with symptomatic or large benign thyroid tumors as these are the recommended treatment options per the American Thyroid Association. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Miscellaneous Solid Tumors 7 For individuals who have miscellaneous tumors (eg, head and neck, thyroid cancer, pancreas) who receive RFA, the evidence includes a few case series, prospective observational studies, and retrospective comparative studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, change in disease status, QOL, and treatment -related morbidity. There is a limited evidence base for these tumor types. Reporting on outcomes or comparisons with other treatments is limited. These studies do not permit conclusions on the health benefits of RFA. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 11/2022 Annual policy review.
