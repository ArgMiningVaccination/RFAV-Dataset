This programme will ultimately target all children 2 -17 years of age with the aim of not only directly protecting the children themselves, but also protecting the remainder of the populat ion (ie elderly) by reducing transmission in the population . This document describes and reports on the cumulative uptake of influenza vaccine during the 2014/15 pilot programme, with a focus on the results from the final end of season data submitted to PHE at school -level between March -April 2015. The school -level data returns presented in this report include additional analysis on consents, refusals, contraindications, and population level ecological predictors of vaccine uptake . An overall uptake of 5 3.2% was achieved f or children of primary and secondary school age (4 - 13 years) vaccinated in 14 geographically discrete pilot areas in England . Uptake varied by programme delivery and year group. Uptake was highest in those areas delivering the programme through schools ( 54.5%) and lowest in areas delivering through primary care based delivery ie pharmacy and/or GP practice (26.8% and 24.4 % respectively ). Overall uptake in primary school children (4 -11 years) was 56.8%, higher than in secondary school children (11 -13 years), where uptake was 49.8%. This difference reflect s the increase in refusal and non -response rates with increasing year group age. Ecological population level predictors of uptake found that lower uptake in both primary and secondary schoo l children was significantly and independently associated with both ethnicity and deprivation . The lowest uptake was reported in the most deprived quintiles of deprivation or areas with the largest proportion of black or minority ethnic groups . Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 5 Background Seasonal influenza is a very common infection among infants and children . Health y children under five years of age have the highest influenza hospital admission rates compared to other age-groups1. The UK has a long standing selective influenza vaccination programme targeted at all those 65 years and over, under 65 and in a clinical risk group, and pregnant women. Based on the recommendations of the JCVI in 2012 , England is in the process of implementing an universal paediatric influenza vaccination prog ramme to ultimately cover all children 2 -17 years of age2. The programme is being introduced incrementally across a number of flu seasons. In 2013/14 vaccination against flu with a newly licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was first offered nationally across the United Kingdom to all chil dren aged two and three years through GP practices . Additionally PHE commissioned a pilot vaccination programme to cover children of primary scho ol-age ( 4-11 years) . The programme ran in geographically distinct pilots areas (Bury, Cumbria, Gateshead, Newham, Havering, South East Essex, and Leicester *). The purpose of the pilots was to undertake an operational evaluat ion including of different modes of vaccine delivery, specifically school based vs . primary care delivery (GP practice/p harmacy). The pilot achieved a final overall uptake of 52.5%, ranging from 3 5.8% to 71.5% between individual pilot areas3. In 2014/15 the national programme was further extended to include vaccination of all children two to four years of age thro ugh GP practices . In addition the 2014/ 15 season saw the extension of the school -age pilot vaccination programme to 14 areas across England targeting a) primary school age children 4 -11 years of age , b) secondary school children aged 11 -13 years or c) both groups. Pilot areas primarily delivered the programme through schools with the exception of two areas which used a pharmacy based model with GP involvement (Cumbria and Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire) . In addition , one local authority (LA) follow ed a primary care GP delivery model (Leed s). London with the exception of Havering LA, covered special schools only. Pilot regions offered LAIV to healthy and at -risk children in whom the vaccine was not contraindicated. At -risk children contraindicated fo r LAIV vaccination were offered quadrivalent inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccine . During the 2014/15 vaccine campaign , cumulative school -level vaccine uptake data was manually submitted through ImmForm by each designated pilot area data provider on a monthly basis. Vaccine uptake was recorded locally at school level and then aggregated by ImmForm by local authority/area team and year group (Annexe A). At the end of the flu season ( March -April), final vaccination data collected at school -level with in each pilot area was submitted to PHE including additional information on consen ts, refusals, and contraindications . *Leicester city, East Rutland Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 6 Methods End of season data collected at a school -level was submitted to PHE between March -April 2015 by data providers for each pilot area. The end of season collection variables requested are outlined in Annexe B . Key i ndicators Uptake End-of-season programme uptake was calculated based on the number of children in the target population who were reported to have received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the campaign period ( 1 September 2014 until 31 January 2015). Where 2nd doses were recorded as delivered through the pilot scheme, they were not counted to prevent duplication. The target population was defined as the number of primary school age children (4 -11 years) born between 2 September 2003 and 01 September 2010 eligible for vaccination in the six primary school pilot areas. The target population for secondary school age children was defined as the number of secondary school age children eligible for vaccination (11 -13 years ) born between 2 September 2001 and 1 September 2003 in the 12 secondary school pilot areas . Predictors of u ptake To assess how population level predictors may be associated with vaccine uptake in 4 -13 year olds, the postcode of each school was matched to vario us predictors available at 2011 census Office for National Statistics (ONS) -defined Lower Super Output Area level ( LSOA ). Each LSOA had a population range of 1,000 - 3,000 and were used to assess potential ecological associations with uptake in 4 -13 year olds4. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is an overall score assigned to each LSOA summarising its relative level of deprivation based on seven topic areas: income, employment, health, education, crime, service access and living environment5. As the value of the score increases, the level of deprivation increases. Information on ethnic constitution of each LSOA is available according to the following categories: White/Mixed/Asian/Black/Other6. The proportion of LSOA classified as belonging in a black or minority ethnic group (%BME, defined as non -white British ) was calculated and, based on the distribution, categorically grouped into quartiles. Information on the religious constitution of each LSOA is available with the categories of Christian/Buddhist/Hindu/Jewish/Muslim/Sikh/Other/None7. Proportions were analysed, focusing on Jewish and Muslim because of the issues reported the previous season around the use of porcine gelatine in the vaccine. The proportion of LSOA identifying as Jewish was grouped into 0% and >0% and Muslim into 0%, 1 -5% and 6%+. Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 7 Classification of the LSOA as rural (To wn and fringe/Village or hamlet/Isolated dwelling) or urban (Major conurbation/Minor conurbation/City and town) was available from the ONS 2011 census8. Vaccine uptake was then calculated by each of these population characteristics. A l inear regression analysis was undertaken to find out if any of the population characteristics were significantly related to uptake. Uptake in primary schools in the pilot areas was linearly regressed against the same population -level variables (pilot site , deprivation, eth nicity, religious constitution and rurality) to determine if changes in uptake could be explained. Variables significant in univariable analysis (p<0.01) were included in a multiple linear regression model to provide adjusted estimates . Model fit was asses sed8. If a variable could be modelled in several ways, the version that resulted in the lowest model Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value was retained. Additionally, stepwise model selection using AIC criteria was used to confirm the final models and t est for interactions, including in the adjusted model if biologically plausible and highly significant (tested with likel ihood ratio tests and p<0.005)8. Consent, refusal, and n on-responders Parental consent forms for flu vaccination were sent to parents through schools . The return of these forms was record ed by the school/data providers and information on consents, refusals, and no returns was submitted to PHE at the end of the season. Not all pilot sites returned consent , refusal and no return data and not a ll schools within each pilot sit e identified these groups consistently. Additionally, some pilot areas merged consent/refusal/no return data for all vaccinating year groups. Cumbria and Arden, Herefordshire and Worcest ershire were excluded from consent analysis, due to the walk in natur e of the pharmacy delivery model . Consent -calculated from number of consent forms returned by all children in a year group, divided by the final denominator for that year group. Consent is defined as direct parental consent to vaccinate. In some cases consents include child ren who are contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV . Refusal - calculated from number of forms returned refusing consent by all children in a year group, divided by the final denominator for that year group. Refusal is recorded as direct refusal to vaccinate. In some cases refusals include children who are contraindicated for the vaccination with LAIV . No return - calculated from the number of forms not returned in a year group (non - responders), divided by the final denominator for that year group. Non -responders were defined as parents that did not return consent forms whose children were subsequently not vaccin ated. Non-responder counts were either provided by the school level data submission or calculated from the final denominator by subtracting the count of consents and refusals. No returns may also include children contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV . Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 8 Contraindications Children contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV ( ie children in clinical risk groups) were identified prior to the use of LAIV in the 2014/15 study. Risk groups are cl inically outlined in Green Book9. The numbers of children contrain dicated for vaccination were recorded, and then aggregated by risk group. Contraindications were split into two groups: Prior Contraindication and On -day Contraindications. The first describes pre -existing contraindications to vaccination that parents were aware of eg previous allergic reaction to a 'flu vaccine. The second describes contraindications described on the day of vaccination eg a child being congested. Not all pilot sites recorded data for all risk groups, and not all schools within each pilot s ite identified risk groups consistent with the end o f season data return variables . Children contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV were either offered quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine on site by providers or referred to their general practice for vaccination. Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 9 Results Uptake An estimated 381,969 primary and secondary school children aged 4 -13 years in the 14 pilot areas received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period 1 September 2014 to 31 January 2015. With an estimated total target population of 718,071, this results in an overall uptake of 53.2%. Overall uptake in primary school children ( 4-11 years ) was 56.8% ranging by pilot area from 32.3% to 63.1% (Table 1) compared to 52.5% in the 2013/2014 season , ranging from 31.8 to 71.5% by pilot area . Cumbria had the lowest final uptake in primary school children at 32.2% (37.3% in 2013/14 pilot) in 2014/15 . Greater Manchester had the highest uptake at 63.1% (63.5% in 2013/14 pilot) Table 1.

Of the 2,676 reporting schools, uptake at school level ranged from 0 to 100% . In the north of England, of the 758 primary and secondary schools reporting vaccine uptake data, median uptake was 57.5% (with interquartile range of 46.3% to 66.7%) (Figure 3). 38 schools reported a vaccine uptake of 5% or less . Figure 3.

Figure 5. Uptake of influenza vaccination in children aged 4 -13 years by schools in Midlands and East of England, 1 September 2014 to 31 January 2015 Predictors of u ptake (school delivery only) 4-11year olds The resu lts of the unadjusted single variable analysis in 4-11 year olds showed that out of the area level characteristics the largest impact was seen for ethnicity and deprivation (Table 3). The more deprived an area, the lower the uptake, with those in the most deprived quintile of deprivation showing a 17 % lower uptake than those in the least deprived quintile. Areas with an ethnic population of 34% or more had a decrease in uptake of 21% compared to areas with a minority population of <5%. In terms of religious beliefs, uptake was 20% lower w hen 6%+ of the LSOA population iden tified as Muslim relative to 0%, and 4% lower if the LSOA contained Jewish residents compared to none . A decrease was seen in urban relative to rural areas, with a difference in uptake of 7%. Finally, uptake by PHE region compared to the North indicate uptake was significantly higher in Midlands and East of England and lowest in London region (Table 3). Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 14 After adjusting for all area level characteristics in the multivariable regression analysis (Figure 6), region, ethnicity and deprivation remained significant predictors of low vaccine uptake. The association was strongest for those in the most deprived quintile . Areas in most deprived quintile of deprivation had a 14 % lower uptake than those in the least deprived quintile. Areas with a black or minority ethnic population of 34% or more had 9% lower uptake compared to areas with a black or minority ethnic population of <5%. The association wi th Muslim populations decreased but remained significant. A reas with a Musli m population of 6%+ had an uptake almost 6% lower than those with 0% Muslim population. Similarly, a significantly lower uptake persisted in urban areas compared to rural (2% lower). And finally, a fter adjusting for area-level characteristics relative to t he North , uptake in Midlands and East of England and London regions was significantly lower, with 2% and 10% lower uptake respectively. These results are similar to those seen in the first year of the pilot vaccination programme in 2013 /148 (Figure 6) , where deprivation, areas with BME >34% and muslim population >5% were all independently associated with low vaccine uptake in children. Figure 6. Adjusted linear regression % uptake change values with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for populatio n-level predictors for 4 -11 year olds resident in 2013/14 vs. 2014/15 pilot areas, England 11-13 year olds As seen for the 4 -11 year olds, the results of the unadjusted single variable analysis in 11 -13 year olds showed that the largest impact in area level characteristics was seen for ethnicity and deprivation (Table 4). The more deprived an area, the lower the uptake, with those in the most deprived quintile of deprivation having 21% lower uptake than those in the least deprived Childhood Flu Vaccination Pilot Programme, England 2014/ 5 15 quintile. Area s with a black or ethnic minority population of 34% or more had almost 23% lower uptake than those with a black or ethnic minority p opulation of <5%. Additionally, uptake was 22% lower when 6%+ of the LSOA population identified as Muslim relative to 0%. Finally by region (relative to the North) uptake was only significantly lower in London. After adjusting for all area level characteristics in the multivariable regression analysis (Figure 7) deprivation and ethnicity remained significant factors along with Muslim religious beliefs. Areas in the most deprived quintile of deprivation had an 11% lower uptake than those areas in the least deprived quintile. Areas with a black or minority ethnic population of 34% or more had 8% lower uptake compared to areas with a black or ethnic minority population of <5% . The association with Muslim populations remained significant , areas with a Muslim population 6%+ had almost 12% lower uptake than those with 0% Muslim population. Though initially insignificant , after adju sting for predictors the impact of Jewish residents became significant . Areas with a Jewish population had almost 6.5% higher uptake than those with no Jewish population . After adjustment, none of the regions showed significant differences in uptake. Figure 7.

Promising uptake levels were achieved across most pilot area s in children of primary and secondary sch ool age (4-13 years ), demonstrating the feasibility of rolling out the programme to further year groups nationally . Uptake was consistently higher in those areas that delivered the programme through schools as compared to pharmacy and GP settings. Refusal and non -response rates increased with increasing age and were higher in certain geographical areas, in particular London. Lower vaccine uptake was found to be significantly associated with increasing deprivation and proportion from a Black and Minority Eth nic group. It is important to note uptake varied by programme delivery and year group. As seen in 2013/14, uptake was lowest in areas delivering their vaccination programme through primary care based delivery ie pharmacy and/or GP clinics8. This mirrors the experience of other programmes that target children of school age such as the HPV vaccine programme, where a school -based delivery model has achieved high levels of coverage in the UK. This highlights the importance of this being the recommended future approach to vaccinate these age -groups. Consent , refusal and non-response rates indicat e that decreasing uptake appear s to be linked mainly to an increase in non -response rates as school year group age increases . Refusal rates were stable across primary s chool year groups with the exception of the reception class (four year olds) while they increased for secondary school years 7 and 8. These differences in response and refusal rates may be a reflection of parent al perceptions of the importanc e of flu vaccination for older children. Younger children are typically more likely to suffer complications from flu than older children, and are therefore a higher risk group12,13. Further work is required to understand and address these differences . Analysis on the ecological predictors of uptake suggest that uptake in primary and secondary school children is significantly and independently associated wit h ethnicity and deprivation, with the lowest upt ake being reported in the most deprived quintile of deprivatio n or areas with a larger black or ethnic minority population. Additionally , areas identifying with the Muslim faith reported significantly lower uptake in both primary and secondary school children. Being in the highest Muslim population tertile had almost the same impact as being in the most deprived quintile. These results are similar to those found in the first year of the pilot vaccination programme in 2013/14, 8. Comparing the 2013/14 and 2014/15 primary school pilot adjusted linear regression analysis, it appears the impact of ethnicity and Muslim population on lower vaccine uptake may have reduced albeit still significant, however it appears the impact of deprivation on vaccine uptake may have i ncreased since 2013/14. It is important to note however that 2013/14 and 2014/15 pilot areas are not identical, with 2014/15 primary pilot areas including additional local authorities. The findings highlight the importance of developing strategies to tackl e these differences. 22 Data on contraindications was variable across pilot areas . However, the most common contraind ications repor ted prior to the day of vaccination were severe ast hma and egg allergy followed by immunosuppression of a family member. An effort should be made during future vaccination programmes to collect information on vaccination in a standardised fashion. In summary, d espite the circulation of drifted A and B influenza strains in the 2014/15 season , the childhood flu vaccination programme continues to show a promising population level impact. With a significant reduction in disease incidence in pilot vs. non -pilot populations where primary school children were not vaccinated11. These findings are si milar to those reported in the first year of the vaccination programme3. Indicators are continually s trengthened through the further roll out of the programme, which is seeing a further extension in the 2015/16 season. From October 2015 all children of sch ool years 1 and 2 age in England have been offered LAIV vaccination mainly through a school -based programme . As seen in previous years, all children aged two, three, and four years on 31 August 2015 have been offered flu vaccination throu gh GPs. Additional ly the five pilot areas that have been piloting the primary school vaccination programme over the past two season s have continue d to offer LAIV to all primary school -age children. The evaluati on of the season will continue to inform the best strategy to roll out influenza vaccination to al l target ages in seasons to come . 23 Acknowledgements The Respiratory Diseases Department would like to thank everyone that contributed to this report and specifically acknowledge : all the PHE and NHS staff in each of the 14 pilot areas who were responsible for planning and delivering the LAIV pilot programme in primary and/or secondary schools children and providing the end of season data return to run this report all the ImmForm sta ff that provided and supported the online survey our colleague Fiona Warburton from the PHE Colindale statistics department for running the logistic regression analysis on t he predictors of vaccine uptake 24 References 1.
