It is designed to utilize nutrients as a means to gain energy, grow, rebuild, and heal. Like a car burns gas to travel from one place to another, our bodies are fueled by the food that we eat and our choice of food is reflected in how our bodies preform. This month I would like to talk about the body's need to cleanse. Many of the issues that we suffer from are a result of bad choices that we have been making for several years, or maybe our whole lives. The build-up of toxins along with over-consumption of sugars and carbohydrates wear and tear on your system, causing it to not function properly with all of the \"poisonous\" overload. Toxic Build-Up There is a lot of information circulating these days warning us to avoid pollution. Our common sense will confirm this necessity as we learn more about the lack of cleanliness in the air that we breathe. Polluted air is practically unavoidable in heavily populated regions. It is everywhere we go. From the fabrics we wear, to what we drive; from where we live to what we eat. Although it is minimal in certain environments, it seems impossible to escape even the smallest quantities. Despite this fact, we have the ability to equip ourselves with a body that will effectively get rid of toxins. Damaged cells that have been polluted throughout the day will be regenerated if our filters are functioning optimally. A healthy body will be equipped and well-prepared to guard our systems from harmful compromise. This is the only way we can truly protect ourselves from toxic pollutants. Digestion What we eat and how our body digests food is an important factor in every aspect of our health. All systems in our body gain fuel to function through the nutrients that we absorb through our diet. We shouldn't be surprised when we make bad food choices then suffer from random health issues. Like any system of energy combustion, foods that are consumed by us will leave a residue on the wall of our digestive tract, as well as on the lining of organs that filter blood: The liver, kidneys, lungs and lymphatic glands. This build-up of residue becomes toxic over time, depleting the efficiency with which each organ has the ability to function. The absorption of vital nutrients that would come from healthy food diminishes. That 'crisp' vitality wanes, and the body begins to fatigue, resulting in a predisposition for illness and injury. Our intestinal tract is lined with immune receptors. A thickening layer of pollutant residue increases the chances of illnesses from the common cold, diarrhea and constipation, to muscular skeletal aches and complications. How to Detox There are many ways to detox our bodies, however it is extremely important to research your chosen method thoroughly, and understand the process and effects of each one. Some forms of detoxification are as follows: - Fasting-Water Detox: This is a 12 - 24 hour detoxification that is focused on water consumption only. It can be difficult because the lack of solid nutrients can make you feel very tired and weak. It is recommended that you arrange to have the day at home or be in a relaxed environment if you decide to do a water detox. - Fasting-Juice Detox: A Juice detox is a flexible detoxification method that can last from one day to several. This is a similar method to the water detox listed above, however, juices are added to the mix. You may drink as much and as often as you wish, customizing your juices with specific fruit, vegetables and legumes. Celery, cucumber, spinach, kale and other chlorophyll rich leafy greens are excellent additions to juicing mixes. You should use the best quality seasonal products you can find. - Herbal Fiber Detox: This is a more aggressive form of detox. It includes drinking a shake made from a herbal fiber powder that will induce bowel movements, ridding the body of impurities. Care must be taken, as mild cramping can occur. This side effect will decrease to none as the body cleanses. You should consume the shakes 20-30 minutes before a healthy meal to avoid any interference with the normal digestion of food. Individuals should really consider all aspects of their health and well-being when considering a detox plan. It should be understood that you need to commit yourself to a certain length of time. Positive results come from careful selection of your foods and the possibility of any sources that may cause allergies or sensitivities to your digestive system. Some common suspects may be corn, soy, wheat products, eggs, peanuts, tomatoes, chocolate, etc. Always consider a higher content and range of vegetables, lean red meats, and non-hormone treated poultry and fish. Low sugar fruits like blueberries, green apples, plums or pears are also ideal additions to a regular cleansing diet. Are you committed to your health? The purification of your digestive system will take time and effort on your behalf, but there is truly no price on vitality and good health. I would like to suggest that a customized 21-day program might be just the thing for youl! This program is broken into 3 phases. It focuses on individual organs and systems. It will enable the body to support itself during the cleanse and create solid foundations for continuing digestive health. During Phase I (the first 10 days) the Liver is targeted, encouraging the binding of toxins and getting them ready for disposal. Throughout Phase I, it is important to cut out potential allergens. You will still consume simple foods such as lentils along with supportive protein drinks and abundant amounts of vegetables, and soups. Minimal fruit intake will help maintain low sugar levels. Plenty of pure spring water and green tea is also recommended. Day 11 marks the beginning of Phase II. Fish and chicken are now re-introduced into the menu, however, red meat is still completely avoided. As the toxins began removal via bowel movements in the previous 10 days, your body systems are now able to handle these lighter animal proteins. By now, noticeable changes are now taking place. Urination is cleaner and clearer, and breathing and lung capacity is increased. The muscular and skeletal system is repairing faster, resulting in greater flexibility and motion. Day 21 marks the ending of phase II with a complete sense of rejuvenation! The absolute key to this kind of detoxification, or any similar program, is the slow reintroduction of foods that have possibly caused allergies or sensitivity in the past. I believe that this is the most important factor while purifying body systems. Accompanied by a healthy lifestyle of physical and mental exercise, it is easy to avoid the 'binge' phenomenon that people can fall into so often after a detox. Breathing exercises, yoga, sauna baths, massage and lymphatic drainage are all recommended to accompany this kind of serious detoxification program.

I use a Systems Survey form to define the major stressors that the body is suffering from. When you fill out this form again at the end of the program, you will be able to see how much progress you've made! Reintroduce one food at a time every 2 days to see if any of your previous symptoms return. If they do, then you will have a great system to identify what causes intestinal bloating, diarrhea, constipation, headaches, etc. that you may have suffered from previously. If you are interested in doing a detox, let us know! We would love to assist you through the process of purifying your body to reach optimal vitality!
