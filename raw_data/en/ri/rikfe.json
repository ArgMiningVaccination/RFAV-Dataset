The company says there are about 600 drops per bottle. I have no bloodwork or amazing bursts of energy to prove it's \"working\", but for what placebo/peace-of-mind is worth, I've been taking it anyway with hopes to have adequate iron stores prior to birth (in addition to an excellent diet). - Earthley Energy Plus I love it! I have low iron and ferritin. I take half a dropper morning and night and can function! I love the plant based ingredients. I can just take it plain (not in food or drink) because it tastes fine. Better than any iron I've tried!
