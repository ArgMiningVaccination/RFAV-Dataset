Regaining mobility and self care [Manage high blood sugar and insulin resistance ](#blood-sugar) On this page Nutrition after surgery The type of surgery you have will determine what and when you can eat after surgery. Surgeries involving the mouth, throat, abdomen, or digestive tract will likely lead to more restricted diets. [](javascript:void(0)) Adding amino acids to tube feeding for a week after gastrointestinal surgery led to less protein loss and a smaller impact on nitrogen balance (preliminary evidencesignificant effects in small or poorly designed clinical studies OR conflicting results in adequate studies but a preponderance of evidence of an effect (this is the CancerChoices definition; other researchers and studies may define this differently)). - Less protein loss and a smaller impact on nitrogen balance after gastrointestinal surgery among people treated with low-energy tube feeding (parenteral nutrition) with amino acids for 7 days after surgery compared to parenteral nutrition without amino acids in a controlled triala study design in which people are assigned to either an experimental group or a control group to compare the outcomes from different treatment; assignment is not random, and so this is not as strong a study design as a randomized controlled trial, but still stronger than an uncontrolled trial [1]L\u00f3pez Hell\u00edn J, Baena-Fustegueras JA, Sab\u00edn-Urk\u00eda P, Schwartz-Riera modulation of protein metabolism after gastrointestinal surgery](https://www.nature.com/articles/1602732). European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2008;62(2):254-262. Once you are able to progress beyond clear liquids, an anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and sources of high quality protein for at least two weeks (but ideally six weeks) after surgery is recommended by experts in integrative oncology, such as Barbara MacDonald, ND, LAc. [2]MacDonald B. [The Breast Cancer Companion: A Complementary Care Manual: Third Edition](http://drbarbmacdonald.com/book/). (self-published, Amazon, 2016). Ask your surgeon or registered dietician about dietary restrictions, such as a diet low in fiber or low in salt, as you begin to eat a variety of foods again. Pain control after surgery Pain after surgery is common. [3]Wang L, Cohen JC et al. [Prevalence and intensity of persistent post-surgical pain following breast cancer surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies](https://www.bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007-0912(20)30344-5/fulltext). British Journal of Anaesthesia. 2020 Sep;125(3):346-357. Our Pain handbook outlines contributors to pain and how to manage pain with conventionalthe medical care offered by conventionally trained physicians and most hospitals; examples are prescription drugs and physical therapy, complementaryin cancer care, complementary care involves the use of therapies intended to enhance or add to standard conventional treatments; examples include supplements, mind-body approaches such as yoga or psychosocial therapy, and acupuncture, and self carelifestyle actions and behaviors that may impact cancer outcomes; examples include eating health-promoting foods, limiting alcohol, increasing physical activity, and managing stress. Pain control not only promotes better quality of life, but can impact your body terrainthe internal conditions of your body, including nutritional status, fitness, blood sugar balance, hormone balance, inflammation and more. For example, pain increases insulin resistance after surgery. [4]Ljungqvist J. [Insulin resistance in surgery](https://www.elsevier.es/index.php?p=revista&pRevista=pdf-simple&pii=X2444050716571238&r=237). Cirug\u00eda y Cirujanos. 2016;84(Supl 1):51-54.

Considerations with opioids Opioids are an important option in pain management and recovery after surgery. Opioids including morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine are often used to manage pain. Use may bring on side effects such as these: [5]Wiffen PJ, Derry S, Moore RA. [Impact of morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone or codeine on patient consciousness, appetite and thirst when used to treat cancer pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483540/). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 2014 May 29;2014(5):CD011056. - Constipation - Urinary retention - Sleepiness (somnolence) - Nausea - Vomiting - Loss of appetite (anorexia) - Dry mouth - Dizziness - Some evidence suggests they may have a negative effect on inflammation and wound healing Opioids also have the potential to become addictive. Impacts on immune function Opioids impair immune function, a body terrain factor connected to cancer. Preliminary evidencesignificant effects in small or poorly designed clinical studies OR conflicting results in adequate studies but a preponderance of evidence of an effect (this is the CancerChoices definition; other researchers and studies may define this differently) of disruption of the immune system from use or sudden withdrawal from opioids; we advise against withdrawing abruptly from opiates and urge you to seek medical supervision for weaning off any opioids. Impacts on cancer outcomes Minimizing opioid use may also improve your long-term cancer outcomes. See [Pain ](https://cancerchoices.org/side-effect/pain/why-is-managing-pain-important/) for the evidence supporting these statements on immune function and cancer outcomes. Opioids: bottom line In light of both benefits and risks of opioid use, we recommend they be used when necessary but in the smallest amount and for the shortest period possible. We encourage you to consider non-opioid options such as ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) when available. Other non-traditional options for pain control are available. [](javascript:void(0)) When used skillfully, non-opioid options can be effective. - Substantially less opioid use, low pain scores, and high satisfaction scores after major urologic cancer surgery among people receiving a preadmission educational handout, postdischarge instructions for using nonopioid analgesics, and no routine opioid prescriptions compared to receiving opioid prescriptions at the prescribers' discretion in a large controlled triala study design in which people are assigned to either an experimental group or a control group to compare the outcomes from different treatment; assignment is not random, and so this is not as strong a study design as a randomized controlled trial, but still stronger than an uncontrolled trial [6]Mian BM, Singh Z et al. [Implementation and assessment of no opioid prescription strategy at discharge after major urologic cancer surgery](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2801213). JAMA Surgery. 2023 Feb 8:e227652. Managing pain without drugs In experienced hands, most of these approaches present little risk and may be beneficial. They may be a good substitute for or addition to conventional pain management options. We present complementary therapies supported by evidence for managing pain, especially pain related to surgery. We don't have a lot of evidence, but this does not mean these approaches will not benefit you. Consider both potential benefits and risks of any pain therapies you use. Full details of the evidence are within each therapy review, available through the image links. A therapy may show a stronger effect or have more evidence in some situations than in others. Good or modest evidence of benefit Good evidencesignificant effects in one large or several mid-sized and well-designed clinical studies (randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate placebo or other strong comparison control or observational studies that control for confounds) (this is the CancerChoices definition; other researchers and studies may define this differently) indicates a relatively high degree of confidence that the therapy is linked to the outcomes as noted. Modest evidencesignificant effects in at least three small but well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or one or more well-designed, mid-sized clinical studies of reasonably good quality (RCTs or observational studies), or several small studies aggregated into a meta-analysis (this is the CancerChoices definition; other researchers and studies may define this differently) means several smaller or at least one large study have found the effect described. The evidence supporting our assessments is in the reviews available through the image links. We summarize effects on pain specifically related to surgery here.

Some pain control methods promote body terrain imbalances, while others promote balance. Expert approach: Keith Block, MD Several imbalances in your body terrain can make your wounds slower to heal, your body more susceptible to infection, and/or your body terrain more favorable to cancer. Balancing these factors in relation to surgery, wound healing, and reducing recurrence risk is especially important: - Chronic inflammation - Insulin resistance/blood sugar - Obesity - Imbalanced stress chemistry, including hormones/melatonin - Oxidation - Compromised immunity, such as from chemotherapy, surgery, anesthesia, or opioid use - Impaired blood clotting (coagulopathy) Integrative physician and CancerChoices advisor Keith Block, MD, recommends an integrative program to address these terrain factors in chapters 14-19 of his book [Life over Cancer: The Block Center Program for Integrative Cancer Care](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/14959/life-over-cancer-by-keith-i-block-md-foreword-by-andrew-weil-md/). Immune function Preserving immune function is important for healing. Some pain management techniques may improve immune function.

Call your physician immediately if you show any signs of infection\u2014an increase of redness, swelling, pain or discharge from your wound. Avoid contact with soil for two or more weeks after surgery. Consult an integrative physician or licensed naturopath (preferably one who is certified in oncology) to recommend approaches to maintain healthy immune function to improve your wound healing and reduce your risk of infection. In the weeks following your surgery, if you need a medical procedure that may introduce bacteria to the body, check with your surgeon about using antibiotics to prevent infection. Morphine\u2014and perhaps other opioids\u2014may increase your susceptibility to infection. [7]Wang J, Barke RA, Charboneau R, Roy S. [Morphine impairs host innate immune response and increases susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection](http://www.jimmunol.org/content/174/1/426.long). Journal of Immunology. Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology. 2011 Dec;6(4):490-502. Alternatives to pain management (above) can reduce this risk. Some complementary therapies may promote wound healing.
