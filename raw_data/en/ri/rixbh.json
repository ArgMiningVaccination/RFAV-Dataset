There are numerous proven benefits associated with acupuncture therapy, especially when it comes to addiction treatment. At [Guardian Recovery Network](https://www.guardianrecoverynetwork.com/) we utilize acupuncture therapy as part of our highly integrated, holistically-based recovery program. According to an article published by John Hopkins Medicine, there are over 2,000 [acupuncture pressure points](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture) in the human body, and these points are interconnected by a series of meridians (or pathways). These meridians create a flow of energy that is largely responsible for overall health and well-being, and applying acupuncture to certain points along these meridians can improve energy flow and contribute to an improvement of physical, mental and emotional wellness. In the year 1997 the National Institute of Health officially accepted acupuncture therapy as a viable form of [complementary therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4822281/), according to an article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information titled, \"Acupuncture Therapy for Drug Addiction.\" This study suggests that acupuncture has been proven to increase the levels of dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine present in the system, which can diminish psychological drug cravings and help alleviate the more uncomfortable symptoms associated with acute and post-acute drug withdrawal. While acupuncture therapy is an effective method of holistic treatment, it is important to understand that it does not serve as a stand-alone solution for substance abuse or dependence. At Guardian Recovery Network we incorporate acupuncture into our comprehensive treatment plan, tackling the physical, emotional and mental implications of active addiction through a combination of traditional and holistic therapies. Acupuncture and Addiction Treatment At Guardian Recovery Network we work closely with several highly experienced and licensed acupuncturists who practice aural acupuncture therapy on clients in a safe and closely monitored setting. According to Traditional Chinese medicine, there are five predominant acupuncture pressure points, each providing a different benefit. These include: - The Sympathetic Point (also known as the Autonomic Point): This point helps facilitate relaxation and calms the central nervous system. - The Lung Point: The lung point helps facilitate the recovery of damaged lung tissue while working to relieve feelings of deep sadness and grief. - The Liver Point: When needles are inserted into the Liver Point, mood is stabilized, irritability and aggression are alleviated and toxins are removed from the blood and from the liver (this can be especially beneficial to people recovering from alcoholism). - Shen Men (or \"The Spirit Gate\"): This point is said to decrease the anxiety that often goes hand-in-hand with drug and alcohol withdrawal. - The Kidney Point: In addition to alleviating fear and anxiety, this point is said to facilitate the reparation of all vital organs. Active addiction severely impairs vital organ function, and in order for comprehensive recovery to be achieved, special attention must be paid to the restoration of physical health. At Guardian Recovery Network we tackle physical healing through a combination of clinical, medical and holistic methods. The Benefits of Acupuncture Therapy Acupuncture therapy is a safe and non-invasive method of craving reduction and withdrawal symptom alleviation. Numerous studies have been conducted on the efficacy of this holistic treatment method for the treatment of substance abuse and dependence, and at Guardian Recovery Network we focus on applying a combination of evidence-based therapies. There are many proven benefits of acupuncture therapy, including: - The reduction of intense psychological cravings that often lead to relapse - The alleviation of uncomfortable physical withdrawal symptoms, including persistent headaches, insomnia, gastrointestinal issues, cold sweats and general feelings of pain and discomfort Our Drug & Alcohol Treatment Services Include - Emotional regulation (and the alleviation of disruptive psychological symptoms like depression and anxiety) - Regulating sleep patterns and helping facilitate calmness and relaxation - Increasing the ability to retain therapeutic treatment This is only one of the holistically-based therapies we employ as part of our integrated treatment program.
