This medical practice has its own unique methods and values. Although All opathic medical approach is dominant in Sri Lanka, Ayurvedic medicine is also practiced widely in society and has successfully maintained its historical social recognition. In Sri Lanka, people believe that herbal medicine can cure majority of their sicknesses. The main objective of this project is to collect specific data systematically, to identify and understand the values and beliefs in Ayurvedic medicine and its approach in treating and curing three specific diseases that are considered to have success ful treatment methods. Three diseases are: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia and Diabetes Mellitus. The main involvement of this project is scientific fact finding through analysis of data, collected through available literature, observations and interviewing t echniques. The project focuses on two main frames. First is to explore treatment methods, medications, pharmacological values and second, to holistically investigate values and beliefs contributed to the claimed success of Ayurvedic medicine. Though there are some research papers published on plural approach and existence of Ayurvedic medicine in Sri Lanka, it is almost impossible to access any published literature or findings of research conducted on the treatment methods for these three diseases. This pro ject focuses on these three diseases because, my initial investigation through discussing with the Commissioner of Western Province, Ministry of Indigenous Medicine , Sri Lanka, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri, confirmed that the Ayurvedic hospitals are treating these three diseases successfully and hence have managed to win popularity. I will gear this project to collect the information on these diseases, and collect information on values and beliefs thus focusing the project in the above two frames. Background My roots were in Sri Lanka until I reached 18 years. Ayurvedic medical strategy always fascinated me. The belief in the society regarding the curable power of Ayurvedic medicine made me enthusiastic and I developed a desire to investigate the basis of this medical approach. In my childhood, my grandmother used to relate stories about this subject as her uncle had been an Ayurvedic doctor. She used to tell me about leaches, and traditional herbs used to cure diseases such as boils or blood poisoning, arthriti s and vascular problems. Further, in her house there had been Ayurvedic literature on ola leaf manuscripts which elaborately explained the methods for treating diseases. She considered those as very precious because they were family inherited and some bein g secrets. Further, her uncle had been respected and honored by the villagers because of his medical ethics and values. Ayurvedic medical service was delivered regardless of any monetary benefits. This childhood environment made me realize that Ayurvedic medicine possessed a unique curing Jithma Abeykoon 2 power together with its own values and beliefs in delivering medical care. It is also evident that the collectivistic cultural qualities in Sri Lankan society have laid the foundation in deriving these ethics and qualities associated with this medical approach. There were incidents that I have heard about curing diseases where Allopathic medicine had failed to cure. Initially, I thought these as just beliefs lacking much scientific validity, but this school of thoughts wa s changed through my own experience. In my childhood, when allergic and asthmatic conditions worsened, my parents used to take me to Ayurvedic doctors because, for these types of diseases people preferred natural herbs to western medicine. Those doctors always issued syrup made out of many herbs from their own dispensaries which gave me relief. Also, there was a time my father was suffering from a chronic pain in his ankle for about 3 years. Initially , he got Allopathic medications but it failed to cure t he illness. Then he consulted an Ayurvedic doctor. I was with him when he went to this doctor's clinic which was his residence, an average house with herbs and ointment , different sizes of bottles, packed on cabinets. The doctor inquired about the history and examined the ankle by using palpation and percussion methods. After a while he sternly uttered that he could cure the sickness completely. Then he gave an ointment to apply daily at night for three weeks and advised to keep the affected area warm. That medicine cured his sickness completely. There are incidents where Ayurvedic medicine competently corrected dislocations and unhealed fractures. It claim s that it can remove eye cataract without surgery. There are many incidents where Ayurvedic medicine cu red strokes. These incidents gave me the insight to the strength and power of the curing methods and techniques of Ayurvedic medicine and I was motivated to investigate the value of those which might add benefit to Allopathic medical sciences as well . There are some researches, conducted by university students, available and accessible through the web. Ediriweera et.el found that Hemiplegis is successfully cured by Ayurvedic Medicine 4. Weerasinghe et.el states Ayurvedic medicine is popular on treating snake bites, paralysis and fractures7. Mano et.el tests with mice found that the herbs used in treating diabetes can reduce the blood sugar levels5. However, the well claimed treating methods on above mentioned three sicknesses are not explicitly researched o r published. Taking these facts into consideration, I was determined to explore further and it was my desire to investigate any valuable medicines, methods, values and beliefs which are practiced in this system to treat diseases. I feel I have the required knowledge to explore the scientific aspect of Ayurvedic medicine in treating and curing the diseases mentioned and now it is the opportune time for me to convert my desire in to practice. Project explanation Before proceeding to actual project explanation, I would like to shed some light on the benefits Jithma Abeykoon 3 and the potential that this project can carry to Sri Lanka and to the USA as well. Through literature reviews I have found some facts on Ayurvedic and Allopathic medicine prevailing in Sri Lanka, because those as institutions are linked to the social, economic and political structure of the society1. Dr. Diyanath Samarasinghe, a profound psychiatrist, being a critique to the paper published by Judith and Themothy2, states that health planners in under developed countries are often faced with the difficult problem of what role they should assign to traditional therapists. Further, the government wants to decide whether or not Ayurvedic doctors be used to meet the severe shortfall of Allopathic medica l doctors in primary care 3. Some scientific findings on the methods and success of treatments could help in this health planning decision making process. Further, raising the awareness about these treating strategies and relevant medications with a scienti fic backgro und can contribute positively to Allopathic medicine. With this potential, now I will proceed to explain the project. As I have explained, I will be investigating on how Ayurvedic medicine treats the three distinct diseases: Hypertension, Hyp erlipidemia and Diabetes Mellitus and the values and beliefs associated with the system. I would like to divide this project in to two main focuses. The first is to identify the treatment processes and the second to analyze and understand the overall values and beliefs of Ayurvedic medical practice. I wish to collect data through literature reviews, interviews and observations from three different reputable sources. First source is medical practitioners and patients in Ayurvedic hospitals and clinics. There are Ayurvedic licensed medical doctors practicing in different parts of the country. I will be choosing two reputable Ayurvedic doctors to obtain information. In Ayurvedic medicine the treatment strategies, methods and equipment used might vary from one practitioner to another. Due to this heterogeneity interviewees need to be selected to represent the entire population. I will be selecting two doctors from different parts of the country. The second source will be from the lecturers in the College of Indigenous Medicine (CIM) established under the Institute of Indigenous Medicine of Sri Lanka (IIMSL). There are three CIMs in Sri Lanka and I will be choosing the one in Colombo at Nawala, Reajagiriya. The third source is from researchers in Bandaranayake Ayur veda Research Institute (BARI) of the IIMSL , located in the suburbs of Colombo. The contact details of these institutes and doctors are given in Annex 1. I have contacted the director of the college of indigenous medicine , Dr. R.A Jayasinghe and he has giv en me the assurance and confirmation of the availability of lecturers whom I can interview and libr ary sources which I can utilize to obtain data for my project. Further I have obtained the permission from the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine, Sri Lanka to carry out this project and this permission will grant me the access to lecturers and library sources in CIM and to researcher s in BARI to obtain data. This multi- source data collection will enable me to gather a conclusive dataset on the two focuses of my project. The purpose of obtaining information from many sources is to be assured that my Jithma Abeykoon 4 data is reliable and valid. The findings of the first focus of the project will be systematically documented. This documentation is detailed in Annex 2. Under the s econd focus I will investigate the beliefs and values in Ayurvedic medicine that contribute to the success of curing the diseases. The data for this section will be collected by interviewing the two Ayurvedic medical pract itioners and patients in the hospi tal where they practice. The contact i nformation of the two Ayurvedic medical practitioners and the address of the hospital are mentioned in Annex 1. The interviews will be conducted through structured conversations in a casual manner to avoid difficulties and stress to the interviewee and will be conducted using a structured guideline to obtain answers to the specific questions on values and beliefs given in Annex 3. By analyzing the answers to these questions, I will be able to obtain information on belie fs and values of Ayurvedic medicine in a holistic manner. Detailed time line of the project is given in Annex 4. Methods This project will be conducted through three main methods to gather data. They are literature reviews, use of interviewing techniques and visual observation. Given the fact finding nature of the project, I will not involve in sophisticated statistical analysis. Literature review will be done through National Ayurvedic and Allopathic medical libraries in Sri Lanka. This review w ill be focused to the research findings and published articles relevant to the three diseases and data available on pharmacological values of the herbs used in treatments. To obtain data on these three pathological conditions and on values and beliefs, visual observations will be carried out by shadowing the two Ayurvedic medical practitioners in their clinics . I will also be interviewing lecturers who conduct classes and research personnel and the two licensed Ayurvedic medical practitioners. The access to in terview the lecturers and research personnel has been obtained with the perm ission of Dr. Nimal Karunasiri and his permission letter will be attached in Annex 5. Further , in Annex 5, I have also attached the letters from the two medical practitioners who have agreed to guide me and support me throughout this project by facilitating shadowing events , patient interviews and sources to obtain data such as medical libraries and self -interviews. As the above three ins titutions are located within a 30 miles ra dius from my former residence, I will be commuting to these places during weekdays and probably be spending most of my time in clinics and hospitals with interviews, shadowing, observations and reading. There is a public transport system in Sri Lanka and also an affordable private transport system which I will be making use of. The systematic documentation of the diseases will include both categorical and numerical data. The numerical data for item #8 listed in Annex 2, w ill contain the number of patients seeking Jithma Abeykoon 5 treatment, their economic, social and educational background and success rates for the three diseases. Given the limited time period, retrospective data which will be obtained through BARI and CIM, will be utilized . The documentation of the rest, from items #1 - #7 shown in Annex 2, will be categorical data . The documentation of values and beliefs will mostly be categorical data as this section will be framed by the questionnaire mentioned in the Annex 3. Systematic documentation will be done by using the format mentioned in Annex 2, which will also include visuals whenever possible. One of the ways to obtain the pharmacological values of specific herbs and their ability to cure sicknesses will be interviewing the two Ayurvedic medical practition ers, profound faculty members and researchers in the CIMs and BARI respectively. Subsequently, attempts will be made to clarify details through library resources. As I have well established roots in Sri Lanka, logistics, accommodation and contacts of mentors and institutes can be obtained without difficulty. I can get free accommodation in my former residence, located 15 miles away from CIM and BARI. I have informed the IIMSL, BARI and CIM and have obtained contact information and permission to collect data for my project. I will also access Allopathic medical libraries in Sri Lanka to gather information on Ayurvedic medical strategies as these libraries have different sections compiling literature of Ayurvedic medicine. This access will be obtained throug h a licensed Allopathic medical practitioner, who is my aunt, a consultant ENT surgeon in Colombo South teaching hospital in Sri Lanka. Through my social connections in Sri Lanka , I have contacted the Ayurvedic Commissioner of Western Province, Minist ry of Indigenous Medicine, Sri Lanka, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri and two other licensed Ayurvedic doctors who have given me written assurance on the support and assistance they could extend to carry out this project . Further, Dr. Nimal Karunasiri has given me pe rmission to conduct this project in Sri Lanka and to access Ayurvedic medical literature and other resources in the BARI, and CIMs and connected hospitals. The contact information of these pe rsonnel is given in Annex 1. Expense The budget for this proje ct is roughly calculated as follows. Expense Amount (SLRs) Amount ($) Travel by Air 1700 Jithma Abeykoon 6 Accommodation 5,000 50 Food 30,000 300 Transportation 10,000 100 Office ware (compute access, printing, etc) 5,000 50 Miscellaneous 20,000 200 Total 2400 Works Cited 1.
