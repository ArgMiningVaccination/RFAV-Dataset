Hazard Assessments This manual includes information on safe laboratory practices, the use of engineering controls, selection and proper use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedure s, use and storage of chemicals, and the proper methods of waste disposal . This information is intended to be a resource and to help laboratory personnel manage hazards and mitigate associated risks . In view of the wide va riety of chemical pro ducts handled and equipment used in labora tories, it should not be assumed that the precautions and requirements stated in t his manual are all - inclusi ve. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to learn about the hazards of chemical 1 Each laboratory must provide supplemental laboratory -specific documents, as needed and required. Maintenance of this information may be hardcopy and/or electronic at the discretion of each laboratory provided that all components are readily available. 4 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 products and laboratory equipment before handling or using them . Principal Investigators (PIs) and Laboratory Supervisors must provide laboratory- specific supplemental information to augment the manual (e.g. written standard operating procedures (SOPs) , laboratory equipment manuals, safety data sheets, training records, etc.) . Laboratory operations that use lasers, radioactive materials , radiation producing machines, or include biolog ical hazards, or shop activities must follow additional guidelines outlined in the associated hazard -specific UC Davis Safety Manuals and P rograms (e.g. Radiation Safety Manual , Laser Safety Manual , Biosafety Program , Shop Safety Manual , etc.). Content covered by other UC Davis Safety M anuals is not included in this manual except as necessary. 1. Departmental Injury and Illness Prevention Program The development and implement ation of the Department's Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) is a key step in strengthening the safety culture in the research laboratories . Every California employer is required by CCR, Title 8, Section 3203 (8 CCR \u00a7 3203) t o have an effective written IIPP . An effect ive Injury and Illness Prevention Program must be in writing and include the following elements: 1. Management commitment/assignment of responsibilities 2. Safety communications system with employees 3. System for assuring employee compliance with safe work prac tices 4. Scheduled inspections/evaluation system 5. Accident Investigation 6. Procedures for correcting unsafe/unhealthy conditions 7. Safety and health training and instruction 8. Recordkeeping and documentation An IIPP provides a framework for departments to provide their employees with equipment and information necessary to work safely within their specific work environments . A well -integrated IIPP provides the information required to monitor activities and resources to reduce the risk of workplace injury and illness to maintain a safe work environment. Each UC Davis department is required to establish and implement a n IIPP . EH&S, in accordance with and 8 CCR \u00a7 3203, have provided additional information for reference and guidance. Please contact iipp@ucdavis.edu with any questions. 5 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 2. Chemical Safety The UC Davis Chemical Hygiene Plan ( CHP ) establishes a formal written program for laboratory personnel - including, but not limited to, faculty, staff, students and visiting scholars - for use to protect against adverse health effects and safety hazards associated with the use, storage, and disposal of chemicals . The campus CHP must be made available to all laboratory personnel working with hazardous chemicals as required in CCR, Title 8, Section 5191 \"The Lab Standard\" . Personnel within a laboratory, or those whose work activities are research -related and involve the use of hazardous chemicals, are subject to the requirements of the campus CHP . The campus CHP is now a component of this laboratory safety manual, providing general guidelines for managing laboratory hazardous chemicals . Any changes to the campus CHP are reviewed and approved by the Chemical and Laboratory Safety Committee (CLSC). Most l aboratories are not required to develop or repr oduce this information in a site-specific CHP. In some cases, laboratories may be required to develop a Laboratory Safety Plan . More information on the L aboratory Safety Plan is available starting on page 16 . However, i ndividual laboratories will need to augment the UC Davis Chemical Hygiene Plan with their lab-specific SOPs and training records to satisf y the campus CHP components necessary for their specific work environment, activities , and hazards . Note in instances where a laboratory maintains accreditation through other state or federal agencies, the requirements of those accreditations augment the campus CHP for that work environment . Additional guidance for clinical medical diagnostic laboratories is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on recommendation of the Biosafety Blue Ribbon Panel. 3. Biosafety The Biological Safety (Biosafety) Office oversees the safe use of infectious biological agents, recombinant or synthetic nuclei c acids (rDNA), and the propagation and release of recombinant organisms including plants, animals, and microbial agents as part of research at UC Davis, as required by PPM 290- 55. No work with infectious biological agents or rDNA is permitted on the UC Davis campus prior to approval of a Biological Use Authorization (BUA) . The BUA approval proc ess by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) is based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute s of Health . Contact EH&S for additional information on the Biosafety program via biosafety@ucdavis.edu or (530) 752- 1493. 4. Radiation Safety The Radiation Safety Program oversees the safe use of radioactive materials , x-ray producing machines, and high intensity light sources that include lasers . Three areas of radiologi cal safety covered by this program include: A. Radioactive Materials B. X-ray Producing Machines C. High Intensity Light Sources/Lasers 6 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 NO WORK with these materials and equipment can be performed on campus prior to approval of a Radiation Use Authorization, as required by PPM 290- 75. Contact radsafety@ucdavis.edu or at (530) 752- 1493 for more information regarding the se programs, manuals, and the application/approval process . 5. Animal Care and Use Use of animals in research and teaching activities at UC Davis is governed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC) . This committee is tasked with assuring complete and adequate review of animal facilities, laboratory/study areas, procedures, and animal care and use protocols, consistent with the requirements of PPM 290- 30. Contact the IACUC office via iacuc- staff@ucdavis.edu or (530) 752- 2364 for additional guidance. 6. Shop Safety Use of hazardous materials and equipment in shop environments is governed by the UC Davis Shop Safety Committee . This committee is tasked with e stablish ing campus policies and procedures for the acquisition and safe use of equipment in shop settings, including engineering and administrative control measures and required personal protective equipment to minimize occupational injuries or illnesses , consistent with the requirements of PPM 290- 58. Contact shopsafety@ucdavis.edu or ( 530) 752- 1493 for additional guidance. 7. Safety Training & Record keeping Effective training is a critical component of a safe work environment . All employees mus t be trained in general s afe work practices and be given specific instructions on hazards unique to their job assignment and laboratory. Achieving safety training requirements is a cooperative teamwork effort by Departments, PIs, Laboratory Supe rvisors, Laboratory Safety Officers, L aboratory Personnel, and EH&S . It is strongly recommended that PIs assign a designated safety person for their lab , and support and empower this person/role . The designated safety person should coordinate initial and refresher training and be a point of contact for inspections. The UC Davis Chemical and Laboratory Safety Committee (CLSC) approved a Safety Training Matrix for Laboratory Personnel for PIs and Laboratory Supervisors to use in determin ing the required safety training courses for their research activities. Furthermore, the CLSC approved a Site-Specific Safety Orientation & Training Checklist for New Laboratory Personnel to document that all personnel have been trained on topics that include the location and use of fire alarms, eye washes and safety showers, emergency action plans, engineering controls, CHP , SOPs, and more . 7 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 An effective health and safety training program must include app ropriate oversight, proper recordkeeping, instruction on the proper use of equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE), and safe work practices. Accurate recordkeeping of training activities demonstrates a commitme nt to the safety and health of the UC Davis community, integrity of research , and protection of the environment. EH&S is responsible for maintaining completion records of training conducted by EH&S staff members in the Learning Management System ( LMS ). Departments or laboratories are required to document and maintain records of all health and safety training, inc luding safety mee tings, one -on-one training, classroom training , and online training . Safety training records , including records of EH&S conducted training, should be kept : A) with the Laboratory Safety Manual, B) with departmental training records, or C) be readily available via the LMS . 8. Inspections, Safety Reviews, and Recordkeeping EH&S conducts a comprehensive Laboratory Safety Review Program for all UC Davis laboratories . These Laborator y Safety Reviews are performed on an annual basis by EH&S Laboratory Saf ety Professionals (LSPs) to assist PIs/Lab oratory Supervisors in maintaining a safe laboratory environment and to aid in complian ce with Federal, State, County regulations and University policies . Most of the applicable standards are contained in CCR, Title 8, Sections 3380- 3385 and 5191, CCR, Title 19, Div.1, State Fire Marshal and in Title 40 of Code of Federal Regulations , Environmental Protection Agenc y. The EH&S Laboratory Safety Professionals conduct Safety Reviews , issue report s, assist investigators with regulatory compliance , conduct follow -up reviews to ensure timely corrective action s, and provide t raining and advice on laboratory safety. PIs/Laboratory Supervisors are required to inspect their own laboratory on a routine basis, at least annually . A self-inspection checklist that mirrors the Laboratory Safety Review Program checklist is available, either on paper or online throug h Inspect , for this purpose. Regular inspections performed by internal personnel have been shown to substantially improve safety conditions and will help to ensur e fewer findings when Safety Reviews or inspections are performed by EH&S personnel or regulatory inspectors . All internal inspection reports must be maintained for a period of five years by the PI or Laboratory S upervisor , while records of the Laboratory Safety Review will be maintained by EH&S . 9. Hazard Assessments Workplace hazard and PPE assessments are required , see 8 CCR \u00a7 3380 \"Personal Protective Equipment\", for all locations where : A) there is use or storage of hazardous materials, or B) where equipment may present a physical hazard. Detailed UC Davis policy requirements and guidance are provided in Protective Clothing and Equipment ( PPM 290- 50). Related requirements include : Written hazard assessments Identification of required PPE Training and refresher training Posting of area hazards and required PPE The L aboratory Hazard Assessment Tool ( LHAT ) categorizes chemical and other types of hazards and specifies the appropriate PPE for each hazard . Note that the LHAT does not identify 8 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 all the hazards present in a p articular work environment . PIs/Laboratory S upervisors must evaluate whether there are additional hazards in their laboratories not addressed by the LHAT . Once the appropria te PPE is identified for the active worker and individuals in the adjacent area , the PI/Laboratory Supervisor must provi de the required PPE to all personnel and cond uct and document training on the proper use of the PPE . PIs and Laboratory Supervisor s are required to provide in formation to EH&S con cerning : the laboratory location ; laboratory personnel roster, identit y of the Laboratory or Facility Supervisor ; the Laboratory Safety Coordina tor, if applicable; and certify the assessment and training w as successfully completed . LHAT instructions and forms are provided on the UC Davis Safety Services website . The LHAT must be updated whene ver hazards in the laboratory or facility change or new hazards are identified , and certified at least annually . The PI/Laboratory Supervisor is responsible to keep the laboratory location and personnel roster within LHAT updated at all times . The laboratory or facility's most recent hazard assessments must be maintained by the PI /Laboratory Supervisor and be readily available .

Introduction Purpose UC Davis is committed to providing a healt hy and safe working environment for the campus community, in accordance with UC Davis Safety Management Program (PPM 290- 15), Care and Use of Animals in Research and Teaching (PPM 290- 30), Minors in University Facilities ( PPM 290- 32), Protective Clothing and Equipment ( PPM 290 -50), Hearing Conservation ( PPM 290- ( PPM 290 Program (PPM 290- 58), Hazar dous Chemical Use, Storage, Transportation, and Disposal (PPM 290- 65), Controlled Substances (PPM 290- 70), Radiological Physics (PPM Tagout (PPM 290- 84), Pesticide and Use of Tax -Free Alcohol (PPM 350- 20), Campus Emergency Policy (PPM 390- 10), and Fire Safety (PPM 390- 40). This campus Chemical Hygiene Plan establishes a formal written program for managing the risks posed by health and safety hazards associated with the use of hazardous chemicals in laboratories and research . The C HP describes the proper use, handling , storage and disposal practices and procedures to be followed by faculty, staff, students, visiting scholars, volunteers, and all other personnel working with hazardous chemicals at UC Davis . This plan is based on best practices identified in, among others sources, Prudent Practices for Handling Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories , published by the National Research Council, and the American Chemical Society's (ACS) Guidelines for Chemical Laboratory Safety in Academic Institutions , Safety in Academic Chemistry Laboratories , and Creating Safety Cultures in Academic Institutions , which are highly recommended reading for all laboratory personnel and are available to all from the provided hyperlin ks. The Association of Public & Land- Grant Institutions ( APLU ) has also released a guiding document to serve as a roadmap for higher -education institutions to enable and foster a culture of safety for academic research activities . The entire report is available electronically , and is a great resource f or all administrators and researchers . In addition to the report, the APLU has issue d: 1. A set of core institutional values . 2. A set of actions by role that support a culture of laboratory safety . 3. Twenty recommendations to implement and sustain a culture of laboratory safety . 10 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 All UC Davis research personnel are encouraged to review and implement these actions wherever possible . Lastly, Dow Chemical Company offers a number of training modules to help build and sustain a st rong laboratory safety culture. If assistance is needed, please contact chem- safety@ucdavis.edu for support and guidance on implementing these recommendations and developing and sustaining a positive safety culture in your labora tory. B. Scope The CHP applies to personnel within a laboratory where hazardous chemicals are used or stored , or those whose work activities are research -related and involve hazardous chemicals . Use or storage of the hazardous chemicals must be consistent with \"laboratory use\" to be covered by 8 CHP . \"Laboratory use,\" means that: 1. Chemical manipulations are carried out on a \" laboratory scale \". 2. Multiple ch emical s or chemical procedures are used. 3. Activities are not part of or simulating a production process . 4. Protective laboratory practices and equipment ar e available and in common use. At a minimum, this definition includes employees who use chemicals in teaching and research laboratories at the UC Davis Campus and the Medical Center . Also, it is UC Davis policy that students in laboratories, while not legally covered by this standard, are afforded the same level of protection as UC Davis employees. The CHP does not apply to research involving exclusively radiological or biological materials, as these safety procedures and regulatory requirements are outlined in the Radiation Safety Program and Biosafety Program respectively. Research involving more than one type of hazard must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and follow guidance outlined in the relevant safety manuals , authorizations, or programs . UC Davis has also established a Hazard Communication Program ( PPM 290- 27) that complies 5194 ( 8 CCR \u00a75194), which is directly applicable to personnel who may handle hazardous chemicals in most non- laboratory workplace s. Consult EH&S with questions regarding the applicability of the Hazard Communication Program . Per the HazCom Program, workplace signage must be displayed in all areas where hazardous chemicals are used, handled or stored. Information that would be helpful in case of an emergency (to be included on the signage): PI Name Designated Safety Person Room Number Contact information Hazards associated with lab Signage should be updated as needed . 11 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 The information presented in the CHP represents best practices and provides a broad overview of the information necessary for the safe operation of laboratories that utilize hazardous chemicals . It is not intended to be all inclusive . Laboratories, technical areas, or other work units engaged in activities with hazardous chemicals possessing unusual characteristics, or are otherwise not s ufficiently covered in the written CHP and supporting materials , must augment the CHP with a l aboratory- specific Laboratory Safety Plan addressing the hazards and how to mitigat e their associated risks, as appropriate . Contact EH&S at chem -safety@ucdavis.edu for assistance with determining the need for a Laboratory Safety Plan and assistance with development of these materials. C. Regulatory Requirements The necessary work practices, procedures, and policies outlined in this CHP are required by the following State of California regulations : 8 CCR \u00a73203, \" Injury and Illness Pr evention Program \" 8 CCR \u00a73380, \" Personal Protective Devices \" 8 CCR \u00a75143, \" General Requirements of Mechanical Ventilation Systems \" 8 CCR \u00a7 5154.1, \" Ventilation Requirements for Laboratory -Type Hood Operations \" 8 CCR \u00a75164, \" Storage of Hazardous Substances \" 8 CCR \u00a75191, \" Occupational Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories \" 8 CCR \u00a7 5194, \" Hazard Communication \" 8 CCR Article 110, \"Regulated Carcinogens\" Other applicable regulations include those promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor including 29 CFR 1910.1450 Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories (the \"Laboratory Standard\") . These regulations require that the CHP be readily available wherever potentially hazardous chemicals are used, handled or stored . Also applicable is the General Duty Clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act which states: \"Each employer: 1. Shall furnish to e ach of his employees employment and a place which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employee. 2. Shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act . Each employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct.\" EH&S will review and evaluate the effectiveness of the CHP at least annually and update it as necessary . Any updates to the CHP wil l be review ed and approved by the Chemical and Laboratory Safety Committee . 12 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 D. Rights and Responsibilities Employees and other personnel who work in University facilities have the right to be informed about the potential health hazards of the chemicals in their work areas and to be properly trained to work safely with these substances . This includes custodial staff and other personnel who work to clean and maintain laboratories . Employees have the rig ht to file a complaint with Cal/OSHA (California Occupational Safety and Health Admini stration ) if they feel they are being exposed to unsafe or unhealthy work conditions , and they cannot be discharged, suspended, or otherwise disciplined by their employer for filing a complaint or exercising these rights . All personnel working with hazardo us chemicals are encouraged to report (anonymously, if preferred) any concerns about unsafe work conditions to EH&S at ( 530) 752- 1493 or by using the online Hazard Report on the Safety Services website. Responsibility for the health and safety of the campus community extends to the highest administrative levels of UC Davis .

Chemical Hazard Identification Introduction UC Davis is responsible for providing information about the hazardous substances and activities in our workplaces including laboratories, the associated risks, and the measures to mitigate those risks . Proper hazard communication involves the active participation of the PI/Laboratory Supervisor, the campus Chemical Hygiene Officer , the EH&S Hazardous Communication Program Professional , the School/College Laboratory Safety Profession als, and the Department Safety Coordinator s, who are each responsible for providing consultation and safety information to employees working with hazardous chemicals. List of Hazardous Substances All laboratories, technical areas, or shops are required to maintain an accurate chemical inventory using the UC Davis online c hemical inventory system (UC Chemicals ). For each hazardous substance on their inventory, specific information on any associated health or safety hazards must be made readily available to all personnel. Compressed gases must also be included in the inventory list. Additional information relate d to storage and management of laboratory chemicals is provided in SafetyNet #42 - General Guidelines for Storage and Management o f Laboratory Chemicals . Hazard Determination PIs/ Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for verifying if any items on their chemical inventory are subject to the requirements of the h azard communication regulation . Note that haz ardous chemical is formally defined in 8 CCR \u00a7 5191 and 8 CCR \u00a75194. The term \"hazardous substance\" refers to any chemical which may present an asphyxiation hazard, environmental hazard, health hazard, physical hazard, or hazard not yet classified . Hazardous substances include, but are not limited to, those chemicals listed in the following: 1. \"The Hazardous Substance List\", commonly known as the Directors List of Hazardous Substances, 8 CCR \u00a7 339 2. \"Toxic and Hazardous Substances, Air Contaminants\", 8 CCR, \u00a7 5155 3. \"Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances in the Work Environment\", ACGIH, updated annually 4. \"14th Report on Carcinogens \", NTP, 2016 5. \"Monographs \", IARC, WHO 6. Safety Data Sheets ( SDSs ) for reproductive toxins and cancer causing substances Inventory items found on the above lists are subject to the requirements outlined below in Sections 1 -4. 22 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 1. Safety Data Sheets The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) requires that an SDS must be available for each hazardous substance in a laboratory's or facilities chemical inventory. SDSs are available from the UC SDS websit e; additional resources are available on the Safety Services SDS website . PIs/Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for keeping SDSs current and making them available to all employees throughout the work day. SDSs must be in a central location that can be accessed immediately in the event of an emergency. Electronic copies may be used, but must be accessible to all laboratory personnel. A SDS Quick Card and more detailed information is available from OSHA . 2. Labels and Other Forms of Warning Labeling requirements for all hazardous substances are summarized as follows: All manufacturer containers of hazardous materials must be labeled with the identity of the hazardous substance . The label must contain all applicable hazard warning statements . The name and address of the c hemical manufacturer or other responsible party must be present . Manufacturer's product labels must remain on all containers, and must not be defaced in any manner . Appropriate hazard warning statements must be present . If not, that information must be added . Labels must be legible, in English, and prominently displayed . Symbols or other languages are required for non -English speaking employees . Secondary containers (i.e. containers used for storing commercial chemicals that are not the original manufacturer packaging , such as spray bottles) must be labeled with the identity of the substance and appropriate hazard warnings . Laboratory- prepared solutions of hazardous chemicals and analytical samples containing hazardous chemicals must be labeled with the identity of the chemical(s) and an appropriate hazard warning(s) ; the date and the identity of the responsible party should be included whenever possible and practical. New synthesized compounds must be labeled with the appropriate hazard warnings based on the knowledge of the chemical and physical properties of that substance . If a lab - specific system of identifying synthesize d compounds is developed, the system must be documented in the lab's Laboratory Safety Plan or an SOP . If a system of abbreviations is used within the laboratory for labeling, the abbreviations and their meanings must be posted in a conspicuous place and a vailable to all personnel , including emergency response personnel. Additional information on container labeling , laboratory personnel responsibilities , and potential labeling resources is provided in Appendix C . 23 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 3. Employee Information and Training Employee training on specific workplace hazards must be provided at the time of initial assignment, whenever a new hazard is introduced into the workplace, and whenever employees may be exposed to hazards in other work areas . All training must be in the appropriate language, educational level, and vocabulary for laboratory personnel . Employees must be given the opportunity to ask questions . The training requirements and resources for laboratory and research personnel are summarized in Training . 4. Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool The online University of California LHAT was developed to broadly identify activities involving chemical and other types of laboratory hazards , and it functions as a component of haza rd communication . The LHAT captures information on hazard categories, the location of the hazard(s), the name of the PI/Laboratory Supervisor, the laboratory personnel roster, and helps to identify the minimum proper PPE that should be used by the active r esearcher and by other individuals in adjacent areas . Once the required PPE is identified, the laboratory is required to conduct and document training for laboratory personnel on the use and maintenance of PPE . It must be updated whene ver hazards in the la boratory or facility change or new hazards are identified, and certified at least annually . The LHAT will not identify all the hazards within a laboratory, and serves as one tool to aid PIs/Laboratory Supervisors to assess hazards within the workplace . It is intended to be used in conjunction with the Job Safety Analyses contained within a Department's IIPP. T he ACS has prepared guidance on hazard assessment in \"Identifying and Evaluating Hazards in Research Laboratories ,\" which should be consulted when completing workplace hazard assessments. A complimentary video is available from ACS's Division of Chemical Health and Safety on the value and process of risk assessment related to laboratory hazards and resear ch activities . The ACS and their Committee on Chemical Safety has further developed tools supporting their hazard recognition and ri sk asse ssment technique methodologies described on their website: Figure II-I. Example of Chemical Hazards Section in LHAT 24 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 It should be understood that laboratory hazard assessments involve all potential hazards associated with laboratory work including physical, radiological, laser, biological , as well as chemical hazards . Non-chemical hazards should not be overlooked . 5. Novel Chemicals Unique chemical hazard identification situations exist when novel materials are prepared in research . For new materials synthesized in the laboratory, the following campus requirements will be implemented: 1. When the chemical composition is known and the material is produced only for use in the laboratory of origin the PI/Laboratory Supervisor will provide and document training on the hazards as described in this CHP . 2. If the chemical composition is not known with 100% certainty the PI/Laboratory Supervisor will assume the substance is particularly hazardous and implement applicable elements of the CHP . 3. New chemical substances synthesized or produced in a laboratory, and used or shared outside of the laboratory of origin may require the preparation of a SDS . Contact the campus CHO at (530) 752- 1493 or chem-safety@ucdavis. edu for more information on necessity for preparing new SDSs . 25 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 III. Classes of Hazardous Chemicals Chemicals pose health and safety hazards to personnel due to inherent chemical, physical, and toxicological properties . Chemicals can be grouped into several different hazard classes . The hazard class will determine how similar materials should be stored and handled and what special equipment and procedures are needed to use them safely . Each chemical container, whether supplied by a vendor or produced in the laboratory, must include labels that clearly identify the hazards associated with that chemical . More detailed hazard information for specific chemicals can be found by referencing the SDS for that chemical. The Globally Harmonized System (GHS) is an international standardized system for identifying and classifying chemical hazards . Information on identified hazards is conveyed on container labels and SDSs . GHS provides consistency in the structure and content of a SDS and applicable hazard warning information on chemical labels . The hazard pictograms are summarized in Appendix D for the GHS system. Written hazard ratings are s tructured as Hazard Codes (H - Code s) and corresponding Hazard Statements . It's important to note that GHS uses an inverse scale with 0 representing the greatest hazard and subsequent higher numbers represent lower hazard . An example for oral toxicity would be the H-Code of H300 corresponds to \"Fatal if swallowed\", H301 corresponds to \"Harmful if swallowed\" . Comprehensive information on GHS is provided in the OSHA guide on GHS , and helpful reference graphics are available from Millipore -Sigma that outline the H -Codes and also the Precautionary Statements ( P-Codes ). An older hazard posting and labeling methodology is described by the National Fire Prevention Associa tion (NFPA), Standard 704 , for building and/or door placarding that provides an overview of the key chemical hazards contained within that building or room. NFPA postings have the familiar four color 1 -4 number rating, which quickly supplies the hazard information broken down into four hazard classes. The four chemical hazard types correspond to the four color areas: red indicates a flammability hazard, yellow indicates a reactive hazard, blue indicates a health hazard and the white area is reserved for special hazards that are identified by hazard symbols or labels to indicate hazards such as radioactivity, biohazard, water reactive chemicals, etc. Each of these hazards has a different set of safety precautions associated with them. Figure III-I illustrates the NFPA rating system. It's important to note that under the NFPA system lower numbers (e.g. 1) represents a lower level of hazard than a higher number (e.g. 4). In comparing NFPA to GHS for the earlier example of oral toxicity, under the NFPA diamond an acutely toxic chemica l via ingestion would be given a Health Hazard rating of \"4\" but under GHS it would be assigned the H300 code (Fatal if swallowed). A side-by-side comparison of the two is available from the NFPA . It is essential that all personnel be trained to understand and identify the types of chemical hazards and the associated risks, recognize the potential routes of exposure, and are familiar with the major hazard classes o f chemicals . In many cases, the specific hazards associated with new compounds and mixtures will not be known, so it is recommended that all chemical compounds be treated as if they were potentially harmful and to use available engineering controls and PPE . 26 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 1. Flammability and Combustibility Hazards A number of highly flammable substances are in frequent use in campus laboratories . Flammable liquids include those chemicals that have a flashpoint of less than 1 00 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F), and combustible liquids have a flashpoint between 100- 200 \u00b0F. These materials must be stored in flammable storage cabin ets if aggregate quantities of 10 gallons/room or more are stored in the lab . Guidance on proper flammable liquid storage is provided in SafetyNet #523 - Flammable Liquid Storage from UC Davis Fire Prevention . Flame -resistant laboratory coats must be worn when working with large volumes of flammable materials (>1L) and/or with procedures where a significant fire risk is present ( e.g. when working with open flame, pyrophorics, etc.) as described in Protective Clothing and Equipment (PPM 290- 50). These materials pose a significant risk and should be treated with care, even though use of t hese materials is fairly common in the laboratory setting . Particular attention should be given to preventing static electricity and sparks when handling flammable liquids. It is the vapors from flammable liquids that burn, rather than the liquids themselves . For a fire to occur , there must be: 1) vapor concentration between the lowe r and upper flammability limits ; 2) source of oxygen (often air); and 3) an ignition source . Careful handling of chemicals and use of chemical fume hoods are typically sufficient to prevent high vapor concentrations . Do not use open flames where flammable vapors may be present . Ensure that containers are properly bonded and grounded before transferring flammable liquids between metal contain ers or equipment. Figure III-I. NFPA Posting 27 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Pyrophoric chemicals are a particularly hazardous class of materials that spontaneously ignite when in contact with air and require laboratory- specific training. Flame -resistant (FR) laboratory coats and hand protection must be worn when handling pyrophoric chemicals. Individuals working with pyrophoric materials must know the appropriate method(s) to quench the chemicals being used. Additional information related to pyrophoric and water -reactive materials is provided in SafetyNet #135 - Procedures for Safe Use of Pyrophoric/Water Reactive Reagents . Helpful safety videos on reactive and pyrophoric chemicals are available from the Dow Chemical Company, for organolithium chemicals from Yale University, and handling pyrophorics from Dartmouth College. 2. Reactivity and Stability Hazards Reactive and unstable substances are materials which may violently decompose , rapidly condense, vigorously polymerize, or become self -reactive under conditions of shock, friction, temperature, pressure, light, or contact with other materials , with the release of large volumes of gas or heat . Some examples of such chemicals include explosives, peroxides, azo compounds, and azido compounds . These substances pose an immediate hazard and procedures for their use and storage must be carefully reviewed and followed . Such materials must also be stored in a manner to protect from light, heat, shock, friction, static discharge, contact with a catalyst, or other conditions to which they are sensitive . Some materials, such as peroxide formers, may not be explosive, but may for m explosive substances over time or upon concentration . 3. Oxidizers Oxidizers present a fire and explosion hazard when they come in contact with flammable , combustible materials , or other fuels . They can: 1) speed the development of a fire and increase int ensity, 2) cause substances which are normally stable in air to rapidly burn, and 3) lead to spontaneous combustion of materials without an obvious ignition source . Oxidizers are classified on a scale of 1-4 by the NFPA based on their potential to in itiate spontaneous combustion , with 1 being the lower hazard and 4 being a greater hazard . In addition to the flammability hazards posed by oxidizers, they can also be corrosive or toxic. tU 4. Health Hazards Cal/OSHA uses the following definition for health hazard in 8 CCR \u00a7 5191: \"A chemical that is classified as posing one of the following hazardous effects: Acute toxicity (any route of exposure); skin corrosion or irritation; serious eye damage or eye irritation; respiratory or skin sensitization; germ cell mutagenicity; carcinogenicity; reproductive toxicity, specific target organ toxicity (single or repeated exposure); aspiration hazard .\" Criteria by which a specific chemical is classified as a health hazard can be found in 8 CCR \u00a7 5194, including the definition of a \"simple asphyxiant .\" An overview of t he major classes of \"hazardous\" 28 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 and \"particularly hazardous substances\" and their related health and safety risks are detailed below . a. Corrosive Substances As a health hazard, corrosive substances cause destruction of, or alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact . Major classes of co rrosive substances include: Strong acids - e.g. sulfuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acids . Strong bases - hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide . pentoxide and calcium oxide . peroxide, chlorine , bromine , perchloric acid, and nitric acid. Symptoms of exposure for inhalation include a burning sensation, coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting . For eyes, symptoms include pain, blood shot eyes, tearing, and blurring of vision . For skin, symptoms may include reddening, pain, inflammation, bleeding, blistering and burns , as shown in a vid eo from UCSD . As a physical hazard, corrosive substances may corrode materials they come in contact with and may be highly reactive with other substances . It is important to review information : 1) regarding the materials they may corrode, 2) on their react ivity with other substances, and 3) on health effects . In most cases, these materials should be segregated from other chemicals and require secondary containment during storage. b. Irritants Irritants are non -corrosive chemicals that cause reversible inflammatory effects on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact . A wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, including many chemicals that are in a powder or crystalline form, are irritants . Consequently, eye and skin contact with al l laboratory chemicals should always be avoided. Smoke is a common example of an irritant which can irritate the nasal passages and respiratory system . Symptoms of exposure can include reddening or discomfort of the skin and irritation to respiratory systems. c. Sensitizers A sensitizer (allergen) is a substance that causes exposed people to develop an allergic reaction in normal tissue after repeated exposure to the substance . Examples of sensitizers include diazomethane, chromium, latex proteins . Sensitizer exposure can lead to all of the symptoms associated with allergic reactions, or can exacerbate an individual's existing allergies. 29 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 d. Hazardous Substances with Specific Target Organ Toxicity (STOT) Substances included in this category include: Hepatotoxins -substances that produce liver damage, such as nitrosamines and carbon tetrachloride . Nephrotoxins -agents causing damage to kidneys, su ch as certain halogenated hydrocarbons . Neurotoxins - substances which produce their primary toxic effects on the nervous system, such as mercury, acrylamide and carbon disulfide . Agents which act on the hematopoietic system - e.g. carbon monoxide and cyan ides which decrease hemoglobin function and deprive the body tissues of oxygen . Agents which damage lung tissue - e.g. asbestos and silica. Personnel working with these materials need to review the SDS for the specific chemical being used and take special note of the symptoms of exposure. e. Particularly Hazardous Substances OSHA recognizes that some classes of chemical substances pose a greater health and safety risk than others . To differentiate this risk characteristic, OSHA identifies two categories of hazardous chemicals: 1. Hazardous chemicals 2. Particularly hazardous substances Substances that pose such significant threats to human health are classified as \"particularly hazard ous substances\" (PHS) . The Cal/OSHA \" Laboratory Standard\" (8 CCR \u00a75191) requires that special provisions be documented in laboratory SOPs to prevent the exposure of laboratory personnel to PHSs, including : i. Establishment of designated areas ii. Use of containment devices ( e.g. fume hoods, glove boxes) iii. Procedures for contaminated waste disposal iv. Decontamination procedures Supplemental information on particularly hazardous substances is provided in Appendix E . Particularly hazardous substances are divided into three primary types . 1. Acute Toxins Substances that have a high degree of acute toxicity are interpreted by OSHA as being substances that \"may be fatal or cause damage to target organs as the result of a single exposure or exposures of short duration.\" These chemicals, their associated chemical waste, and storage containers must be handled with care to prevent cross contamination of work a reas and unexpected contact. These chemicals must be labeled as \"Toxic.\" Empty containers of these substances must be packaged and disposed of as hazardous waste without rinsing trace amounts into the sanitary sewer system. Many of these 30 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 compounds can als o be classified as corrosives, irritants, sensitizers, Select Agent Toxins , Toxins. 2. Reproductive Toxins Reproductive toxins include any chemical that may affect reproductive capabilities, including causing chromosomal damage (muta genesis ), effects on fetuses (teratogenesis) , and adverse effects on sexual function and fertility . Reproductive toxins can affect the reproductive health of both men and women if proper procedures and controls are not used. For women, exposure to reproductive toxins during pregnancy can cause adverse effects on the fetus; these effects include embryo lethality (death of the fertiliz ed egg, embryo or fetus), malformations (teratogenic effects), and postnatal functional defects . For men, exposure can lead to sterility. Examples of embryo toxins include thalidomide, tamoxifen and many other antineoplastic (chemotherapy) drugs, and cert ain antibiotics such as tetracycline. Women of childbearing potential should note that embryo toxins have the greatest impact during the first trimester of pregnancy. A pregnancy sometimes goes undiscovered well into this period of high susceptibility, spe cial caution is advised when working with all chemicals, especially those rapidly absorbed through the skin (e.g. formamide). Pregnant women and those intending to become pregnant should consult with their personal physician, supervisor, and EH&S before working with substances that are suspected to be reproductive toxins. Additional information for laboratory pers onnel is available through EH&S via SafetyNet #107 - Pregnancy and Reproductive Hazards in the Workplace: Physical and Biological Hazards , SafetyNet #108 - Pregnancy and Reproductive Hazards in the Workplace: Chemical and Radiological Hazards , as well as through Occupational Health for those working in animal care environments (Reproductive Hazards for Working in the Animal Care Environment ). 3. Carcinogens Carcinogens are chemical or physical agents capable of causi ng cancer or tumor development . Generally, they are chronically toxic substances; that is, they cause damage after repeated or long -duration exposure, and their effects may only become evident after a long latency period . Chronic toxins are particularly in sidious because they may have no immediately apparent harmful effects. Current UC Davis requirements related to carcinogen use are detailed in the carcinogens SOP . If you have any questions regarding the campus requirements for carcinogen use or personnel monitoring contact EH&S for assistance. Laboratory use of carcinogens requires the preparation of a carcinogen SOP . Additional chemical -specific guidance is available for formaldehyde and dichloromethane in SafetyNet #139 - Guidelines for Handling Formaldehyde and #140 - Guidelines for Handling Dichlo romethane (Methylene Chloride) respectively. 31 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 f. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API s) Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are a broad class of materials designed to address many different illnesses and disorders in humans and animals. Each API has uniq ue properties and there are many different potential health effect s associated with any given API. Of particular note within this class are antineoplastics, or APIs that act to prevent, inhibit, or stop the development or progression of a neoplasm (tumor). Antineoplastic agents, also referred to as anticancer or chemotherapy drugs, by their nature are h armful to healthy cells and tissues as well as neoplasms. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has consolidated a list of antineoplastic and other hazardous d rugs as well as developed guidance for handling and preparing such materials . A variety of APIs are used in laboratories across campus and it is vital t hat these materials be handled with care as they are designed specifically to affect the human body. A control plan that specifies controls to reduce exposure based on individual drug toxicity, hazards, reported Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL), or other safety parameters should be developed. Contact chem-safety@ucdavis.edu for further assistance or questions. g. Nanomaterials The increasing use of nanomaterials in research lab oratories warrants consideration of the hazards they may pose . As is the case with many new technologies, the health effects of nanomaterials have not been thoroughly investigated . Consequently, the uncertainty surrounding the toxicity of nanomaterials merits a cautious approach when working with them. Nanomaterials include any materials or particles that have an external dimension in the nanoscale (~1 - 100 n anometers, 10 -9 meter ). Nanomaterials occur naturally in the environment, are products of incomplete combustion , and are produced via chemical synthesis . Synthesized nanomaterials are referred to as Engineered Nanomaterials (ENMs) . Materials whose properties do not differ significantly between their nanoscale and larger forms ar e generally excluded from ENMs . Some examples of ENMs include fullerenes (carbon buckyballs C60), carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, quantum dots, and metal oxide nanoparticles. Nanomaterials are categorized by the risk of potential exposure they pose to personnel . This risk is impacted by the physical state , surface area, and the conditions in which they are used. In general, the risk of exposure is lowest when nanomaterials are bound in a solid matrix with li ttle potential to create airborne dust or when in a non -volatile liquid suspension . The risk of exposure increases when nanomaterials are used as fine powders or are suspended in volatile solvents or gases (i.e. aerosolized) . The parent compound of the nanomaterial should also be taken into consideration when evaluating the potential hazards associated with exposure (e.g. a highly toxic compound such as cadmium should be anticipated to be at least as toxic and possibly more toxic when used as a nanomaterial ). Laboratory personnel using or preparing nanomaterials must utilize a combination of engineering controls, SOPs, and personal protective equipment to minimize potential exposure to their self and others. The UC Davis Chemical and Laboratory Safety Committee has adopted the detailed guidance related to nanomaterials from the California Nanosafety Consortium of Higher Education's \"Nanotoolkit: Working Safely with Engine ered Nanomaterials in Academic Research Settings \" and the 32 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health's (NIOSH) \" Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories .\" A useful video on nanoparticle safety is available from the Dow Chemical Company. Given the uncertainty of the health and environmental hazards posed by nanomaterials, SOPs are required for the preparation, use, storage, and disposal of nanomaterials. All nanomaterials, including solutions co ntaining nanomaterials, are to be disposed as hazardous waste. SafetyNet #132 - Nanotechnology: Guideliness for Safe Research Practices has been prepared to provide additional guidance on these materials, and a summary of available resources for nanotechnology laboratory safety is available from the National Nanotechnology Initiative . Contact chem -safety@ucdavis.edu for additional information if needed. h. Compressed Gases & Cryogenic Liquids Compressed gases and cryogenic liquids present pressure and asphyxiation hazards in the workplace . Both compressed gases and cryogenic liquids may also present additional health hazard and/or flammability concerns. Given these hazards, special handling and storage requirements must be followed to mitigate the associated risks . More d etailed information on compressed gases can be found in SafetyNet #60 - Compressed Gas Safety , while additional information on cryogenic liquids is contained in SafetyNet #58 - Safety Precautions for Cryogenic Liquids . i. Pesticides Pesticides, as defined by the California Food and Agricultural Code \u00a712753 , are chemicals used to control unwanted species including, but not limited to, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, nematicides, plant growth regulators, fumigants, and desiccants . In many instances these chemicals present known or suspected human health hazards, and shall be managed accordingly . While pesticides may be involved in research activities, it is how these materials are being applied that determines regulatory obligations . If the chemical is being used as d irected by the manufacturer its use must include one of the following: 1. Person applying the chemical (Applicator) is in possession of a Qualified Applicator Certificate (QAC) or Qua lified Applicator License (QAL) . 2. Applicator is under the direct supervision of an individual with a QAC or QAL . 3. Appl icator with a QAC or QAL has been contracted to apply the chemical in question. When the use of pesticide differs from the manufacturers' directions then this use of material would be consider ed research use. Some examples of research use of pesticides may include , but are not limited to, the following : 1. Applying different concentrations of the chemical for efficacy assessment . 2. Applying multiple chemicals at the same time to examine synergistic effects, toxicity effects, degradation timelines , etc. 3. Applying novel chemicals to examine pesticide efficacy. Application of pesticides within enclosed spaces that are located within other enclosed spaces (e.g. growth chambers, growth rooms, etc.) may present challenges with respect to ventilation control and pesticide exposures . Please contact pesticide -safety@ucdavis.edu prior to applying pesticides within such spaces to determine appropriate chemical exposure risk mitigation steps . 33 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 IV. How to Reduce Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals Regulatory Requirements The necessary work practices, procedures, and policies outlined in this chapter are required by the following: 8 CCR \"Occupational Exposures Laboratories\" 8 CCR Article 110, \"Regulated Carcinogens\". Introduction Hazardous chemicals require a carefully considered, multi- tiered approach to effectively manage their associated risks. There are four primary routes of exposure for chemicals that have associated health hazards (illustrated in Figure IV-I): 1. Inhalation 2. Absorption (through the skin or eyes) 3. Ingestion 4. Injection (skin being punctured by a contaminated sharp object or uptake through an existing open wound) Of these, the most likely route of exposure in the laboratory is via inhalation . Many hazardous chemicals may affect people through more than one of these exposure routes , so it is critical that protective measures are in place for each of these uptake mechanisms. The methodology for controlling exposures to hazardous chemicals typica lly proceeds through the following hierarchy of controls : Elimination Substitution Engineering Controls Administrative Controls Personal Protective Equipment Figure IV-I. Routes of Exposure 34 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 A graphical representation of the hierarchy of controls is illustrated in Figure IV -I. Although various illustrations have been used to depict the hierarchy of controls, it is typically represented as an inverted triangl e, as developed by NIOSH . The rationale behind this hierarchy is that the control methods at the top of graphic are potentially more effective and protective than those at the bottom. Typically, Elimination or Substitution are most easily considered and implemented while processes are still under design and development . Existing processes often pose greater challenges for implementing Elimination or Substitution, and thus are typically addressed using the other Safety Controls available. Safety Controls Beyond Elimination and Substitution control approaches , Safety Controls are grouped into three main classifications: 1. Engineering Controls 2. Administrative Controls 3. Protective Apparel and Equipment Elements of these three classes are typically applied in a layered approach to mitigate the risks associated with hazardous chemicals . The principles of each safety control group are described in the following materials. 1. Engineering Control s The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) states that: \"Engineering Controls are used to remove a hazard or place a barrier between the worker and the hazard . Well- designed en gineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection.\" Following Elimination and Substitution t hese controls offer the first line of protection t o prevent exposures to hazardous chemicals . Engineering controls can be very effective and are the preferred method for reducing exposures . Examples of engineering controls include , but are not limited to, general room ventilation, chemical fume hoods, glo ve boxes, \"elephant trunks\" (or Figure IV-II. The Hierarchy of Controls 35 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 \"snorkels\"), flammable material storage equipment , ventilated balance enclosures , and downdraft tables . Note that elements of \"Isolation \" and \"Segregation\" accompany use of various engineering controls . a. General Laboratory Ventilation Laboratory spaces shall have mechanically generated and conditioned supply and exhaust air . All laboratories shall exhaust 100% to the outside . Air intakes for laboratory ventilation systems shall supply outside fresh air . General laboratory ro om ventilation should meet a minimum of 6 air change per hour ( 0.1 cfm of mechanical exhaust per cubic foot of laboratory gross room volume ) whenever the laboratory is occupied. Laborator ies should be kept at negative pressure to adjoining low -hazard non- laboratory space to prevent the spread of hazardous chemicals . In cases where 100% exhaust and/or negative pressure are not desirable, a formal evaluation must be made by EH&S to determine what work can be done in the space and under what special conditions or limitations . See the UC Davis Campus Standards and Design Guide for additional information on laboratory ventilation . Note that with isolated exceptions hazardous chemicals should not be used in enclosed spaces that have recirculated ventilation, please contact healthandsafety@ucdavis.edu if you have any questions about t he suitability of the space in which you would like to use hazardous chemicals for a site - and chemical- specific evaluation . b. Fume Hoods Chemical fume hoods are an effective way to control exposure to hazardous chemicals . Fume hoods are the most commonly used local exhaust system on campus . Other methods include vented enclosures for large pieces of equipment or chemical storage, and portable exhaust systems for capturing contaminant s near the point of release. Some systems are equipped with air cleaning devices (HEPA filters or carbon absorbers) . The e xhaust s from fume hoods are designed to terminate at least ten feet above the roof deck or two feet above the top of any parapet wall, whichever is higher . Figure IV-III displays the key components of a fume hood. It is important to note that the correct type of fume hood to be used is dependent upon the materials involved in the activities . A helpful fume hood overview video is available from Dow Chemical ; and guidance for proper us e of a fume hood can be found in SafetyNet #35 - How to Use a Chemical Fume Hood Safely and augmented with the UC Davis Fume Hood Training Course. Chemical fume hoods should be used for the safe handling of noxious, corrosive, or volatile chemicals whenever possible. In addition, a laboratory hood or other suitable containment device must be used for all work with PHS . Note, that a fume hood should not be used as a substitute for a biosafety cabinet or a laminar flow hood. Fume hoods are evaluated and certified by Facilities Management (FM) at least once per year. Fume hoods used for the carcinogens listed in 8 CCR \u00a7 5209 are evaluated semi -annually. These evaluations verify the proper fume Figure IV-III. Fume Hood 36 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 hood air flow velocity to ensure that the unit will operate as designed. Data on fume hood monitoring is maintained by FM. Each chemical fume hood should have a current calibration sticker and a marker indicating the highest sash height to be used when working with hazardous materials . Contact Facilities Management (530 ) 752-1655 for a hood evaluation if these labels are missing on the Davis campus, or Plant Operation & Maintenance (PO&M) at (916) 734- 2763 on the Sacramento campus . Air flow for fume hood ventilation is measured at nine points . The average of the nine readings must be at least 100 feet per minute (fpm) with a minimum of 70 fpm for any measurement . The average face velocity should not exceed 120 fpm . All chemical fume hoods must have an audible and visual alarm to show proper operation . Contact Facilities Management (530) 752-1655 if the alarm is not working prope rly on the Davis campus, or PO&M (916) 734 - 2763 for any fume hood issues on the Sacramento campus. Routine maintenance and repairs of fume hoods are conducted by FM . If any problem with chemical fume hoods occurs, d iscontinue use of the fume hood and immediately call Facilities Management at ( 530) 752-1655 to arrange for repairs . Make sure to indicate the urgency of the matter and indicate a health and safety deficiency. General Rules for Fume Hood Use The following general rules should be followed when using laboratory fume hoods: 1. Fume hoods shoul d not be used for work involving hazardous substances unless they have a certification label that confirms certification has occurred within the past year, or six months if using one of the carcinogens listed in 8 CCR \u00a75209. 2. Before beginning work in a fume hood check the fume hood flow indicator to verify proper air flow and make sure the audio alarm has not been disabled. 3. Always keep hazardous chemicals more than six inches behind the plane of the sas h, see Protective Air Barrier . 4. Never put your head inside an operating laboratory hood. The plane of the sash is the barrier between contaminated and uncontaminat ed air. Keep the sash clean so your vision is unobstructed. 5. Work with the hood sash in the designated operating height range. The maximum operating sash height for vertical sash hoods should be clearly marked. Contact FM there is no sash height indicated o n your fume hood. The sash also acts as a physical barrier in the event of an accident. 6. Do not clutter your hood with unnecessary bottles or equipment. Keep it clean and clear. Only materials actively in use should be in the hood. C lutter inside the hood may disrupt air flow and thus reduce capture efficiency. 7. Do not make any modifications to hoods, duct work, or the exhaust system without first contacting EH&S at (530) 752 -1493 . 8. Do not use large equipment in laboratory hoods unless the hood is dedicated for this purpose, as large obstructions can change the airflow patterns and render the hood unsafe. 9. Avoid sudden movements while working in the fume hoods. Such movements can create turbulence which may disrupt air currents and pull vapors out of the fume hood. 10. For energy efficiency, make sure to shut your sash when the hood is not in use. 37 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 The use of perchloric or hydrofluoric acids in chemical fume hoods necessitates additional considerations . Perchloric acid when heated above ambient temperature can form potentially explosive perchlorate salts in a fume hood and its associated duct system and hood fan . Perchloric acid can also form explosive mixtures w ith organic compounds . Hydrofluoric acid can dissolve glass, and is very corrosive to many metals . For these reason s, the use of perchloric and hydrofluoric acids in fume hoods must be carefully evaluated prior to use, contact EH&S at (530) 752-1493 or resear chsafety@ucdavis.edu for more information . Additional information can be found in SafetyNet #18 - Safe Use of Perchloric Acid and SafetyNet #70 - Safe Use of Hydrofluoric Acid . Laboratory fume hoods are vital piece s of equipment for protecting personnel from exposure to hazardous chemicals . Chem ical fume hoods must be inspected upon installation, renovation, when a deficiency is reported, or a change has been made to the operating characteristics of the hood. Whenever possible volatile /semi -volatile chemicals and PHS s should be handled under ventilation engineering controls (e.g. fume hoods ). Please contact chem-safety@ucdavis.edu if you have any questions on ventilation controls for the chemicals needed in your research . Fume Hood Inspections Step 1 -Physical Inspection (Laboratory Personnel) Step 2 -Hood Performance Inspection (Facilities Management Personnel) Evaluate the physical condition of the hood and the materials being used in the hood . This includes checking for: Improper storage of materials inside the fume hood Use of proper materials General hood cleanliness Physical damage to the fume hood (e.g. broken sash) Fully functioning lighting, fume hood indicator, airflow monitor, and alarm Evaluate the overall hood performance to ensure that it is functioning properly. This involves checking the: Average face velocity and minimum face velocity, which is used to determine the rating of the hood and what the hood can be used for Noise g enerated by the fume hood, to ensure that it is below 85 dB If fume hood does not pass inspection, it will be labeled with a \"DO NOT USE \" sign until it can be repaired c. Glove Boxes and Ventilated Containment Devices In addition to chemical fume hoods, some laboratories use contained glove boxes (dry boxes) or other ventilated containment units for working with reactive chemicals under an inert atmosphere , working with very toxic substances in a completely closed system, or for creating a stable, draft -free, system for weighing hazardous or reactive materials . These units can be very effective because they offer complete containment . Personnel must be trai ned in the proper use of this equipment , and the training must be documented. 38 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 d. Other Engineering Controls In addition to the elements listed above, consideration must be given to providing sufficient engineering controls for the storage and handling of haz ardous materials . No more than 10 gallons of flammable chemicals may be stored outside of an approved flammable storage cabinet . For refrigerator or freezer reduced -temperature storage, flammable and explosive materials must be kept in units specifically designed and rated for storing these respective materials . It is common for laboratories to use a \"lab-safe\" refrigerator approved for the safe storage of flammable chemicals . These units should be visibly labeled with a rating from Underwriters Laboratory or other certifying organization . Lab-safe refrigerators do not contain internal electrical components that could spark and trigger an ignition, and the cooling elements are external to the unit . While lab -safe refrigerators can safely store chemicals whic h may emit flammable vapors, these refrigerators should not be used in locations that contain explosive vapors . If you need a refrigerator or freezer for chemical storage in a location with explosive vapors , contact EH&S for assistance with an explosion -proof refrigerator . See SafetyNet#523 on Flammable Storage for additional information. In addition to chemical -focused engineering c ontrols in the laboratory, there are other mechanical and electrical devices that may find appl ication in laboratory settings. Analytical tools/instrumentation, process equipment, and power tools may include machine guarding, interlocks, Emergency Power Off (EPO) but tons, dust collection syst ems, and barriers. Modern equipment is far more likely to come equipped with these engineering controls. If you have older equipment in your laboratory that may lack some of these safeguards, please contact healthandsafety@ucdavis.edu for an assessment and consultation. i. Biological Safety Cabinets Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs or biosafety cabinets ) are primary containment devices used in laboratories for working safely with biohazardous agents . There are three classes of biosafety cabinets: Classes I, II, and III, each with different performance characteristics and applications . The most commonly used BSCs at UC Davis are Class II BSCs. Class II BSCs provide protection for the user, biological agents used, and the environment . Class II BSCs use High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters to control airborne particles and may be ventilated into the room or ducted out of the building. Class II BSCs m ust be tested and certified to meet NSF/ANSI Standard 49 specifications when first installed . On an annual basis, a nd whenever they are moved, the BSC will need to be retested and recertified. Purchase and placement of BSCs within the laboratory must be ap proved by EH&S . Contact biosafety@ucdavis.edu for additional information. ii. Laminar Flow Benches Laminar flow benches (\"clean benches\") provide a high quality, clean work surface and environment for manipulation of materials . There are three types of laminar flow benches: a. Forward flow (towards the operator): T he operator sits directly downstream from the clean bench airflow . This type of clean bench must never be used for handling toxic, infectious or sensitizing materials . Only handling of non -hazardous materials is allowed in this type of laminar flow bench. While it is understood that ethanol solutions 39 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 are typically used with such equipment, note that this puts the operator at an increased risk of injury should a fire ignite where the flames may be blown towards the operator . b. Vertical flow (top to bottom): These benches are designed to protect samples and processes from contamination where operator protection is not required. Only handling of non -hazardous materials is allowed in this work setting . c. Reverse flow (away from operator): The operator sits upstream of the clean bench airflow - the airstream blows away from the operator . These benched provide effective laboratory prot ection for a variety of low to moderate hazard materials - aqueous liquids, small quantities of volatile materials, etc . One common application for reverse flow laminar benches is for chemical weighing/dispensing of solid materials . It's important to note that laminar flow benches are not the same as downdraft tables, which find application in anatomy and engineering laboratories . Also, a laminar flow bench is NOT a biosafety cabinet, and some models may recirculate the airstream back into the general labo ratory space following filtration. For additional information on the correct application of laminar flow benches contact EH&S. 2. Administrative Controls Administrative controls consist of policies and procedures to reduce or prevent exposures to laboratory hazards . These controls are generally not as reliable as engineering controls in that the user has to carefully follow the appropriate procedures and must be fully trained and aware in order to do so. Note that elements of \" Isolation \" and \"Segregation\" may be contained in an administrative control. a. Prior Approval Several committees and programs at UC Davis are tasked with reviewing r esearch protocols and/or approving /monitoring the use of hazardous materials . These committees or programs are as follows: i. Chemical and Laboratory Safety Committee ( CLSC) ii. Controlled Substances Program iii. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC) iv. Instituti onal Biosafety Committee ( IBC) v. Institutional Review Board ( IRB) vi. Radiation Safety Committee ( RSC) vii. Select Toxin Registration . In addition to the identified committees and programs with their respecti ve emphasis, the campus Chemical Hygiene Officer is available to work with investigators prior to beginning laboratory operations that involve any of the following: i. Working with potentially explosive chemicals , extremely reactive chemicals, acutely toxic chemicals, or large quantities of material that could potentially be released to the environment . ii. When it is likely that a Cal/OSHA Action Level or Permissible Exposure Limit (see Chapter V) could be exceeded. 40 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Finally, the PI/Lab oratory Supervisor is strongly encouraged to establish rules for the following activities and chemical usage in their laboratory operations that involve an increased level of risk: i. Working alone in the laboratory. T he CLS C has formalized the requirement that a Working Alone SOP is require d for all laboratories. The Working Alone SOP is a laboratory- specific SOP that defines laboratory activities that may not be undertaken while alone in the laboratory . ii. Unattended laboratory operations . iii. Modifying a procedure in such a manner that the overall hazard is increased substantially . One such example is the scale -up of a reaction . The capability of the existing protective mechanisms to accommodate the changes in the thermodynamics of the chemical system must be considered . It is strongly recom mended that the PI/Laboratory Supervisor establish upper limits for quantities of material use , and require prior approval for work when these limits need to be exceeded. b. Standard Operating Procedures While general guidance regarding laboratory work with c hemicals is contained in this Chemical Hygiene Plan, PIs/Laboratory Supervisors are required to develop and implement laboratory- specific SOPs for hazardous chemicals , including PHS , that are used in their laboratories . This is a Cal /OSHA requirement - 8 CCR \u00a75191, subpart (e)(3)(A). Development and implementation of laboratory- specific SOPs is a core component of promoting a strong safety culture at UC Davis and help ing to promote a safe work environment . The campus CHO , chem-safety@ucdavis.edu, and DSCs are available to assist PIs/Laboratory Supervisors with the development of SOPs . Several SOP templates have been prepared under the direction of the CLSC and are available on the Safety Services website . Baseline campus requirement and recommendation expectations reviewed and endorsed by the CLSC are outlined in Table 1 of the SOP guidance document . The guidance document also provides additional information to help define and identify applicable materials. Laboratory- specific SOPs must be prepared in writing by personnel who are most knowledgeable about the experimental process and approved by PI/Laboratory Supervisor prior to starting work. SOPs identify safety precautions and requirements specific to the hazardous chemicals and/or process. Laborator y personnel must be trained on all SOPs for the hazardous chemicals they will be using, and shall be trained on emergency procedures for all chemicals contained in the laboratory. Laboratory- specific SOPs should be developed on a case -by-case basis for haz ardous procedures unique to the laboratory. For certain hazardous chemicals, PHS , or specialized practices, consideration must be given to whether additional consultation with safety professionals is warranted or required. Trainin g on a n SOP involves more than simply reading and signing the training documentation form. The PI/Laboratory Supervisor , or their qualified designee, will train all personnel responsible for performing the procedures detailed in the SOP , and will document training on the material. The trainer demonstrates the procedures/techniques described in the SOP, and then observes 41 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 the trainees while they complete those procedures/techniques , demonstrating competence to perform the procedure/techniques . The content and accuracy of SOPs shall be reviewed , and revised as needed, when one of the following criteria is met: i. Nature of the hazard changes (e.g. previously unknown hazard is identified, use of vacuum or pressure, increased/decreased temperature, etc .). ii. Chemical changes ( e.g. quantity increase or scale -up, increase in concentration, new chemical supplier , etc.). iii. Equipment changes . iv. An unexpected outcome occurs (e.g. unanticipated rise or fall in temperature, increased gas production, unexpected color change or phase separation, etc.) . v. At a minimum, every three years. PI/Laboratory Supervisor review and re -approval is required following any SOP revision . Laboratory personnel must be trained on any SOP revisions, and documentation of the training must b e maintained . Once laboratory personnel have been trained on the content of a n SOP they may prepare an Executive Summary document for quick reference . An Executive Summary must be approved by the PI/Laboratory Supervisor to ensure that it accurately reflects the expectations for safe handling, storage, and disposal of the hazardous chemicals in the SOP . Such an Executive Summary may not be used for training, as training must be completed on the entire content of the SOP . Circumstances requiring prior appr oval from the PI/Laboratory Supervisor or designee must also be stated in laboratory- specific SOPs . These circumstances are based on the inherent hazards of the material being used, the hazards associated with the experimental process, the experience level of the worker, and the scale of the experiment . Some examples of circumstances that may require prior approval include , but are not limited to, working alone in a laboratory, unattended or overnight operations, the use of highly toxic gas of any amount, t he use of large quantities of toxic or corrosive gases, the use of extremely reactive chemicals ( e.g. pyrophoric or water reactive chemicals), reaction scale -up, or the use of carcinogens . When preparing an SOP, consider the type and quantity of the chemical being used, along with the frequency and manner of use . The SDS for each hazardous chemical should be referenced during SOP development . The SDS lists important information, such as hazard warnings, chemical/physical properties, type of toxicity, symptoms of exposure , and exposure limits . If a novel chemical will be produced during the experiment, an SDS will not be available . In these cases, the toxicity is unknown and it must be as sumed that the substance is particularly hazardous, as a mixture of chemicals will generally be more toxic than its most toxic component . In most every instance of SOP preparation (and revision) a risk assessment for the materials and manner of use is of g reat value. The ACS has provided a short video that describes the risk assessment process and value ; use of risk assessments for laboratory activity planning and SOP preparation is strongly encouraged. If you have questions or would like assistance in completing a risk assessment for your laboratory activities contact researchsafety @ucdavis.edu for assistance. SOPs should be maintained as hardcopy and/or electronic format in such a way as to be readily available to laboratory personnel. The SOP storage location and organizational structure is at 42 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 the discretion of each PI/Laboratory Supervisor. Additional guidance on writing SOPs, including a sample template, is available on the EH&S website . Several control- banded SOP templates are currently available, and the CLSC and EH&S are developing tools and resources to further assist with the SOP development process. Details are available at EH&S Chemical and Laboratory Safety , and additional information can be obtained from chem -safety@ucdavis.edu. 3. Protective Apparel and Equipment a. Personal Protective Equipment Personal protective equipment serves as a researcher's last line of defense against chemical exposures . Specific minimum requirements for PPE use during operations involving chemicals are contained in Protective Clothing and Equipment (PPM 290- 50). The PPE policy outlines the basic PPE requirements, which include but are not limited to the following : Full length pants and closed -toe/closed- heel shoes, or equivalent . Protective gloves, laboratory coats, and eye protection when working with, or adjacent to, hazardous chemicals . Flame resistant laboratory coats for pyrophoric and high -hazard flammable materials use. For more information, see PPM 290- 50. The CLSC has approved a PPE Selectio n Guide to assist in selecting the appropriate equipment for work activities and hazards. 43 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Additionally, it is strongly recommended that safety eye protection be worn in the laboratory at all times . Several videos from UCSD highlight the importance of vision protection , the dynamic character of the splash zone in a laboratory , and a reminder of the benefits of PPE . Figure IV -IV provides some examples of eye and face protection. The primary goal of PPE is to reduce the risk associated with handling hazardous substances and performing hazardous activities. Be sure to select the PPE that is appropriate to the activity, including the type of lab coat worn. The PPE selection guide can help determine the correct PPE. Additional , more protective PPE may be needed for certain activities and chemical hazards. When selecting appropriate gloves consider the following: A. Chemical(s) being used . B. Anticipated chemical contact ( e.g. immersion, incidental, etc .). C. Manufacturer' s permeation and degradation data . D. Whether a combination of different gloves is needed. Additional guidance is provided in SafetyNet #50 - Guidelines for the Selection of Chemical -Resistant Gloves which includes links to online glove permeation charts from glove manufacturers. Informative videos on PPE are available from UCSD and the Dow Chemical Company. UC Davis policy ( PPM 290- 50) requires a hazard assessment be completed for all personnel prior to beginning work. This hazard analysis will help identify the minimum needed PPE and equipment needed. An online Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool is available to assist with the job hazard analysis. Note that the LHAT may not address all the potential hazards within a laboratory. Additional resources to guide hazard assessment are available from the ACS, Identifying and Evaluating Laboratory Hazards , contact EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 or researchsafety@ucdavis.edu for assistance. Figure IV-IV. Examples of eye and face protection 44 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 b. How to Use and Maintain PPE Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be kept clean and stored in an area where it will not become contaminated. PPE should be inspected prior to use to ensure it is in good condition. It should fit properly and be worn properly. If it becomes contaminated or damaged, it should be cleaned or repaired when possible, or replaced and properly discarded as hazardous waste. See the PPE FAQs or chem-safety@ucdavis.edu for additional question or help related to PPE. PPE may be reassigned to ot her laboratory personnel provided that it is appropriately fitting and in good condition . For additional requirements and information on selection of PPE, see PPM 290- 50, and SafetyNet #5 - Eye and Face Safety Protection for Laboratory Workers . c. Respiratory Protection Typically, respiratory protection is not needed in a la boratory. Under most circumstances, safe work practices, small scale usage, and engineering controls (fume hoods, biosafety cabinets, and general ventilation) adequately protect laboratory workers from chemical , radiological, and biological hazards . Howeve r, under certain circumstances respiratory protection may be needed . Examples may include any of the following : An accidental spill such as: o Chemical spill outside the fume hood. o Spill of biohazardous material outside a biosafety cabinet . Performance of an unusual operation that cannot be conducted under the fume hood or biosafety cabinet . When weighing powdered chemicals or microbiological media outside a glove box or other protective enclosure . Disposable filtering face -piece respirators are generally recommended for nuisance dusts . If the chemicals are toxic, contact EH&S for additional evaluation . When exposure monitoring indicates that exposures exist that cannot be controlled by engineering or administrative controls . As required by a specific labor atory protocol or as defined by applicable regulations . Detailed requirements related to respiratory protection are described on the UC Davis Respirator y Protection Program website including the UC Davis Respiratory Protection Manual , how to obtain a respirator, and requirements for respirator training, medical surveillance, and fit testing. Always contact EH&S or your DSC before proceeding with the use of a respirator, even a disposable one. d. Safety Shields Face shields protect the fa ce, neck, and ears from splash or flying particles . They are worn over safety gla sses or chemical splash goggles, and should be worn when major splashing may occur. Standing shields, affixed to the countertop and of good rigidity and strength , protect the face, neck , and upper torso from projectiles when over -pressurization or implosion may occur . These shields must meet the impact test criteria in the ANSI Z87.1 Eye and Face Protection Standard. Standing shields should be considered for the following : 45 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 i. Work with potentially- explosive compounds. ii. Systems under high or low pressure . iii. Scaling up reactions 4. Safe Laboratory Habits As detailed above, a safety program must include policies and protective equipment to promote a safe working environment, but to truly achieve effectiveness, a number of fundamental elements must become an integral part of our safety culture . According to the American Chemical Society (ACS): \"To build a strong safety culture, all faculty, staff, and students need the skills to recognize hazards, to assess the level of risk of exposure to those hazards, to minimize the risk, and to be prepared to respond to laboratory emergencies.\" ACS has prepared a report on \" Creating Safety Cultures in Academic Institutions \" that has been endorsed by the CLSC . The CLSC highly recommends that all researchers review this report. Some of the fundamental or operational elements of an effective safety program and safety culture are detailed below: a. Personal Protective Equipment Wear closed -toe/closed- heel shoes and full length pants, or equivalent, at all times when in the laboratory (i.e. no exposed skin from waist to toes) . Open shoes, sandals, bare feet, bare shins, ba re midriffs, and bare shoulders are prohibited. Use appropriate PPE while in the laboratory and while performing procedures that involve the use, movement, or disposal of hazardous chemicals or materials. Perform hazard assessments to determine the necessa ry PPE. Wear appropriate eye protection in the laboratory. Do not manipulate contact lenses while in the laboratory. If they are used, inform the PI/Laboratory Supervisor and the other laboratory personnel that they are being worn. Long hair should be tie d back or otherwise confined. Secure neck ties or other articles of clothing or jewelry that might become entangled in equipment. Remove laboratory coats or gloves immediately on significant contamination, as well as before leaving the laboratory. Do not t ouch common surfaces ( e.g. door handles, elevator button, telephone, compressed gas cylinders, etc.) with a gloved hand. Do not reuse disposable gloves, they are a single -use item of PPE. b. Chemical Handling : Review the SDS to better understand the hazards o f any new chemical to be handled, and re examine as needed. Properly label and store all chemicals. Deposit chemical waste in appropriately labeled receptacles and follow all other waste disposal procedures specified in the Chemical Hygiene Plan, WASTe , and SOPs. Do not dispose of any hazardous chemicals through the sewer system. 46 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Do not smell or taste chemicals . Never use mouth suction for pipetting or starting a siphon . Be prepared for an accident or spill and refer to the emergency response procedures for the specific material. Procedures should be readily available to all personnel. Minor chemical spill information is described in the CHP and also in SafetyNet #13 - Guidelines for Chemical Spill Control . For general guidance, the following situations shou ld be addressed: o Eye Contact : Promptly flush eyes with water for a prolonged period (15 minutes) and seek medical attention , as portrayed in the guidance video from UCB . o Skin Contact : Promptly flush the affected area with water ( 15 minutes) and remove any contaminated clothing , after washing seek medical attention . c. Equipment Storage and Handling: Use the proper safety equipment for your activities, which may include a chemica l fume hood, glove box, biosafety cabinet, shields, or other equipment. Use appropriately rated hoses and tubing. Use certified fume hoods, glove boxes, or other ventilation devices for operations which might result in release of toxic chemical vapors or dust . Preventing the escape of these types of materials into the working atmosphere is one of the best ways to prevent exposure. Do not use uncertified fume hoods or glove boxes for hazardous chemical handling. Store laboratory glassware with care to avoid damage . Inspect all glassware and equipment prior to use ; do not use damaged items. Use extra care with Dewar flasks and other evacuated glass apparatus; shield or wrap them to contain chemicals and fragments should implosion occur. Handle broken glass a nd sharps with caution and appropriate hand protection ; properly dispose of these materials. Keep fume hood sash closed when you are not working in the fume hood. Avoid storing materials in fume hoods . Do not allow the vents or air flow to be blocked. d. Laboratory Operations: Know the location of all exits for the laboratory and the buildin g. Know the location and proper operation of safety showers, eyewashes, and first -aid kits . Know where the fire extinguishers and alarm pull boxes are located and how t hey operate . Know the location of the nearest phone that can be used in an emergency . Critical phone numbers should be posted near the phone . Be prepared for laboratory accidents, chemical spills, and other emergency situations. Be prepared for seismic act ivity, including guidance provided in SafetyNet #83 - Non- Structural Seismic Safety . Know the potential hazards of the materials, facilities, and equipment with w hich you will work . If you are uncertain, ask your PI/Laboratory Supervisor or contact EH&S. 47 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Research staff and students should never work alone on procedures involving hazardous chemicals, biological agents, or other physical hazards unless the PI/Laborat ory Supervisor has: A. Developed a n SOP specifically on working alone in the laboratory, and B. Granted formal approval for the laboratory activities being performed. Follow electrical safety guidance as described in SafetyNet#512 - Electrical Safety and PPM 290- 85 Elect rical Safety . Inspect electrical cords on laboratory equipment prior to use; do not use equipment with damaged electrical cords. Keep the work area clean and uncluttered . Seek information and advice about hazards, plan appropriate protective procedures, an d plan positioning of equipment before beginning any new operation . Follow written protocols or instructions . Perform only authorized experiments . Do not create shortcuts to procedures. When using unfamiliar equipment complete a \"dry run\" of your experiment using a less hazardous chemical to familiarize yourself with the proper operation of the equipment and PPE. If cooling water is required for laboratory activities ensure that the chosen system is not single -pass, utilizing recirculating baths or other water -less alternatives (e.g. FindenserTM), consistent with UCOP Sustainability Policy . Vacuum lines must be protected with traps to prevent vacuum system component contamination. Operations requiring a vacuum must use a trapping device to protect the vacuum source, personnel, and the environment. Do not allow water, solvents, and corrosive g ases to be drawn into a building vacuum system. When the potential for such a problem exists, use a cold trap and/or protection (HEPA/hydrophobic) filter. If unattended operations are unavoidable, and have been approved by the PI/Laboratory Supervisor, pla ce an appropriate sign on the door, leave lights on, and provide for containment of toxic substances in the event of failure of a utility service (e.g. cooling water). Highly exothermic, potentially explosive reactions, or sudden polymerization reactions m ust never be left unattended. Notify other laboratory personnel when an explosion hazard is present or may be produced, through direct announcement and prominent warning signs . Be alert to unsafe conditions and ensure that the PI/Laboratory Supervisor is notified of such conditions and they are corrected promptly. Do not move or disturb equipment in use without consent of the user . Do not engage in distracting behavior such as practical jokes in the laboratory. This type of conduct may confuse, startle, or distract another worker . Use of headphones in the laboratory, for non -research purposes, is strongly discouraged , some of the risks are highlighted in a video from Cornell . If headphones are used in the laboratory for non -research purposes leave one ear unobstructed to be able to hear any sounds and language of any emergency events. If personal electronic devices ( e.g. laptop, cellular phone, MP3 player, etc.) are used in the laboratory, take prec autions to prevent contamination with hazardous materials . Wash hands carefully before leaving the laboratory . Beware of contamination on clothing, doorknobs, doorframes, etc. Maintain good laboratory cleanliness, including: o Clean bench tops, work areas, and equipment regularly. 48 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 o Prevent the accumulation of dirty glassware, unneeded samples/chemicals, and trash . o Keep aisles and areas around eyewashes and showers clear to allow for unobstructed exit and easy access to safety equipment in emergency situation s. o Ensure all compressed gas cylinders are properly restrained . o Practice good refrigerator and freezer management by preventing overcrowding, using secondary containment, and completing periodic defrosting procedures. Follow guidance described in the EH&S and Fire Prevention SafetyNets . Immediately report all accidents, injuries, and near -misses, however small, to the PI/Laboratory Supervisor . Report any fires or the discharge of any fire extinguis her to the Fire Department by calling 9 -1-1, even if the fire is extinguished. e. Food/Drink: No e ating, drinking, gum chewing, tobacco chewing, handling contact lenses, and the application of cosmetics (including lip balm) where biological hazards, radioactive materials, or hazardous chemicals will be stored or used. Food must not be kept in refrigerators or cold rooms used for hazardous chemica ls or other hazardous materials . Refrigerators used for food and beverage storage shall not be located in the laboratory. 5. Guidance for Support Personnel Entering a Laboratory a. Custodial Staff To aid proper recognition of laboratory hazards the Lab S afety for Support Personnel training has been developed . You must have completed this training before you may enter a laboratory environment. Rooms that have a Caution Sign or any other warning stickers on laboratory doors, may contain materials or equipme nt which, if used improperly, could cause harm. Any container (box, bottle, carton, etc.) that holds hazardous material should be clearly marked with an appropriate warning label . Do not touch, move or handle containers of any chemicals or materials in a laboratory. If items need to be moved in order to perform your duties, have the PI/Laboratory Supervisor arrange for this to be completed or contact your immediate supervisor. If the contents of any laboratory container are spilled, do not touch it or attempt to clean it up . Evacuate the area, close the laboratory door as you leave, and contact your supervisor . Call 9 -1-1 for assistance with cleanup or to report a chemical spill. Wear appropriate laboratory coat or work uniform and eye protection . Do not eat, drink, apply cosmetics, handle contact lenses, or take medications in a laboratory. Chemical bottles should not be disposed as regular trash unless they have been completely emptied, air dried, label defaced, and the cap removed. If in doubt about t he containers, leave them in the laboratory. 49 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 b. Facilities Maintenance & Information Technology To aid proper recognition of laboratory hazards the Lab Safety for S upport Personnel training has been developed. This training must be completed before you may enter a laboratory environment. Before working in a laboratory or chemical fume hood, notify the PI/Laboratory Supervisor or laboratory personnel about the problem , the length of time anticipated to accomplish the corrective actions, and when the work will be performed . Before work starts, adequately notify lab personnel so equipment which could cause injury or be damaged is turned off or moved. The PI/Laboratory S upervisor is responsible for making sure your work area within the room is free from physical, chemical, and/or biological hazards . Your work area could include hoods, sinks, cabinets, benches, bench tops, floors, and/or equipment . You may be required to re pair, move, remove, replace, or paint as part of your work. Do not handle or move chemicals in the laboratory. If you need chemicals moved in order to perform your work, have the laboratory supervisor arrange for this to be done. Do not move or handle equipment in the laboratory . If your work requires you to move, remove, or replace a piece of equipment, have the PI/Laboratory S upervisor assure you that the equipment is free of any physical, chemical, and/or biological hazards. Do not eat, drink, apply cosm etics, handle contact lenses, or take medication s in the laboratory. In situations where the hazard cannot be totally removed, specific work procedures will be developed in conjunction with the PI/Laboratory S upervisor and EH&S. If there is a chance your w ork could bring you in contact with chemical hazards ( e.g. working on laboratory sinks, working in areas where there is a chance of chemical contamination) or when working in rooms where chemical experiments are taking place, consult with the PI/Laboratory Supervisor on the appropriate coveralls and eyewear. If working on a hood, ask the room supervisor if the hood is used for perchloric acid or radioactive material . Contact EH&S before performing maintenance on any part of a perchloric acid o r radioactive materia l fume hood system (including: hood, base, duct, fan, and stack) . Lubricate perchloric acid hood fans with fluorocarbon grease only. If you have any questions, contact the PI/Laboratory Supervisor first, your supervisor next, or EH&S. 50 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 V. Hazard Assessment and Chemical Exposure Monitoring Regulatory Overview It is University policy to comply with all applicable health, safety, and environmental protection laws, regulations and requirements. Under Article 107 of Title 8 Cal/OSHA requires that all employers \"measure an employee's exposure to any substance regulated by a standard which requires monitoring if there is reason to believe that exposure levels for that substance exceed the action level (or in the absence of an action level, the exposure limit).\" Repeated monitoring may be required if initial monitoring identifies employee exposure over the action level or exposure limit. Cal/OSHA regulates Permissible Exposure Limits ( PELs ) for airborne contaminants to which \"nearly all workers may be exposed daily during a 40 -hour workweek for a working lifetime (of 40 years) without adverse effect\" , and are based upon an 8-hour Time -Weighted Average (TWA) exposure. Thus, the PELs are the maximum permitted 8 -hour TWA concentration of an airborne contaminant without the use of respiratory protection . Cal/OSHA has also defined Short Term Exposure Limits ( STELs ) as the maximum TWA exposure during any 15 minute period, provided the daily PEL and Ceiling (C) exposures are not exceeded at any time. Cal/OSHA has listed established PELs, STELs and Ceiling exposures for chemical contaminants identified in 8 CCR \u00a7 5155 (Airborne Contaminants) Table AC -1. In the absence of a published Ceiling limit, Cal/OSHA requires employee exposure to concentrations above the PEL be controlled to prevent harmful effects . Further, Cal/OSHA has promulgated specific standards covering several regulated carcinogens, which may include an Action Level ( AL), triggering medical surveillance requirements or the imposition of a specific Excursion Limit (such as for asbestos) with a unique measurement of the duration of an exposure. Exposure Assessment Overview All University employees require protection from exposure to hazardous chemicals above PELs, STELs and Ceiling concentrations . Principal Investi gators and supervisors are responsible for assessing hazards. For concerns of airborne chemical exposure , contact EH&S for consultation and further evaluation . Per Cal/OSHA , chemical exposure monitoring must be performed by or under the direction of a pers on competent in industrial hygien e. At UC Davis , EH&S provides this expertise and serves this role . Contact EH&S at healthandsafety@ucdavis.edu or (530) 752- 1493 for general questions regarding exposure assessments. Minimizing an exposure may be accomplished by elimination, substitution, or using a combination of engineering controls, administrative controls and PPE , listed in order of priority. Assessing exposure to hazardous chemicals may be accomplish ed through a number of methods performed by EH&S, including employee interviews, evaluation of chemical properties, visual observation of chemical use, evaluation of engineering controls, use of direct -reading 51 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 instrumentation, or the collection of analytic al samples . An e xposure assessment may be performed under situations including the following: 1. Based on chemical inventories, review of SOPs, types of engineering controls present, laboratory inspection results and/or review of hazard assessments, EH&S det ermines whether an exposure assessment is warranted . 2. User of a hazardous chemical has concern or reason to believe exposure is not minimized or eliminated through use of engineering controls or administrative practices and the potential for exposure exist s. The user should then inform his or her PI/Laboratory Supervisor, who will in turn contact EH&S to assess exposure potential. EH&S will then determine the best course of action in assessing employee exposure, including visual assessment, air monitoring, medical evaluation, examination, or medical surveillance . 3. Based on a suspected exposure incident following an Employer's First Report. 4. If a Cal/OSHA investigation determines the need for exposure monitoring. Any serious injury or exposure, including chemical splash involving dermal or eye contact should be immediately reported by calling 9-1-1 and obtain ing emergency medical treatment . Do not wait for an exposure assessment to be performed before seeking medical care. 1. Exposure Assessment Protocol - Notification to employees or employee representatives and right to observe monitoring (8 CCR \u00a7340.1) The EH&S Industrial Hygiene group conducts exposure assessments for members of the campus community . Employees have a right to observe testing, sampling, monitoring or measuring of employee exposure . They are also allowed access to the records and reports related to the exposure assessment . Exposure assessments may be performed for hazardous chemicals, as well as for physical hazards including noise and heat stress to determine if exposures are within PELs or other appropriate exposure limits that are considered safe for routine occupational exposure . In summary, the g eneral protocol in conducting an exposure assessment may include any of the following: a. Employee interviews . b. Visual walkthrough and observation of chemical usage and/or laboratory operations . c. Evaluation of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals . d. Evaluation of potential for absorption through the skin, mucus membranes or eyes . e. Evaluating existing engineering and administrative controls, as well as PPE. f. Measuring levels of hazardous substances using various methods . If exposure monitoring determines an employee exposure to be over th e Action Level (or the PEL) for a hazard for which Cal/ OSHA has developed a specific standard ( e.g. lead), the medical surveillance provisions of that standard shall be followed. It is the responsibility of the PI/Laboratory Supervisor to ensure that any n ecessary medical surveillance requirements are 52 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 met. When necessary, EH&S will make recommendations regarding adjust ments to engineering controls, administrative procedures , and/or PPE requirements to maintain exposure below any applicable PEL . In assessi ng exposure to hazardous chemicals for which Cal/OSHA has not published a PEL, STEL or Ceiling exposure, EH&S may defer to the Threshold Limit Values ( TLVs ) established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH ) or the Recommended Exposure Limits ( RELs ) established by NIOSH . OSHA has consolidated most of this information at Permissible Exposure Limits - Annotated Tables . 2. Notification The Industrial Hygienist will promptly notify the employee and his/her PI/Laboratory Supervisor of the results in writing after the receipt of any monitoring results . The Industrial Hygienist will establish and maintain an accurate record of any measurements taken to monitor exposures for each employee . Records, including monitoring provided by qualified vendors, will be managed in accordance with 8 CCR \u00a73204 \"Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records\". 3. Exposure Assessment to Determine and Implement Controls EH&S and Occupational Health Services will use any of the following criteria to determine required control measures to reduce empl oyees ' occupational exposure: a. Verbal information obtained from employees regarding chemical usage . b. Visual observations of chemical use or laboratory operations . c. Evaluation of existing engineering control measures, administrative practices , or PPE usage . d. Recommendations expressed in Safety Data Sheets . e. Regulatory requirements of Cal/OSHA . f. Recommendations from professional industrial hygiene organizations . g. Employee exposure monitoring results . h. Medical evaluation, examination and/or surveillance findings. Particular attention shall be given to the selection of safety control measures for chemicals that are known to be extremely hazardous. Per Cal/OSHA \"Control of Harmful Exposure to Employees\" ( 8 CCR \u00a7 5141) , the control of harmful exposures shall be prevented by implementation of control measures in the following order: a. Elimination, whenever possible . b. Substitution, whenever possible . c. Engineering controls, whenever feasible . d. Administrative controls wh enever engineering controls are not feasible or do not achieve full compliance and administrative controls are practical . e. Personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection: a. During the time period necessary to install or implement feasible eng ineering controls . 53 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 b. When engineering and administrative controls fail to achieve full compliance . c. In emergencies. a. Medical Evaluation All employees, student workers, medical health services volunteers, or laboratory personnel who work with hazardous chemica ls shall have an opportunity to receive a free medical evaluation, including supplemental examinations which the evaluating physician determines necessary, under the following circumstances: 1. Whenever an employee develops signs or symptoms possibly associ ated with a hazardous chemical to which an employee may have been exposed in a laboratory. 2. Whenever an uncontrolled event takes place in the work area such as a spill, leak, explosion, fire, etc., resulting in the likelihood of exposure to a hazardous chem ical. 3. Upon reasonable request of the employee to discuss medical issues and health concerns regarding work -related exposure to hazardous chemicals. 4. When a measured exposure level requires medical evaluation in accordance with Cal/OSHA regulations. All work- related medical evaluations and examinations will be performed under the direction of UC Davis campus Occupational Health Services or UC Davis Health System (UCDHS) Employee Health Services by licensed physicians or staff under the direct supervision of a licensed physician . Evaluations and examinations will be provided without cost to the employee, without loss of pay, and at a reasonable time and place. Any laboratory employee or student who exhibits signs and symptoms of adverse health effects from work -related exposure to a hazardous chemical s should report to Occupational Health Services (Davis employees ), Student Health and C ounseling Services (Davis students ), or Employee Health Services (Sacramento) immediately for a medical evaluation. Refer to your Department's IIPP for procedures on how to obtain medical evaluation under the above -listed circumstances. Please contact iipp@ucdavis.edu with any questions. b. Information to Provide to the Clinician At the time of the medical evaluation, the following information shou ld be provided to Health Services: 1. Personal information such as age, weight , and University employee ID number . 2. Common, trade, and/or I nternational Union of P ure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name of the hazardous chemicals to which the individual may have been exposed. 3. A description of the conditions under which the exposure occurred . 4. Quantitative exposure data, if available . 5. A description of the signs and symptoms of exposure that the empl oyee is experiencing, if any . 6. A copy of the SDS of the hazardous chemical or material in question . 54 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 7. History of exposure including previous employment and non -occupational (recreational) hobbies . 8. Any additional information helpful to Health Services in asse ssing or treating an exposure or injury such as a biological component of exposure or existence of an antitoxin. It is strongly recommended to bring a copy of the SDS of the hazardous chemical or material in question to any medical evaluation . c. Physician's Written Opinion For evaluation or examinations required by Cal/OSHA, the employer shall receive a written opinion from the examining physician which shall include the following: 1. Recommendation for further medical follow -up. 2. Results of the med ical examination and any associated tests, if requested by the employee . 3. Any medical condition which may be revealed in the course of the examination which may place the employee at increased risk as a result of exposure to a hazardous chemical found in the workplace . 4. A statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the results of the consultation or medical examination and any medical condition that may require further examination or treatment. d. Confidentiality & Individual's Access to Personal Medical Records All patient medical information is protected by California and federal law and is considered strictly confidential . Health Services , both campus and UCDHS, are prohibited from disclosing any patient medical information that is not directly related to the work -related exposure under evaluation and should not reveal any diagnosis unrelated to exposure . Any patient information disclosed by Health Services to the employee's supervisor will be limited to information necessary in assessin g an employee's return to work, including recommended restrictions in work activities, if any . Any patient information disclosed by Health Services to EH&S will be limited to information necessary to develop a course of exposure monitoring, or perform haza rd assessments and incident investigations, if appropriate . Health Services will otherwise disclose patient medical information only as required by California and Federal law, such as for Worker's Compensation Insurance claims . Each employee has the right to access his/her own personal medical and exposure records . Health Services will provide an employee with a copy of his/her medical records upon written request. e. Medical Surveillance Medical surveillance is the process of using medical examinations, quest ionnaires and/or biological monitoring to determine potential changes in health as a result of exposure to a hazardous chemical or other hazards . Certain Cal/OSHA standards require clinical examination as part of medical surveillance when exposure monitoring exceeds an established AL or PEL. Health Services and/or outside vendors may provide medical surveillance services . Medical surveillance is required of employees who are routinely exposed to certain hazards as part of their 55 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 job description (such as asbestos) and may be offered to other employees based upon quantifiable or measured exposure . Examples of hazards that are monitored through the medical surveillance program may include: o Asbestos o Beryllium o Bloodborne pathogens o Formaldehyde o Lead o Dichloromethane o Noise ( Hearing Conservation Program ) o Radioactive Materials (Bioassay Prog ram) o Respirator Use ( Respiratory Protection Program ) o Other Particularly Hazardous Substances Individuals with questions regarding work- related medical surveillance a re encouraged to contact campus Occupational Health Services at (530) 752-6051, Employee Health Services (Sacramento) at (916) 734 -3572, or EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 for more information. f.

Exposure records include environ mental monitoring and related collection and analytical m ethodologies, calculations, and other background data relevant to interpretation of the results; biological m onitoring results, and specific Safety Data Sheets. 3. The UC Davis Health Services will maintain medical records f or each e mployee in strict confidence . Medical records of e mployees who have worked for less than one year for the University need not be retained beyond the term of employm ent if they are provided to the e mployee upon ter mination of e mploym ent. 56 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 VI. Inventory, Labeling, Storage, and Transport Regulatory Requirements The necessary work practices, procedures, and policies outlined in this chapter are required by the following: 8 CCR \u00a75154.1, \"Ventilation Each PI/Laboratory Supervisor is required to maintain a current comprehensive chemical inventory, through the chemical inventory s ystem (UC Chemicals ), which lists the hazardous chemicals and compressed gases used and stored in the labs and the quantity of these chemicals. This information is managed and reported to meet obligations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right -to-Know Act (EPCRA) that is managed in California by the Certified Unified Program Agencies ( CUPA ). This inventory needs to be updated: 1. At least annually 2. Whenever new chemicals are introduced into the laboratory 3. Whenever a chemical i s complet ely removed from the laboratory Specific storage locations must be kept as part of the inventory list to ensure that chemicals are easily located . The chemical inventory is used to aid compliance with storage limits, reporting requirements, fire and life safety regulations, and may be used in emergency situations to identify potential hazards to emergency response personnel. Additionally, an accurate chemical inventory ai ds the operational and financial mana gement of laboratory activities . Active chemical inventory management can also deter chemical diversion, and quickly identify instances where diversion may have occurred . Given the multitude of advantages afforded by an accurate and current chemical inventory, efforts should be taken to actively manage the laboratory's chemical inventory through UC Chemicals . 57 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Management of the laboratory chemical inventory should include the following aspects: 1. Chemical inventory revie wed prior to chemical procurement . 2. Chemical purchases target the minimum quantiti es necessary for the research, and never exceed quantities that can be consumed within one year . 3. When new chemicals are added to the laboratory, each laboratory group must con firm they have access to the SDS for that chemical, and update their UC Chemicals information to reflect the addition of the chemicals to the laboratory . 4. Each chemical container is dated upon receipt so expired chemicals can be e asily identified for disposal . 5. Unneeded chemicals should be culled from the inventory and properly disposed to reduce laboratory risk from storage of hazardous materials . 6. Chemicals beyond their expiration dates should be removed via proper disposal (See Chapter IX ). 7. Any visible evidence of chemical or container degradation including: Cloudiness in liquids Color change Evidence of liquids in solids, or solids in liquids \"Pooling\" of material around outside of containers Pressure build- up within containers Obvious deterioration of containers ( e.g. corrosion) These indicators should prompt chemical disposal. 8. Chemical quantities are updated frequently, especially after large changes . 9. Chemicals are returned to their designated storage area when not in us e. 10. Chemical storage locations are inspected regularly . Access to hazardous chemicals, including toxic and corrosive substances, shoul d be restricted at all times, as discussed in SafetyNet #118 - Laboratory Security Tips for Hazardous Materials Users and in Chapter X . These materials must be stored in laboratories or storerooms that are kept locked when laboratory personnel are not present. Locked storage cabinets or other precautions may be required in the case of acutely toxic or hazardous ch emicals, tax -free alcohol (see PPM 350- 20), select toxins , and controlled substances . Acutely toxic chemicals may include those associated with very low IDLH conditions. For guidance on locked storage requirements, please conta ct EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 or chem -safety@ucdavis.edu. Additional information related to storage and management of laboratory chemicals is provided in SafetyNet #42 - General Guidelines for Storage and Management of Laboratory Chemicals , and guidance on the current chemical inventory system is available on the EHS website. Lastly, on termination or transfer of laboratory personnel, all their related hazardous materi als (including chemicals and samples) shall be properly disposed of, or transferred to the PI/Laboratory S upervisor or a designee, with the chemical inventory updated appropriately. 58 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Chemical Labeling All chemicals found in the laboratory should be properly labeled. Hazardous chemicals, including dilute solutions, must be labeled properly including the associated hazards (consistent with PPM 290- 27, Appendix C , and SafetyNet #42 - General Guidelines for Storage and Management of Laboratory Chemicals ). Commercial chemicals come wi th a manufacturer's label which contains the necessary information. Care should be taken to not damage or remove these labels. Commercial chemical labels should be augmented with the date of receipt and date of opening, to aid in determining if chemicals a re expired and require disposal. When novel chemicals are synthesized, their containers must be labeled with the identification name, date, and hazard information; the generator or other party responsible for this chemical should be noted on the container so they may be contacted if questions arise about the contents. The Dow Chemical Company provides an excellent video highlighting the importance of chemical labeling for a safe working environment. Additional guidance and resources on the labeling of chemical containers is provided in Appendix C . In addition to the labeling requirements outlined in Appendix C , peroxide forming chemicals Formation in Ethers and Other Chemicals , must also be labeled with: A) D ate of receipt, and B) D ate of opening . A useful label for this purpose is contained in SafetyNet #23 . These chemicals can degrade to form highly reactive compounds sensitive to shock, heat and friction, and need to be stored and labeled very carefully. Chemicals which may form peroxides have varying shelf lives; consult SafetyNet #23 for additional information on the types of chemicals of concern and their associated storage and disposal timelines. PHSs have additional labeling requirements ; consult EH&S for guidance . The storage area for these materials must be labeled with the appropriate hazard information . It is advised to store PHSs segregated from less hazardous chemicals to aid access restriction , inventory control, and hazard identification. Chemical Storage & Segregation Establish and follow safe chemical storage & segregation procedures for your laboratory. Storage guidelines for flammable, oxidizing, corrosive, water reactive, explosive, and acutely toxic materials are described in the following materials. The manufacturers specific SDS should always be consulted when doubts arise concerning chemical properties, compatibilities , associated hazards, and storage recommendations. All storage procedures must comply with Cal/OSHA, California Fire Code, and California Building Code regulations. Always wear 59 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 appropriate PPE (e.g. laboratory coat, safety glasses, gloves, safety goggles, apron) when handling hazardous chemicals. Be aware of the locations of the safety showers and emergency eyewash stations. Each laboratory is required to provide appropriate laboratory- specific training on how to use this equipment prior to working with haz ardous chemicals. Table VI -I lists chemical safety storage priorities. 1. General Recommendations for Safe Storage of Chemicals Each chemical in the laboratory should be stored in a specific location and returned there after each use. Acceptable chemical storage locations may include corrosive cabinets, flammable storage cabinets, laboratory shelves /cabinets , and appropriate refrigerators or freezers, as discussed in SafetyNet #42 . Fume hoods should not be used as general storage areas for chemicals, as this may seriously impair the ventilating capacity of the hood and its capture efficiency . Figure VI-I depicts improper fume hood storage . Chemicals should not be routinely stored on be nch tops nor stored on the floor . Chemicals used in animal research should not be stored in the vivarium or procedural space locations, but rather returned to the laboratory for proper Table VI-I. Chemical Safety Storage Priorities Keep in mind that most chemicals have multiple hazards and a decision must be made as to which storage area would be most appropriate for each specific chemical. First you have to determine your priorities: 1. FLAMMABILITY . When establishing a storage scheme, the number one consideration should be the flammability characteristics of the mat erial. If the material is flammable, it should be stored in a flammable cabinet or refrigerator/freezer rated for the storage of flammable liquids. 2. ISOLATE . If the material will contribute significantly to a fire (e.g. oxidizers), it should be isolated fro m the flammables. Water -reactive material must be sufficiently segregated from flammable and combustible materials. 3. CORROSIVITY. Isolate acids from bases, and further segregate by organic vs. inorganic origin. Segregate oxidizing inorganic acids from flamm able and combustible materials. 4. SPECIAL HAZARD . Be sure to consider chemicals requiring special handling and storage (e.g. air/water reactive, peroxide forming chemicals, reduced temperature storage, inert atmosphere storage, etc.). 5. TOXICITY . Finally, cons ider the toxicity of the material, with particular attention paid to regulated materials. In some cases, this may mean certain chemicals will be isolated within a storage area. For example, a material that is an extreme poison but is also flammable, should be locked away in the flammable storage cabinet to protect it against accidental release. There will always be some chemicals which will not fit neatly in one category or another, but with careful consideration of the hazards involved, most of these cases can be handled in a reasonable fashion. For instances where a chemical has multiple hazardous properties (e.g. corrosive and oxidizer) the initial assignment would be the hazard of greatest risk. When this assignment results in chemical incompatibility, the multiple -hazard chemical will require additional segregation within its assigned hazard class. Consult SafetyNet#42 or EH&S for furth er information. 60 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 segregation and storage . Additionally, bulk quantities of chemicals ( i.e. larger than 1 gallon) should be stored in a separate storage area, such as a stockroom or supply room. Laboratory shelves used for chemical stora ge must have a raised lip along the outer edge or a railing to prevent containers from falling . Hazardous chemicals should not be stored above a height of 5 feet. C hemicals which are acutely toxic or corrosive shall be stored below a height of 5 feet and s hall be stored in chemically -compatible and durable secondary containment . Chemicals must be stored at an appropriate temperature and humidity level and should never be stored in direct sunlight or near heat sources, such as laboratory ovens. Be sure to consider chemical compatibility before storing laboratory chemicals : guida nce is provided in Figure VI - II and Appendix F . Figur e VI-II. Chemical Segregation Guidance.2 2 Provided with permission from Environmental Health and Safety, Stanford University, 2013 Figure VI-I. Improper Fume Hood Chemical Storage 61 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Implementation of the storage approach shown in Figure VI -II is strongly recommended. Additional information to aid implementation of this segregation approach is available from the National Academies of Science (available as free pdf ), including classification group codes for some common laboratory chemicals . If these chemicals must be stored in one cabinet, due to space limita tions, adequate segregation and secondary containment must be ensured to prevent adverse reactions. Incompatible materials should be stored in separate cabinets, whenever possible. Incompatible gases must be separated by 20 feet or a noncombustible partition. Note that Group X materials typically require special storage consideration s and may not be appropriate to store as a collective group. Please contact EH&S for a ssistance with appropriate storage guidance of these materials. All chemical containers and research samples must be appropriately labeled and tightly capped to prevent vapor interactions and to alleviate nuisance odors . Flasks with cork, rubber or glass stoppers should be avoided because of the potential for leaking. Laboratory refrigerators and freezers must be labeled appropriately with \"No Food/Drink\" and must never be used for the storage of consumables. Freezers should be defrosted periodically so chemicals do not become trapped in ice formations. Storage of peroxide formers ( e.g. ether ) in a refrigerator is not recommended. 2. Flammable and Combustible Liquids Large quantities of flammable or combustible materials should not be stored in the laboratory. No more than 10 gallons aggregate quantity of flammable or combustible liquids , including flammable/combustible hazardous waste, are allowed to be kept outside a fla mmable storage cabinet, safety can, or approved refrigerator/freezer . The maximum total quantity of Class 1A flammable liquids must not exceed 60 gallons within a flammable storage cabinet . Total volume of flammable and combustible liquids must not exceed 120 gallons per cabinet . Flammable materials must never be stored in domestic -type refrigerators/freezers and should not be stored in a refrigerator/freezer if the chemical has a flash point below the temperature of the equipment . Flammable or combustible liquids must not be stored on the floor or in any egress pathway . Always segregate flammable or combustible liquids from acids (e.g. nitric, perchloric, chromic, sulfuric) . the amount of material required for the exper iment or procedure should be stored in the work area . Additional guidance on flammable/combustible liquid storage is available from the UC Davis SafetyNet #523. 62 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Handle flammable and combustible materials only in areas free of ignition sources and use the chemical in a fume hood whenever possible . Ignition sources may include electrical equipment, open flames, static electricity, and hot surfaces . If heating of a flammable liquid is required, it should be limited to heating mantles, heating tapes, and water/oil/sand baths. Always transfer flammable and combustible chemicals from glass containers to glassware or from glass container/glassware to plastic. If transfer ring flammable liquids between metal equipment ensure that the containers are bonded together and connected to a common ground. When transferring or dispensing highly flammable liquids with the aid of a pump, the pump shall be constructed of metal rather t han plastic due to better chemical resistivity and the ability to bond the pump/bulk container to the receiving container. Do not pour directly from metal drum into receiving flask. Failure to follow these guidelines for flammable liquid transfer may prese nt an increased fire hazard due to static electricity. The transfer of flammable liquid from 5 gallon or larger metal containers should not be performed in the laboratory. Flammable and combustible liquids may be stored in safety cans, less than 2 gallons in volume. 3. Pyrophoric & Water Reactive Materials Because pyrophoric substances can spontaneously ignite on contact with air and/or water, they must be handled under an inert atmosphere and in such a way that rigorously excludes air and moisture. Some of these chemicals are also toxic, and many are dissolved or immersed in a flammable solvent. Other common hazards include corrosivity, teratogenicity, or peroxide formation. All users of pyrophoric and water -reactive materials at UC Davis must know and foll ow the guidance provided in SafetyNet #135 - Procedures for Safe Use of Pyrophoric/Water Reactive Reagents , know the appropriate quenching methods, and the use of these materials is never to be performed when alone in the laboratory. Only minimal amounts of reactive chemicals should be used in experiments or stored in the laboratory. Careful ordering practices should be utilized to minimize the amount stored in the laboratory and never purchase more quantity than can be consumed in a reasonable timeframe . These chemicals must be stored as recommended in the SDS, and compliant with CCR, Title 8 and the California Fire Code. Reactive materials containers must be clearly labeled with the correct chemical name, in English, along with a hazard warning. 63 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Examples of pyrophoric and water -reactive chemicals Lithium carbonyl, nickel tetracarbonyl Group I (alkali) metals Lithium, potassium, sodium Metal powers (finely divided) Cobalt, iron, zinc, zirconium Gases Silane, dichlorosilane, diborane, phosphine, arsine Metal h ydrides NaH, LiAlH Suitable storage locations may include inert gas -filled desiccators or glove boxes; however, some pyrophoric materials must be stored in a dedicated refrigerator or freezer rated for the storage of flammable liquids. It is further recommended that an inert gas -filled desiccator also be used in conjunction with reduced temperature storage. If pyrophoric or water reactive reagents are received in a speci ally designed shipping, storage or dispensing container (e.g. Aldrich Sure/Seal packaging system), ensure that the integrity of that container is maintained. Ensure that sufficient protective solvent, oil, kerosene, or inert gas remains in the container while pyrophoric materials are stored. Don't store reactive chemicals with flammable materials or in a flammable storage cabinet with other flammable liquids. A flammable stor age cabinet may be used but it must be dedicated to storing pyrophoric or water -reactive materials only. A quenching scheme must be in place prior to beginning work with pyrophoric and water -reactive material. Storage of pyrophoric gases is described in t he California Fire Code, Chapter 64 . Gas cabinets, with remote sensors and fire suppression equipment, are required. Gas flow, purge and exhaust systems should have redundant controls to prevent pyrophoric gas from igniting or exploding . Emergency back -up power should be provided for all electrical controls, alarms and safeguards associated with the pyrophoric gas stor age and process systems. Please contact chem - safety@ucdavis.edu for assistance with appropriate storage guidance of these materials . Additional information on proper han dling, disposal, safety equipment, emergency procedures, and excess chemical storage for these materials is contained in the pyrophorics SOP and associated pyrophoric flow spill chart , SafetyNet #135 - Procedures for Safe Use of Pyrophoric/Water Reactive Reagents . Incredibly helpful videos are available from the Dow Chemical Company , from Yale University on organolithium reagents , and from UCSD on preparation , and transfer of pyrophoric liquids with reactive metals . dichromate, sodium nitrate, e tc.) should be stored in a cool, dry place and kept away from flammable and combustible materials, such as wood, paper, Styrofoam, plastics, flammable 64 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 organic chemicals, and away from reducing agents ( e.g. zinc, alkaline metals, metal hydrides, formic acid). 5. Peroxide -Forming Chemicals (Time -Sensitive Materials) Peroxide forming chemicals (e.g. ethers, alkenes, alkynes, etc.), see SafetyNet #23 - Peroxide Formation in Ethers and Other Chemicals , should be stored in airtight containers in a dark, cool, and dry place and must be segregated from other classes of chemicals (e.g. acids, bases, oxidizers) that could create a serious hazard to life or property should an acc ident occur. The containers must be labeled with the date received and the date opened. This information, along with the chemical identity should face forward to minimize container handling during inspection. These chemicals should be periodically tested for the presence of peroxides and the results documented annually. Minimize the quantity of peroxide -forming chemicals stored in the laboratory and dispose peroxide -forming chemicals within one year of receipt or six months after opening. Refer to SafetyNet #23 - Peroxide Formation in Ethers and Other Chemicals for specific guidelines and/or contact chem-safety@ucdavis.edu with questions on perox ide forming chemicals or peroxide testing. Keep an inventory of peroxide -forming chemicals for your workplace, and never purchase more quantity than can be consumed prior to the manufacturer's expiration date. Do not handle the container if: old contain ers of peroxide -forming chemicals are discovered in the laboratory, (greater than five years past the expiration date or if the date of the container is unknown) ; Crystallization is present in or on the exterior of a container . Secure the immediate area a nd restrict access to the container until it can be evaluated by EH&S personnel. Contact EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 or hazwaste@ucdavis.edu for inspection, pick- up, and disposal. 6. Corrosives Store corrosive chemicals (e.g. acids, bases) below a height of five feet and in secondary containment that is large enough to contain at least 10% of the total volume of liquid store d or the volume of the largest container, whichever is greater . Acids must always be segregated : From bases and from active metals ( e.g. sodium, potassium, magnesium) at all times and Must also be segregated from chemicals which could generate toxic gases upon contact (e.g. sodium cyanide, iron sulfide , potassium ferricyanide ). Specific types of acids require additional segregation : 65 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Mineral acids must be kept away from organic acids , and Oxidizing acids must be segregated from flammable and combustible materials . Picric acid must be stored wet with at least 30% water, in a cool, dry, well -ventilated area, away from heat sources. Picric acid is considered a flammable solid when wet >30% water . Incompatibilities for picric acid include ox idizers, metals, reducing agents, and bases . Recurring inspection and rehydration should be completed every six months to ensure it does not dry out to <10% water, at which point picric acid becomes unstable and may pose an explosion hazard. See SafetyNet #104 - Safe Use and Management of Picric Acid for additional information. Pressure -relief or vented caps must be used on containers for waste streams of oxidizing inorganic acids or pressure generating materials (e.g. piranha, aqua regia). See storage of hazardous wastes for further hazardous waste st orage criteria. Additional guidance for handling and storage of nitric and perchloric acid is provided in SafetyNet #14 - Safe Use of Nitric Acid and SafetyNet #18 - Safe Use of Perchloric Acid respectively. 7. Acutely Toxic Chemicals Acutely toxic chemicals should be stored based on their hazards and physica l properties . Storage for acutely toxic solids and liquids includes secondary containment in a well- ventilated area . Containers should be closed with tape or other sealant . Storage areas for acutely toxic chemicals and their containers must be meticulously labeled. Acutely toxic chemicals shall be stored no higher than eye level (~5ft). 8. Special Storage Requirements a. Compressed Gas Cylinders Compressed gas cylinders must be secured to prevent tipping, falling, or rolling caused by contact, vi bration, seismic activity, or transportation. Methods for properly storing and securing cylinders include: Compressed gas cylinders must be stored with the safety cap in place . Gas cylinders shall be segregated by hazard cl ass. Secure cylinders upright to a substantial, fixed surface with restraints made of non- combustible material such as chains . Do not expose cylinders to excessive dampness or temperatures >125 \u00b0 F, nor corrosive chemicals or fumes. Secure cylinders to (or within ) a rack, rail framework, or similar assembly designed for such use. Nesting of cylinders is allowed if a minimum of 3- point s of contact can be achieved. 66 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Secure cylinders on carts or other mobile devices designed for the moving of cylinde rs, when transporting cylinders. Cylinders must be restrained by at least one non- combustible restraint , but preferably two non -combustible restraints; one restraint at 1/3 from the top of the cylinder, and the other at 1/3 from the bottom of the cylinder (see Figure VI -III). Bolted \"clam shells\" may be used in instances where gas cylinders must be stored or used away from wall s or racks. Certain gas cylinders and chemicals require additional precautions. Compressed oxygen gas cylinders must be stored at least 20 feet away from combustible materials and flammable gases, or separated by a non -combustible part ition (contact fireprevention@ucdavis.edu for more information). Liquefied fuel gas cylinders must be stored securely in the upright position . Materials used to convey and dispense compressed gases (e.g. piping, tubing, valves, fittings, etc.) shall be constructed from compatible materials and designed to properly contain and deliver the specific gases for which they are used. Gas cylinder con nections must be inspected frequently for deterioration and must never be used without a regulator. Never use a leaking, corroded or damaged cylinder and never refill compressed gas cylinders. When stopping a leak between cylinder and regulator, always close the valve before tightening the union nut. The regulator should be replaced with a safety cap when the cylinder is not in use. Gas cylinders must be moved with the safety cap in place using carts designed for this purpose. Separate empty from full cylin ders in storage areas, and arrange full cylinders such that the oldest materials are utilized first. Refer to SafetyNet #60 - Compressed Gas Safety , the gas cylinder safety video from Dow Chemical Company, and Safetygram #10 from Air Products for more information. Toxic, corrosive, flammable, oxidizing, and pyrophoric gases have special handling and storage requirements. Contact Fire Prevention and chem- safety@ucdavis.edu for additional information. Training on toxic compressed gases is available through the LMS. b. Cryogenic Liquids Because cryogenic liquid (e.g. n itrogen, argon, helium, etc.) containers are at low pressure and have protective rings moun ted around the regulator, they are not required to be affixed to a permanent fixture such as a wall. However, additional protection considerations should be addressed when storing cryogenic liquids in a laboratory. The primary risk to laboratory personnel from cryogenic liquids is skin or eye damage caused by contact with the material. Additionally, all cryogenic liquids have large expansion volumes, typically greater than 500:1 when transitioning from a cryogenic liquid to a room temperature gas. This volumetric increase can create high pressure hazards if confined to a closed system; pressure relief valves must always be functional and unobstructed. While the gases are usually not toxic, a significant risk of Figure VI-III. Proper Compressed Gas Cylinder Storage 67 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 asphyxiation is a possibility due to oxygen dis placement. Consult with EH&S prior to locating cryogenic liquids in confined spaces or areas without adequate ventilation. Always use appropriate thermally insulated gloves when handling cryogenic liquids. Face shields may be needed in cases where splashin g can occur. Refer to the UC Davis SafetyNet #58 - Safety Precautions for Cryogenic Liquids and the cryogen safety video from the Dow Chemical Company for further information. Training on Cryogen Safety is available through the LMS. On-Campus Transport of Hazardous Chemicals Precautions must be taken when transporting hazardous materials between laboratories and buildings . Chemicals must be transported in durable , secondary containment such as commercially available bottle carriers made of rubber, metal, or plastic, that include carrying handle(s) and which are large enough to hold the contents of the chemical conta iner in the event of breakage. All hazardous materials must be transported in a university vehicle. Consult the UC Davis Hazardous Chemical Use, Storage, Transportation, and Disposal (PPM 290- 65) for more information on campus policy regarding chemical transportation . Additional guidance regarding the transportation of hazardous material or biological samples through public spaces is available on the Safety Services website. When transporting cylinders of compressed gases, a lways secure the cylinder with straps or chains onto a suitable hand truck (dolly) and protect the valve with a safety cap. Avoid dragging, sliding, or rolling cylinders and use a freight elevator when possible . Figure VI-IV illustrates correct cylinder transport . Never transport a cyl inder with a regulator attached. Off-Campus Transport or Shipment of Hazardous Chemicals The transportation of hazardous chemicals and compressed gases over public roads, or by air, is strictly governed by international, federal, and state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the International Air Tran sport Association (IATA). Any person who prepares and/or ships these types of materials must ensure compliance with pertinent regulations regarding training, quantity limits, packaging, labeling, documentation and hazard communication. Without proper train ing, it is illegal to ship hazardous materials. Those who violate the hazardous materials shipment regulations are subject to criminal investigation and penalties. UC Davis campus personnel who sign hazardous materials manifests, shipping papers, or those who package hazardous material for shipment, must be properly trained and certified. Consult the UC Davis Hazardous Chemical Use, Storage, Transportation, and Disposal (PPM 290- 65) for more information on campus policy regarding chemical transportation and shipping. Figure VI-IV. Correct Transport of Compressed Gas Cylinder 68 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Individuals who wish to ship or transport hazardous chemicals or compressed gases off -campus, even when using UC Davis or personal vehicles, must contact EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 or hazshipping@ucdavis.edu for assistance. 69 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 VII. Training Regulatory Requirements The necessary work practices, procedures, and policies outlined in t his chapter are required by the following: 8 Introduction Effective training is critical to facilitate a safe and healthy work environment and prevent laboratory accidents. All PIs/Laboratory Supervisors must participate in formal safety training and ensure that all their employees have appropriate safety trainin g before working in a laboratory. Comprehensive resources are available at the EH&S website for training . A traini ng matrix is available to help inform laboratory personnel about what training must be complete d before starting work in a laboratory. Types of Training All laboratory personnel must complete the online UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals training course before beginning work in a laboratory. Additionally, before being granted unescorted access to a laboratory, personnel must complete and document site -specific sa fety orientation and training. Guidance on materials that need to be covered in the site -specific safety orientation and training is provided in the Site -Specific Safety Orie ntation & Training Checklist for New Laboratory Personnel , which includes documentation of training on the campus CHP and any applicable Laboratory Safety Plans . Note, equivalent existing checklists and documentation are also accepta ble. Additional training may be needed when: 1. New hazards are introduced into the workplace . 2. New work activities/processes are to be implemented. 3. New equipment is introduced into the workplace. EH&S offers general classroom and online training, plus resource materials to assist laboratories in implementing laboratory -specific training.

Fume hoo d operation (included in Laboratory Safety Fundamentals) or biosafety cabinet operation (if necessary) iv. LHAT - PPE Training v. Lab-specific Chemical Spill Response (SafetyNet #13) vi. Cryogen Safety (if necessary) B. Annual : i. IIPP, EAP, CHP updates, L aboratory S afety P lan if applicable ii. Chemical Spill Response (SafetyNet#13) iii. Lab-specific safety topics (e.g. laser, radiation) C. Triennial: i. UC Laboratory Safety Fundamentals refresher ii. SOPs (if no revision has triggered earlier training) EH&S provides additional assistance in planning laboratory -specific training upon request. Documentation of Training Accurate recordkeeping is a critical component of health and safety training . Per OSHA regulations, departments or laboratories are responsible for documenting health and safety training, including safety meetings, one -on-one training, classroom, and online training . Documentation should be maintained with the Laboratory Safety Manual or be otherwise readily available . An example of a safety training form for the acutely to xic materials SOP is shown in Figure VII -I. Additional information on recordkeeping can be found in Chapter VIII. A generic safety training attendance form is available on the UC Davis EH&S website. 72 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Figure VII -I. Example of a safety training form. 73 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 VIII. Inspections and Compliance Regulatory Requirements The necessary work practices, procedures, and policies outlined in this chapter are required by the following: 8 CCR 5191, \"Occupational Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories \" Laboratory Safety Inspections - Lab Personnel The primary goal of safety inspection s is to identify both existing and potential incident -causing hazards, activities , procedures , and faulty operations that can be corrected before an incident occurs . Regular laboratory inspections performed by laboratory personnel have been shown to substantially improve laboratory safety conditions , reduce accidents and incidents, and should help to ensure fewer findings when inspections are performed by regu latory personnel or other campus inspectors . PIs/Laboratory Supervisors are required to self- inspect their laboratorie s on a routine basis, at least annually . While inspections are a snapshot in time and cannot identify every accident -causing condition , they do provide important information on the overall operation of a particular laboratory. Laboratory personnel may use the self-inspection checklist that mirrors the Labora tory Safety Review Program checklist, available either on paper or online through Inspect , or use an alternate inspection checklist at the discretion and preference of laboratory personnel that best meets the needs of the laboratory. Follow -up an d documentation related to any identified corrective actions is very important . Inspection documentation for recent inspections and follow -up actions should be maintained and readily available. Laboratory Safety Reviews - EH&S Under the direction of the C LSC, EH&S has instituted a comprehensive Laboratory Safety Review Program to assist laboratories and other facilities in maintaining a safe work envir onment. This program provides assistance to aid compliance with regulations and to fulfill UC Davis's 74 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 commitment to protecting the health and safety of the campus community. These Safety Reviews are meant to supplement laboratory self -inspections. The Safe ty Reviews can also help to identify weaknesses that may require more systematic action across a broader spectrum of laboratories, and strengths that should be fostered in other laboratories. The criteria of the Laboratory Safety Review are available from the EH&S website. Once the review is completed, a Laboratory Safety Review Report is issued via Inspect . The report will identify deficiencies in the laboratory, both serious and non -serious . All findings must be corrected within 30 days. If corrective action is not undertaken in the identified time period, an escalation process will be initiated. Depending on the severity of the deficiency, the EH&S Laboratory Safety Review Program Supervisor , in consultation with the Chairperson for the CLSC , may temporarily suspend research activities until the deficiency is corrected . In some cases, the PI /Laboratory Supervisor may be required to provide a corrective action plan to the CLSC prior to resuming research activities. Recordkeeping Requirements Accurate recordkeeping demonstrates a commitment to the health and safety of the UC Davis community, integrity of research, and protection of the environment . EH&S is responsible for maintaining records of the Safety Reviews , accident investigations, monitoring equipment calibration, and training conducted by EH&S staff . Per OSHA regulations, departments or laboratories must document health and safety training, including safety meetings, one -on-one training, classroom training, and online training . A copy of recent Laboratory Safety Review Report and self-inspection docume ntation must also be maintained or otherwise be readily available . Additionally, the following records must be retained in accordance with the requirements of state and federal regulations: 1. Measurements taken to monitor employee exposures . 2. Inventory and use records for high -hazard substances. 3. Any medical consultation and examinations records, including tests or written opinions required by 8 CCR \u00a7 5191. 75 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 IX. Hazardous Chemical Waste Management Regulation of Hazardous Waste In California, hazardous waste is regulated by the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC ), a division within the California Environmental Protection Agency ( Cal/EPA ). Federal EPA regulations also govern certain aspects of hazardous waste management, since most of our waste is treated and disposed out of state . These hazardous waste regulations are part of the Resource Conservation and Recover y Act (RCRA ). Local enforcement authority is administered by the Yolo County Environmental Health Services - Hazardous Materials Programs . Hazardous Waste Program The EH&S Hazardous Waste Program manages the shipment and disposal of all hazardous waste generated on campus . All laboratory personnel must comply with the campus Integrated Hazardous Wast e program requirements and all applicable regulations . A regular pick- up service i s provided to most research buildings equipped with labs, and a pick- up is available upon request to other locations where hazardous waste is generated . Laboratory personnel are responsible for identifying, labeling, and properly storing hazardous waste in the lab oratory. Laboratory clean - outs and disposal of high hazard compounds must be scheduled in advance . The PI/Laboratory Supervisor is responsible for coordinating the disposal of all chemicals from his/her laboratories including prior to closing down laboratory operat ions. Comprehensive UC Davis requirements and guidance related to hazardous waste are provided in UC Davis Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Management , including a list of hazardous wastes , current definitions of hazardous waste, and related guidance. Additional hazardous chemical waste information is available from : SafetyNet #8 - Guidelines for Disposal of Chemical Waste SafetyNet #34 - Managing Chemical Waste Streams to Reduce Disposal Cost SafetyNet #43 - Identification and Segregation of Chemical Waste SafetyNet #110 - Guidelines for Completing the Chemical Waste Label SafetyNet #124 - Empty Container Management 76 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 1. Definition of Hazardous Waste EPA regulations define hazardous waste as substances having one of the following hazardous characteristics: Corrosive : pH 2 or 12.53 Ignitable : liquids with fla sh point below 60\u00baC or 140\u00baF ( e.g. methanol, a cetone) Reactive: unstable, explosive or reacts violently with air or water, ( e.g. sodium metal) or produces a toxic gas when combined with water, or contains cyanides or sulfides that can create a toxic gas or vapor Toxic : Determined by toxicity testing ( e.g. mercury) The EPA definition of hazardous waste also extends to the following items: Abandoned chemicals Unwanted chemicals Chemicals in deteriorating containers Empty containers that have visible residues Containers with conflicting labels Unlabeled or unknown chemicals Chemicals not in frequent use must be carefully managed to prevent them from being considered a hazardous waste. This is especially true for certain compounds which degrade and destabilize over time and require careful management so they do not become a safety hazard (see Waste Which Requires Special Handling ). NOTE the campus has more stringent waste restrictions as it relates to drain disposal of materials, be sure to consult the numerical Local Limits list and contact local_limits@ucdavis.edu with any questions prior to placing any materials into any campus drain. 2. Extremely Hazardous Waste Certain compounds me et an additional definition known as \"extremely hazardous waste\". This list of compounds includes carcinogens, pesticides, and reactive compounds, among others (e.g. cyanides, sodium azide, and hydrofluoric acid). The Federal EPA refers to this waste as \"a cutely hazardous waste,\" but Cal/EPA has published a more detailed list of extremely hazardous waste. Both the State and Federal lists are included in the EH&S List of Extrem ely Hazardous Waste . NOTE while there is some overlap with the list of Particularly Hazardous Substances, such as the examples listed above, the extremely hazardous waste list is specific to the hazardous waste management program. 3 There are additional restrictions on the disposal of substances with a non -neutral pH; see the section on Drain Disposal . 77 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 3. Biohazardous and Medical Waste Please consult SafetyNet #3 - Sharps Safety Guidelines , as well as the Medical and the Biological Waste Management webpages for UC Davis information on medical and biological waste, and contact EH&S Biosafety for handling and disposal information. 4. Radiological Waste Activities that produce or use radioactive materials may generate radioactive waste. Waste generated by research activities at UC Davis is typically low -level radioactive waste. Guidance regarding radioactive waste management is described on the EH&S w ebsite and in SafetyNet #9 - Guidelines for Disposal of Radioactive Waste . Please contact EH&S for additional information. Proper Hazardous Waste Management 1. Training All personnel who are responsible for handling, managing or disposing hazardous waste must attend training prior to working with these materials. Hazardous Waste Minimization training is available from EH&S, and includes instruction on the container labeling program . Additionally, videos outlining a var iety of WASTe functions are available on the WASTe website. Each laboratory must also complete annual training on their lab -specific spill response procedures and the CUPA self -audit . 2. Waste Identification All the chemical constituents in each hazardous waste stream must be accurately identified by laboratory personnel, even those components present at trace levels . This is a critical safety issue for both laboratory personnel and hazardous waste technicians who handle the waste once it is turned over to EH&S . Mixing of incompatible waste streams has the potential to create violent reactions and is a common cause of la boratory accidents . If there is uncertainty about the composition of a waste stream resulting from an experimental process, laboratory personnel must consult the PI/Laboratory Supervisor, the CHO , or the Hazardous Materials Manager . In most cases, careful documentation and review of all chemical products used in the experimental protocol will result in accurate waste stream characterization . The manufacturer's SDS provides detailed information on each hazardous ingredient in laboratory reagents and other commercial chemical products; and also the chemical, physical, and toxicological properties of the Figure IX -I. Sample label generated from WASTe. 78 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 ingredients. The UC SDS website provides access to SDS for hazardous chemicals. 3. Labeling Comprehensive UC Davis hazardous waste labeling information is provided on the EH&S website, and an online system for generating hazardous waste labels (WASTe) is also provided. An example of a completed WASTe tag is shown in Figure IX -I. Additional information is available from SafetyNet #110 - Guidelines for Completing the Che mical Waste Label . Refer to these resources as all hazardous waste must be appropriately labeled. 4. Storage The hazardous waste storage area in each laboratory is considered a Satellite Accumulation Area (SAA) by the EPA . According to EPA requirements, this area must remain under the control of the persons producing the waste . This means the SAA should be located in an area that is supervised and is not accessible to the public . The chosen SAA within the laboratory should be properly labeled and located in such a place as to minimally impact normal laboratory activities . Other SAA requirements include the following : 1. Hazardous waste containers must be labeled at all times. 2. Waste must be collected and stored at or near the point of gen eration . 3. According to State law, the maximum amount of waste that can be stored in a SAA is 55 gallons of a hazardous waste or one liter of extremely hazardous waste . If you reach these volumes for a specific waste stream, you must dispose of the waste wit hin three days . 4. The maximum amount of flammable solvents allowed to be stored in a laboratory is 60 gallons; this limit also includes waste solvents . 5. Hazardous waste streams must have compatible constituents, and must be compatible with the containers in which they are stored. 6. All hazardous waste containers in the laboratory must be kept closed when not in use . 7. Oxidizing inorganic acid waste (e.g. nitric acid, chromic acid, perchloric acid ) or pressure generating wastes (e.g. from use of piranha solution - also known as piranha etch, or use of aqua regia ) must be stored with vented or pressure -relief caps. 8. Hazardous waste containers must be stored in secondary containment at all times . Primary waste containers must be in good condition with leak proof lids . 9. Containers must be less than 90% full. 10. Dry wastes must be double -bagged in clear, three -mil plastic bags. 5. Segregation All hazardous waste must be managed in a manner that prevents spills and unexpected reactions . Additionally, proper waste seg regation can help reduce disposal costs. Whenever possible, recommended segregation approaches include : Segregate : o acids from bases o oxidizers from organics o cyanides from acids 79 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 o halogenated solvents from non- halogenated solvents o radioa ctive waste from chemical waste Exclude metals from solvent wastes. Refer to SafetyNet #43 - Identification and Segregation of Chemical Waste for additional guida nce on chemical waste segregation. 6. Incompatible Waste Streams Mixing incompatible waste streams, or selecting a container that is not compatible with its contents, is a common cause of accidents in laboratories and waste storage facilities . Reactive mixt ures can cause catastrophic container failure , resulting in serious injury and property damage . All chemical constituents and their waste byproducts must be compatible for each waste container generated . Waste labels must be immediately updated when a new constituent is added to a waste container, so personnel in the laboratory will be aware and manage the container and waste accordingly. Some common incompatible waste streams include: Oxidizers added to any fuel can create an exothermic reaction and may cause catastrophic container failure . The most frequent is acids oxidizing flammable liquids . Piranha etch solution is a specific waste stream which contains sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide . This forms a reactive mixture often still fuming during disposal . For this waste stream, and other reactive mixtures like it, vented caps are mandatory. US EPA has provided guidance on the compatibility of hazardous wastes, which can be obtained from Yale University EH&S . 7. Accumulation Time Hazardous waste may not accumulate anywhere on campus for more than one year . This one - year period includes the 60- 90 days EH& S may need to store the waste prior to shipment . As such, hazardous wastes must not be accumulated in laboratories for more than 270 days (9 months) after the accumulation start date . Hazardous wastes must be removed from laboratories no more than nine months after the accumulation start date. One major exception to the one year maximum accumulation period pertains to extremely hazardous wastes . Extremely hazardous wastes ( e.g. hydrofluoric acid, arsenic or bromine - containing wastes ) may not be accumulated for more than 90 days if certain volume limits are exceeded . For this reason, EH&S advises removal of all hazardous waste as soon as containers are full or at least every 90 da ys. 80 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 8. Waste Which Require s Special Handling a. Sharps Syringes, glass pipettes, and other sharps contaminated with hazardous materials (chemicals, radioactive, or biological) must be placed in a specially designed rigid container. Such \"sharps\" containers can be purchased through AggieBuy . Do NOT use red medical waste containers for non- medical waste sharps; unless the biohazard symbol has been defaced. EH&S will pick up sharps waste containers on request for disposal . Autoclaved sharps containers of medical waste must be disposed through EH&S or an approved medical waste disposal company ; contact EH&S Biosafety for more information . Addition al guidance for disposal of sharps and broken glassware is available in SafetyNet #3 - Sharps Safety Guidelines . b. Unknowns Unlabeled chemical containers and unknown/unlabeled wastes are considered \" unknowns \" and additional fees must be paid to have these materials analyzed and identified. These containers must be labeled with the word \"unknown\" . Do not mix unknowns in order to minimize disposal costs. c. Peroxide -Forming Chemicals Peroxide -forming chemicals include a number of substances which can react with air, moisture , or product impurities, and undergo a change in their chemical composition during normal storage . The peroxides that form are highly reactive and can explode upon shock or spark . Peroxides are not particularly volatile and thus tend to precipitate out of liquid solutions . It is particularly dangerous to allow a container of these materials to evaporate thereby concentrating any peroxides that may have formed in the container. Each container of peroxide forming chemicals should be dated with the date received and the date first opened. There are three classes of peroxide forming chemicals: 1. Form potentially explosive peroxides without concentration, 2. Form potentially explosive peroxides on concentration, and 3. Autopolymerize; with each class having different management guidelines (see SafetyNet #23 - Peroxide Formation in Ether and Other Chemicals ). Ensure containers of peroxide -forming chemicals are kept tightly sealed to avoid unnecessary evaporation, as this inhibits the stabilizers that are sometimes added . Visually inspect containers periodically to ensure they are free of exterior contamination or crystallization . Peroxide - forming chemicals must be disposed prior to expiration date . If old con tainers of peroxide forming chemicals are discovered in the laboratory, (greater than five years past the expiration date or if the date of the container is unknown), do not handle the container . If crystallization is present in or on the exterior of a con tainer, do not handle the 81 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 container and contact EH&S at ( 530) 752-1493 immediately . Secure the immediate area and restrict access to the container until it can be evaluated by EH&S personnel . d. Dry Picric Acid Picric acid (also known as trinitrophenol) must be kept hydrated at all times, as it becomes increasingly unstable as it loses water content . When dehydrated, it is not only explosive but also sensitive to shock, heat , and friction . Picric acid is highly reactive with a wide variety of compounds (including many metals) and is extremely susceptible to the formation of picrate salts . Be sure to label all containers that contain picric acid with the date received, and then monitor the water content every six months . Add distilled water as needed to maintain a consistent liquid volume . If old or previously unaccounted for bottles of picric acid are discovered, do not touch the container . Depending on how long the bottle has been abandoned and the state of the product inside, even a minor disturbance could be dangerous . Visually inspect the contents of the bottle without moving it to evaluate its water content and look for signs of crystallization inside the bottle and around the lid. If there is even the slightest indication of crystallization, signs of evaporation, or the formation of solids in the bottle, do not handle the container and contact the EH&S at ( 530) 752-1493 immediately . Secure the immediate area and restrict access to the container until it can be evaluated by EH&S personnel . SafetyNet #104 - Safe Use and Management of Picric Acid provides additional information related to picric acid. e. Explosive Compounds with Shipping Restrictions A variety of other compounds classified as explosives , or are water or air reactive are used in research laboratories . These compounds often have shipping restrictions and special packaging requirements . When disposing these compounds, employees must ensure they are stored appropriately for transport . Flammable metals must be completely submerged in oil before they are offered for waste pick -up. Many pyrophoric and reactive compounds can be stabilized using a quenching procedure prior to disposal . Chemicals classified by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as explosives ( e.g. many nitro - and azo -compounds) will require special packaging and shipping, and may require stabilization prior to disposal . Consult with the Chemical Hygiene Officer and the Hazardous Waste group for disposal considerations of these compounds. f. Chemotherapy Waste Pourable chemotherapy/oncology chemicals should be left in their original container and can be offered for hazardous waste pick- up. Complete a hazardous waste label through WASTe and submit the material for hazardous waste pickup . Medical devices and supplies associated with patient treatment, including tubes, empty containers, syringes, and sharps also cont aminated with chemotherapy drugs should not be managed through the standard hazardous waste pick- up system . These are disposed via the medical waste program . Because chemotherapy drugs are potent toxins, special yellow barrels are available for these materials, which are usually located in medical waste storage areas . For 82 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 more information, contact the Biosafety Program personnel and review the Medical Waste Management website. g. Animals Animal carcasses not contaminated with chemicals or radioactive materials are disposed through individual Department contracted service providers . For animal carcasses which have chemical or radioactive material contamination, c ontact EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 or hazwaste@ucdavis.edu for guidance on the needed disposal method. 9. Managing Empty Containers Empty containers that held Extremely Hazardous or Acutely Hazardous material must be managed as hazardous waste following the standard hazardous waste disposal procedures. Do not rinse or reuse these containers. All other empty hazardous waste containers, if they are less than, or equal to 5 gallons in size, should either be reus ed for hazardous waste collection, recycled , or discarded. The labels should be completely defaced (remove it or mark it out completely) and the cap removed . Dispose or recycle empty plastic or glass containers as regular trash or in a campus recycling bin . Empty containers greater than 5 gallons can be reused as a waste container or recycled through Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability . The container must be marked with the date it was emptied, and the container reused or recycled within one year of that date . EH&S SafetyNet #124 - Empty Container Management , provides a dditional information related to empty container management at UC Davis . Hazardous Waste Mini mization UC Davis is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste . In order to meet our permit obligations and our sustainability mission, EH&S has developed a Hazardous Waste Minimization Program, in an effort to minimize the costs, health hazards, and e nvironmental impacts associated with the disposal of hazardous waste . Additional informat ion and training on Hazardous Waste Management and Minimization is available. 1. Administrative Controls In order to reduce the amount of chemicals that become waste, administrative and operational waste minimization controls can be implemented . Usage of chemicals in the laboratory areas should be reviewed t o identify practices which can be modified to reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated. Purchasing: When ordering chemicals, be aware of any properties preclud ing long term storage, and order only exact volumes to be used. Using suppliers who can provide quick delivery of small quantities can assist with reducing surplus chemical inventory and associated risk. Consider establishing a centralized purchasing program to monitor chemical purchases and avoid duplicate 83 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 orders . Purchase the minimum quantit y needed, and no more than can be consumed within a year. Inventory: Rotate chemical stock to keep chemicals from becoming outdated, and implement the \"first in, first out\" approach to stock chemicals. Locate surplus/unused chemicals and attempt to redis tribute these to other users, investigate returning unused chemicals to the vendor , or dispose of surplus/unwanted material as hazardous waste through EH&S. Operational Controls: Review your experimental protocol to ensure chemical usage is minimized . Reduce total volumes used in experiments; employ small scale procedures when possible . Instead of wet chemical techniques, use instrumental methods, as these generally require smal ler quantities of chemicals . Evaluate the costs and benefits o f off- site analytical services . Avoid mixing hazardous and non -hazardous waste streams . Reuse solvents if possible . Spent solvents can also be used for initial cleaning, using fresh solvent only for final rinse . Use less hazardous or non -hazardous substitutes when fe asible . Some examples include: Specialty detergents can be sulfuric acid/chromic acid cl eaning solutions . SYBR Safe Gel Green and Gel Red are recommended in place of ethidium bromide. Ideas for ways to reduce disposal costs are provided in SafetyNet #72 - Chemic al Substitutes , and SafetyNet #34 - Managing Chemical Waste Streams to Reduce Disposal Cost. 2. Drain Disposal UC Davis does not permit drain disposal of chemical wastes, unless a specific dilution and/or neutralization method for a consistent waste stream has been reviewed and approved by EH&S. This applies to weak acid and base solutions. As indicated in previous sections, EPA hazardous waste definitions specify that materials with a pH between 2 and 12.5 are not hazardous wastes. However, drain disposal of these materials is still not permitted, because local industrial waste water discharge requirements have mor e restrictive pH thresholds (pH < 5 and pH > 11 are prohibited). In addition, acid and base neutralization may be considered waste treatment, a process strictly regulated by the EPA (see \"Bench Top Treatment\" below). Additional information on drain disposa l of materials can be found in Can This Go Down the Drain , SafetyNet#6 - Drain Disposal Guidelines , Sewer Disposal Policy , and on the numerical Local Limits webpage. Contact local_limits@ucdavis.edu for additional questions about drain disposal variances. Drain disposal of properly disinfected infectious or bio- hazardous liquids is acceptable, if disinfection is conducted as specified by the EH&S Biological Safety Program , and the liquids disposed contain no other hazardous constituents. 3. Bench Top Treatment EPA regulations allow some limited bench top treatment of certain chemical waste streams in laboratories provide d specific procedures are followed. Due to the stringent nature of these requirements, any treatment of hazardous waste in labs must be reviewed and approved by EH&S . The EPA requirements for treating hazardous waste in laboratories generally follow the 84 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 National Research Council \"Prudent Practices in the Laboratory\" 2011, Chapter 8 procedures, or other peer-reviewed scientific publications . The quantity of waste treated in one batch cannot exceed 5 gallons of liquid or 18 kilograms of solid/semi- solid waste . As treatment may result in residuals which may have to be managed as hazardous waste, all residual hazardous waste must be handled according to UC Davis Hazardous Waste Program requirements . 4. Laboratory Clean -out Laboratory clean -out typically involves the removal and disposal of excess chemicals when a laboratory is closing, moving , or when legacy chemi cals have been accumulated . Chemicals should be stored in the original manufacturer container (in good condition) with the original label . Departments must establish processes to ensure laboratory clean -outs are completed when needed and determine the fina ncially -responsible party for disposal costs . EH&S will assist with the completion of a laboratory clean -out. Please contact hazwaste@ucdavis.edu for consultation and guidance. Transportation and Disposal It is a violation of DOT regulations to transport hazardous waste in personal vehicles . As a result, EH&S provides pick- up services for all hazardous waste generators . These recurring waste pick - ups are for routinely generated r esearch wastes . Hazardous waste disposal requests can be initiated using WASTe . Frequent disposal will ensure that waste accumulation areas in labs are managed properly, and that maximum storage volumes are not exceeded . Once a waste container is 90% full or it is near the accumulation time limit, it should be scheduled for pick- up by EH&S . Once an experiment or process is completed, all containers, including those that are partially filled, should be scheduled for EH&S pick- up. SafetyNet #8 - Guidelines for Disposal of Chemical Waste provides related information. Prior to EH&S pick up, please inspect all containers to make sure they are safe to transport . Verify each container has an accurate waste label, and the containers are clean and free of residue and do not show any signs of bulging, fuming, or bubbling . EH&S may refuse to pick up waste that is not properly prepared. Hazardous waste pick- ups can be initiated at the WASTe website. Radioactive Wastes - related information is available at the EH&S Radioactive Waste Management website Biohazardous waste (medical waste, infectious materials or biohazardous agents) - contact Biosafety Program personnel and review related information on the EH&S Biological Waste Management website Controlled Substances - requests for controlled substance disposal can be initiated at the EH&S Disposal Requests for Controlled Substances website 85 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 X. Chemical and Laboratory Security Motivation Laboratories and university research activities can become a target of malicious actions with intent of inflicting harm to individuals or pursuant to criminal activity. Implementation of a laboratory security plan can help to mitigate risks of these malicious actions while being complementary to existing laboratory safety policies and procedures. Guidance on the elements of a laboratory security plan is available within Prudent Practices (see Chapter 10). Current campus laboratory security guidance can be found in SafetyNet #118 - Laboratory Security Tips for Hazardous Materials Users and PPM 390- 60. ACS has developed a security vulnerability checklist; it is recommended all laboratories complete this self- assessment. It is critical that chemicals be secured to prevent theft from campus laboratories. Numerous federal agencies are involved in the maintenance of laboratory security, including the Drug Enforcem ent Agency , Federal Bureau of Investigations , and Department of Homeland Security . Access to hazardous chemicals, including toxic and corrosive substances, should be restricted at all times (PPM 390- 60). All hazardous chemicals must be recorded in the chemical inventory system including any amount of Carcinogens or Chemicals of Interest (COI) as identified in the Chemical Facility Anti- Terrorism Standard (CFATS). These materials must be stored in laboratories or storerooms tha t are kept locked when laboratory personnel are not present. Locked storage cabinets or other precautions are always recommended, and may be required in the case of tax - free alcohol (see PPM 350 -20), select toxins , and controlled substances . For guidance on controlled substances, please contact cs- info@ucdavis.edu. For guidance on recommended locked st orage requirements, please contact the EH&S office at 530 -752-1493 or ehs -help@ucdavis.edu. Initial onboarding of laboratory personnel should include training on entry procedures, provisioning of appropriat e access, and inventory of any materials issued or acquired. On termination or transfer of laboratory personnel, all related hazardous materials should be properly disposed of, or transferred to the laboratory supervisor or a designee. It is each laboratory's responsibility to prevent and report any theft of chemicals from their laboratory. Laboratory, building, or facility access must also be modified to prevent terminated or transferred laboratory personnel from gaining access. A laboratory super visor, or designee, must retrieve all metal keys, disable electronic access, and/or change any PIN access codes. Security Vulnerability Assessment Laboratories are encouraged to conduct a Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) : assistance conducting a SVA is available from the UC Davis Police Department . Aspects that should be covered in a SVA include: Existing threats, based on the history of the institution (e.g., theft of laboratory materials, sabotage, data security breaches, protests); The attractiveness of the institution as a target, and the potential impact of an incident; 86 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Chemicals, biological agents, radioactive materials, or other la boratory equipment or materials with dual -use potentia l; Sensitive data or computerized systems; Animal care facilities; Infrastructure vulnerabilities (e.g., accessible power lines, poor lighting); Security systems in place (e.g., access control, cameras, intrusion detection); Access controls for laboratory personnel (e.g., background checks, authorization procedures, badges, key controls, escorted access); Institutional procedures and culture (e.g., tailgating, open laboratories, no questioning of visitor s); Security plans in place; and Training and awareness of laboratory personnel. Labs can increase their security by simply keeping lab doors closed and locked when unoccupied, maintaining a current and accurate chemical inventory, training personnel on security procedures, and controlling laboratory access through regular audits of metal keys and access control systems. Personnel should know each laboratory user: if unable to do so, personnel should wear identification badges, along with signing in and out visitors. Labs should immediately report any facility concerns related to lighting, door and lock hardware, or equipment function to Facilities Management. Labs should immediately report any suspicious activity, information security breaches or loss to the UC Davis Police Department and the PI/Laboratory Supervisor ; if intellectual property is also affected, the Information Security Office must also be notified. 87 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 XI. Accidents and Chemical Spills Regulatory Requirements The necessary work practices, procedures, and policies outlined in this chapter are required by the following: 8 \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" Overview Laboratory emergencies may result from a variety of fact ors, including serious injuries; fires and explosions; spills and exposures; and natural disasters . All laboratory employees should be familiar with and aware of the location of their laboratory's or department's emergency action plan and safety manuals . Before beginning any laboratory task, know what to do in the event of an emergency situation . Identify the location of safety equipment, including first aid kits, eye washes, safety showers, fire ex tinguishers, fire alarm pull stations, and spill kits . Plan ahead and know the location of the closest fire alarms, exits, and telephones in your laboratory. Additional information is available including: Campus emergency management policy ( PPM 390 -10). UC Davis Campus Emergency Management Plan . Information o n Emergency Management & Mission Continuity . Emergency Respon se Guide for the UC Davis campus provides an overview of emergency response procedures. A separate Emergency Response Guide for the UC Davis Health System is available for activities at the Sacramento campus. The applicable guide should be posted in each laboratory. For all incidents requiring emergency response, call 9 -1-1. Accidents In the event of an injury or illness : 1. Seek medical attention if needed . 2. Notify the PI/La boratory Supervisor immediately. 3. File a Worker's Compensation claim through the Employer's First Report (EFR) system. 88 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Serious i njuries and illnesses require an immediate notification to Environmental Health and Safety at (530) 752 -1493 during normal business hours or (530) 752- 1230 after hours, in accordance with SafetyNet #121- Reporting Work -Related Fatalities and Serious Injuries or Illnesses . The most common examples of a serious injury is anytime an employee is hospitalized, suffers permanent disfi gurement ( e.g., facial burn), loss of an eye, or amputation (bony involvement with a finger cut). PIs/Laboratory Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that their employees receive appropriate medical attention in the event of an occupational injury or illness . All accidents and injuries requiring medical care must be reported to EH&S . At a minimum, each laboratory should have the following preparations in place: 1. Access to a first aid kit . 2. Posting of emergency telephone numbers and locations of emergency treatment facilities , including Occupational Health Services . This information should be reviewed and updated if needed at least annually . 3. Training of adequate number of staff in basic first aid . Basic CPR training is also strongly recommended. 4. Training of staff to arrange a n escort for injured personnel to the medical treatment site when possible and to provide medical personnel with copies of SDS(s) for the chemical(s) involved in the incident . For non -emergencies, you may use a personal vehicle instead of taking an ambulance. ACCIDENT PREVENTION METHODS Do Don't Always wear appropriate eye protection ; Always wear appropriate laboratory coat ; Always wear appropriate gloves ; Always wear closed -toe/closed- heel shoes and full length pants ; Always confine long hair and loose clothing ; Always use the appropriate safety controls ( e.g. certified fume hoods) ; Always label and store chemicals properly; and Always keep the work area clean and uncluttered . Never enter the laboratory wearing inappropriate clothing ( e.g. open -toe shoes and shorts) ; Never work alone on procedures involving hazardous chemicals, biological agents, or other physical hazards unless approv ed by the PI/Laboratory Supervisor ; Never eat, drink, chew gum or tobacco, smoke, or apply cosmetics in the laboratory; Never m anipulate contact lenses in a laboratory; and Never use damaged glassware or other equipment . NOTE the UC Center for Laboratory Safety maintains a website of Lessons Learned from previous research -related incidents and injuries. Please review this information such that a known situation that previously resulted in an injury/incident at a previous institution is not repeated at UC Davis. UC Davis Safety Services also maintains a website of Lessons Learned . Researchsafety@ucdavis.edu welcomes the opportunity to discuss any previous incidents, corresponding Les sons Learned analyses, and efforts to support dissemination of anonymous 89 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Incident and Near -Miss information. By sharing this information at UC Davis, and throughout the UC system, we can aim to learn from previous events with the goal of preventing future recurrence. Efforts are underway to develop an efficient mechanism to anonymously collect and disseminate information on laboratory Incidents and Near -Misses to the UC Davis research community and UC system. If laboratory personnel experience a severe or life threatening injury , or any other medical emergency , call 9-1-1 for emergency response . When treatment at an Emergency R oom is needed ( e.g. burns, large lacerations, etc.) the two most applicable locations are: 1. Sutter Davis Hospital Emergency Room , (530) 756- 6440, 2000 Sutter Place, Davis, CA 95616. 2. UC Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) Emergency Department , (916) 734- 2011, 2315 Stockton Boulevard, Sacramento, CA 95817. Personnel with minor injuries should be treated with first aid kits as appropriate, and receive further evaluation and treatment when nec essary at: 1. Occupational Health Services , (530) 752 -6051, in the Cowell Building , UC Davis campus . 2. Student Health Ser vices, (530) 752- 2300, in Student Health and Wellness Center , UC Davis campus . 3. Employee Health Services , (916) 734- 3572, at 2221 Stockton Boulevard, Cypress Building, Suite A , UCDMC . After normal business hours, treatment can be obtained at designated medical centers and emergency rooms . If the injury is work- related, please follow the instructions for Worker's Compensation Injury Reporting . Please note that neither Occupational Health Services, Student Health Services, nor Employee Health Services offer emergency medical care. All acute emergencies should contact 9-1-1 or seek care at the nearest emergency room. Note, if your work environment is not in close proximity to Davis, CA (main campus ) or Sacramento, CA (UCDMC ), you must provide laboratory personnel with guidance on the location and contact information for the most appropriate medical treatment facility to your location . This information shall be contained in either: A) laboratory -specific SOPs , or B) a laboratory- specific Laboratory Safety Plan . Serious occupational injuries, illnesses, and exposures to hazardous substances must be reported to EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 within eight hours . EH&S will report the event to Cal/OSHA, investigate the accident, and complete exposure monitoring if necessary. Serious injuries include those that result in permanent impairment or disfigurement, or require hospitalization . Examples include , but are not limited to, amputations, lacerations with severe bleedin g, burns, concussions, fractures, and crush injuries . As soon as PIs/Laboratory Supervisors are aware of a potentially serious injury , they must contact EH&S . Serious injury posters are displayed across campus with instructions on reporting injuries to EH&S to ensure that all serious injuries are reported to Cal/OHSA within eight hours . See SafetyNet #121 - Reporting Work -related Fatalities and Serious Injuries or Illnesses for additional information . It is better to over -report injuries than it is to not report at all. 90 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Laboratory Safety Equipment New personnel must be instructed in the location of fire extinguishers, emergency eyewashes, safety showers, and other safety equipment before they begin work in the laboratory. This training is considered part of the laboratory- specific trainin g all lab personnel must complete, and is outlined in the Site-Specific Safety Orientation and Training Checklist for New Laboratory Personnel . Existing equivalent checklists are also acceptable. 1. Fire Extinguishers All laboratories working with combustible or flammable chemicals must be outfitted with appropriate fire extinguishers. All extinguishers must be mounted on a wall in an area free of clutter or stored in a fire ext inguisher cabinet. Personnel should be familiar with the location, use, and classification of the extinguishers in their laboratory. A helpful overview video on laboratory fires and fire extinguishers is available from the Dow Chemical Company and training on the pro per operation of a fire extinguisher is available from Fire Prevention. Laboratory personnel are not required to extinguish fires that occur in their work areas and should not attempt to do so unless: It is a small fire ( i.e. small trash can -sized fire ). Appropriate training has been received. It is safe to do so. The person wishes to do so and is cap able. Any time a fire occurs or a fire extinguisher is used, no matter for how brief a period, the PI/Laboratory Supervisor, or most senior laboratory personnel present at the time of the incident, must immediately report the incident to the UC Davis Fire Department at 9- 1-1. 2. Safety Showers and Eyewash Stations Immediate access to emergency eyewash stations and safety showers is required where the risk of c hemical exposure can cause: eye damage severe irritation permanent tissue damage toxic ity by absorption Access must be available in 10 seconds or less for a potentially injured individual; and access routes must be kept clear. The installation locations of emergency eyewashes and safety showers shall follow the current version of ANSI Z358.1. Safety showers must have a minimum clearance of 16 in ches from the centerline of the spray pattern in all directions at all times; this means that no objects should be stored or left within this distance of the safety shower. S ink-based eyewash stations and drench hoses are not adequate to meet this requirem ent and can only be used to 91 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 support an existing compliant system. Additionally, keg -type shower/eyewash systems are only acceptable as a temporary solution and are not intended to replace emergency safety showers/eyewash stations. In the event of contact with a chemical or substance, immediately irrigate the eyes and/or other parts of the body for 15 minutes . Individuals using the emergency eyewash and/or safety shower should be assisted by an uninjured person to aid in decontamination and to encourage th e individual to use the eyewash and/or shower for the full 15 minutes . Clothing that has been in contact with hazardous materials must be removed. Fire blankets and clean lab coats may be used to cover the injured person for warmth and modesty. Medical attenti on must be sought immediately, and the event reported to the PI/Laboratory Supervisor and EH&S (530) 752- 1493. Safety shower/eyewash combination units are tested according to SafetyNet #66 - Emergency Eyewash and Shower Testing and Use . 3. Fire Doors Many areas of research buildings contain critical fire doors as part of the building design . These doors are an important element of the fire contai nment system and shall remain closed unless they are held open by an electro magnetic releasing system integrated with the building fire detection system . See SafetyNet #513 - Fire Door Regulations for more information . Fire-Related Emergencies Everyone working in a laboratory should know the location and correct use of fire extinguishers . It is important to use the right kind of fire extinguisher for a given fire, as not all extinguishers can be safely used on all types of fires . At UC Davis the following classes of fire extinguishers are most common: A - Ordinary combustible solids including paper, wood, coal, rubber, and textiles . B - Flammable and combustible liquids including gasoline, diesel fuel, alcohol, motor oil, grease and flammable solvents . C - Electrical equipment. If you encounter a fire, or a fire -related emergency ( e.g. abnormal heating, smoke, burning odor), immediately follow these instructions: 1. Pull the closest fire alarm pull station and call 9 -1-1 to notify the Fire Department . 2. Evacuate and isolate the area Use portable fire extinguishers to facilitate evacuation and/or control a small fire ( i.e. size of a small trash can), if safe to do so . If possible, shut off equipment before leaving . Close doors . 92 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 3. Remain safely outside the affected area to provide details to emergency responders . 4. Evacuate the building when th e alarm sounds . It is against state law to remain in the building when the alarm is sounding . If the alarm sounds due to a false alarm or drill, you will be allowed to re -enter the building as soon as the Fire Department determines that it is safe to do so. Do not go back in the building until the alarm stops and you are cleared to reenter by Fire Department personnel . If your clothing catches on fire, go to the nearest emergency shower immediately and activate the water flow. If a shower is not immediately available (3 -5 steps), stop, drop, and roll; then proceed the nearest safety shower to cool off. A fire extinguisher may be used to extinguish a fire on someone's person. Report any burn injuries to the supervisor immediately and seek medical treatment. Report every fire (even if extinguished), explosion, and all situations having fire or explosion potential to 9- 1-1, as required by Fire Safety (PPM 390- 40). Contact UC Davis Fire Prevention by calling 9 -1-1 immediately every time a fire extinguisher is discharged. Information on fire extinguisher training, or to request a new fire extinguisher can be obtained from UC Davis Fire Prevention . Immediately report any fire or fire extinguisher discharge, even if the fire is extinguished, to the Fire Department by calling 9 -1-1 and the PI/Laboratory Supervisor. Chemical Spills Chemical spills , or release of gas, chemical smoke, or vapor, can result in chemical exposures and contaminations . Safet yNet #13 - Guidelines for Chemical Spill Control provides helpful information and should be posted in all laboratories . Additional guidance related to mercury spills is provided in SafetyNet #16 - Guidelines for Mercury Spill Control . These incidents become emergencies when: The spill results in a release to the environment ( e.g. sink or floor drain ). The material or its hazards are unknown . Laboratory personnel cannot safe ly manage the hazard . The material is too hazardous or the quantity is too large to safely manage without professional assistance . Effective emergency response to these situations is imperative to mitigate or minimize adverse reactions when chemical incidents occur . After emergency procedures are completed, all personnel involved in the incident should follow UC Davis chemical exposure procedures as appropriate (see Hazard Assessment and Chemical Expo sure Monitoring ). In the event of a significant chemical exposure or contamination, immediately try to remove or isolate the chemical if safe to do so . When skin or eye exposures occur, remove contaminated clothing and flush the affected area using an eye wash or shower for at least 15 minutes . Remember to wear appropriate PPE before helping others . For a non -emergency chemical ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure contact the California Poison Control System at 1-800- 222-1222 immediately for assistance, and seek medical care as instructed . PIs/Laboratory 93 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Supervisors must review all exposure situations, make sure affected employees receive appropriate medical treatment and/or assessment, and arrange for containment and clean -up of the chemical as appropriate. HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL SPILLS Do not try to clean up spills of any size. All spills of these materials require emergency response: halides 1. What to Do With a Small Chemical Spill (< 0.5 Liter) Evacuate all non -essential persons from the spill area . If needed, call for medical assistance by dialing 9- 1-1. Help anyone who may have been contaminated . Use emergency eyewashes/showers by flushing the skin or eyes for at least 15 minutes . Seek medical attention following use of the eyewash/safety shower. Post someone just outside the spill area to keep people from entering . Avoid walking through contaminated areas . Before attempting to clean -up a spill you must have the proper protective equipment (including safety goggles, gloves and a laboratory coat or other protective garment) and appropriate clean -up materials. C heck the chemical' s SDS in your laboratory or online for spill clean- up procedures, or call EH&S at (530) 752- 1493 for guidance. Turn off poten tial ignition sources ( e.g. open flames, electrical heaters, and other electrical equipment ), and close valves on compressed gas cylinders if the chemical is flammable . Confine the spill to a small area . Do not let it spread. Avoid breathing vapors from th e spill . If the spill is in a non- ventilated area, do not attempt to clean it up . Call for emergency personnel to provide HazMat response. Work with another person to clean -up the spill . Do not clean -up a spill alone . DO NOT ADD WATER TO THE SPIL L. 94 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Use an appropriate chemical spill kit to neutralize and absorb inorganic acids and bases . For other chemicals, use the appropriate spill kit or absorb the chemical with sorbent pads, paper towels, vermiculite, dr y sand, or diatomaceous earth. Collect the residue and place it in a clear plastic bag . Double bag the waste and la bel the bag with a properly completed Hazardous Waste label . Note, solid spills are not typically emergencies . If the chemical is toxic, use damp paper towels to transfer it into plastic bags, DO NOT dry sweep. 2. What to Do With a Large Chemical Spill (> 0.5 Liter) Large chemical spills require emergency response. Call 9 -1-1. If the spill presents a situation that is IDLH or presents a significant fire risk, activate a fire alarm, evacuate the area and wait for emergency response to arrive. Remove the injured and/or contaminated person(s) and provide first aid. Call for emergency medical response . As you evacuate the laboratory, close the door behind you, and: o Post someone at a safe distance from the spill area to keep people from entering the spill area . o Confine the spill area if possible and safe to do so. o Leave on or initiate exhaust ventilation ; o If possible, turn off all sources of flames, electrical heaters, and other electrical equipment if the spilled material is flammable . o Avoid walking through contaminated areas or breathing vapors of the spilled material . o Any employee with known contact with a particularly hazardous chemical must shower, including washing of the hair as soon as possible unless contraindicated by physical injuries . FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE SPILL CLEAN -UP Spill location Size of spill area/chemical quantity Toxi city Volatility Flammability and presence of ignition sources Availability of spill cleanup materials, including proper PPE Training of responders 95 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Earthquake In the event of an earthquake, please take the following precaution s: 1. Take cover under a desk or strong doorframe during the shaking . 2. Remain under cover indoors until the shaking subsides . Evacuate the building only once the shaking has ceased . 3. Report any injuries or broken utility services to 9 -1-1. 4. Assist any injured individuals with receiving medical attention . 5. Be prepared for these events .

Glossary ACCIDENT - an undesired event that results in personal injury or property damage, as defined by the National Safety Council . ACGIH - The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists is a voluntary membership organization of professional industrial hygiene personnel in governmental or educational institutions. The ACGIH develops and publishes recommended occupational exposure limits each year called Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for hundreds of chemicals, physical agents, and biological exposure indices. ACTION LEVEL - A concentration designated in Title 8, California Code of Regulations for a specific substance, calculated as an eight (8) -hour time weighted average, which initiates certain required activities such as exposure monitoring and medical surveillance. AEROSOL - Liquid droplets or solid particles dispersed in air that are of fine en ough size (less than 100 micrometers) to remain dispersed for a period of time. ASPHYXIANT - A chemical (gas or vapor) that can cause death or unconsciousness by suffocation. Simple asphyxiants, such as nitrogen, either use up or displace oxygen in the air . They become especially dangerous in confined or enclosed spaces. Chemical asphyxiants, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide, interfere with the body's ability to absorb or transport oxygen to the tissues. BIOLOGICALS - Medicinal preparation made from living organisms and their products, including, but not limited to, serums, vaccines, antigens and anti- toxins . \"C\" OR CEILING - A description usually seen in connection with a published exposure limit. It refers to the c oncentration that should not be exceeded, even for an instant. It may be written as TLV -C or Threshold Limit Value - Ceiling. (See also Threshold Limit Value). CARCINOGEN - A cancer -producing substance or physical agent in animals or humans . A chemical is considered a carcinogen or potential carcinogen if it is so identified in any of the following: National Toxicology Program, \"Annual Report of Carcinogens\" (latest edition) International Agency for Research on Cancer, \"Monographs\" (latest edition) OSHA, 29 CFR \u00a71910, Subpart Z, Toxic and Hazardous Substances Cal/OSHA has an additional definition for Select Carcinogens . CHEMICAL HYGIENE OFFICER - An EH&S employee who is qualified by training or experience to provide technical guidance in the development and implementation of the provisions of the Chemical Hygiene Plan and Standard Operating Procedures.

DESIGNATED AREA - An area which has been established and posted with signage for work involving hazards ( e.g. \"select carcinogens,\" reproductive toxins, or substances which have a high degree of acute toxicity) . A designated area may be the entire laboratory, an area of a laboratory, or a device such as a laboratory hood. EMERGENCY - Any potential occurrence, such as, but not limited to, equipment failure, rupture of containers, or failure of control equipment which could result in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous chemical into the workplace. EXPLOSIVE - A chemical that causes a sudden, almost instantaneous release of pressure, gas, and heat when subjected to a sudden shock, pressure, or high temperature. FLAMMABILITY LIMITS - The range of concentrations where a gas or vapor (from a liquid) as a mixture in air will propagate a f lame and cause an explosion . The concentration range spans the lower flammability limit (lower explosive limit) for the minimum concentration to the upper flammability limit (upper explosive limit) for the maximum concentration . Note that these limits vary according to temperature, oxygen levels, and the presence of other chemicals. FLAMMABLE - A chemical that falls into one of the following categories: 1. Flammable aerosol - an aerosol that, when tested by the method described in 16 CFR \u00a71500.45, yields a fl ame projection exceeding 18 inches at full valve opening, or a flashback (a flame extending back to the valve) at any degree of valve opening . 2. Flammable gas - a gas that, at ambient temperature and pressure, forms a flammable mixture with air at a concent ration of 13% by volume or less; or a gas that, at ambient temperature and pressure, forms a range of flammable mixtures with air wider than 12% by volume, regardless of the lower limit . 3. Flammable liquid - any liquid having a flashpoint below 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C), except any mixture having components with flashpoints of 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C) or higher, the total of which make up 99% or more of the total volume of the mixture . 4.

A chemical shall be considered to be a flammable solid if, when tested by the method described in 16 CFR \u00a71500.44, it ignites and burns with a self - sustained flame at a greater than one -tenth of an inch per second along its major axis. FLASHPOINT - The minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off a vapor in sufficient concentration to ignite in the presence of an ignition source or when tested as follows: 1. Tagliabue Closed Tester (See American National Standard Method of Test for Flashpoint by Tag Closed Tested, Z11.24- 1979 (ASTM D- 56-79) for liquids with a viscosity of less than 45 Saybolt Universal Seconds (SUS) at 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C) or that contain suspended solids and do not have a tendency to form a surface film under test . 2. Pensky -Martens Closed Tester (See American National Standard Method of Test for Flashpoint by Pensky- Martens Closed Tester, Z11.7 -1979 (ASTM D- 73-79) for liquids with a viscosity equal to or greater than 45 SUS at 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C), or that contain suspended solids, or that have a tendency to form a surface film under test . 3. Setaflash Closed Tester (See American National Standard Method of Test for Flashpoint of Setaflash Closed Tester (ASTM D -3278- 78)). Organic peroxides, which undergo auto accelerating the rmal decomposition, are excluded from any flashpoint determination methods specified above. GENERAL VENTILATION - Also known as general exhaust ventilation, this is a system of ventilation consisting of either natural or mechanically induced fresh air movements to mix with and dilute contaminants in the workroom air . This is not the recommended type of ventilation to control contaminants that are highly toxic, when there may be corrosion problems from the contaminant, when the worker is close to where the contaminant is being generated, and where fire or explosion hazards are generated close to sources of ignition. (See Local Exhaust Ventilation) HAZARD ASSESSMENT - A formal procedure undertaken by the Principal Investigator or designee in which occupation al hazards for all employees are described per procedure or task, and by affected body part(s) or organ(s), and which is documented and posted in the workplace with all personal protective equipment requirements. HAZARD WARNING - Any words, pictures, symbols or combination thereof appearing on a label or other appropriate form of warning which convey the hazards of the chemical(s) in the container(s). HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL - Any chemical which is classified as a physical hazard, or a health hazard, a simple asphyxiant, combustible dust, pyrophoric gas, a hazard not otherwise classified, or is included in the List of Hazardous Substances prepared by the Director pursuant to Labor Code 6382 ( 8 CCR \u00a7339 ). A chemical is also considered hazardous if it is listed in any of the following: 1. OSHA, 29 CFR \u00a71910, Subpart Z, Toxic and Hazardous Substances . 2. \"Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents in the Work Environment,\" ACGIH (latest edition ). 3. \"The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances,\" NIOSH (latest edition). 101 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (DOT) - A substance or material capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported including, but not limited to, compressed gas, combustible liquid, corrosive material, cryogenic liquid, flammable solid, irritating material, material poisonous by inhalation, magnetic material, organic peroxide, oxidizer, poisonous material, pyrophoric liquid, radioactive material, spontaneously combustible material, an d water -reactive material. HEALTH HAZARD - From 8 CCR \u00a75194, a chemical for which there is statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles that acute or chronic health effects may occur in exposed e mployees . Includes chemicals which are carcinogens, toxic or hepatotoxins, act on the hematopoietic system, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes or mucous membranes . The criteria for determining whether a chemical is classified as a health hazard are detailed in GHS Purple Book , which incorporates by reference 29 CFR 1910.1200 Appendix A . HIGHLY TOXIC - A substance falling within any of the following categories: 1. A substance that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 50 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when administered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each . 2. A substance that has a median lethal dose (LD50) of 200 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when administered by continuous conta ct for 24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between two and three kilograms each. 3. A substance that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) in air of 200 parts per million by volume or less of gas or vapor, or 2 milligrams per liter or less of mist, fume, or dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for one hour (or less if death occurs within one hour) to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each. INCIDENT - an unplanned, undesired event that adversely affects completion of a task. IGNITABLE - A solid, liquid or compressed gas waste that has a flashpoint of less than 140 \u00b0F. Ignitable material may be regulated by the EPA as a hazardous waste as well. INCOMPATIBLE - The te rm applies to two substances to indicate that one material cannot be mixed with the other without the possibility of a dangerous reaction. IRRITANT - A substance which, by contact in sufficient concentration for a sufficient period of time, will cause an inflammatory response or reaction of the eye, skin, nose or respiratory system . The contact may be a single exposure or multiple exposures . Some primary irritants: chromic acid, LABEL - Any written, printed or graphic material displayed on or affixed to containers of chemicals, both hazardous and non- hazardous. LABORATORY TYPE HOOD - A device located in a laboratory, enclosed on five s ides with a movable sash or fixed partial enclosure on the remaining side; constructed and maintained to 102 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 draw air from the laboratory and to prevent or minimize the escape of air contaminants into the laboratory; and allows chemical manipulations to be con ducted in the enclosure without insertion of any portion of the employee's body other than hands and arms. LABORATORY SCALE - Work with substances in which the containers used for reactions, transfers, and other handling of substances are designed to be e asily and safely manipulated by one person . \"Laboratory scale\" excludes those workplaces whose function is to produce commercial quantities of materials. LABORATORY USE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS - Handling or use of such chemicals in which all of the followi ng conditions are met: 1. Chemical manipulations are carried out on a \"laboratory scale \". 2. Multiple chemical procedures or chemicals are used. 3. The procedures involved are not part of a production process nor in any way simulate a production process . 4. 4. \"Protective laboratory practices and equipment\" are available and in common use to minimize the potential for employee exposure to hazardous chemicals. LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION (Also known as exhaust ventilation) - A ventilation system that captures and removes the contaminants at the point they are being produced before they escape into the workroom air . The system consists of hoods, ductwork, a fan, and possibly an air -cleaning device . Advantages of local exhaust ventilation over general ventilation inc lude: it removes the contaminant rather than dilutes it, requires less airflow and, thus, is more economical over the long term; and the system can be used to conserve or reclaim valuable materials; however, the system must be properly designed with the correctly shaped and placed hoods, and correctly sized fans and ductwork. MEDICAL CONSULTATION - A consultation which takes place between an employee and a licensed physician for the purpose of determining what medical examinations or procedures, if any, ar e appropriate in cases where a significant exposure to a hazardous chemical may have taken place. MIXTURE - Any combination of two or more chemicals if the combination is not, in whole or in part, the result of a chemical reaction. MUTAGEN - Anything that can cause a change (or mutation) in the genetic material of a living cell. NEAR -MISS - As defined by OSHA , refers to incidents where no property was damaged and no personal injury sustained, but where, given a slight shift in time or position, damage and/or injury easily could have occurred. General examples of near -misses include: Any non- compliance that could have led to an accident . Observation of unsafe conditions such as fire risks, faulty equipment, or failure to use appropriate PPE . Falling or flying objects that do not make contact with individuals nor cause any significant property damage . Waste going into the wrong waste stream. 103 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Failure of any equipment or associated systems that are in place to protect health and safety ( e.g. fume hoods, glove boxes) . Unexpected f ailure of building facilities systems which may compromise laboratory activities ( e.g. water supply, HVAC system) . Some specific examples of near -misses that have occurred in academic r esearch include: a. A vacuum pump leaking oil creates a slick floor surface where someone slips but does not fall nor is injured . b. A centrifuge tube breaks but not all of the broken glass is removed from the rotor . Someone reaches into the rotor and is poked by a residual piece of broken glass but no laceration occurs . c. Incompatible material is added to a hazardous waste container . The waste container pressurizes and ruptures while the lab is unoccupied. No equipment damage or chemical exposure occurs. NFPA - The National Fire Protection Association ; a voluntary membership organization whose aims are to promote and improve fire protection and prevention . NFPA has published 16 volumes of codes known as the National Fire Codes. Within these codes is Standard No. 705, \"Identification of the Fire Hazards of Materials\" . This is a system that rates the hazard of a material during a fire. These hazards are divided into health, flammability, and reactivity hazards and appear in a well -known diamond system using from zero through four to indicate severity of the hazard . Zero indicates no special hazard and four indicates severe hazard. (Note: The GHS system uses a numerical severity rating that is opposite.)

General Rules for Laboratory Work with Chemicals Prudent Laboratory Practices It is prudent to minimize all chemical exposures . Few laboratory chemicals are without hazards, and general precautions for handling all laboratory chemicals should be adopted, in addition to specific guidelines for particular chemicals . Exposure should be minimized even for substances of no known significant hazard, and special precautions should be taken for work with substances that present special hazards . One should assume that any mixture will be more toxic than its most toxic component and that all substances of unknown toxicity are toxic. Avoid inadvertent exposures to hazardous chemicals by deve loping and encouraging safe habits and thereby promoting a strong safety culture. Safe Laboratory Habits 1. Personal Protective Equipment Wear closed -toe/closed- heel shoes and full length pants, or equivalent, at all times when in the laboratory (i.e. no exposed skin from waist to toes) . Utilize appropriate PPE while in the laboratory and while performing procedures that involve the use of hazardous chemicals or materials . These items may include laboratory coats, gloves, and safety glasses or go ggles . (See UC Davis 290- 50, Protective Clothing and Equipment . Confine long hair and loose clothing . Wear appropriate gloves when the potential for contact with toxic materials e xists; inspect the gloves before each use, and replace them often . Remember that latex gloves provide little to no protection from solvents and strong corrosives . Do not reuse disposable gloves. Remove laboratory coats or gloves immediately on significant contamination, as well as before leaving the laboratory. Avoid use of contact lenses in the laboratory unless necessary; if they are used, inform supervisor so special precautions can be taken . Ensure that appropriate PPE is worn by all persons, including visitors, where chemicals are stored or handled . Use appropriate respiratory equipment when air contaminant concentrations are not sufficiently restricted by engineering controls, inspecting the respirator before use . Respirator requirements are summarized in SafetyNet #88 - The Respiratory Protection Program . Use any other protective and emergency apparel and equipment as appropriate . Be aware of the locations of first aid kits and emergency eyewash and shower stations . 107 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 2. Chemical Handling Before using any chemical know its characteristics (SDS are an excellent source of information) including: o Quantity that is toxic or hazardous o Route(s) of exposure o Type of hazard o Method of chemical action in the body o Symptoms of exposure o Physical properties of the chemical o Chemical compatibility Use only those chemicals for which the quality of the available ventilation system is appropriate . Vent apparatus which may dischar ge toxic chemicals (vacuum pumps, distillation columns, etc.) into local exhaust devices . Properly label and store all chemicals . Use secondary containment at all times ; Keep chemical containers tightly closed when not in use . Segregate chemicals in storag e to keep adequate separation between incompatible materials . Do not store chemical s in alphabetic order . Avoid smelling chemicals . Deposit chemical waste in appropriately labeled receptacles and follow all other waste disposal procedures in the campus Che mical Hygiene Plan. In the case of an accident or spill, refer to the emergency response procedures for the specific material . These procedures should be readily available to all personnel . Information on minor chemical spill mitigation may also be referenced in SafetyNet #13 - Guidelines for Chemical Spill Control . For general guidance, the following situations should be addressed: o Eye Contact : Promptly flush eyes with water for a prolonged period (15 minutes) and seek medical attention . o Skin Conta ct: Promptly flush the affected area with water and remove any contaminated clothing . If symptoms persist after washing, seek medical attention . o Clean -up: Promptly clean up spills, using appropriate protective apparel and equipment, and proper disposal . 3. Equipment Storage and Handling Use equipment only for its designed purpose . Store laboratory glassware with care to avoid damage . Use extra care with Dewar flasks and other evacuated glass apparatus; shield or wrap them to contain chemicals and fragments should implosion occur . Use certified fume hoods, glove boxes, or other ventilation devices for operations which might result in release of toxic chemical vapors or dust . Preventing the escape of these types of materials into the working atmosphere is one of the best ways to prevent exposure . Keep hood closed at all times, except when adjustments within the hood are being made . 108 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Leave the fume hood \"on\" even when it is not in active use if toxic substances are in the fume hood or if it is uncertain whether adequate general laboratory ventilation will be maintained when it is \"off. \" 4. Laboratory Operations Keep the work area clean and uncluttered . Seek information and advice about hazards, plan appropriate protective procedures, and plan positioning of equipment before beginning any new operation . If unattended operations are unavoidable, and have been approved by the PI/Laboratory Supervisor, place an appropriate sign on the door, leave lights on, and provide for containment of toxic substances in the event of failure of a utility service (such as cooling water) . Vacuum lines must be protected with traps to prevent contamination . Be alert to unsafe conditions and ensure that they are corrected when detected . Use of headphones in the laboratory, for non- research purposes is strongly discouraged , some of the risks are highlighted in a video from Cornell . If headphones are used in the laboratory for non -research purposes leave one ear unobstructed to be able to hear any sounds and language of any emergency events . If personal electronic devices ( e.g. laptop, cellular phone, MP3 player, etc.) are used in the laboratory, take precautions to prevent contamination with hazardous materials Know the locations of fire extinguishers, alarm pull stations, eyewashes, and emergency showers, and know how they operate . Immediately report any fires or fire extinguisher disch arge to the PI/Laboratory Supervisor and Fire Prevention . 5. Hazardous Waste Call EH&S with any problem concerning hazardous waste and its disposal . Completely fill out and attach hazardous waste labels before waste accumulation starts . Date containers when the first drop of waste is added to the container . Use only screw -top containers that can be securely closed . Keep containers closed except when being filled . Leave headspace in containers for expansion (do not fill over 90% full) . Store waste containers in secondary containment and properly labeled. Substitute less hazardous chemicals whenever possible. Unsafe Laboratory Habits 1. Personal Protective Equipment Do not enter the laboratory without wearing appropriate clothing, including closed - toe/closed- heel shoes and full length pants, or equivalent (i.e. no exposed skin from waist to toes) . Do not wear laboratory coats or gloves outside of the laboratory area . 109 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 2. Chemical Handling Do not smell or taste chemicals . Do not allow release of toxic substances or fumes into cold or warm rooms, as these types of areas typically involve re -circulated atmospheres . Never use mouth suction for pipetting or starting a siphon . Do not dispose any hazardous chemicals through the sewer system . These substances might interfere with the biological activity of waste water treatment plants, create fire or explosion hazards, cause structural damage or obstruct flow . 3. Equipment Storage and Handling Do not use damaged glassware or other equipment, under any circumstances . The use of damaged glassware increases the risks of implosion, explosion, spills, and other accidents . Do not use uncertified fume hoods or glove boxes for hazardous c hemical handling . Avoid storing materials in hoods and do not allow them to block vents or air flow. 4. Laboratory Operations Never work alone on procedures involving hazardous chemicals, biological agents, or other physical hazards unless you have received prior approval from the PI/Laboratory Supervisor . Avoid unattended operations, if at all possible . Unattended operations require prior approval from the PI/Laboratory Supervisor . Do not engage in distracting behavior such as practical joke playin g in the laboratory . This type of conduct may confuse, startle, or distract another worker . 5. Hazardous Waste Do not mix chemical waste streams, e.g. halogens, metals, solvents, etc. Never put chemical hazardous waste in red or biohazard bags . Do not place sharps, pipettes or broken glass in plastic bags (use an appropriate sharps container) . Do not leave waste containers open . Never guess at the contents of an unknown container. 6. Food/Drink Do not eat, drink, smoke, chew gum, or apply cosmetics in areas where hazardous chemicals are present; wash hands when the leaving the laboratory and before conducting these activities . Do not store, handle, or consume food or beverages in storage areas, refrigerators, glassware or utensils which are also used for laboratory operations involving hazardous chemicals . Wash areas of exposed skin well before leaving the laboratory . 110 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Chemical and Workspace Labeling Primary Container Labeling Most manufacturer labels provide safety information to inform about chemical hazards and to help workers protect themselves . This information may include protective measures and/or protective clothing to be used, first aid instructions, storage information and emergency procedures . On original manufacturer containers the label must not be removed or defaced in any way until the container is emptied of its original contents . Incoming containers must be inspected to make sure the label is in good condition . Date new chemicals when they are received in the labo ratory , as well as the initials of the responsible person . Time -sensitive peroxide forming chemicals should be labeled with the date received and date opened. Secondary Container Labeling The appropriate labeling o f chemical secondary containers (i.e. containers used for storing commercial chemicals that are not the original manufacturer packaging ) or laboratory- prepared solutions /dilutions is important to laboratory safety. With the excepti on of transient containers that will contain chemicals for immediate use and will not be left unattended , all containers of chemicals being used or generated in UC Davis research laboratories should be labeled sufficiently to indicate the contents of the c ontainer . Many chemicals lack a unique identification property (e.g. color, odor, etc.), and are thus impossible to distinguish based on sensory assessment . Following a consistent and comprehensive chemical labeling approach in the laboratory has many adva ntages including, but not limited to the following: To help prevent hazardous reactions resulting from the accidental combination of incompatible chemicals . To give workers the \"right to know\" regarding hazardous chemical exposure . To minimize the high costs associated with the disposal of unknown chemicals . To facilitate the proper storage and segregation of chemicals . To enable a quick response in the event of a chemical spill or other emergency. Appropriate labeling impacts the safety of various stakeholders in the laboratory. Improperly - labeled or unlabeled chemicals can be dangerous for safety and support personnel including, but not limited to: Laboratory personnel Laboratory Safety Officers/Laboratory Managers Custodial personnel Hazardous waste disposal personnel Facilities and Maintenance and Design and Construction Management personnel School/College/Departmental Safety Coordinators/Safety Officers Laboratory Safety Professionals Contractors 111 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Emergency Responders Regulatory Officials (e.g. California Safety and Health Administrations (Cal/OSHA), California Department of Public Health Representatives (CDPH), Department of Toxic Substances and Control (DTSC), California Unified Program Agency (CUPA), etc. Although experienced laboratory personnel may have learned and adapted to a prescribed labeling convention, new or inexperienced personnel may have difficulties understanding the labeling conventions used in a new laboratory setting. Standardized laboratory chemical labeling conventions are important to avoid confusion . Labels containing the proper chemical name, in English, can eliminate the confusion that may be caused when acronyms are used . Some examples of potentially confusing acronyms/abbreviations TEA: Triethyla mine or Triethanola mine At a minimum, the following information must be provided on a hazardous chemical conta iner: 1. The name of the chemical written in legible English: a. Acronyms or abbreviations may be used so long as the corresponding definitions are posted in a prominent location and available to all laboratory occupants . Any acronyms/abbreviations being used in the laboratory must be legible, located on a conspicuous area of the container, and included in the definitions posting; 2. The hazard(s) associated with the chemical. Any of the following hazard -labeling systems may be used: a. Word(s) that explain the hazard i. The use of acronyms or abbreviations for the hazard statement is strongly discouraged ii. The warning may be a single word (e.g. \"Danger\", \"Caution\", \"Warning\") or preferably identifies the hazard(s), including both physical (e.g. \"Water Reactive\", \"Flammable\" or \"Explosive\") and health (e.g. \"Carcinogen\", \"Corrosive\", \"Irritant\", etc.), such as what is found on the NFPA diamond and in hazard warnings on the manufacturer label or SDS b. Globally Harmonized System (GHS) hazard pictograms c. National Fire Prevention Association diamond 3. Chemicals prone to peroxide formation must also have: a. Date Received b. Date Opened Additionally, the following information should be provided on a hazardous chemical container: 4. The name of the person responsible for the chemical. 5. The date the chemical was synthesized or transferred from the original container . 112 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Containers of non- toxic and normally harmless chemicals should also be labeled with content information, including containers such as squirt bottles containing water or cont ainers of buffer solutions . This helps to minimize the inadvertent combination of incompatible materials . There are a few other laboratory labeling s ituations that occur frequently: A. Small vials can be grouped into one secondary container which is labe led with the above listed information . B. Novel chemicals need to be labeled based upon knowledge of the chemical and physical properties . If these properties are unknown, the materials should be treated similarly to Particularly Hazard ous Substances and labeled as \"Toxic\" . C. Temporary flasks must be labeled following the above requirements whenever they are left unattended. Labeling Resources and Options Labels should be durable and water, solvent and fade - resistant . Inexpensive commercially -manufactured squeeze bottles printed with NFPA triangle and/or GHS hazard labels are avail able for commonly used solvents . These are optimal because solvents tend to erode labels over time . ThermoFisher Scientific and other laboratory equipment vendors offer a wide variety of options. Label Maker s Commercial label makers are available starting at prices as low as $20 and can be used to make simple text labels . Brother manufactures many options, which can be used in conjunction with Brother TZe tape that adheres to glass, metal and plastic and resists fading, water and solvents . Chemical Labeling - What are Laboratory Personnel Responsible for? Inspecting incoming containers to be sure that labels are attached and are in good condition and contain the information outlined above; Reading the container label each time a newly purchased chemical is used. It is possible that the manufacturer may have added new hazard information or reformulated the product since the last purchase; Ensuring that chemical container labels are not removed or defaced, except when containers are empty; Labeling any secondary containers used in the laboratory, to prevent unknown chemicals or inadvertent re action; and Verifying that chemical waste containers have complete and accurate chemical waste labels Pre-Printed Solvent Squirt Bottles 113 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Labels pre -printed with the applicable GHS hazard pictograms can be used to identify hazards . ThermoFisher Scientific , Labelmaster , and other vendors offer options for hazard symbol labels , and some ( e.g. LabelMaster ) even offer a variety pack of hazard labels . Additionally, EH&S has a Cobra Syst ems printer capable of printing labels on vinyl adhesive tape for a variety of unique safety situations, including the GHS pictograms . Ink-Jet/Laser -Jet Printer Labels Avery and other manufacturers offer a multitude of adhesive labels and document templates to assist the creation of laboratory labels . This includes a series of products intended for chemical and GHS labels . By using printed text , a large amount of information can be placed legibly into a smaller area than would be possible by hand -written ink . One great application of this type of label is for ampules . Once the printed label has been adhered to the container surface it can be further covered by clear tape to improve the label's durability. Workspace Labeling It is good laboratory practice to label one's workspace to convey information regarding the activities and hazards to other laboratory occupants . Workspaces must be labeled under the following conditions: 1. In areas where radioactive materials are used or stored; 2. In areas where Particularly Hazardous Substances are used or stored, including: a. Acutely Toxic Materials; b. Carcinogens; and c. Reproductive Toxins; 3. When a reaction is left unattended; and 4. When a reaction is left overnight. For more information on labeling, see Chapter 6 (Inventory, Labeling, Storage, and Transport ) and SafetyNet #42 - General Guidelines for Storage and Management of Laboratory Chemicals . Pre-printed Labels/Pictograms 114 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Globally Harmonized System (GHS) - Old vs. New GHS System 115 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Particularly Hazardous Substances - Supplemental Information Particularly Hazardous Substances Definitions Particularly hazardous substances fall into the following three major categories: acute toxins, repro ductive toxins , and carcinogens. Acute Toxins Substances that have a high degree of acute toxicity are substances that may be fatal or cause damage to target organs as the result of a single exposure or exposures of short duration . They can be defined as: 1. A chemical with a median lethal dose (LD50) of 50 mg or less per Kg of body weight when administered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 g rams each; 2. A chemical with a median lethal dose (LD50) of 200 mg or less per Kg of body weight when administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between 2 and 3 Kg each; and 3. A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC50) in air of 5000 ppm by volume or less of gas or vapor, or 50 mg per liter or less of mist, fume, or dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for 1 hour (or less if death occurs within 1 hour) to albino rats w eighing between 200 and 300 g rams each. Reproductive Toxins Reproductive toxins include any chemical which may affect the reproductive health of men and women including fertility, chromosomal damage (mutagenesis ), and developmental effects on embryos or fetuses (teratogenesis) . A list of reproductive toxins is maintained online at http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/Newlist.html. Carcinogens Carcinogens are chemical or physical agents that are capable of causing cancer. Generally, they are chronically toxic substances; that is, they cause damage after repeated or long -duration exposure and their effects may only become evident after a long lat ency period. Comprehensive UC Davis requirements are outlined in the carcinogens SOP . Please contact EH&S with any questions you may on the safety expectation s for carcinogen use . 116 UC Davis Laboratory Safety Manual v1.5 Segregation of Incompatible Chemicals Table F.1 contains a list of incompatible chemicals . The following chemicals, listed in the left column, should not be used with chemicals listed in the right column, except under specially controlled conditions . Chemicals in the left column should not be stored in the immediate area with chemicals in the right column. Incompatible chemicals should a lways be handled, st ored or packed so that they cannot accidentally come into contact with one another . This list is representative of chemical incompatibilities and is not complete, nor are all incompatibilities shown.
