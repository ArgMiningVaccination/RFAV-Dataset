This section does not prevent any insurer from 26 reimbursing an attending provider or health care facility on a 27 capitated, case rate, or other financial incentive basis. 28 (5) Every carrier that provides coverage for maternity services 29 must provide notice to policyholders regarding the coverage required 30 under this section. The notice must be in writing and must be 31 transmitted at the earliest of the next mailing to the policyholder, 32 the yearly summary of benefits sent to the policyholder, or January 1 33 of the year following June 6, 1996. 34 (6) This section does not establish a standard of medical care. 35 (7) This section applies to coverage for maternity services under 36 a contract issued or renewed by a health carrier after June 6, 1996, 37 and applies to plans operating under the health care authority under 38 chapter 41.05 RCW beginning January 1, 1998. 39 p. 52 HB 2378Sec. 39.
