Whether I am packing up my two young children to attend my sister's art show in Mexico City, heading to the Alaskan wilderness to explore with my brother and his family, or simply discovering a new neighborhood park - adventuring and travel is part of my soul. My quest for natural solutions began with the catastrophic end of my collegiate running career. As an athlete, I struggled with chronic stress fractures and eventually fractured my pubic bone. After a lack of answers from medical specialists, I was forced to search on my own for the underlying cause, which ultimately lead me to a career in Naturopathic and Chiropractic Medicine. Some happenings in life, however, are unexpected. The sudden death of my husband in 2019 opened a rawness and depth that was beyond my imagination. Through this tragedy, I continue to gain perspective to positively impact and connect to the experiences of others. We all have a story and I am here to bring strength, hope, and health to yours. Naturopathic medicine is built upon the foundation of our body's wonderfully innate ability to heal itself. Ailments are intertwined on a physical, mental, emotional, and environmental level. They should not be separated. My ambition is to guide you to the underlying cause of your health concerns, providing the tools to lead you to wholeness, independence, and happiness. After all, the only way out is through! I look forward to partnering with you on your journey...
