If an era has no good treatment for a malady, the effort is limited, uncertain, or inconclusive. The Medicine skill grants knowledge of a wide variety of drugs and potions, natural and man-made, and understanding of the side effects and contraindications. Treatment using the Medicine skill takes a minimum of one hour and can be delivered any time after damage is taken, but if this is not performed on the same day, the difficult level is increased (requiring a Hard success). A person treated successfully with Medicine recovers 1D3 hit points (in addition to any [First Aid](/wiki/First_Aid) they have received), except in the case of a [dying](/wiki/Dying) character, who must initially receive successful [First Aid](/wiki/First_Aid) to stabilize them before a Medicine roll is made. A character is limited to one treatment of [First Aid](/wiki/First_Aid) and Medicine until further damage is taken (except in the case of a [dying](/wiki/Dying) character who may require stabilizing with [First Aid](/wiki/First_Aid) multiple times). Successful use of Medicine can rouse an unconscious person to consciousness. In treating [Major Wounds](/wiki/Major_Wound:_the_Effects), successful use of the Medicine skill provides the patient a [Bonus](/wiki/Bonus_Dice) die on their weekly recovery roll. The Keeper may grant automatic success for medical treatment in a contemporary, well-equipped hospital. Opposing skill/Difficulty level: - Regular difficulty: diagnosis and treatment of standard medical ailments, with access to equipment (at least a doctor's bag containing drugs and instruments) and a suitable environment. - Hard difficulty: diagnosis and treatment in a dirty and unsafe environment, with the minimum of equipment. Pushing examples: consulting with colleagues; conducting further research; trying something experimental or more risky; performing some form of clinical experiment. Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll: you misdiagnose the ailment and you worse the patient's condition (perhaps even killing them); your good standing comes into question and you are investigated for malpractice. In the case of a [dying](/wiki/Dying) character, if a pushed Medicine roll is failed, the patient dies. - If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, the results will be disturbing to the extreme, perhaps involving amputation or blood poisoning as a result of failed attempts to graft animal parts to a person.
