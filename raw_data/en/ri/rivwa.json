Read Full LicensePage 3/21Abstract Background Dysregulation of gut microbiota-host bile acid (BA) co-metabolism is a critical pathogenic factor of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), instructed by pattern differentiation, is effective in treating IBS-D, in which liver depression and spleen de\u0000ciency (LDSD) is the most prevalent pattern. Still, it is unclear the linkage between the LDSD pattern and the BA metabolic phenotype. This study aimed to uncover the biological basis of the LDSD pattern from the BA metabolic perspective. Methods Patients with IBS-D completed questionnaires regarding the irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBS- SSS), stool frequency, Stool Bristol scale, and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Fasting blood and morning feces were collected to analyze the gut metagenome and BA-related indices/metabolites. Results IBS-D patients with LDSD had higher of BA overexcretion (41% vs. 23% non-LDSD) with signi\u0000cant elevations in fecal total BAs and serum BA precursor 7 -hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one levels. Compared to controls or non-LDSD patients, LDSD patients had a featured fecal BA pro\u0000le, with higher proportions of deoxycholic acid (DCA), 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. It is consistent with the BA-metabolizing genomic changes in the LDSD gut microbiota characterized by overabundances of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria and BA-inducible genes (baiCD/E/H). The score of bowel symptoms (stool frequency and abdominal pain) showing greater severity in the LDSD pattern were positively correlated with bai-expressing bacterial abundances and fecal DCA levels separately. Conclusion We clari\u0000ed an LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic phenotype, which closely correlates with the severity of bowel symptoms. It demonstrates that gut microbiota and host BA co-metabolism would provide crucial insight into the biology of the LDSD pattern and its internal relationship with IBS progression. Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) characterized by abdominal pain and altered stool habits is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), affecting 11% of the global population and 6% of the Chinese population [1]. IBS is grouped into four subtypes, including diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), and un-subtyped IBS (IBS-U), among which IBS- D is more prevalent in China [2]. As a result of complex etiologies and incompletely understood pathogeneses, mainstream medications are symptom-focused and generally have unsatisfactory e\u0000cacy [3, 4]. There is an increasing demand for alternative medicine in treating IBS.Page 4/21Herbal medicine is a frequently chosen alternative approach for the Chinese population. Cohort studies have reported that herbal formulas instructed by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) pattern differentiation are substantially effective in relieving global bowel symptoms of IBS-D, diarrhea, and abdominal pain/distention [5-7]. Liver Depression and Spleen De\u0000ciency (LDSD) is the most general TCM pattern in IBS-D; herbal formulas with liver-soothing and spleen-strengthening properties (e.g., Tong- Xie-Yao-Fang and Xiao-Yao-San) are widely applied to treat IBS-D [8, 9]. Nevertheless, the biological foundation of the LDSD pattern is yet to be clari\u0000ed, which restricts the development of pharmacology and clinical application of liver-soothing and spleen-strengthening herbal medication. IBS-D can be triggered by multiple external and internal factors, which include an excess of irritants, e.g., bile acids (BAs), exposure in the colon [10, 11]. BA overexcretion was reported to affect around 30% of IBS-D patients, who exhibit more severe bowel dysfunction, poorer quality of life, and a higher depression score than those with normal BA excretion [12]. Excessive BA excretion in IBS-D has been thought to be caused by increased hepatic BA synthesis (marked by a higher level of serum BA synthetic intermediate 7 -hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one)[13-15]. We further uncovered that the Clostridia-rich gut microbiota also contribute to intraluminal BA metabolic disturbance and thus suppress intestinal BA feedback control of BA synthesis, leading to diarrhea [16]. Hence, the dysregulated gut microbiota-host BA metabolism is a critical promotor of IBS-D. Given that the BA pool has been reported to be changed in speci\u0000c TCM patterns of GI diseases [17-19], we suppose that the BA metabolic phenotype should be altered with the LDSD pattern of IBS-D. This study enrolled 221 IBS-D patients with the LDSD or non-LDSD pattern and 80 matched healthy controls. Serum BA indices, fecal BA, and fecal microbiota pro\u0000les were individually tested to obtain LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic phenotype. Methods Subject recruitment and pattern differentiation Adults (18-65 years) meeting the Rome IV criteria for IBS-D [20, 21] were recruited at Chinese medicine clinics a\u0000liated with the School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University. By referring to the TCM pattern differentiation criteria previously published [22], each patient was grouped into LDSD or non- spleen-stomach heat-dampness, spleen-kidney yang spleen de\u0000ciency with dampness) based on the phenotypes of tongue coating, and the conditions of defecation, fatigue, cold-fearing and emotion. Additional age-and gender-matched healthy volunteers without gastrointestinal diseases, BA-related diseases (e.g., metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric illness and neurodegenerative diseases) and no surgical histories of gallbladder removal, GI tract, and cerebral cranium were recruited. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Human & Animal Subjects in Teaching & Research of HKBU (Approval no. HASC/15-16/0300 and HASC/16-17/0027), and all recruits signed the written consent form.Page 5/21The questionnaires of IBS symptoms contained IBS-SSS, daily defecation frequency, Bristol Stool Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were required to complete when the interview with physicians. Participants were instructed to provide fasting blood samples and morning \u0000rst feces, required to stop using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics and other microbiota-related supplements at least one month before sampling. Determination of serum BA-related indices Serum total BAs and \u0000broblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) were determined by commercial Assay Kit (Thermo scienti\u0000c, Waltham, MA, USA). Serum 7 -hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) was tested based on the liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrum (LC/MS) as our previously described [16]. LC/MS-based quanti\u0000cation of fecal BA metabolites A total of 36 BA standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The isotopic BA deoxycholic acid-2,2,4,4-d4 (DCA-d4) was used as internal standard and was obtained from CDN isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). HPLC grade organic reagents for mass spectrometric analysis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). BA standards were dissolved in methanol as stock solution with a concentration of 5 mg/ml. A mixed stock solution was prepared by mixing individual standard stock solution. The standard curves and regression coe\u0000cients were gained based on (internal standard) IS adjustment. The signals of each BA metabolites were found in individual measured ranges. As previously described [16], fecal BAs were quanti\u0000ed by an LC/MS UHPLC 1290 QQQ- USA) with a single 26-min acquisition with positive/negative ion switching method under multiple reaction monitoring mode. Sample injection and \u0000ow rate were set at 2 \u00b5L and 0.35 ml/min for each sample, respectively. Bile acid metabolites were separated an ACQUITY BEH C18 column (1.7 \u00b5m, 100mm \u00d7 2.1 mm) with a linear gradient of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (A) and 0.1% FA in acetonitrile (B). The gradient program was: 25-40% B for the \u0000rst 6 min, 40- 70% B for 14 min, 70-100% B for 0.1 min, held at 100% B for 2.9 min, then re-equilibration at 25% B for 0.1 min, and held at 25% B for 2.9 min. The column temperature was maintained at 45 C. The capillary voltage of mass spectrometer was 3.5 kV and 4 kV in positive and negative modes. The acquisition data was analyzed using Agilent MassHunter Workstation Software for peak integration, calibration equations and quanti\u0000cation of individual BAs. Fecal total BA levels of included subjects were obtained by accumulation of all testing BAs. Fecal metagenomic sequencing Microbial DNA was extracted from morning stools (200 mg) with the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufactures' instructions. The DNA library was established using a TruSeq DNA HT Sample Prep Kit and sequenced by the Illumina Hiseq 2000 at BGI-Shenzhen. By removing low quality bases and human genome, the high-quality sequences were mapped using the published gene catalog database of the human gut microbiome [23]. Microbial diversity was previously [24, 25]. Functional orthologs (KOs) were predicted against the KEGG gene database (v79) by BLASTP with the highest scoring annotated hits. The relative abundances of phyla, genera, species and KOs were calculated from the relative abundances of their respective genes. Statistical analysis Variations of clinical characteristics, bowel symptom severity scores, BA-related indices, fecal BA metabolites were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests for comparison of multiple groups while the Mann-Whitney test was employed for comparison of two groups. Differential taxa and BA- transforming genomes were obtained from the Benjamin-Hochberg method with the p value less than 0.1. Relationships of bowel symptom scores with fecal total BA levels or BA-metabolizing species abundances were analyzed by Spearman's and Pearson's correlation based on Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The signi\u0000cance difference for all of tests except for fecal metagenomic data was set to p<0.05. Results A higher incidence of BA overexcretion with more severity of bowel symptoms in the LDSD pattern The baseline characteristics were summarized in Table 1. There was no difference in the subject distribution of gender, BMI, IBS-SSS, SDS, and SAS between the LDSD and non-LDSD groups except for the indices of age and fecal BA excretion (p<0.05 resulted from the Chi-square test). There was a lower proportion of elderly patients over 50 years in the LDSD group (19% vs. 34% non-LDSD). By referring to the 90th percentile of fecal total BA levels from healthy subjects [16], a higher incidence of BA overexcretion ( 10.61 \u00b5mol/g) shown vs. 23% non-LDSD). Page 7/21Table 1 The baseline characteristics of included IBS-D patients with LDSD or non-LDSD pattern. Characteristics (%) 36 (34%) 32 (27%) 1.161 0.281 SAS 50, patients from either LDSD or non-LDSD group exhibited diarrheal symptoms, marked with increased levels of stool frequency and stool Bristol score relative to controls (Fig. 1A, B). Although there was no difference in the levels of stool Bristol score, IBS-SSS score, and abdominal distention score between the two IBS-D subgroups, the LDSD pattern had more frequent daily defecation and a higher abdominal pain score (Fig. 1C-E). As shown above, the LDSD pattern exhibits more severe stool frequency, abdominal pain, and a higher incidence of BA overexcretion. An increase of serum C4 with altered fecal BA pro\u0000le in the LDSD patternPage 8/21In consistent with a higher incidence of BA overexcretion, fecal total BA levels was increased in LDSD patients relative to controls or non-LDSD patients (Fig. 2A). Also, fecal total BA levels were borderline elevated in the non-LDSD group. But serum total BA levels were unchanged in both IBS-D groups (Fig. 2B). Serum C4, a BA precursor as an indicator of BA synthesis [15], was remarkably raised in the LDSD group (Fig. 2C), whereas serum FGF19 released from the intestine with the function to control BA synthesis negatively showed a slight reduction (Fig. 2D). LC/MS-based BA data revealed that both LDSD and non-LDSD groups showed remarkable increase in levels of primary BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) in feces (Fig. 2E, F). But secondary BA pro\u0000le was differed between the two groups. Glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), acid 12-ketolithocholic acid (12-KLCA) were elevated in LDSD patients compared with controls and/or non-LDSD patients (Fig. 2E, F). Fecal BA composition data consistently showed higher proportions of DCA, LCA and 7-KDCA in the LDSD pattern (Fig. 2G). While the non-LDSD group had a higher glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) level and an increased proportion of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (Fig. 2E-G). The above results suggest an enhanced host BA synthesis for the LDSD pattern, with an altered BA-transforming gut microbiome. Distinct gut microbiota structures between the LDSD and non-LDSD groups Fecal metagenome data showed that there was no difference in total gene numbers and the Shannon index among the three groups of control, LDSD and non-LDSD, indicating similar gut microbiota - diversity (Fig. 3A). The PCA analysis also revealed similar microbial -diversity among groups (Fig. 3B). Still, the taxonomic pro\u0000le data demonstrated particular differentiation in the fecal microbiota structure among groups. At phylum level, dominant bacteria in the LDSD group did not differ statistically from controls, but the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was increased (Fig. 3C, D). Non-LDSD patients showed increased abundances of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria, while the abundance of Chloro\u0000exi decreased (Fig. 3C). Further, the top 30 differed bacteria (p<0.1 from the Kruskal-Wallis test) was focused to obtain the main change in the taxonomic composition among groups at the genus level (Fig. 3E and Table S1). The gut microbiota of patients from the two IBS-D subgroups similarly changed, showing that Bilophila, Fusobacterium, were de\u0000cient (Fig. 3E and Table S1). Certain bacteria altered differentially between the two groups, in which genera Mobiluncus and Treponema reversely showed 3E and Table S1). Notably, the LDSD pattern had an increased level of Clostridium and decreased levels of Odoribacter and PrevotellaPage 9/21(Fig. 3E and Table S1). Sequence data demonstrated differed gut microbiota signatures between patterns. LDSD-speci\u0000c microbiota featured by altered BA deconjugation and 7-dehydroxylation levels A total of 9 BA-metabolizing genes were identi\u0000ed from the metagenome dataset. Three inducible including and increased abundances in the LDSD group (Fig. 4A). Such three bai genes highly dominated in the LDSD pattern is known to encode 7- dehydroxylases that derives secondary BA (such as DCA and LCA) from primary BA (such as CA and CDCA)[26]. Moreover, the gene cgh, encoding or taurine from salts, had a lower abundance. By searching the open-access database VIRTUAL METABOLIC HUMAN (https://vmh.life/), Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria was to be lower in the LDSD group (Fig. 4B). The bai genes are expressed in few species, including hylemonae C. hiranonis and C. scindens showed increased abundances in the LDSD pattern (Fig. 4C-F). The LDSD gut microbiota enriched by 7-dehydroxylating Clostridium species and the bai genomes was in accordance with higher levels of DCA, LCA and their glycine conjugations shown in fecal BA pro\u0000le data. LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic changes linked with the severity of bowel symptoms We further explored the relationships between LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic phenotype and bowel symptom severity. Spearman's correlation data showed that the levels of stool frequency and stool Bristol score were positively associated with the amounts of serum C4 and fecal total BAs (Table S2). Primary BAs (GCA, GCDCA, CA and CDCA) had positive relationships with stool frequency and stool Bristol scores. DCA, a secondary BA derived from microbiota 7-dehydroxylation, showed positive relationships with levels of stool frequency and abdominal pain score (Table S2). Similarly, abundance of bai-expressing Clostridium species (accumulated by C. scindens and C. hiranonis) was positively associated with levels of stool frequency and abdominal pain score (Fig. 5). The data demonstrated a particular linkage between LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic phenotype and the severity of stool frequency and abdominal pain. Discussion BA is known to be synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and stored in the gallbladder, secreted into the small intestine when intaking diets, almost reabsorbed from the distal ileum into the portal vein and returned back to the liver; remaining non-reabsorbed BAs are entered into the large intestine and transformed by gut microbiota, \u0000nally excreted out of the body in feces [27]. BAs are lost in feces daily, equal to the amount of hepatic synthesis [28]. In terms of the BA metabolic process, the BA overexcretionPage 10/21of IBS-D has been thought to be caused by dysregulated feedback control of BA synthesis, varied genotypes of BA metabolic regulators, increased GI transit, or combination of above factors [29-32]. This study revealed the linkage between the TCM pattern and the BA metabolism in IBS-D for the \u0000rst time, suggesting that fecal BA overexcretion is associated with more than one TCM pattern of IBS-D, with a closer relation with LDSD. Our data that an increase in the serum C4 level and a slight reduction in the serum FGF19 level at least indicate that an excess of BA synthesis due to de\u0000cient feedback control, which contributes to the BA overexcretion in the LDSD pattern. We also noted that the LDSD pattern had a higher level of stool frequency with increased amounts and proportions of fecal free secondary BAs, suggesting that a fast colonic transit might be another contributor of the enhanced BA synthesis and excretion. A positive relationship between the stool frequency level and the amount of serum C4 also support the notion. Above evidence suggests that host BA metabolism of the LDSD pattern is featured with a higher hepatic synthetic level but a lower colonic absorptive level. LDSD-speci\u0000c gut microbiota was shown to exhibit alteration of BA metabolic function with a slightly reduced level of taurine/glycine conjugation (a lower cgh gene level) and a higher level of 7- dehydroxylation (overabundances of bai genes and bai-expressing Clostridium bacteria). Such microbiota BA metabolic change is partially similar to the Clostridia-rich microbiota previously described in an IBS-D cohort [16], excluding the change in the hdhA gene. The hdhA gene with the responsibility of 7-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7 coding Escherichia, pathobionts that have been reported to trigger GI dysfunction, in\u0000ammation and adenoma-carcinoma progression [34-36], were more enriched in the non-LDSD group. It is consistent with an increased levels of GUDCA and UDCA, derived from microbiota 7-HSDH action, shown in the fecal BA pro\u0000le of the non-LDSD pattern. Omics data indicate that gut microbiota BA metabolism should be varied among TCM patterns. A study with quantifying LDSD has revealed mental phenotypes closely linked with the liver stagnation factor and abdominal discomfort phenotypes highly related to the spleen de\u0000ciency factor [37]. The symptoms of stagnation of liver qi, de\u0000ciency of bile secretion, and intestinal malabsorption in the \u0000eld of psychological diseases [38]. Regulator genes involving in BA synthesis (Hnf4a and CYPs) showed elevated expressions in the liver tissue of LDSD rats [39]. Differential metabolic pathways, such as BA biosynthesis, were also shown to closely related to the liver cancer with LDSD in rats [40]. Hence, the enhanced host BA synthesis caused by problemed intestinal feedback control or fast GI transit shown in the LDSD pattern seems to be closely linked with the liver stagnation factor. Overabundances of Clostridiales or Clostridium spp. have been reported in the gut microbiota of subjects with spleen-de\u0000cient pattern and stress-induced spleen-de\u0000cient abundance of the Clostridium XlVa group [44]. Our data that the increase of Clostridium and its produced DCA was found toPage 11/21be positively correlated with the severity of stool frequency and abdominal pain suggest that alterations in the gut microbiota and its BA metabolism are more likely linked with the spleen de\u0000ciency factor. LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic phenotype, particularly the increase of Clostridium and its produced DCA, showed positive relationships with the severity of diarrhea and abdominal pain, suggesting a promotive role of gut microbiota BA dysmetabolism in IBS-D progression. Increased colonic BA exposure can induce stool volume and stool habits, particularly the dihydroxy-BAs, such as DCA and CDCA, stimulate water secretion and accelerates colonic transit, increases stool frequency and decreases stool consistency [45, 46]. The underlying mechanism is involved in the BA-driven high-amplitude colonic contractions and increased water also promote visceral hypersensitivity mast cell-to-nociceptor signaling that involves the farnesoid X receptor/nerve growth factor/transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 axis [47]. DCA, the potent agonist of BA receptor TGR5, could activate subsets of colonic sensory neurons and evoked colonic afferent, thus inducing pronounced visceral hypersensitivity, in a transient potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1)-dependent mechanism[48]. The BA metabolic phenotype, at least the part shaped by the gut microbiota, is an ideal path to understand the internal relationship between the LDSD pattern and IBS-D progression. Conclusion We reported a LDSD-speci\u0000c BA metabolic phenotype, characterizing enhanced synthesis and excretion levels for the host and altered BA-transforming genome levels for the gut microbiota. This study targeting the BA metabolism provides foundation toward understanding the biological nature of the LDSD pattern and the internal linkage between the LDSD pattern and IBS progression.
