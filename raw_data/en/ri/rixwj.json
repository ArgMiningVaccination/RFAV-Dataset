Sure, you can google yourself silly, but with so much contradictory\u2014and in some cases flat-out wrong\u2014information on the Web, how do you make sure the advice you collect is reliable? \"When patients ask me about Web resources, I'm always nervous because there's a lot of incorrect information out there, or it's industry sponsored,\" cautions Alice Domar, PhD, founder of the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health, which specializes in integrative medicine. And indeed, studies funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and others have found that information on health websites is often inaccurate or incomplete. The good news is that there is valuable information if you know where to look; even the professionals troll the Internet to learn about cutting-edge studies or unorthodox treatments. \"The Web is wonderful for finding news that's not so mainstream,\" says Christiane Northrup, MD, the ob-gyn who wrote Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. \"Alternative viewpoints can be just as useful in treating illness, only we don't hear about them as often.\" Northrup told us she recently used the Web to research the latest science on vitamin D and fish oil, which inspired us to reach out to other prominent health professionals for their picks for the best women's health websites.
