Although only in existence since 1977, the Department traces its lineage to the Manhattan Project effort to develop the atomic bomb during World War II and to the various energy-related programs that previously had been dispersed throughout various federal agencies. The mission of the Energy Department is to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. Grant Program Highlights [Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office](http://energy.gov/eere/wipo/about-weatherization-and-intergovernmental-programs-office) The Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office (WIPO) collaborates with state and local governments, Indian tribes, and overseas U.S. territories to leverage resources to achieve near-term and measurable reductions in overall energy use, improvements in energy efficiency, growth in renewable energy capacity, and expanded economic opportunities. WIPO provides funding only to state and local governments, overseas U.S. territories, and Indian tribes to support their clean energy programs. WIPO does not provide any funding or assistance of any kind to private companies or individuals. [State Energy Program](http://energy.gov/eere/wipo/state-energy-program) The State Energy Program (SEP) provides leadership to maximize the benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy in each state through communications and outreach activities and technology deployment, and by providing access to new partnerships and resources. Additionally, SEP helps states improve the security of their energy infrastructure by assisting them with the development of state energy plans. SEP provides financial and technical assistance to states through formula and competitive grants. States use their formula grants to develop state strategies and goals to address their energy priorities.
