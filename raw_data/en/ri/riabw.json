Innate Choice Omega Sufficiency (Lemon Flavour) Price: $45.00 Omega Sufficiency is the purest, most natural fish oil available with natural EPA:DHA ratios and NO Artificial Chemical Concentration. Because of this Omega Sufficiency is aligned with the human genetic requirements for Omega 3 consumption and thus provides the maximal health and prevention benefits. Omega Sufficiency is the world's premier EPA/DHA omega 3 fish oil. Each teaspoon or 4 capsules provides 720-825 mg of EPA and 480-550 mg of DHA omega 3 essential fatty acids which have been scientifically shown to be a crucial requirement for health and important in the prevention of illnesses such as heart disease, arthritis, ADD, depression, stroke, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, eczema, learning and cognitive development problems, and Alzheimer's. Omega Sufficiency is extracted in a licensed pharmaceutical grade facility from cold water anchovies, herring and sardines that are the purest source of omega 3 fish oil. Our oil is purified in a non-chemical molecular distillation process that removes all trace amounts of heavy metals, PCBs, organochlorides, and organophosphate pesticides resulting in the safest, purest source of EPA/DHA fish oil possible. As the oil is purified it is immediately infused with our natural, proprietary antioxidant blend consisting of rosemary extract, ascorbyl palmitate and natural mixed tocopherols. This process ensures the greatest oxidation protection possible. There simply is not a better, purer source of EPA/DHA omega 3 fatty acids in the world as our third party testing results indicate. Our extraction process keeps the fish oil in its most natural form possible, this is crucial because human beings are genetically designed to ingest, digest, and absorb EPA and DHA essential fatty acids in the form they are found in nature, not in any concentrated form produced by chemical processing. If science and experience has taught us anything it is that we cannot improve upon nature. Directions for Use Amount: 1/2 teaspoon or 2 capsules per 40 lbs/18 kgs of body weight Adults: (e.g. 160 lb adult 2 tsps or 8 lb tsps capsules/day) child tsp or 2 capsules/day: 80 lb child 1 tsp or 4 capsules/day) Liquid Oil must be refrigerated after opening.

Sisu Vitamin D (180 tablets) Price: $13.00 An important factor in the prevention of bone loss in men and women. Vitamin D is produced naturally when our skin is exposed to strong sunlight.

Other at-risk groups include seniors, people with darker skin, vegans and those on a low protein diet.

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body and it is an essential factor in maintaining strong bones and teeth.

Adeeva Prostate 40 Plus (60 capsules) Price: $35.00 Scientific evidence suggests that men need targeted nutrient support to preserve optimal prostate health after age 40. Here's Why: - At age 40 the prostate gland tends to speeds up the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) - High levels of DHT cause prostate cells to replicate rapidly causing prostate enlargement and increasing the risk of other prostate diseases - In fact, from age 40 to 80, ninety percent of men eventually develop enlarged prostate symptoms and one in eight men in North America develop more serious prostate problems - Symptoms of an enlarged prostate include, decreased urine stream, urgency to urinate, but difficulty in initiating a urine stream, frequent urination, and frequent night-time urination. Are there natural agents that can protect the prostate? Yes, clinical studies show that a number of natural agents can block the build up of DHT, and thereby slow the rate of prostate cell division. The optimal dosages and standardized grades of these natural agents are contained within Prostate 40 Plus, which can help prevent the build up of DHT and have been shown to reverse prostate enlargement in men with diagnosed mild to moderate enlargement problems (BPH), and protect the prostate in other ways.
