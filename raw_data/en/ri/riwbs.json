Forbioengineering, the influx of ideasfrom the physical sciences andengineering into biology is building aflourishing research culture. Formaterials, innovative research todesign higher performance materialswith extraordinary properties is beingdriven by their role in a widespectrum of applications. If you would like to hear more about the research activities andcollaborations that are definingbioengineering and materialsresearch at Cambridge, join us for the showcase Horizon Seminars on 1 October and 9 December (see page35 for details). The two scientists featured on our front cover are engaged in researchthat spans both bioengineering andmaterials research. Drs Serena Bestand Ruth Cameron lead theCambridge Centre for MedicalMaterials in the Department ofMaterials Science and Metallurgy.They and their colleagues areaccomplishing a cross-over betweenphysical and life sciences that isproving vital to the bioengineering ofimproved materials for medicine. In a fascinating line-up of other articles, we hear about virtual violinsand medical imaging, endangeredlanguages and illicit networks, andwhat lies beyond the 'terrible twos' .We also take the opportunity to lookin detail at two highly successfulmodels of industrial-academicpartnership: the Centre for AdvancedPhotonics and Electronics (CAPE) andthe long-established relationshipbetween Rolls-Royce and theUniversity of Cambridge.

All rights reserved.DR JIM HASELOFFDR JON HERAS, EQUINOX GRAPHICS (WWW.E-NOX.NET)Issue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 3RESEARCH NEWS Construction of a new building to house the MRC LMB is scheduled tobegin later in 2008 and is expected totake three years. Scientists working atthe LMB are world-renowned for theirrevolutionary discoveries in exploringbiological processes at a molecularlevel, and the Laboratory has yielded atotal of 13 Nobel prizes since itsbeginnings in 1947. 'The Laboratory of Molecular Biology has an outstanding track recordas an innovator in medical research,'said Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, the MRCChief Executive. 'The new building willallow the MRC to build on the LMB'sposition as a globally competitiveresearch centre and continue to attract the best researchers .' The Government has announced funding of \u00a367 million from theDepartment for Innovation, Universitiesand Skills towards the cost of theflagship building. The University willcontribute up to \u00a310 million, whichincludes \u00a37.5 million to lease space for40 research workers and a substantialcommitment from the WolfsonFoundation to cover equipping theUniversity space. Capital generated as aresult of the commercialisation ofdiscoveries made at the LMB willcontribute to the rest of the cost,funded by the MRC.The new LMB building will provide 'state-of-the-art facilities for making thediscoveries of the 21st century,' said DrHugh Pelham, Director of the LMB. It willbe sited on the Cambridge BiomedicalCampus, which supports research-ledclinical care by bringing together theCambridge University Hospitals NHSFoundation Trust, the Univ ersity of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicineand the MRC, as well as medical researchcharities including Cancer Research UKand the Wellcome Trust. For more information, please contact the MRC Press Office(press.office@headoffice.mrc.ac.uk).Laboratory of the future A new \u00a3197 million Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) is to be built on the expanding Cambridge Biomedical Campus. The Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh are to share a \u00a316 millionendowment funded by HRH PrinceAlwaleed bin Abdulaziz Alsaud,Chairman of the charitable andphilanthropic organisation The KingdomFoundation. The agreement wasformalised at a ceremony inBuckingham Palace in May attended byPrince Alwaleed and HRH The Duke ofEdinburgh, who is Chancellor of bothuniversities. The new Centre, known as the HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Centre ofIslamic Studies, will be based in theFaculty of Asian and Middle EasternStudies. Professor Yasir Suleiman, wholed the successful bid, said: 'Byconducting research of the highestquality, combined with outreach to the public arena, we intend to foster adeeper understanding between Islamand the West.' Professor Suleiman alsoretains strong research ties with theUniversity of Edinburgh, from where hemoved to Cambridge in 2007. The two main programmes of research at the Centre will initiallyconsider Muslim identities in the UK andEurope, looking at notions of citizenship,ethnicity and religious values, and willexplore how Islam and Muslims arerepresented in the British and Europeanmedia. 'These are new areas of researchfor Cambridge and yet they build on abed-rock of expertise and scholarship in Islamic Studies,' said ProfessorSuleiman.'This new Centre at Cambridge will quickly establish itself as a major forcefor research, teaching and publicunderstanding,' commented the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Alison Richard.'By providing a clear, central focus forstudying Islam in the contemporaryworld, as well as engagement with thewider community outside the University,it will harness the richness and variety ofCambridge's contributions to researchand teaching on Islam to make thewhole far greater than the current sumof our parts.' For more information, please contact Professor Yasir Suleiman(ys310@cam.ac.uk).Design of the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL New Centre of Islamic Studies A research centre opening in October 2008 aims to enhance understanding, tolerance and cross-cultural dialogue between Islam and the West.A recent study by Professor Diane Reay from the Faculty of Education andProfessor Gill Crozier from the Universityof Sunderland has reached itsconclusion after two years exploringworking-class students' experiences ofhigher education. Funded by theHigher Education Funding Council forEngland (HEFCE) through the Economicand Social Research Council (ESRC), thestudy forms part of a wider \u00a330 millionTeaching and Learning ResearchProgramme. 'Students from working-class backgrounds bring a complex set ofsocial, cultural and learner issues touniversity and in turn are met with anarray of new circumstances andexpectations,' said Professor Reay. Theaim of this study was to examine theseissues in the context of four differenthigher education institutions: an 'elite'university, a traditional 'red-brick'institution, a post-1992 university(formerly designated a polytechnic),and a further education college. The research demonstrated the resilience and commitment thatworking-class students employ in order to 'get in and stay in' . However, it alsoshowed that the experiences ofstudents attending the four institutionswere structurally unequal, with the levelof their participation depending oncompeting demands above the generalrequirements of their course (such asneeding to take paid employment tosupport themselves or their families).How the institutions supported andresponded to these issues determinedwhether the students' disposition tolearning was enhanced or undermined. 'Our findings present insights into the need for higher educationinstitutions to be mindful of thediversity of needs amongst the studentbody,' said Professor Reay. 'Taking thesefactors into consideration shouldaddress inequalities of provision andsupport that currently impact on theirdiverse student intakes, and enable allstudents to be effective learners.'

Weaving a web of world history For five researchers embarking on the project 'Civilizations in Contact' , finding the links betweeneach of their specialist fields will provide unique insight into pre-modern world history. Five scholars have received \u00a31.2 million funding to undertake research thatcollectively spans five millennia ofcivilisation. For thousands of years, themovement of ideas, people, trade andreligion has linked empires andconnected civilisations. Evidence ofthese communication routes, the majorsites where commercial and culturalexchanges took place and the historicalbackground against which thesecontacts occurred offers a view ofworld history that transcendsgeographical boundaries. 'Under the aegis of the Civilizations in Contact project, not only will fivescholars each be authoring excellentstand-alone research but also, bytracing the points of contact betweenthem, they will have the opportunity tocreate something even greater,'explained Professor Geoffrey Khan, theproject's Principal Investigator, from theFaculty of Asian and Middle EasternStudies. The researchers, Sally Church, Robert Harding, Paul Lunde, JaneMcIntosh and Caroline Stone, will eachstudy a period of Afro-Eurasian history. Their research will include trade acrossthe Iranian plateau and through theGulf; the movement of pilgrims andmerchants across the Indian Ocean; theroutes taken by diplomatic missions toand from pre-modern China; and thedevelopment and administration ofemporia in Southeast Asia and Japan.'Just one example of civilisations incontact is the pilgrimage of hundredsof Chinese monks across the Silk Roadinto India in the first millennium ADand the important effect this had onthe development of Buddhism whenthey returned to China,' explained Dr Harding. The project, with offices at Wolfson College, has been funded by theGolden Web Foundation, a charitablefoundation with international fundingbased in Cambridge. Paul Keeler,Director of the Foundation,commented: 'We are delighted tosupport this project, the fruits of whichwill be available through our innovativeGolden Web system when it launchesin 2011.''Our aim is to research exchanges across cultural and political boundaries,and to study the evolution of societiesand economies in the light of theseexchanges,' said Dr Church. 'The historyof civilisations in contact reminds ustime and again that globalisation is nota new phenomenon, but has a longand significant history, which wheninvestigated can provide freshperspectives on the world today.'

Front row, from left: Caroline Stone, Sally Church, Jane McIntosh; back row, fromleft: Robert Harding, Paul the 'Academic tap into thehighest quality thinking in academia tooptimise the early clinical developmentof new GSK medicines in a model ofshared risk and reward. The newagreement provides a framework for ateam of academic experts led byProfessors Ed Bullmore, Barry Everitt,Trevor Robbins, Paul Fletcher andStephen O'Rahilly, theDepartments Psychiatry andExperimental Psychology and theInstitute of Metabolic Science, todevelop a novel centrally acting agentwith therapeutic potential for obesityand addictive disorders. 'Sometimes drug development needs to cut across traditionalboundaries, and the development ofdrugs that act on the brain to deliver health benefits in terms of reduced bodyweight is a good example,' said ProfessorBullmore. 'The University has establishedexpertise in both neuroscience andmetabolic science and, importantly,there is already a strong track record ofinterdisciplinary research between thesegroups. This was particularly attractive toGSK as a scientific environment tosupport the innovative development ofcentrally acting anti-obesity drugs.' Although Cambridge is the first academic institution to pioneer theincubator model of working with GSK, itis not expected to be the only one if themodel proves successful here. Cliniciansand scientists at carefully selectedacademic institutions worldwide will beexpected to challenge industry normsand set a unique path for preclinical and early clinical development activities thatwill deliver on the promise of an asset atthe earliest stage. Importantly, theagreement also allows the academicscientists freedom to publish resultsarising from their work on incubatorprojects. 'This puts academia-industry relationships on a new footing andallows academics who are leaders intheir fields the opportunity to becomedirectly involved in developingmedicines for patients and to have thefreedom to take the programme inexciting new directions,' said PatrickVallance, Senior Vice President, DrugDiscovery at GSK. In support of all itsincubator projects, GSK will provideoperational support, access to in-houseclinical research and imaging facilities,and background preclinical data on thedrug. For incubator projects based inCambridge, an important component ofGSK's support for the academic teamswill be provided by the facilities and staffof GSK's Clinical Unit Cambridge. TheUnit is embedded in the CambridgeBiomedical Campus in close physicalproximity to departments of the Schoolof Clinical Medicine and the WellcomeTrust Clinical Research Facility. Patrick Sissons, Regius Professor of Physic and Head of the School of ClinicalMedicine in Cambridge, said: 'We placegreat value on our relationship with GSKand are delighted to be working withthem in this innovative new partnershipbetween leading clinical scientists in theUniversity and industry.'

Issue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 5RESEARCH NEWS 'Academic Incubator' to develop new medicines of value GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has signed its first agreement with theUniversity to optimise the early clinical development of newGSK medicines for obesity and addictive disorders. A new initiative launches toshowcase the University'sstrength and depth inimmunology research. Cambridge has a long tradition ofworld-leading research intoimmunology - the study of how theimmune system functions in bothhealth and conditions such as diabetes,cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, AIDS andother infectious diseases. Now a newinitiative hopes to bring together the numerous groups working in this fieldto capitalise on current strengths, andto help those outside Cambridge toeasily navigate their way around thisdiverse and exciting area of research. 'Cambridge Immunology will help support immunology researchersacross Cambridge, creating a real senseof community, and building newinteractions and collaborations,' saidProfessor Ken Smith, GenzymeProfessor of Experimental Medicineand Chair of the CambridgeImmunology steering committee. 'Itwill also raise visibility of the breadth and depth of Cambridge's expertise inthis field to the wider world, includingpotential students, job applicants andfunders.' Cambridge Immunology will be formally launched at the 'Visions ofImmunology' conference inCambridge on 25 September 2008.To register as part of the CambridgeImmunology community, please visit the websitewww.immunology.cam.ac.uk, whichwill be launched in late September. \u00a9ISTOCKPHOTO.COM/CHRISTINE BALDERAS6| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008RESEARCH NEWS Cheap labour has been an incentive for manufacturers to outsource theirproduction abroad, but there are manyuncertainties and risks involved inhaving a distance between the hostlocation and the outsourcer. Theseuncertainties and risks can lead tounexpected costs - for example, risingoil prices affect shipping costs - whichcan offset any gains made from cheaplabour or, in some cases, result in lossesto the outsourcer. A recent study by DrsKen Platts and Ninghua Song of theCentre for Strategy and Performance inthe Institute for Manufacturing hasinvestigated the real costs involved insourcing from China. To arrive at a complete picture of all the potential costs, they developed atotal-cost model covering 15 items ofset-up cost and 36 items of ongoingcost. The model was then applied,using in-depth case studies, to nineproducts sourced from China. They found that the quoted price, onaverage, accounted for only 65% of thetotal cost incurred, but there was highvariability from product to product. Inthe worst case they investigated, thetotal cost was almost four times thequoted price. The case-study research was followed by a survey into companies'perceptions of China sourcing costs.This, taken with the case studies,suggested that companies tended tounderestimate the non-price costs ofsourcing from China by about 30%,often underestimating costs for extrawarehousing to cope with variabledemand, and inspection to cope withvariable quality. The cost data were collected during 2006/7, before the recent oil priceexplosion, so we might expect that, astransportation costs increase, the ratioof total cost to quoted price will also increase. For more information, please contact Dr Ken Platts (kwp@eng.cam.ac.uk)or Dr Ninghua Song(ns359@cam.ac.uk). What are the real costs of outsourcing abroad? Many UK manufacturers have transferred their production tolow-cost regions to reduce costs. But a new study has discoveredthat these savings are not as substantial as they first seemed. Cambridge University Library hasreceived an outstanding collection ofbooks relating to Michel de Montaigne(1533-1592), author of the celebratedEssais, who famously declared 'I am myself the matter of my book.' The Montaigne Library was assembled by the Montaigne scholarand Gilbert de Botton(1935-2000). Gilbert de Botton's remarkablecollection was the desire to recreateMontaigne's library - by buying eitherMontaigne's personal copies or othercopies of works known to havebelonged to him. He was able topurchase 10 of Montaigne's ownbooks.' Among the books is Montaigne's copy of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (1563), an important influence on hislife's work. It is covered withMontaigne's annotations, allowingscholars to trace in detail how he readand used his source. There is also a fine set of editions of Montaigne's works,including copies owned by Ben Jonsonand Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and animpressive collection of secondaryworks, which means that Cambridge isnow a major centre for Montaignestudies. Philip Ford, Professor of French and Neo-Latin Literature at Cambridge,said, 'Thanks to Gilbert de Botton'spassionate interest in Montaigne,future generations of Montaignescholars will be able to share in hisinterest by consulting this magnificentcollection in its new home inCambridge University Library.'A monograph by Professor Ford,published by the University Library,gives further information on the scopeand content of the collection. The acquisition is marked by a conference of the French Department'sCambridge French Colloquia inSeptember 2008, devoted to the'Librairie de Montaigne' , and an exhibition of items from the collection,'My booke and my selfe': Michel de Montaigne 1533-1592 , which runs until 23 December 2008 at CambridgeUniversity Library.

Portrait of Montaigne by Pierre-Michel Alix (1792)INSTITUTE FOR MANUFACTURING REPRODUCED BY PERMISSION OF THE SYNDICS OF CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY LIBRARYIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 7RESEARCH NEWS Scholars from The Fitzwilliam Museum and Faculty of Classics have won amajor Arts and Humanities ResearchCouncil (AHRC) grant to undertakeresearch that will underpin the re-display of the Museum's Greek andRoman collections. The three-yearproject grant funds a full-time researchassistant and aims to bring university-based research in classical art andarchaeology into conversation withmuseum-based display practices. Traditional museum displays of Greek and Roman material tend toprivilege either a chronological or athematic approach. The former offers astylistic history of Greek and Roman artthat plays down the original contextand nature of the objects, while thelatter presents these objects as thoughtransparent evidence for 'daily life' . Bothleave out of the picture the role ofcollectors in shaping museumcollections. Recent research has exposed the inadequacy of seeing the history of artpurely in terms of stylistic progression,and has improved our understanding ofthe importance of changingtechnology, the complexities ofworkshop practices, and the role of ancient markets in influencingproduction. The Fitzwilliam re-displayoffers an opportunity to re-assess thecollections both in the light of theseadvances and as collections. 'The project will put people back into the history of art and provide animportant opportunity to integrate TheFitzwilliam's collections into the studyof classics in Cambridge,' explained Dr Lucilla Burn, Keeper of Antiquitiesand Principal Investigator. 'It will alsoprovide the Faculty with both theopportunity to engage with actualobjects and a broader public forum inwhich to share and transfer theirknowledge and expertise,' addedProfessor Robin Osborne who, with Dr Caroline Vout and Professor MaryBeard, represents the Faculty of Classicscomponent of the project. The research will be disseminated to the public in an online public-accesscatalogue and new web pages for'virtual' visitors. Talks, workshops andfamily activities drawing on theresearch will also be an important partof the Museum's education provisionfor children and adults.For more information, please contact The Fitzwilliam Museum(www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk). Re-interpreting Greece and Rome at The Fitzwilliam Recent funding will enable collaboration between classicists and museum curators, and shape a major re-display of Greek and Roman art and archaeology.

Systems biology also describes a multi-component approach, combiningtheoretical modelling with real data aboutthe interaction between genes and theirproducts. Arising from this is the need tointerpret large datasets of complexbiological information. The recentlylaunched Cambridge Systems BiologyCentre is enabling research groups fromdifferent disciplines to interact closely anddevelop a long-lasting multidisciplinaryresearch environment. This Horizon Seminar will showcase the fast-moving landscape of researchactivities and collaborations in Cambridge.Speakers' presentations will illustrate thediversity of challenges that are being addressed and the novel ideas that areresulting from the integration of skills thatcharacterises emerging bioengineering. 8| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008BIOENGINEERING The University of Cambridge has become increasingly aware of themajor importance of recent advancesat the interface between the lifesciences, physical sciences andengineering. A key challenge is toassist the evolution of the establishedreductionist 'molecular' view ofbiology into a more quantitative,data-rich and predictive science, withan holistic and integrativeunderstanding of its principles. Research activities are crossing disciplines in efforts to addresscomplex biological systems andprovide technical solutions to currentand emerging global concerns.Researchers are using new tools inpredictive biology and syntheticbiology for bio-product design -seeking to go beyond the analysis ofenzymes, metabolic networks andcells to consider functionality anddelivery as intimately linked elementsof the design process. Developmentsin Cambridge are breaking newground in biomechanics, tissueengineering and biomimetics: fromstrategies for restoring function thedamaged nervous system, to next-generation medical implants thatinteract therapeutically with the body,to the development of mechanicallyrobust bone-like materials forengineering purposes. The need to integrate expertise in multidisciplinary researchenvironments is well recognised inCambridge, and 2008 sees the launchof two new research complexes. TheCentre for the Physics of Medicine at Professor Nigel SlaterSingle component biology is past; bioengineering has begun The Horizon Seminar'Bioengineering' takes place on 1 October 2008. Here, ProfessorNigel Slater, from the Departmentof Chemical Engineering,describes how the influx of ideasand principles from non-biological disciplines is shaping anew biology.

It isgenerally accepted that understandingsuch complex genetic systems requiresmore than a description of itscomponent parts; knowledge of thedynamic interactions within a system isalso essential. The emerging field ofsynthetic biology aims to employprinciples of standardisation anddecoupling, well known in engineering,to construct complex biological circuitsthat behave just like living systems. Scaling up from microbes Synthetic biology uses well-characterised and reusable geneticcomponents in combination withnumerical models for the design ofbiological circuits. For microbes, thisapproach is providing a powerfulconceptual and practical framework forthe systematic engineering of geneexpression and behaviour. Can the same be achieved for multicellular systems, with their greaterdiversity of cell types and biochemicalspecialisation? Of all multicellularsystems, plants are the obvious firsttarget for this type of approach. Plantspossess indeterminate and modularbody plans, have a wide spectrum ofbiosynthetic activities and can begenetically manipulated. Assemblingnew feedback-regulated genetic circuitscould modify plant form andbiosynthetic activities, with the ultimateprospect of using them in crop systemsfor the production of biomass, food,polymers, drugs and fuels.Engineering plant systems A systematic approach to engineeringplants requires a suitable control circuitto be established by combininginterchangeable DNA parts, devices andsystems. Not only must robust geneexpression be achieved at anappropriate level, time and place duringthe plant's lifecycle, but the circuit mustalso trigger the expression of suitablegenetic markers that alter thecharacteristics of the organism. In the Department of Plant Sciences, a unique library of genetic circuits andinterchangeable parts (PhytoBricks) isbeing created for the biologicalengineering of plant systems. A softwareenvironment has also been constructedto model the properties of themulticellular system, describing both thephysical interactions between cells andthe cells' genetic properties. This allowsthe design and testing of newmorphogenetic programs in silico , before creating the plant systemsthemselves. The future The growing application of engineeringprinciples to biological design andconstruction marks a practical transition for biological research. As part of thisshift, synthetic biology is beginning tooffer improved rational design andreprogramming of biological systems. Itholds great promise for the futureimprovements in microbial, plant andanimal cell engineering that are clearlyneeded for the renewable technologiesof the 21st century.

An annual, worldwide, open design challenge for students - to design and testa simple biological system from standard, interchangeable parts and tooperate it in living cells - is held by the Biological Engineering Division ofMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Computer Science and ArtificialIntelligence Laboratory. This competition, known as the InternationalGenetically Engineered Machine (IGEM; www.igem.org), has played a specialrole in the development of synthetic biology as a field in Cambridge, acting asa nucleus for a growing network of researchers tocollaborate; scientists from eight departments andthree nearby institutes now work together throughthe Cambridge iGEM project. In 2007, theCambridge team received Gold Awards and a prizefor the best BioBrick (see www.synbio.org.uk).

CCMM isdeveloping materials to replace tailored load-bearing support and yet are porous toallow regeneration of new bone. Inparticular, methods are being investigatedto encourage the patient's bone to bondto orthopaedic implants, which wouldimprove implant lifetime andperformance. The group is also creating guides for nerve regeneration in damaged limbs, toattract and selectively steer neurons in aspecific direction and to repel cells thatcause scar tissue formation. Artificialmammary gland structures are being builtas models for screening new drugs. Andfurther lines of research include thedelivery of active agents to the body, bothin combination with devices and aspharmaceutical delivery systems in theirown right. Working at the edge ofdisciplines Established six years ago, the group isstrongly interdisciplinary and has dozensof collaborations with departments withinthe University, across the UK and withresearch bases around the world. Thismeans that new research builds on a widenetwork of expertise, interlocking theknowledge of material scientists,physicists, chemists and engineers withthat of cell biologists, biochemists,pharmacists, pathologists, surgeons, dentists and vets. There is also a high level of collaboration with the medical devicesindustry - a must if the new materialsdeveloped are to reach the clinic. This hasincluded the creation of spin-outcompanies; the most recent isOrthomimetics, an award-winningcompany and the first spin-out from theCambridge-MIT Institute, which isdeveloping products for regenerativerepair (see page 34 this issue). With theright combination of expertise, it's clearthat there is huge potential to engineerimproved active materials for the nextgeneration of medical implants. 10| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008BIOENGINEERING It's easy to take the complex and specialised materials that make up ourbodies for granted, until somethinggoes wrong. However, replacementtissue is something that most of us willneed at some point in our lives. Itmight take the form of a permanentimplant like a replaced hip or knee or itcould be a structure designed to beabsorbed as the body heals. Membersof the Cambridge Centre for MedicalMaterials (CCMM), a research groupheaded by Drs Ruth Cameron andSerena Best, are tackling the manyquestions that surround the designand engineering of effective medicalmaterials. Medical materials The first requirement of a material forimplantation is that it is non-toxic.Materials that are biocompatible in thissense can be used successfully,particularly if their mechanicalproperties match as closely as possiblethose of the original tissue. However,rather than using an inert structure,what if the material could interact in apositive way with the biologicalsystem around it? This couldencourage a stronger integration ofsurrounding tissue with the implant, oreven stimulate the regrowth of newspecific tissue to entirely replace theimplant over time. It is these noveltypes of medical materials that CCMMresearch projects aim to deliver.

Launchedin 2002, the Initiative brings togetherstem cell scientists, bioengineers andmedical researchers to achieve 'translation'of basic discoveries to therapeuticapplications. The University of Cambridgehas invested over \u00a330 million refurbishingand equipping two buildings for stem cellresearch: its first phase, the WellcomeTrust Centre for Stem Cell Research, waslaunched in December 2006 and islocated in the heart of the University'sBiological Sciences campus in centralCambridge. The Initiative is now enteringits second phase with the launch of theLaboratory for Regenerative Medicine(LRM) on the Addenbrooke's HospitalCambridge Biomedical Campus. Regenerative medicine Cambridge's stem cell researchers havebeen focusing mainly on understandingthe properties of stem cells in 'modelsystems' that can be studied in the Petri dish. These provide a vital source offundamental knowledge that willunderpin future clinical initiatives. Withthe opening of the LRM in September2008, this basic knowledge platform isextending into areas needed forsuccessful human tissue engineering,enhancing the University's capacity todeliver novel clinical treatments throughstem cell research. Substantial funds havealso been contributed to refurbishing andequipping the LRM building by the RoyalSociety (together with the WolfsonFoundation), the British Heart Foundation(BHF), the Medical Research Council (MRC)and the Isaac Newton Trust. Engineering for health Our bodies are constantly changing -they renew and remodel themselves,even daily in some tissues such asintestine, skin, blood and bone.'Embryonic stem cells' are developmentallypowerful because they can form all of thebody's approximately 200 different tissues.The regulatory interaction between stemcells and their local environment (knownas their 'niche') works somewhat like apoint-of-sale inventory system thatarranges for new items to bemanufactured as pre-existing items aresold or used. Future versions of tissuesengineered for clinical applications willideally share this self-renewing propertyof stem cells, possibly by incorporatingstem cells in their manufacture. This requires a leap in our knowledge about stem cells and their morespecialised descendants. It will beparticularly important to learn how stemThe Cambridge Stem Cell Initiative enters its secondphase with the launch of theLaboratory for RegenerativeMedicine.Engineering stem cellsand tissues for betterhealth cells of various types maintain their unique quality of self-renewal, howthey regulate production of the morespecialised cells that make up mostof any tissue or organ, and how theyinteract with their niche. With itsfocus on human stem cell medicine,the LRM will contribute to thisknowledge, thereby providing aplatform for numerous clinicalapplications. These will include notonly cellular transplants, but also cellsfor drug testing and for the discoveryof medicines that improve thefunction of our body's own stemcells. The LRM will be named in memory of Cambridge researcher DameAnne McLaren, whose vision forturning stem cell research intoregenerative medicine inspired theCambridge Stem Cell Initiative.

Professor Roger PedersenA colony of human embryonic stem cells formed from a mixture of cells expressing red or green fluorescent proteinsDR ISABELLE BOUHONBuilding blocks of natural materials Collagen is ubiquitous; this triple-helical protein makes up a quarter of all proteinsin the body. It self-assembles from themolecular scale up to large fibre-likestructures, creating a hierarchical materialwith remarkable physical properties.Collagen combines with other ECMcomponents - mainly water, non-collagenous proteins and sugars - and,in mineralised tissues, with bioceramicsanalogous to earth minerals. These non-living, but cell-derived, materialscombine with cells to form living yetmechanically robust tissues. Collagen takes on different roles in different parts of the body. In structuraltissues, like bones and ligaments, it'sfound in rope-like fibres that provideresistance to stretching and tearingforces. In cartilage, which is mostlyloaded in compression, collagen hasmore of a 'holding' function, with thefibres arranged rather like a basket,retaining other hydrated proteins andsugars. In the lens of the eye, collagen iscrystalline, organised precisely for opticaltransparency. In fact, there are over 20different types of collagen in the body,and it is not even known precisely what functions they all fulfil. Mechanics in medicine The study of the biomechanicalproperties of collagen and ECM is aparticularly exciting and fast-growingfield in reproductive medicine. Oneaspect of Dr Oyen's research has been toexamine the physical properties of theECM in the amniotic sac, the membranethat ruptures (the 'breaking of waters'),signalling imminent birth. Rupture occurring before full-term gestation results in approximately a thirdof all premature births. Following thefirst-ever set of rigorous bioengineeringstudies on placental membranes, Dr Oyen and clinical colleagues at theUniversity of Minnesota concluded thatthe phenomenon is due to localiseddamage, not widespread overallmembrane deterioration, and thatdiagnostic techniques may be developedto detect localised thinning and ECMdamage for intervention into prematurebirth. This project is taking a new direction since Dr Oyen's arrival in Cambridge. Byteaming up with researchers at the 12| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008BIOENGINEERING Mention the word 'biology' and most people think immediately about cells.However, large portions of thehuman body are non-cellular and aremade instead from an extracellularmatrix (ECM) that provides much ofthe structural support around cells.This supportive function of the ECMis especially evident in theconnective tissues of the body. Manyload-bearing structures such asbones, teeth and ligaments areconnective tissues and these havebeen the focus of recentbioengineering research inCambridge. Dr Michelle Oyen, Lecturer in the new Engineering for Life Sciencesprogramme in the Department ofEngineering, is studying themechanical functions of connectivetissues. Her research ranges fromfundamental science andengineering projects through tocollaborative projects with cliniciansfor developing mechanics-basedtools for use in medical practice. Theunifying theme of this research lieswith the primary component ofmany connective tissues: in theworld ofengineering.Collagen mechanics:learningfromnature Collagen - one of the materials that is inspiring new directions in engineeringIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 13BIOENGINEERING newly opened Centre for Trophoblast Research (www.trophoblast.cam.ac.uk),she will be able to examine placentaldevelopment from an engineering andmechanics perspective. Mimicking nature Nature clearly creates dynamic,mechanically functional tissues that aredifferent from anything engineers havemade. As an example, cartilage, whichforms the gliding surface that permitsjoint movement, is approximately 75%water and only 25% collagen, sugar andother proteins, and yet its stiffness andshock-absorbing capability make itcomparable to solid rubber. Moreover,the cartilage-on-cartilage slidinginterface has lower friction than icesliding on ice. In fact, when engineers design materials, uniformity and simplicity areoften prized. Engineering materials donot always feature the multi-levelhierarchical organisations found inprotein-based materials, nor do theyexemplify the dramatic spatial non-uniformity that has been found tostrengthen natural materials. So, bylearning from nature, novel engineeringsystems might be developed that utilisethe principles found in natural materials - a field of technology that has beentermed biomimetics. In some instances, biomimetics takes the form of direct imitation, as in thecase of a nanocomposite of mineral andproteins similar to natural bone. For casesof major bone defects, such as occursthrough trauma or cancer, a bone-likematerial that is biocompatible can beseeded with cells to form a 'tissue-engineered' construct and implantedwithin the body. However, if youconsider just how lightweight, yet stiff,strong and tough, a bone-like material is,why not use it for other structuralapplications such as architecture? This isa challenge that Dr Oyen is investigating. To do this, you need to go back to first principles - how the material forms.With funding from the Royal Society, DrOyen is examining biomineralisation andthe formation of mechanically robustbone-like materials. The work differs fromtissue-engineering approaches in thatthere is no cellular component and theend applications are viewed as beingremote from medicine. Although a largenumber of groups have considered thesynthesis of biomimetic materials, farfewer have taken a primary angleassociated with the measurement of mechanical properties. Dr Oyenviews the materials as successfulwhen they replicate both bonecomposition and mechanicalbehaviour. Inspirational materials It is also possible to abstract ideasfrom nature without directlyimitating the materials themselves.As examples, key concepts thatcould guide the formation of 'bone-inspired' materials include:composite materials with a verylarge stiffness mismatch betweenthe phases; materials that form fromroom-temperature deposition of aceramic onto a self-assembledpolymer; materials with up to sevendifferent levels of hierarchicalorganisation; and materials that areself-healing. Each of these conceptscould be applied to a system that isnot protein based, and ongoingresearch both at Cambridge andacross the world is incorporatingthese types of principles for materialsdevelopment. Compared with many branches of engineering, biomimeticengineering is comparatively new. Inthis rapidly expanding field, thelessons learnt from the physical andmechanical properties of naturalmaterials such as collagen and boneoffer great promise within anengineering framework. Not only isthis sure to make a difference to21st-century healthcare, but thereare also ways in which engineeringwill itself benefit from theabstraction of ideas from nature.

Given the near-ubiquitous importance of materials, it's no surprisethat materials research is diverse andgrowing in its range and capabilities.This research drives innovation, wherebetter materials enable technologicaladvances, which in turn demand moreof material properties. AcrossCambridge, researchers are concernedwith improving the performance,durability and efficiency of existingmaterials, and with finding newgenerations of materials withextraordinary properties. The science of materials has a vital role to play in today's priority researchareas and worldwide 'grand challenges'such as energy, sustainability, theinformation revolution and health. It is afield in which the University has longplayed a key part and continues to produce research leaders of world rank. Cambridge has also been particularly active in generating spin-out companiesto apply these new materials, such as:energy-efficient methods of metalextraction (Metalysis), flexible polymersfor displays and also extensiveengagement with industry on otherlevels: several company-supportedlaboratories are embedded within theUniversity, working on materials relevantfor topics such as aeroengines,electronics and pharmaceutical delivery. The materials field is intrinsically cross-disciplinary, with bridges tochemistry, engineering, physics andearth sciences, and increasingly also tobiology and medicine. This HorizonSeminar will provide a window onCambridge's contributions to materials science by bringing together individualsengaged in relevant research fromacross the University, providing a timelyopportunity to experience some of theenergy and innovation in Cambridge'sbroad-based materials research.

As opticalmaterials, however, they are inerttransparent jelly. But can this assembly beadapted to build the optical devices ofthe future? Our knowledge of how suchstructures can self-assemble on thenanometre scale - on the order of abillionth of a metre in size - is expandingat the same time that we are discoveringthe extraordinarily rich possibilities ofmaking new nanomaterials that haveunusual optical properties. The intricate arrangement of metals, glasses and active light emitters in three-dimensional architectures controls howphotons of light interact with them;nanophotonics is the study of howphotons behave with materials at thenanometre scale. The recent explosion ofinterest in this discipline heralds entirelynew ways of manipulating light forapplications ranging from healthcare toenergy production. Co-opting theprocesses honed in the natural world formaking tuneable optical materials is oneof the aims of Cambridge'sNanoPhotonics Centre, funded by theEngineering and Physical SciencesResearch Council (EPSRC) and opened in April 2008. Photonic crystals and artificial opals The trick in nanophotonics is to internally 'chop up' materials on the size scale of thewavelength of light, which is several hundred nanometres for visible light.Light can become schizophrenic in suchenvironments, flipping from oneconstituent into the other depending onits exact colour. So-called 'photoniccrystals' have allowed researchers at theCentre to make super-prisms thatseparate the colours of light thousands oftimes more widely than glass, enablingnew generations of optical chips forbiosensing. Recently, new ways have been found to squeeze together regular plasticnanoparticles in ways that assemble theminto regular photonic crystal stacks on thenanoscale - the resulting sheets areartificial opals with intense iridescent'structural colour' coming purely fromtheir internal structure. Such materialsmight be used to replace toxic dyes andoften exhibit unusual properties: forinstance, it is possible to photonicthreads that change colour dramaticallywhen stretched. Towards meta-materials Coinage metals such as gold or silver arealso unusual optical environments as theycan trap light, which surfs along theirsurface. Light in this form is compressedso that the critical dimensions fornanostructuring drops to tens ofnanometres. Such structures can act asaerials for light, greatly enhancingabsorption and emission by singlemolecules or nanoparticles.

The NanoPhotonics Centre Turning this combined vision ofadvanced physics and novelnanomaterials into practice at thepurpose-built healthcareprofessionals Cambridge arebecoming fruitful and widespread,and are yielding unexpected andexciting research directions. Just asimportant are the Centre'sinteractions with industrial partners(including Kodak, Renishaw andMerck) who are interested in thisrapidly expanding research area. Notonly does this encourage research tofocus on the practicality ofmanufacturing nanomaterials on thelarge scale, but it also effectivelybrings NanoPhotonics out of the laband into our hands. Sensing molecules by light using a substrate of nanoscale gold voidsMATERIALSFuelled by rapidly developing electronics and telecommunicationsindustries, the global demand forhigh-performance materials isinsatiable. In the UK alone, annualturnover associated with the design,manufacture and processing ofmaterials exceeds \u00a3200 billion -income that relies on devising smaller,faster, stronger, cheaper andincreasingly eco-friendly technologies.The challenge faced by the scientificcommunity is that of meeting thisdemand by identifying new materialswith ever more extreme capabilities. Dr Andrew Goodwin, a Trinity College Research Fellow in theDepartment of Earth Sciences, hasbeen tackling this problem bydesigning materials with ultra-flexibleatomic-scale structures. Just as acollapsible toy sphere has entirelydifferent properties from those of theplastic from which it is assembled, sotoo can these ultra-flexible materialsbreak all the rules that 'traditional'systems are forced to obey. Shrinking from the heat One such rule, known to all who havestruggled with a stubborn jar lid,decrees that materials should expandwhen heated. More often than not,this is bad news for industry. Mirrorsused on satellites change dimensionssimply on passing through the Earth'sshadow. Small daily variations inocean temperatures limit the quantityof data that can be transmittedthrough optical fibres laid on the seafloor. Quite the opposite occurs in a remarkable material called silver 16| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008MATERIALS Atomic yoga: the newphysics offlexibility A UK-wide Earth Sciences isuncovering thecounterintuitive propertiesof flexible materials.NATE TRUE Some materials are capable of flexing in very strange ways, like the collapsible toy sphere shown above hexacyanocobaltate, which Dr Goodwin showed actually shrinks when heated.Assembled from long chains of cobalt,carbon, nitrogen and silver atoms, silverhexacyanocobaltate has a flexiblestructure that at the atomic scale looksjust like garden lattice fencing. Whenheated, the lattice dimensions changevery quickly - but an expansion in onedirection is forced to produce an equallystrong contraction in another direction.The contraction is so rapid that even a very small amount of silverhexacyanocobaltate is capable ofcompensating for the usual thermalexpansion of 'normal' materials. Goodnews for industries where thermalexpansion remains a fundamentalproblem. Push and pull It turns out that this strange new physicsis not limited to thermal expansion alone.Squeeze most materials - or, to be moreprecise, apply an equal pressure in everydirection - and, naturally enough, theirdimensions decrease. But squeeze silverhexacyanocobaltate and its lattice-likestructure folds up, collapsing in onedirection but actually expanding inanother. Far from an academic curiosity,this bizarre pressure-induced expansion has important applications in pressure-measuring devices, such as those used todetermine aircraft altitudes and tomonitor meteorological variations. Silver hexacyanocobaltate is just one example of what is emerging to be adiverse and exciting family of materials.Understanding flexibility and itsconsequences in these compounds is animportant problem in materials science.Dr Goodwin is addressing this problemwith Professor Martin Dove in the Department of Earth Sciences and Dr Mark Calleja in the eScience Centre,using a range of experimental techniques. Themultidisciplinary, UK-wide collaborationalso includes researchers at the ISISNeutron Facility at the RutherfordAppleton Laboratory near Oxford, theUniversity of Oxford's Department ofPhysics and the University of Durham'sDepartment of Chemistry. This approach of designing architectures in which flexibility plays newand varied roles is far from child's play;instead, it promises the sort of materialswith extreme properties needed to meetthe increasing demands of key globalindustries.

By immersing metals such asaluminium, titanium, zinc andmagnesium in a solution that conductselectricity and applying an electriccurrent, the natural oxide on the metalsurface thickens and creates aprotective outer layer. Although anodised layers are typically only a few microns in depthand are porous, this simple process canalter the surface appearance of a metaland, importantly, vastly improve itsresistance to corrosion and wear. Today,anodised metals enjoy varied and far-reaching applications stretching fromconstruction, through the automotiveindustry, to consumer products. More recent modifications have improved this process still further: byusing stronger electric fields in aprocess known as plasma electrolyticoxidation (PEO), thermal and electricalprotection can now be added to the listof attributes. Coatings produced in thisway on aluminium, for instance,incorporate a very hard, crystallinephase of aluminium oxide calledcorundum - known in its naturallyoccurring form as the minerals sapphireand ruby - that is second only inhardness to diamond. Lightning strikes As the electric field is increased toachieve these harder, thicker and moredurable coatings, localised electricdischarges or 'sparking' occurs - perhapsbest likened to micro-lightning strikeswithin the forming coat. In the pastdecade, attention has focused on what exactly is happening during sparking.How do these phenomena dictate themicrostructure of the coating material?Is it possible to control them and evento use them to influence the propertiesof the oxide coat? Questions such asthese are being investigated byProfessor Bill Clyne in the GordonLaboratory, Department of MaterialsScience and Metallurgy, in closecollaboration with Dr James Curranseconded from InternationalLtd (www.keronite.com), a Cambridge-based industrial manufacturer that ispioneering PEO technology. Taming the spark The phenomenon of sparking hashistorically been regarded asdestructive, imposing a limit on thegrowth rate and the thickness ofanodised layers, and generating defectsand microcracks in the material. But, asresearch in the Gordon Laboratory hasprogressed, it's become clear that thedischarges can in fact be 'tamed' andused beneficially. So long as a suitableelectrolyte and electrical controlcircuitry is employed, the dischargescan be made to occur repeatedly in acontrolled fashion over the surface ofthe component, and the conditions ofhigh local pressure and temperaturewithin the resulting plasma can be usedto modify the structure of the growingoxide layer and enhance its properties. Controlled coatings Rather than being unwanted defects,the ultra-fine, interconnected porosityand networks of microcracks within PEOcoatings appear to play an unsung role.The researchers have found that this porosity is essential for the process tocontinue. In fact, the so-called defectsactually confer important beneficialeffects on the coatings, improving theirthermal insulation, enhancing theirstrain tolerance (giving better adhesion)and leading to excellent 'keying' withoverlays such as paints and sealants. The focus now has turned towards analysing the electrical andspectroscopic characterisation ofdischarges at the level of single events,with the aim of developing a processmodel that has the capability ofpredicting and controlling themicrostructural features that determinecoating properties.

Theystore information, translate it intofunction, perform an enormous rangeof chemical transformations, respond toheat and light as well as mechanicaland chemical stimuli, and performphysical movement. Yet none of theseactions is driven by electricity orcontrolled by software, and the 'devices'are not fabricated using lithographictechniques or other engineering tools.Instead, cells rely on chemical energyand efficient chemical reactions to drivetheir complex machinery. The machinery itself is principally made up of functional assemblies ofbuilding blocks, or monomers, whichtogether form larger polymers such asDNA, proteins devices areincreasingly (one canthink of modern-day computers,memory devices, miniature robots, andso on), they are not even close toapproaching the level of complexityobserved in cells. Can lessons belearned from nature's successes in self- organising and self-assembling buildingblocks into functional entities that runon chemical energy? The softer side of nanotechnology To design and fabricate devices that merge principles from engineering withbiological design rules for cellularmachinery, a step change is needed inour understanding of how softmaterials are assembled and organisedinto functional materials. Softnanotechnology is an emerging area ofscience that aims to do just this: byunderstanding and exploitingpolymeric (and small molecule)building blocks, the goal is to formfunctional devices that can mimic someof the properties of biological systems.To do this, we need to understand howto synthesise these building blocks,how to assemble them and, mostimportantly, how to incorporatefunctionality.Taking their cue from the building blocks of life, Cambridge chemists are assembling polymers that move.Brushing up on soft materials for nanotechnology Fluorescence image showing patterned polymer brushes attached to a surfaceREPRODUCED WITH PERMISSION FROM J. AM. CHEM. SOC. (2006) 128, 16253-16258 .\u00a92006 AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETYIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 19MATERIALS It is clear that the building blocks used in biological systems are far toocomplex to synthesise de novo . Research in Professor Wilhelm Huck'sgroup in the Melville Laboratory forPolymer Synthesis, Department ofChemistry, is therefore aimed atexploiting the properties ofsynthetically accessible polymers.Synthetic polymers have been aroundfor some time - one has only to thinkof plastic, nylon and polystyrene tounderstand how important andcommonplace synthetic polymers aretoday. Not only are polymersinexpensive and easy to use, as it turnsout they also provide remarkableflexibility in the field of softnanotechnology. One important aspect of the group's research is based on the introduction ofarchitectural order to the polymers atthe nanometre scale. Essentially, it is thearrangement and confinement ofindividual polymers in relation to eachother and to the surface that supportsthem that holds the key to expandingtheir functionality. 'Hairy' surfaces A good example of novel propertiesarising from confinement are polymerbrushes. These are best imagined ashair growing out of a surface: thepolymers assemble at high density,with little space between them, and are'rooted' at one end to a surface. Likereal hair, the synthetic conditions canbe tailored so as to make short, long,curly or very straight hair. Of coursethese structures are at molecularlengthscales that can be 10,000 timessmaller in diameter compared with ahuman hair. Polymers normally resist stretching and would prefer to form a curly carpet.It is possible to switch this polymercarpet layer between stretched(straight) and collapsed (curly) states viaa wide range of physical and chemicaltriggers such as temperature, light, saltand pH. Not only does the transitionchange the properties of the polymersbut it also changes the level ofinteractions between neighbouringchains. Crucially, this has the addedeffect of changing the properties of the surface, including wettability,roughness and stiffness. Harvesting the effect of these simple movements opens up a wholenew area of applications in the area of'nanoactuation' . By growing the polymer brushes on flexible,microfabricated cantilevers (a structuresupported only at one end, like abalcony), and allowing the brushes toswitch from stretched to collapsed, thecantilevers bend to relieve the surfacestresses that are generated inside thepolymer brush layer. If theseconformational changes are used as away of transforming chemical energyinto mechanical work, then you havethe basis of a 'nanoactuator' . Work incollaboration with Professor Steinerin the inCambridge is currently extending theactuation properties of polymerbrushes to explore the possibility offabricating molecular 'conveyor belts'based on the directional movement ofpolymer brushes. Potential applicationsfor these types of surface modificationsare in microfluidics, where valvesactuated by polymer coatings could beused in self-regulating fluidic devices. In addition to industrial applications, such as protective coatings andpolymer photovoltaic devices, otherapplications are to be found in theworld of biology, especially in the areaof ultrasensitive detection systems forviruses and bacteria. And, in aninteresting twist, actuation in polymerbrushes driven by chemical signals(instead of electrical signals) brings usmuch closer to understandingactuating principles found in nature.For example, in the pond-dwellingprotozoan Vorticella , the hair-like stalk that anchors it is able to coil and uncoillike a spring and, similar to the situationwith polymer brushes, the rapidcontraction is a result of forces restoringa collapsed state betweenneighbouring polymeric buildingblocks. Tailored soft materials Ultimately, the group hopes to shrinkdimensions much further and reallyoperate at the lengthscales ofbiological machinery inside living cells.Some of the current work is gearedtowards arranging brushes intonanoscale (35 nm) patterns andstudying the transition from thecollective behaviour of 'infinite' carpetsto individual polymer chains. Thesestudies are very important to providegeneral guidelines for the design ofmaterials that are based onnanostructured polymers because it isfar from obvious how the properties of soft materials deviate when structuredor confined at small lengthscales. Thegroup's results strongly indicate thatmany of the properties changeconsiderably because, unlike bulkmaterials, the individual chains are all ina slightly different environment. To exploit soft materials to their full potential, it has become increasinglyimportant to determine how thesematerials can be interfaced with micro-and nanofabricated electronic devices.But future applications of softnanotechnology are not necessarily allat a very small scale. For example, thenext generation of materials for tissueengineering will require 'smart' scaffoldsthat have the right mechanical andchemical properties, combined withbiocompatibility, surface chemistry anddegradability. The group is currentlyworking on nanocomposites formedfrom blending polymers and inorganicparticles with the right surface coatingsand has identified several that formexcellent scaffolds for the growth ofstem cells that differentiate into bonecells. The lessons learned from model studies on polymer brushes provide uswith new tools to finely tailor theproperties of materials. In the future, wewill see many more soft materials thatare engineered at the nanometre levelto provide a level of complexity andfunctionality that makes these materialsinteract with biological matter in acompletely new way.

Some dialects arelost through political upheavals,scattering populations whose childrengrow up speaking the language of theirnew home; for others, social tensionspersuade communities to lose onedialect in favour of another. Unlike theloss of biodiversity, this type ofendangerment goes largely unnoticedand yet the loss of linguistic diversity,and the history and knowledge thatlanguages embody, is equally aslamentable. There is now a great urgency in the task of systematically documenting onegroup of dialects, whose roots lie in theancient Semitic language of Aramaic,before their imminent demise. SinceOctober 2004, Geoffrey Khan, Professorof Semitic Philology in the Faculty ofAsian and Middle Eastern Studies, hasbeen directing a research team in anArts and Humanities Research Council(AHRC)-funded project that is preserving this knowledge in an entirely new way. Ancient roots Aramaic has survived into modern timesas the spoken vernacular language invarious areas of the Middle East. Neo-Aramaic, as it is known, consists of a verydiverse range of dialects that today differconsiderably from earlier literary forms ofAramaic. In many cases, the dialectsexhibit types of linguistic forms that areunique within Semitic. The group of dialects spoken in south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq,north-western Iran and the adjacentregion of the former Soviet Union,known as North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic(NENA), exhibits particular diversity,comprising over 100 dialects spoken byChristians and Jews. Remarkably, thosespoken by Christians are in all casesdifferent from those spoken by Jews,even when the two communities havelived side by side for centuries. Current estimates suggest that a language dies every two weeks. Here, Geoffrey Khan describes the documentation of a group of dialects before they are lost forever.COURTESY OF PROFESSOR GEOFFREY KHAN Endangered dialects of AramaicDelman Gwirgis, a Neo-Aramaic-speaking storyteller from Golaysor, ArmeniaFEATURESIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 21Vulnerable voices The NENA group of dialects are particularly vulnerable because of thegreat upheavals that have beensuffered in the 20th century by theJewish and Christian Aramaic-speakingcommunities in the region. Jewish communities left the region in a mass exodus in the 1950s and nowlive, for the most part, in Israel. As forthe Christian communities, a largeproportion have been displaced in thepast century: in south-eastern Turkey,for instance, virtually all the villagecommunities were destroyed in theFirst World War and the survivors forcedto flee their villages; and in northernIraq, many of the Christian villages havebeen lost more recently throughpolitical disturbances in the region. These catastrophes, together with a policy of Arabicisation by an Iraqigovernment intolerant of linguisticminorities, have driven a large numberof Aramaic-speaking Christians out ofthe Middle East to make a new life inother countries. The diaspora havesettled throughout the world,particularly in North America, Australiaand western Europe. Such upheavalshave brought the majority of the NENA dialects to the verge ofextinction. Tracing the last surviving speakers To arrive at a systematic description of the surviving NENA dialects, much ofthe data have to be gathered in field-trips and it has become a major task tolocate informants for many of thedialects. This applies all the more so tothe most endangered dialects of thegroup, some of which have only a fewsurviving speakers, all of whom areadvanced in age. For example, after along hunt, Professor Khan finallymanaged to locate the final speaker ofone dialect in Auckland, New Zealand.He was a man in his 90s who hadoriginally come from a small village innorthern Iraq. Similarly, the remaininghalf-dozen speakers of another dialect have been found, this time in a village in Armenia to which theirancestors had migrated from easternTurkey at the beginning of the 19thcentury. In the case of some of the NENA dialects, the surviving speakersremember the dialect of their parents imperfectly. Vocabulary relating to material culture is particularly prone to disappear quicklyafter the displacement of thecommunities from their rural villages in the Middle East. The physicaldeterioration of the speakers can alsobe a problem; elderly speakers oftenlack enough teeth to pronounce somewords properly, especially those withdental consonants. Having found surviving speakers, the process of describing anundocumented spoken languageconsists of more than simply recordingan individual's speech. There is ananalytical dimension in which a linguistmust use various means of questioningto tease out the complete structure ofthe language. Some cases turn out tobe more arduous than others: oneinformant had great difficulty with theplural imperative of the verb 'to open'(i.e. the order 'open!' addressed to agroup of people), insisting that this wasnot possible, since more than oneperson is not needed to open awindow or door. The most successful means of working with informants has proved to be through informal, friendlyrelationships, without any payment of fees. On one occasion, however, an informant was clearly conscious of the financial value of his knowledge and insisted on charging $2 for every grammatical form. Owing to the complex nature of hisdialect's verbal system, it became clear that the description of thisparticular dialect would be beyond the means of the available researchfunding! Linguistic fingerprinting In most cases, the speakers have noknowledge of the migration history of their ancestors. The grammaticalstructure of the dialects, however, is a 'linguistic genome' and onefascinating aspect of this project has been the finding that dialectssometimes contain evidence ofpopulation movements. In Azerbaijan, for instance, the Turkishlanguage had an impact on the verbal system of the Aramaic dialects of the region. This influencecan still be seen today in Aramaicdialects that are spoken a long way from Azerbaijan, as far as theMosul plain in Iraq.

The web-based resource allowsefficient retrieval of linguistic data andaudio recordings for individual dialects,of which over 70 have now beendocumented. Comparative displays ofdata from all the dialects in thedatabase can be created, and a 'smart'version of the traditional dialect atlasdisplays the distribution of grammaticalfeatures across the dialect area. Of course, linguists in most cases cannot keep endangered languagesalive, given that the risk to the languageis often rooted in social and politicalissues, but they can create records that are detailed and sophisticated enoughto allow analytical study by futureresearchers over decades to come. Bypreserving the world's rich history oflinguistic diversity, we can enhance ourcollective understanding of humanlanguage and the peoples that havespoken them.FEATURESlandscape. According to many policymakers and pundits, the primaryconfrontation in world politics in the 21st century is no longer between statesbut between states and terroristnetworks such as al-Qaeda, drugsmuggling networks like those inColombia and Mexico, and insurgentnetworks such as those in Afghanistanand Iraq. And states are widely reputedto be losing the battle. For example,Peter Clarke, who leads the anti-terroristbranch of London's Metropolitan Police,described the networks of radical Islamas 'large, fluid, mobile, and incrediblyresilient.' It is this fluid structure that issaid to provide terrorists and criminalswith multiple advantages, includingadaptability, mobility and covertness,and which makes them difficult formore-stable, hierarchical states tocombat. Just how do networks differ from hierarchies? Networked organisations areflat and decentralised, with decision-making and action dispersed amongmultiple actors enjoying significant localautonomy and relating to each otherthrough informal, horizontal ties.Hierarchies rely on top-down command,authoritative rules and legal arbitration;by contrast, networks are self-enforcinggovernance structures disciplined byreputation and reciprocity. Consequently,networks tend to be based on directpersonal contacts among people who share similar backgrounds and goals, andwho trust one another. Most current literature on clandestine groups assumes that networks, due totheir informal, flexible design, are betterthan hierarchies at learning, innovatingand responding to new situations.However, Dr Eilstrup-Sangiovanni'sresearch suggests that the manyadvantages claimed for networks in theircompetition with hierarchical states reston a poor understanding of the networkform. Scholars and policymakers havetended to overestimate the strengths ofclandestine networks through drawingparallels to the world of the 'company' ,where networked modes of organisationhave proved highly adapted to the fast-moving global marketplace. Yet,clandestine organisations - whether theyare terrorist groups, guerrilla movementsor drug smuggling enterprises - face aunique set of constraints that distinguishthem from their legal, commercialcounterparts and which limit theireffectiveness. An historical approach Although most observers assume thattoday's transnational networked threatsare new phenomena, opposition to thestate has in fact often taken a networkedapproach, as illustrated by thedecentralised Greek resistance to the 22| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008Networks appear to be defining relations everywhere in today'sglobalised societies: internationalbankers, financial regulators, lawenforcement officials, even legislatorscooperate informally across borders toshare information and coordinatepolicies. But networks are notconfined to the realms of internationalpolitics and finance. Arms dealers,drug traffickers, money launderers,people smugglers, terrorists and othersundry criminals, enabled by thenewest technologies, increasinglyorganise into sprawling globalnetworks like that of the infamous al-Qaeda organisation. Dr Mette Eilstrup-Sangiovanni, based in the Centre of InternationalStudies, has been researching thestructural properties of networkedorganisations in international politics.Understanding the strengths andweaknesses of networks might openthe door to more effective forms ofinternational governance and moreinnovative ways of combatingtransnational criminal and terroristgroups. Networked crime and terrorism Networks feature prominently in today's international securityTerrorist groups, guerrilla movements, drugsmuggling: Mette Eilstrup-Sangiovanni the tocombating them. Clandestine networks:howdangerousare they? FEATURES In a networked organisation, decision-making and action are dispersed through informal, horizontal ties among its membersIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 23FEATURES Ottomans in the early 19th century, by the sprawling International AnarchistMovement in the late 19th century, andby the Muslim Brotherhood's looselyorganised, dispersed resistance to theEgyptian state in the 20th century.Drawing on such historical andcontemporary examples ofparticipation in undergroundmovements, terrorism and insurgency,and organised organisations connected totheir growth, decision-making andinternal cohesion. Restricting growth Clandestine networks often find itdifficult to grow their ranks. Becauseillicit networks cannot depend on thelegal system to resolve disputes, theyare crucially dependent oninterpersonal trust. It is easier togenerate trust in small groups whenthe 'social distance' between actors isshort, and chains of action are notextended. This favours small networks. It is also easier to generate trust when actors are homogeneous inoutlook, lifestyle and culture. This is whyrecruitment to clandestine networksmostly proceeds through pre-existing networks of personalrelationships. Terrorist groups tend torely on bonds of family or friendship, and contemporary drug traffickinglargely occurs within ethnicallyhomogeneous groups, where kinshipgenerates trust among criminals. Theserecruitment practices also restrict thepotential size of clandestine networks. Making decisions The absence of centralised leadershipin clandestine networks makesdecision-making difficult, particularlywith regard to complex decisions suchas resource allocation, tactics, andwhether and when to use violence. Alack of centralised control also makesnetworks susceptible to internal strife.Once made, decisions may not berespected as readily due to the lack ofan authoritative stamp. As a result,resources may be used poorly,contradictory tactics selected andactivities carried out that serveparochial short-term interests ratherthan the larger mission. Moreover,internal security is often fragile inclandestine networks, leaving themopen to infiltration. The absence of central authority may also lead to strategic and tacticalerrors because local autonomy meansoperations can go forward withoutevaluation, coordination and soberassessment of the overall benefits andrisks. A good example is the Madridbombings in 2004: lacking centraloversight and screening of activities,the Madrid group's efforts to recruitmembers and acquire arms broughtthem into contact with policeinformants; the bombs they used wereof poor quality; and an unexplodedbomb provided information that led toarrests just days after the bombings. Confronting clandestine networks Analysing the progression of al-Qaeda exemplifies the importance ofunderstanding how networks arestructured. Since the attacks of 11September 2001, al-Qaeda has evolvedfrom a fairly centralised command-and-control organisation, running trainingcamps and occupying territory inAfghanistan, into a diffuse transnationalnetwork of associate groups and ad hoc cells. Many believe al-Qaeda's transformation has made it a moreformidable enemy, better capable ofgrowing its ranks and avoidingdetection. But decentralisation and segmentation have also exposed al-Qaeda to the gamut oforganisational dilemmas associatedwith a networked structure. As itbecomes more networked, al-Qaedaappears to be losing unity, cohesionand the ability to act collectively. Al-Qaeda's most successful operations,including the September 11 attacks,took place when the organisationadopted a hierarchical structure. In theaftermath of 9/11, al-Qaeda was forcedto segment into smaller operationalunits, and affiliated groups have startedto act on their own initiative withoutcentral approval and guidance, leadingto poorer security practices. Al-Qaeda'sincreased reliance on informal links toglobal jihad groups around the worldalso appears to be leading tofractiousness as groups differ in theirunderstanding of overall goals andstrategy. Attention to these and similar weaknesses has important implicationsfor counter-terrorism policy. Throughunderstanding the structuralweaknesses of clandestine networks, it is hoped that states can improve theirstrategic thinking about how tocombat them.

In the Department of Radiology, imaging techniques are being refined fordiagnosing abdominal pain, cranial andspinal problems, early lung cancer,inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis,to name but a few conditions that arebenefitting from these non-invasivediagnostic procedures. Image-guidedstrategies are replacing formal opensurgical diagnostic procedures for manydiseases. And, where direct injection ofcontrast material was previously requiredto visualise the lymphatic system, lymphnodes now be directly visualised inthree-dimensional images on ultrasound,CT, PET/CT and MR. Imaging for therapy As well as breaking new ground in howmedical conditions are diagnosed,ongoing research is enabling thereplacement of some forms of therapeuticsurgery. This has been achieved in severalconditions through the development ofnovel image-guided techniques that allowdrainage of acute abdominal and pelvicabscesses. In breast malignancy,sophisticated percutaneous image-guidedmethods have been extended toincorporate therapeutic excision usingwide-core needle biopsy, and this may, intime, replace conventional methods ofbreast surgery. Imaging can inform surgeons, helping them to decide whether to operate, aswell as enlighten the patient and guide surgical planning. These improvements totherapeutic surgery have been madepossible through triage studies on acutesurgical admissions using rapid multi-detector CT, providing surgeons with apre-operative specific diagnosis andlocation of disease. Towards novel imaging techniques New and innovative uses of imaging are being pioneered and evaluated inCambridge for a plethora of diseaseconditions. In patients with atherosclerosis,lesions in carotid arteries are beingassessed using a variety of techniques thatcan also determine the degree ofassociated inflammatory change.Important nerve tracts are beingdelineated in relation to techniques forevaluating patients with stroke. Newfunctional methods such as MR perfusionand diffusion are being evaluated forassessing early solid tumour response totherapy (e.g. in gynaecological tumours).For diffuse liver disease, a range ofquantitative techniques for measuringbody and hepatic fat distribution are alsobeing assessed. 24| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008FEATURES Medical imaging has developed at an astonishingly rapid speed sincethe first discovery of X-rays in 1895.Today, imaging is a crucial part of thebiomedical sciences and a mainstayof medical practice.

Professor Adrian Dixon For more information, please contact the author Professor Adrian Dixon(akd15@radiol.cam.ac.uk) at theDepartment of Radiology.Medical imaging across Cambridge Cambridge is fortunate in having excellent cross-sectional imaging facilities thatbenefit from a close integration between National Health Service (NHS)departments and academic imaging departments spread across the city. In the University's Department of Radiology , located at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Addenbrooke's Hospital, an impressive inventory ofimaging tools has been assembled thanks to research collaborations both withindustry (GlaxoSmithKline) and with charity (Cancer Research UK; TheDepartment of Radiology houses numerous modern multi-detector CT systems, four state-of-the-art 1.5 Tesla (T) MRIsystems and one 3T MRI system. Two of the MRI systems have full multi-nuclearspectroscopy capability. These NHS-based machines are all used extensively forresearch as well as for routine NHS work. All machines are linked by a sophisticatednetwork to a central picture-archiving computed storage (PACS) system, allowingpractitioners at different physical locations to access the stored images. Also used extensively for research as well as for routine NHS work are the gamma cameras within the NHS Department of Nuclear Medicine ; the imminent arrival of a PET/CT unit in this Department, funded with a grant from the recent successfulNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre bid andindustrial support, will be predominantly used for research. Comprehensiveresearch agreements with the vendors underpin the ability to develop andevaluate new technology and applications on these systems. The Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre (WBIC) is a research facility attached directly to the Addenbrooke's Hospital Neuro Critical Care Unit and is dedicated to imagingfunction in the injured human brain. WBIC facilities include state-of-the-artMRI/MRS systems (two of them 3T systems), PET research capabilities, twocyclotrons and a PET radiochemistry laboratory with some 15 radioligandscurrently available for studying patients with acute brain injury. The University is currently refurbishing a laboratory on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus that will provide the School of Clinical Medicine with small animal imaging systems to support phenotyping and molecular imaging studies formetabolic, endocrine, neuroscience and cardiovascular medical research. Inaddition to a 4.7T preclinical MR and microPET, it will also house an experimentalPET/MR system. The Medical Imaging Group in the Department of Engineering is developing new techniques for freehand three-dimensional ultrasonic imaging. Workingclosely with various members of the School of Clinical Medicine, the Group isresearching ways to improve the visualisation and measurement of tumours andmore accurate targeting of the tumour site, allowing reduced radiation doses withfewer side effects. The Cambridge Research Institute (CRI), funded by CRUK, has recently developed an Imaging Section and there is close liaison between its imaging scientists andthose elsewhere on the campus. Imaging goals at the CRI include using MRI andMRS for the evaluation and design of novel tumour therapies, includingimmunotherapy, anti-vascular and gene therapies. Such research will increaseunderstanding of the biology of cancer and the determination of tumour-associated MR parameters for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of therapy. There are further imaging facilities at the Medical Research Council (MRC)-funded Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit , an internationally leading centre for research in the cognitive sciences and neurosciences. With dedicated 3T functional MRI and306-channel magnetoencephalography facilities available on site, the Unit hasparticular strengths in the application of neuro-imaging techniques in the contextof well-developed neuro-cognitive theory. PROFESSOR ADRIAN DIXON26| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008FEATURES Violins crafted 300 years ago by the master violin-maker Antonio Stradivarisell for millions of pounds on the rareoccasion they reach auction; what is itabout their quality of sound that makesthem prized above all others? Indeed, istheir sound actually discerniblydifferent? Any experienced violinistknows that some violins respond totheir bow better than others: whatdetermines which violins are difficultand which are easy to play? Questionssuch as these have fascinatedmusicians and scientists since the 19th century. To get to the heart of the riddle there is an added complication: soundis in the 'ear of the beholder' . In fact,although much is now known aboutthe acoustics of the violin, and how thisis influenced by the way it is made,virtually nothing is known about howhuman capacities for perceiving,discriminating and judging violinsounds match up to their acousticalfeatures. This is a very significant gap, asperceptual judgements obviouslydefine what makes a violin differentfrom, say, a cello, just as it makes oneviolin different from another, for listeners,performers and violin-makers alike. A three-year project funded by the Leverhulme Trust that is reachingcompletion at the University ofCambridge has been intent on fillingthis gap. The approach has involvedcollaboration between fourdepartments - Professor JimWoodhouse from the Department ofEngineering, Dr Claudia Fritz and Dr IanCross from the Faculty of Music,Professor Brian Moore from theDepartment of ExperimentalPsychology and Dr Alan Blackwell fromthe Computer Laboratory. Strings and body The tone, pitch and loudness of a violin are the product of many components:drawing a bow across tightly stretchedviolin strings forces them into complexharmonic vibration; a significantfraction of this acoustical energy istransmitted, via a structure called thebridge, into the violin body. Here, thesound is amplified by the vibration ofthe wooden box and the air inside it. The team's approach relies on the fact that the acoustical behaviours ofthe strings and the violin body can betreated separately, and that it is thelatter that distinguishes different violins.In fact, on its own, a string makes hardlyany sound and the acoustical behaviouris much the same from one instrumentto another. The main acoustical featurethat 'colours' the sound in ways that areunique for each violin is the way inwhich the violin body responds to thedifferent frequencies input from thebridge and radiated from the violin's 'frequency responsecharacteristic' . Virtual violins The project was tocreate a 'virtual violin' . To carry out anycomparative study of musicalinstruments it is important to rule outvariations caused by the player. Insteadof achieving this by using a roboticviolinist that repeats the same piece ona variety of real violins, in this projectthe tests themselves are virtual. Sensors on a violin bridge record the string waveforms arising as a playerperforms normally. The recordings arestored as standard force functions,which can then be applied to differentviolins to hear how they sound withoutVirtual violins Why does one violin sound different to another? Investigating this question has brought together researchers from music,engineering, experimental psychology and computer science. \u00a9ISTOCKPHOTO.COM/YENWEN LUIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 27FEATURES having to worry about any complications caused by variations inplaying. So, by 'playing' these recordingsthrough computer models of differentviolins' frequency responsecharacteristics using digital filters, aprediction of the sound of the violincan be created. This makes it possibleto 'play' exactly the same performance on different 'virtual violins' . The frequency response characteristics can be derived from empirical measurements made on a range of real violins. The psychoacoustics of the violin Once the violin response is represented in digital filter form, it becomes very easy to make controlled variations of a kind that would be almost impossible to achieve by physical changes to a violin. This gave the researchers an opportunity to focus on what features of violins' response characteristics determine how listeners discriminate between different violins. In particular, the psychoacoustical experiments looked at just-noticeable differences of alterations made to theacoustical response characteristics oftwo violins: an excellent violin made byDavid Rubio and a mass-producedstudent violin that was informally ratedas low quality. Psychoacoustical testmethods can be used to find thethreshold for detection of any particularchange, and also to obtain statisticallysignificant data on quality judgementsmade by the listeners. Using groups of listeners that spanned expert string players, expertnon-string-playing musicians and non-musicians, it was found for bothinstruments that the alteration ofindividual low-frequency resonancesneeds to be fairly large in order to beperceptible. Even for the listeners whowere expert players, a resonanceneeded to be shifted (in terms offrequency) by about a semitone to beperceptibly different. However, if severalresonances are shifted simultaneously, a smaller shift becomes audible. Testing timbre The sound of an instrument is not justabout pitch and resonance but is alsoabout a somewhat elusive qualityknown as timbre. It is, in effect, therichness of the sound. Similar to themanner in which a wine taster conveysthe flavour and aroma of a fine wine,there are many exercise from The Strad , a classical music magazine covering string instruments, came upwith a list of 61 words that arecommonly used by players, critics,makers and listeners to describe thequality of the sound. This list of descriptors was used as the basis for a series of experiments inwhich players located the words intwo-dimensional spaces, the results being analysed by multidimensionalscaling methods (MDS) to producemaps of families of terms. Somerelevant descriptors can therefore beselected on the basis of theirdistribution in the MDS spaces. This isnow allowing the team to test timbre ina more methodical way than has beenpossible before, asking questions suchas: does an increase of amplitude in thefrequency range between 650 Hz and1300 Hz really make the violin soundmore 'nasal'? Probing the mysteries ofmusic The aim is to provide researchers, violin-makers and repairers with an evidence-based means of assessing what it isnecessary to adjust on a violin toachieve improved sound. This rigorousanalysis of descriptors and theirrelations will not only be useful tospecialists in discussions withperformers, but will also havepedagogical value and might lead tonew ways for composers and arrangersto annotate musical scores. Perhapsone day, when describing how oneviolin sounds different to another, wewill be able to say exactly why.

Recording string waveforms with sensors on the bridge (left) and measuring the violins' frequency response with a small hammer and laser vibrometer (right) PROFESSOR JIM WOODHOUSE DANIEL OI28| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008FEATURES The fast-expanding advanced photonics and electronics field isdominated globally by large, often non-European, industrial operations capableof investing tens of billions of dollars inresearch and development. This createscertain challenges, as Professor BillMilne, Head of the ElectricalEngineering Division, explained: 'Theproblem in Cambridge and the UK ishow do you stay involved, engage withglobal players and maintain acompetitive edge in an industry whenthe bulk of investment is being madeelsewhere?'The Centre for AdvancedPhotonics and Electronics (CAPE),which Professor Milne directs, isCambridge's answer: a unique way ofworking with industry involving anequal partnership between theUniversity and a small group of keyindustrial companies. Strategic Partners CAPE, based in a purpose-built buildingat the West Cambridge Site and housedwithin the Department of Engineering'sElectrical Engineering Division, is nowfour years into its five-year strategicagreement and has attracted international attention as a model ofuniversity-industry collaboration. Thetwo current Strategic Partners are theJapanese company ALPS ElectricCompany Ltd and the US-basedcompany Dow Corning, with Carl ZeissSMT as an Associate Member. An important remit was that the industrial partners be global playerswith a wide geographical spread andshould represent non-overlappingareas of the supply chain (ALPS makeselectronic components and DowCorning is a materials supplier).'Without this we couldn't hope to havesufficient oversight of the market,'explained Professor Bill Crossland, CAPEChairman, 'and the fact that StrategicPartners were not in competitionenabled us to develop the degree oftrust and readiness to share strategyand road-mapping that was needed.' An imperative from the outset was that CAPE would not be about contractresearch - instead, the partnership isfocused on inventing and developingmaterials, processes, components andsystems that will have a major, long-term impact in photonics and electronics through research effectivelyjointly commissioned within thepartnership. Uniquely, the governance of CAPE through its Steering Committee isshared between the academic andindustrial partners with precisely equalvotes. Through CAPE's StrategicPartnership Agreement (SPA),ownership of intellectual property isretained within the University and theindustrial partners benefit frompreferential licensing. Through thismodel of closed partnership, theintention is to provide the best andmost rapid route of linkingbreakthrough research to marketimplementation. Looking forwards Getting CAPE off the ground requiredinitial funding of \u00a310 million, raisedentirely from its industrial partners(which originally also included Marconias a founding member), and CAPEremains self-funded.

Provision is also madefor CAPE Associate companies in specialareas of technology; the involvement ofCarl Zeiss SMT as CAPE Associate forElectron Beam Imaging has beenparticularly successful. The SPA alreadyallows for 'Third-Party' projects withcompanies outside CAPE, which maybecome important in the recent CAPEinitiative on the role of electronics andphotonics in the sustainability of thebuilt environment. Innovation to commercialisation CAPE's success has been instrumental in allowing Electrical Engineering to bidsuccessfully to create the CambridgeIntegrated Knowledge Centre (CIKC),funded by the Engineering and PhysicalSciences Research Council (EPSRC). DrTerry Clapp, one of the CAPE foundersand CIKC Director, explained: 'Althoughthe CIKC works very differently to CAPE- it's an open partnership funded withgovernment agency money - the twoare highly complementary, with theCIKC providing an integral role inmoving proof-of-principle researchcarried out in CAPE on Milneadded: 'CAPE and the CIKC effectivelyrepresent the two poles of howacademia can interact with industry.Together, they enable cutting-edgeresearch to be effectively and quicklytransferred for the benefit of society.' This highly successful model is bringing results: two ground-breakingprojects have reached importantmilestones in their development (seeside panels). Professor Ian White, CIKC'sPrincipal Investigator and also Head ofthe School of Technology and Head ofPhotonics Research in ElectricalEngineering, explained: 'These projectsare excellent examples of CAPEtechnologies that have been originated,researched and patented in theUniversity, licensed to our partnercompanies, and are now beingprototyped under the CIKC.' For more information about CAPE, please visit www-cape.eng.cam.ac.uk Displaying the future Reflective colour displays that can open up the world of 'electronically controlled print' are a grand challenge for the display industry. A CAPE projectin collaboration with Dow Corning has electronic posters within its sights. Flat-panel liquid crystal display panels such as television screens have finally displaced the cathode ray tube, and the industry is now worth morethan $100 billion per year. A large market sector for the display industry lieswith street furniture - everything from advertising billboards to displays ofpublic information. But, as yet, no current display technology can challengegood-quality print. To be able to deliver the size and the reflective viewingcharacteristics of printed media, current proposals are turning to electronic 'e'-ink. At CAPE, the SiLC project is based on the use of smectic A liquid crystals and coloured dyes. This is a true e-ink technology; one electrical pulse coloursthe liquid crystal ink and a second pulse clears it. Pictures can remain for manyyears with no electrical power feeding them.Projecting the future Imagine a projector the size of a credit card, capable of showing real-timeimages and expending the minimum of energy. This is the goal of a flagshipproject at CAPE in partnership with ALPS Electric. Conventional projectors take a small brightly illuminated image of a scene and then make it larger by projecting it onto a screen. Because thesmall image absorbs most of the light that illuminates it, the process isextremely energy expensive. The idea behind the Video Holographic Projection Display System (ViHPS) is to represent the image to be projected by a completelytransparent, computer-generated, liquid crystal hologram - it blocks nolight, instead representing the image by delaying the light as it passesthrough. The advantage of these projections is that they reduce the powerconsumption and the size of the projector, making micro-projectorspossible. Recent developments are creating a new market for highly portable micro-projectors that can be integrated into mobile phones, personal digitalassistants and laptop computers. The facilities for assembling prototype micro-display for holographic projectors have been built up in CAPE with the support of the CIKC. Earlytests are now being carried out in ALPS UK on a miniature full-colourprojector that will be demonstrated at the ALPS Show in Tokyo inSeptember 2008.

Temper tantrums, aggressionand defiance be 'horribly normal'behaviours for the 'terrible twos' , butproblems that persist to school age aremore worrying. Children with early-onset problems are especially likely toshow a persistent prognosis throughlife, and so understanding the earlyorigins of disruptive behaviour isimportant for developing interventionprogrammes. A long-term series of studies at the Centre for Family Research aims to shedlight on the nature and origins of earlyand persistent problem behaviours. The'Toddlers Up!' study, funded by theEconomic and Social Research Council(ESRC), is tracking the socialdevelopment of 140 children from two-to-six years of age. Dr Claire Hughesand her colleagues Dr Rosie Ensor andDr Anji Wilson are interested in howchildren's cognitive skills and socialrelationships interact in predictingindividual differences in children'sbehaviour. Connected conversations One key finding to emerge from thestudy is that it is the two-year-olds withpoor social understanding (or 'Theoryof Mind') who are at risk of displayingproblem behaviours at four years andbeyond, even when initial problembehaviours and known risk factors, suchas exposure to harsh parenting, aretaken into account. On the other hand,a well-developed social understandingmay help children to be resilient in theface of harsh parenting (commonly associated with raised levels of problembehaviour). The study also reveals the importance of mother-childconversations. Psychologists haverecognised that talking about thoughtsand feelings helps children's socialunderstanding. The Toddlers Up! studyhas shown that this effect is strongestfor 'connected' conversations that buildon what a child is saying or doing. Thisfinding highlights the potential benefitsof parents' efforts to build and sustainconversations with their children - bylistening as well as by talking. Mothers' success in promoting good behaviour also depends on theiremotional availability and well-being.Recent findings from the Toddlers Up!study show that effects of maternaleducation/well-being on children'sbehaviour are carried by knock-oneffects on children's abilities to monitorand control their own actions (i.e. theirexecutive functions). That is, rather than'naughtiness' , some problem behavioursmay reflect deficits in children's abilitiesto anticipate or respond flexibly tochallenging situations. The good, the bad and the socially busy A new study aim is to consider children's overall social profiles ratherthan problem behaviours in isolation.'Socially busy' children who areboisterous but also show redeemingbehaviours (such as concern for others)can be quite successful with peers.Thanks to a recently awarded BritishAcademy Postdoctoral Fellowship, Dr Ensor will be able to study theseideas further, for example by exploring whether children's popularity (orrejection) at school reflects their socialprofiles. It's hoped that this approachmight prove useful for evaluatingintervention programmes for childrenat risk of school exclusion. The transition to school Starting school is, for many children,their first major life-event. One of thepositive messages to come out of thisstudy is that parents can prepare theirchildren for the demands of school lifeboth by helping them to develop self-regulatory skills and by havingconnected conversations. And, byunderstanding the early origins ofdisruptive behaviour, studies such asthese should reveal the strategies thatmight work best to help young childrenand their families move beyond the'terrible twos' .

He is perhaps best knownamong his peers for his developmentof a 'quasi-realistic' method for seekingto understand the nature of ethicalattitudes. Although he asserts that his contribution 'was to make myself a nuisance to everyone' , the workprovided substantial progress in thearea and has influenced the way many philosophers think about theproperties of ethics and moraljudgements. Throughout his career, Professor Blackburn has achieved a remarkablebalance between 'ivory-tower'philosophy and accessible, 'democratic'philosophy. His delivery isunderstandable to an audience widerthan his peer group. Tackling a varietyof topics within the philosophy ofmorality - from ethics to truth, lust tobeing good - he does so with acelebrated combination of humour andfirst-rate academia. Lust, for instance, hedescribes as 'furtive, headlong, alwayssizing up opportunities. It is a trail ofclothing in the hallway, the trashycousin of love.' Among his extensive and influential contributions to teaching and research,Professor Blackburn has written theonly single-authored dictionary ofphilosophy ( The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ) - comprising some 2500 entries - and in August he publishedhis latest book: How to Read Hume . A fitting book for him to write, giventhe debt he acknowledges to this 18th-century British philosopher: 'David Hume's philosophy hasinfluenced my research enormously -you could say that a great deal of whatI've done has been a rediscovery of it,an updating of it for our own time.'Who or what inspires you? The great philosophers George Berkeley,Ludwig Wittgenstein and of course DavidHume. My wife also is a constantinspiration. It is her exacting standards ofwriting, borne out of a career in thepublishing industry, that haveencouraged me with my own efforts. As towhat inspires me: poetry and art. Have you ever had a Eureka moment?I would say that my first Eureka momentwas coming to Cambridge as anundergraduate and finding thatphilosophy was something I could do andbe really interested in. I remember feelingas if I was walking on air for the whole ofmy first and second term! My secondEureka moment was when I felt I'ddiscovered the way through somethingcalled Goodman's Paradox - it's a set ofpropositions that seem to be true but can'tall be true all together. What's the best piece of advice you've ever been given?Don't complain! I remember once I wasgetting very hot under the collar aboutwhat I regarded as a piece of plagiarismand an older, wiser friend said 'let it go -you'll hurt yourself more than you'll hurtanyone else. ' Good advice, as it turned out.In general I'd say I pretty much take life asit comes. If you could wake up tomorrow with a new skill, what would it be?Music - singing, playing, even justenjoying listening to it more than I do.Other people clearly get an enormousamount of pleasure out of music and I'dlove to be able to share in this delight. What motivates you to go to work each day?A sense of duty? No not really, but it's truethat if I wasn't coming to work every dayI'd be thinking about philosophy. I need no motivation to do that - it's just somethingI find myself doing. I have a verydemocratic view about philosophy and Ithink more people could enjoy it if theystopped being afraid of it, stoppedworrying about coming up against dead-ends - so I take a lot of pleasure in helpingpeople learn to do that. I think that's whyI've never stopped enjoying teaching in 40years. As regards writing, it is a craft skill,so I suppose I do it for the sheer joy of it. What is your favourite research tool? Time and leisure! Take my current researchinterests - I'd like to develop a pragmatistapproach to the theory of truth, abouthow truth and success in action relate toeach other. But it's expensive in terms oftime - I need to read what others havesaid about pragmatism, marshal my ownthoughts, present them to my peers to seeif I can bear what I'm saying and thenwrite it all down. Part of what makes anhonest philosopher as opposed tosomeone who's going through themotions is preparedness to try it out andgo back to the drawing board if it doesn'twork. In that sense we are experimentalbut, unlike empirical scientists, ourexperimental materials are ourselves andour audience. Professor Simon Blackburn A prolific writer and champion of accessible philosophy, Simon Blackburn was honoured this year by theprestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences forhis significant contributions to academia. His esteemedcareer has taken him full circle - from his arrival at TrinityCollege to study Moral Sciences as an undergraduate in1962, to his return to the same college as Professor ofPhilosophy in 2001. INSIDE OUTIN FOCUS 'Super' superalloys: hotter, stronger, foreven longer Only a single class of engineering materials canwithstand the extremeconditions deep within a jet aeroplane engine - thenickel-base superalloys. Rolls-Royce spends around \u00a3800 million annually on research and development.Its research strategy embraces three'Visions' addressing the 5-, 10- and 20-year timeframes, which broadly aredevoted to technology validation,applied research and fundamentalresearch, respectively. A key element of the longer-range Vision 10 and Vision 20 programmes isthe network of Rolls-Royce-supportedUniversity Technology Centres (UTCs).Over the past 18 years, some 29 UTCs(20 in the UK, the remainder in Europe,USA and Asia) have been carefullyselected as the very best in their fields toaddress critical technical areas as diverseas materials, noise, combustion,aerodynamics and manufacturingtechnology. In cases where UTCs arehighly complementary in their researchfocus, they have been linked together toform University Technology Partnerships(UTPs). The University of Cambridge, with which Rolls-Royce has deep and long-established research links, plays a keyrole in the UTC network through threeresearch programmes: The Cambridge University Gas Turbine Partnership (UGTP) includesthe world-renowned WhittleLaboratory and over 80 projects,such as the Environmentally FriendlyEngine (see panel), whose collectivepurpose is to provide an integratedapproach to gas turbine fluidmechanics and thermodynamics. The Materials UTC in the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgyconducts research into high-temperature superalloys used in thehottest components of gas turbineengines (see panel). The Engineering Design Centre (EDC) in the Department ofEngineering provides theEngineering KnowledgeManagement UTC of a wider UTP forDesign. The project is addressing theneed to capture, store and retrieveengineering knowledge to improvedesign processes. The UTCs and UTPs are highly regarded as models for effective industrial-academic collaborative research. Theirlong-term nature and real-worldchallenges bring mutual benefits: Rolls- Royce finds solutions to complex technical challenges; the universities gain an ongoing five- year stability of funding and a greater depth and quality to their academic research; and the science base is broadened by developing a strong pool of highly skilled engineers and scientists. For more information, please visit www.rolls-royce.comResearch is the foundation stone for the high-technologyproducts that Rolls-Royce designs and develops for itsextremely competitive aerospace, marine and energybusinesses. Each market sector sets substantial economic,operational and environmental challenges that call for accurate,long-range, research-based, technology planning. 32| Issue 7 | Autumn 2008 ROLLS-ROYCEA team of over a dozen researchers at the Rolls-Royce Materials UTC in theDepartment of Materials Science andMetallurgy has been studying theproperties of nickel-base superalloys withthe aim of obtaining the very best fromtheir performance. 'Materials are subjectedto incredible conditions in jet engines -the turbine blades, which have walls onlya millimetre thick, are whizzing round at10,000 rpm while gases over 1500\u00baC passover their surface,' explained DeputyDirector Dr Howard Stone. By improving the performance of materials used in these highly demanding An industrial-grade aerospace gas turbine combustionsimulator - the first of its kindin the UK and one of only adozen worldwide - is ready for'lift off' . Lean machines:environmentallyfriendly enginesIssue 7 | Autumn 2008 | 33IN FOCUS Professor Simone Hochgreb and colleagues in the Department ofEngineering have built the rig to supportthe Environmentally Friendly Engineprogramme, which brings together a UK-wide, cross-sectoral consortium ofacademic and industrial partners underthe leadership of Rolls-Royce. Launched in2006 under the UK's National AerospaceTechnology Strategy, the \u00a395 millionprogramme receives funding from the UKGovernment's Technology Programme,Regional Development Agencies andRolls-Royce and its collaboratingindustries. The partnership's aim is to take UK aerospace capabilities to the next level ofefficiency. 'With no current practicalalternative to oil-based fuels for air travel,the aerospace industry is asking how wecan burn fuel more efficiently and cleanly,'explained Professor Hochgreb. The goalsare impressive: the programme aims todeliver a 10% reduction in carbon dioxideemissions and a 60% reduction in nitrousoxide emissions as a significant steptowards the targets for the aerospaceindustry set for 2020. Detailed understanding of combustion under realistic conditions is a verychallenging area of research in gas turbineenvironments, jet engines can be run at higher temperatures. And, because thisreduces fuel consumption, increasing gastemperatures offers a direct method bywhich emissions from air travel can alsobe reduced. The Cambridge teamconducts research into all aspects of themetallurgy of these materials, fromunderstanding how their properties maybe optimised, to ensuring their safety inservice, to investigating why failures occur. The Cambridge Materials UTC was linked five years ago with complementarydepartments at the Universities ofSwansea and Birmingham to form a UTP .'The UTPs have been very much admiredthroughout the world, and othercompanies globally are beginning toemulate the model of having permanentresearch centres within universities,' saidsenior academic Dr Cathie Rae. 'It's aboutbuilding a relationship of trust betweenthe researchers and the industrial partnerto mutual benefit.' With an eye on the future, the lab is now also working towards thedevelopment of novel materials to enablemore efficient aeroengines to be realised. 'We cover the longer research areathat Rolls-Royce needs,' explained DirectorProfessor Colin leadsthe UTP . 'We've helped to develop newalloys that are currently flying in Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft and now we're developing their successors - thealloys of the future - which will run hotter,stronger, for even longer.'

'In thepast, it's been very difficult to set downdesign rules for fuel injectors because it'sthe details that matter,' ProfessorHochgreb explained. 'This opticallyaccessible rig will now allow us to seewhat effect small geometry changes haveon the flame structure, so that we canmove towards designing cleaner andmore efficient engines from scratch.' Although a new area of research, Professor Hochgreb's work falls under theumbrella of the UGTP . With researchprojects in the Departments Chemical Engineering andApplied Maths, the UGTP's purpose is tocreate an holistic understanding of thelinkages between aerodynamics, noiseand vibration, combustion, heat transferand advanced cycles in turbomachinery. Director of the UGTP , Professor Dame 'The its two-way informationflow and regular contact betweenresearch staff, students and Rolls-Royceengineers - ensures that we address theright problems with the right people, andis both exciting and motivating for staffand students.'

NEWS FROM CAMBRIDGE ENTERPRISE LTD An invention to help repair damaged joints Continuing our series of the stories behind Cambridge innovations - the pathway topatenting - we hear about a spin-out companywhose medical devices are helping the body toheal itself. In 2007, a staggering 2.5 million joint replacement procedures were performed worldwide. Although theseoperations are essential to ease pain and restore mobility,recuperation can be long and painful, and the prostheticjoints have a limited lifespan of no more than 17 years. Foryounger patients, this brings the unwanted prospect offurther painful and expensive revision operations. Treatmentsare needed that can delay or even prevent joint replacement. Research that grew from a PhD project into a spin-out company provides the answer through its line of products forregenerative repair. In 2001, Andrew Lynn embarked on afour-year product and preclinical development programmeunder the supervision of Professor William Bonfield at theCambridge Centre for Medical Materials and funded by theCambridge-MIT Institute. Working in collaboration with ateam of colleagues from Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology and Harvard University, he developed advancedporous materials and structures that mimic important tissuesfound in the body, including those sites with interfaces between bone and soft tissue that are susceptible totraumatic injury. By 2005, it was clear that the research had produced an effective novel solution that could be patent protected.Cambridge Enterprise filed the patent and licensed thetechnology to a newly created company 'Orthomimetics' , andthe following year the company raised over \u00a35 million frominstitutional and private investors. Orthomimetics has subsequently been awarded a further \u00a32.1 million in grant funding to develop its technology andhas made significant progress since its formation; it hopes tobe selling its first product, Chondromimetic, next yearfollowing regulatory approval. The implant works by acting asa tissue regeneration scaffold that supports the body'snatural repair processes and is intended for cartilage repairfollowing sports injuries and other orthopaedic trauma. Byreducing the need for total joint replacement, products suchas these will have a major impact on raising the standard oforthopaedic healthcare worldwide. If you are an employee of the University and would like advice on the patentability and commercialopportunities for your invention, please contact Cambridge Enterprise (email:enquiries@enterprise.cam.ac.uk; Tel: +44 (0)1223760330; www.enterprise.cam.ac.uk).Research Funding Roadshow Cambridge researchers have the chance to meet representatives from the University'smajor funding organisations at a drop-insession.
