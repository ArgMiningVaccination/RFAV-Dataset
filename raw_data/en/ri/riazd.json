Other children who have had COVID-19 have experienced long-term symptoms. \"While most children who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease, some kids have a severe disease such as MIS-C, long-term symptoms consistent with long COVID, or require monitoring by a cardiologist for effects on the heart prior to returning to sports,\" says Megan Freeman, MD, PhD, fellow, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. \"Vaccination can help protect the individual and the community as well.\" For more information about the COVID-19 vaccine, visit [UPMC.com/COVIDVaccine](https://www.upmc.com/covidvaccine).
