The vine grows to 3 to 5 m long, climbing over other plants by means of tendrils which twine round anything they touch. The narrow, heart-shaped The fruit extract is nearly 300 times sweeter than sugar and has been used as a natural sweetener in China for nearly a millennium due to its flavor and lack of food energy, only 2.3 kcal/g (9.6 kJ/g). It has also been used in Additional recommended knowledge Cultivation It is grown primarily in the southwestern Chinese province of Guangxi (mostly in the mountains of Guilin), as well as in Guangdong, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi. These mountains lend the plants shadows and often are surrounded by mists; because of this the plants are protected from the worst of the sun. Nonetheless, the climate in this southern province is warm. The plant is rarely found in the wild and has hence been cultivated for hundreds of years. Records as early as 1813 mention the cultivation of this plant in the Guangxi province. Longjiang town (\"Dragon River\") in Yongfu County has acquired the name \"home of the Chinese luohanguo fruit\"; a number of companies specialised in making luohanguo extracts and finished products have been set up in the area. The Yongfu Pharmaceutical Factory is the oldest of these. Traditional uses The plant is most prized for its sweet fruits, which are used for medicinal purposes, and as a sweetener. The best way to describe the medicinal use of luohan guo in southern China during the 20th century can be found in the book Active agents The sweet taste of luohan guo comes mainly from the mogrosides, a group of Triterpene- Five different mogrosides are known and they are known by names with the numbers 1 to 5. The main mogroside in this plant is mogroside-5, that was previously known as esgoside. Other similar agents in luohan guo are Siamenoside and Neogroside. The pure mogroside mix present results in a sweetness that is 300 times sweeter than sugar. The 80% mix is approximately 250 times sweeter. Pure mogroside-5 and -5 can be up to 400 times as sweet. Toxicity There are no reported incidents of negative side effects of luohan guo that are known. It is classed by the American Current research Recent research on luohan guo suggests that the mogroside works as an The use of luohan guo as a remedy for Luohan guo has been shown to be useful against the The plant also contains a glycoprotein called momorgrosvin, which has been shown to inhibit ribosomal protein synthesis Cultivation and marketing Traditional processing Luohan guo is harvested in the form of a round green fruit, which becomes brown on drying. It is rarely used in its fresh form, as it is hard to store. Furthermore, it develops a rotten taste on fermentation, which adds to the unwanted flavours already present. Thus the fruits are usually dried before further use and are sold in precisely this fashion in The Procter & Gamble process The process for the manufacture of a useful sweetener from luohan guo was patented in 1995 by Procter & Gamble. The patent states that, while luohan guo is very sweet, it has too many interfering aromas, which render it useless for general application. Thus the company developed a process for the removal of the interfering aromas. In this process, the fresh fruit is harvested before it is fully mature, and is then matured in storage so that it may be processed precisely when it is mature. The shell and seeds are then removed, and the pulped fruit is made into a fruit concentrate or puree. This is then used in the further production of food. Solvents are used, amongst other things, to remove the interfering aromas. Products There are a number of commercially prepared luohan guo products: One of the most famous ones is powdered instant luohan guo, which is also sold by the Yongfu company. It is sold in China, Hong Kong and in Chinese shops in the West. In addition, there are a number of other products which contain luohan guo either on its own or in a mix with other herbs. For example it is used with Ginkgo against cough, with chrysanthemum against History During the Tang dynasty, Guilin was one of the most important Buddhist retreats containing many temples. The fruit was named after the arhats (Chinese: ; pinyin: lu\u00f3h\u00e0n), a group of Buddhist monks who, due to their proper way of life and meditation, achieved enlightenment and were said to have been redeemed. According to Chinese history, the fruit was first mentioned in the records of the 13th century monks who used it. However, plantation space was limited: it consisted mainly in the slopes of the Guangxi and Guangdong mountains, and to a lesser degree in Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hainan. This and the difficulty of cultivation meant that the fruit did not become part of the Chinese herbal tradition, which depended on more readily available products. This is also the reason why one finds no mention of it in the traditional guides to herbs. Rediscovery in the 20th century The herb became better known in the 20th century. The first report on the herb in English was found in an unpublished manuscript written in 1938 by Professor G. W. Groff and Hoh Hin Cheung. The report stated that the fruits were often used as the main ingredients of \"cooling drinks,\" that is, as remedies for hot weather, fever, or other dysfunctions traditionally associated with warmth or heat. It was known that the juice of the fruits was very sweet. Groff and Hoh realised that the fruit was an important Chinese domestic remedy for the treatment of cold and pneumonia when consumed with pork. Interviews have confirmed that the fruit only recently gained importance in Chinese history. Nonetheless, it appears that a small group of people had mastered its cultivation a long time ago and had accumulated extensive knowledge on growth, pollination, and climatic requirements of the plant. The fruit came to the United States in the early 20th century. Groff mentions that during a visit to the American ministry of agriculture in 1917, the botanic Frederick Coville showed him a luohanguo fruit bought in a Chinese shop in Washington. Seeds of the fruit which had been bought in Chinese shop in San Francisco were entered into the universal botanic description of the species in 1941. The first research into the sweet component of luohanguo is attributed to C. H. Lee, who wrote an English report on it in 1975, and also to Tsunematsu Takemoto, who worked on it the early 1980s in Japan (later Takemoto decided to concentrate on the similar sweet plant, The development of luohanguo products in China has continued ever since, focusing in particular on the development of concentrated extracts.
