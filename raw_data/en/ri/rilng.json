A child centered approach is the need of the hour to promote universal enrollment and reten tion as there is an emergence of new avenues and an entirely new set of demands are required. It is the time to reform our pedagogies by effecting a shift from learning by rote to improving knowledge retention by advocating practical application as stated in NEP 2020. We must endeavor to effect a decisive shift from education for all to quality edu cation for all. As it is precisely the time to bring reforms in education, everyone must make concerted efforts to redesign curriculum and be more open to work and embrace intuitive teaching techniques that increase student involvement in the learning pro cess. The new learning and teaching practices must excite students and ignite their imagination. The 'Herbal Heritage' is one such effort to make learning fun -filled and enable students know about our spices that have a range of health benefits. The studen ts will strive to gain sufficient knowledge of concepts, language and have the will to innovate! Constructive learning has to be part of the curriculum. Situations and opportunities have to be created for students to provide students with challenges, encou rage creativity and encourage their active participation. I congratulate the Management, Principal, teachers and students of Delhi Public School Kamptee Road, Nagpur who successfully shouldered this responsibility and came up with this brilliant work which will give the student fraternity an opportunity to have fun -filled learning. I am also grateful to Princess Diya Kumari Foundation who mentored the facilitators for producing this phenomenal and astounding work. I would like to advise the students to cont inue to study and learn new skills and be persistent in their pursuit for expansion.

Learning outcome - Students will be able to identify and name the plants according to the category they belong to. Before we proceed to herbs let 's first understand what actually herbs are and why are they called so? We see a huge variety of plants around us. Among which few are terr estrial means that grow on land while those that grow in water are called aquatic plant s. Despite this fact, they all have the same parts and the same functions but still they appear unique with different types of roots, stem s, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds , etc. Therefore, the plants are further classified based on their height, te nderness of stem, branches and life cycle. Let us know in deta il about the classification of plants based on their growing h abits. Before that, let us understand the term Growth Habit. Growth habit mainly refers to the appearance, shape, height, and form of growth of a plant species . A plant's growth habit develops from particular genetic patterns that determine growth. CLASSIFICATION BASED ON GROWTH HABITS If we consider plants based on their height, some are too short while some are too tall to climb. Besides the height, stem thickness and delicacy also varies. For example - Short plants have greenish, soft, and tender stems, while big and tall plants or trees have a thick, strong and woody stem s that are hard to break. Based on the growth hab it, plants are broadly categoriz ed into three groups: HERBS, SHRUBS AND TREES Herbs The herb is a short -sized plant with a soft, g reen, delicate stem without woody tissues. They complete their life cycle within one or two seasons. Generally, they have few branches or are branchless. These can be easil y uprooted from the soil. Herbs contain enough nutritional benefits, including v itamins and minerals, to make them a part of a healthy balanced diet. Tomato, wheat, paddy, grass and banana are a few examples of herbs. Shrubs Shrubs are medium -sized, woody plants taller than herbs and shorter than a tree. Their height usually ranges from 6m to 10m tall. Their features include b ushy, hard, and woody stems with many branches. Although stems are hard, they are flexible but not fragile. The life - span of these plants usually depends on the species. Rose, jasmine lemon, tulsi, and henna are some of the common shrubs around us. Picture Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl/ Picture Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl/ Picture Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl/ Page 7 of 49 Trees Trees are big and tall plants. They have very thick, woody and hard stems called the trunk. This single main stem or the trunk g ives rise to many branches that bear leaves, flowers and fruits. Some trees are branchless like coconut tree; i.e., they have only one main stem which bears leaves, flowers, and fruits all by itself. The lifespan of the trees is very large . i.e. for seve ral years. Banyan, mango, neem, cashew, teak and oak are some examples of trees. In addition to these three categories of plants, there are plants that need some support to grow. They are specifically called climbers and creepers. Climbers Climbers are much more advanced than creepers. Climbers have a very thin, long and weak stem that cannot stand upright, but they can use external support to grow vertically and carry their weight. These types of plants use special structures called tendril s to climb. Some examples of climbers are pea plant, grapevine, sweet gourd, money plant, jasmine, runner beans, green peas, etc. Creepers Creepers, as the name suggests, are plants that creep on the ground. They have a very fragile, long, thin stem that can neither stand erect nor support all their weight. Examples include watermelon, strawberry, pumpkin and sweet potatoes. Are herbs and spices same? What do you think? Herbs are leafy things, like basil, thyme, and cilantro; and spices are seeds, either whole or ground, like coriander and cumin. ACTIVITY Categorize the following name in proper categories of herbs, shrubs, trees, creepers and climbers. Neem tree, lemongrass, cilantro, basil, lemon, mango, pumpkin, bitter gourd, wheat, maize and money plant. List two differences between herbs and shrubs. Give some examples of spices that we often use in our kitchen. 4.

Learning outcomes - Students will know about the various names, origin and importance of Aloe vera . HISTORY The origin and history of Aloe vera from its discovery in ancient times to the present day is a remarkable story and not one that many have heard despite being familiar with Alo e vera. Historically, we may never know when Aloe vera's wellness applications were first discovered as they likely predate written history. We know about it from the 6000 -year-old carvings of the plant discovered in Egypt. Later, it became a common buria l offering or gift to the deceased pharaohs as its remnants are found in the tombs. The first written record of Aloe vera's usage for medicinal purposes appeared in Sumerian hieroglyphic tablets circa 2200 BC during the Mesopotamia civilization which descr ibes it as a laxative. Traditional herbal medicine practitioners and ancient physicians considered it a 'miracle plant' as it has many health benefits. Find out more information about some more 'miracle' plants found in your region. Wonderful!! MORPHOLOGY So, what exactly does Aloe v era look l ike? You might be thinking it looks somewhat grass only. Aloe vera is an arid plant that survives in areas of low natural rainfall. Aloes are perennial succulents or xerophytes; they can adapt to habitats with low or erratic water availability, are characterized by the capacity to store large volumes of water in their tissue. It is a stem less or very short -stemmed plant growing to 60 -100 centimeters (24-39 inches) tall, spreading by offsets . The leaves are thick and fleshy, green t o grey -green, with some varieties showing white flecks on their upper and lower stem surfaces. The margin of the leaf is serrated and has small white teeth. The flowers are produced in summer on a spike up to 90 cm (35 in) tall, each flower being pendulous , with a yellow tubular corolla . Mostly Aloe v era is cultivated in I ndia and China.

It has choline, which transmits nerve impulses in the body and sends signals between the cells. It also contains vitamins A, C and E, which are antioxidants. Antioxidants protect cells against damaging free radicals, molecules that damage the cells and cause heart disease and cancer. Minerals Minerals are vital to humans, and they are found in aloe gel. The gel contains a minimum of nine minerals, which are needed to make enzyme systems and metabolism function properly. Among the important in Aloe Vera are calcium, zinc, selenium and magnesium, all essential for metabolic functions; and chromium, which enhances the insulin that provides cells with energy. It also contains copper, manganese, potassium, and sodium. I am sure all of us have got some kind of injuries when we are asked t o be careful with the germs and infection s. Here comes A loe Vera to your rescue ! HOW DOES ALOE VERA SPEED UP THE HEALING PROCESS ? Aloe vera contains agents known to help inhibit fungi, bacteria, and viruses. It helps speed the healing of wounds, including first- and second -degree burns and also fights bacteria inside wounds. Germany's regulatory agency for herbs - Commission E - approved the use of Aloe vera for the treatment of constipation. Dosages of 50 -200 milligrams of Aloe latex are commonly taken in liquid or capsule form once daily for up to 10 days. Aloe Vera has excellent antioxidant and anti -inflammatory properties. Anti-oxida nts are substances that prevent or slow down the damage caused to cells by free radicals which are normally found in cigarette and air pollution as well. Anti-inflammatory properties hel p to reduce re dness, swelling and pain in the body. Stress and worries leave you constipated and have poor digestive health. Consuming Aloe vera juice may benefit your digestive tract and help to soothe and cure stomach diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A study showed that it significantly improved symptoms of IBS when compared to a placebo. No adverse effects were reported, though more research is needed using a larger study size. Additionally, Aloe vera also stops the growth of bacteria, which is found in your digestive tract and can lead to ulcers. ALOE VERA - A FRIENDLY PLANT Aloe vera is rich in nutrients, enzymes, and antioxidants that offer numerous benefits to us humans when used topically or ingested - including a boost to hydration, digestion, cell regeneration, wound healing, and mor e. Aloe vera can also be used as a 'natural fertilizer' to feed other plants! Page 19 of 49 HOW TO MAKE AN ALOE V ERA SOIL DRENCH ? It's incr edibly simple to make homemade A loe vera fertilizer to use as a soil drench. Essentially, all you have to do is toss some Aloe v era in a blender wit h water! If you're using fresh A loe vera leaves, you don't even need to remove the skin or extract the inner gel. Use about \u00bc cup to \u00bd cup of fresh Aloe vera per gallon of water total . A little goes a long way! Creating a smaller concentrated batch of A loe vera in the blender and then further dilute it before applying it in the garden. So, calculate based on the total volume you plan to make. For e xample, we blend about 2 large A loe vera leaves (or 4 - 5 small leaves) to make a 5-gallon bucket of finished A loe vera fertilizer. Before getting started, keep in mind that i t is best to use homemade Aloe v era fertilizer within 20 minutes of mixing it. Once cut, processed, and exposed to air, fresh Aloe v era quickly ferments and begins to degrade. Cut the A loe vera leaves into several chunks and add them to a blender half-full of water Next, pour the blended A loe vera solution into a larger volume of water to dilute it to the desired concentration. We typ ically add one blender full of A loe into one or two 5 -gallon buckets of water. GLOSSARY 1. latex: a milky fluid found in many plants 2. edible: fit to be eaten 3. anti-inflammatory : the agent that reduces swelling and pain 4. constipation : A condition in which there i s difficulty in emptying bowels 5. anti-bacterial : tend to prevent the growth of bacteria ACTIVITY 1.List some health benefits of Aloe vera. 2.List any two medicinal properties of Aloe vera. 3.Name some vitamins and minerals present in Aloe v era. 4.How does Aloe vera provide relief to the person su ffering from injuries and burns?

Learning outcome - Students will learn how to grow Aloe Vera . Let's start propagating this herb by the steps given below. But wait! WHAT IS PROPAGATION? Propagation is the breeding of a plant by natural processes from the parent stock. How To Grow Aloe Vera at Home - Materials list: an Aloe Vera leaf a clay pot with large holes in it potting soil a watering device (such as a hose) a couple of fragments of broken pottery knife spoon You can gather all these things at a plant nursery and a gardening store. GROWING AND PLANT CARE: 1- Cut the leaf at the base using a sharp, clean knife. Try to cut at a downward angle, towards the stem. The knife must be very clean, or you risk infecting the leaf. 2- Leave the leaf someplace warm, long enough for a film to form over the cut part. This can take as little a few days to as long as two weeks. This film will help keep the cut part from getting infected by the soil. An infected Aloe vera leaf won't survive for very long. 3- Find a pot with a drain hole in the bottom. Like most plants, Aloe Vera likes water, but it hates to sit in it. If your pot does not have a drain hole, the soil will stay soaking wet. This can lead to root rot, which can kill a plant \u2014including the hardy Aloe vera. 4- Fill the pot with cactus soil, and dampen it with water. If you don't have any cactus soil, you can mix your own by mixing one part sand and one part potting soil. 5- Stick the leaf cut-side-down into the soil. Make sure that about one-third of the leaf is in the soil. The bottom leaves of the Aloe plant should rest just above the soil, too. Do not water after planting. 6- Ignore your plant (temporarily) . After you've placed your aloe in its new pot, don't water it for at least a week. This will decrease the chance of inducing rot and give the plant time to put out new roots. Until the plant seems to be rooted and happy, keep it in a warm place that receives bright but indirect light. 7- Give the plant adequate sunlight and warmth. Aloe Vera plants prefer 8 -10 hours of sunlight a day. While they grow best in warm or hot temperatures, they are capable of surviving cooler seasons in a more dormant state. However, they may suffer harm if exposed to temperatures below 25\u00baF ( -4\u00baC). Page 22 of 49 FERTILIZER AND MANURE Any organic manure like farmyard manure is good for this herb. The best fertilizers to use are liquid 10 -40-10 houseplant mixes des igned specifically for succulents. Avoid granular fertilizers. If your aloe is in a container, water it thoroughly the day before feeding. This should flush out any lingering salts and reduce the risk of tip burn. Weeding Weeding is required only in the first plantation year, as unwanted plants keep reducing with each year. Managing Pests and Disease Aloe v era is prone to be attacked by plant pests. Its fleshy thick leaves are a feast for multiple plant pests such as aphids, scale, mealy bugs and mites. How to get rid of a pest infestation ? Aloe v era plants are very sensitive and you should refrain from usin g any pesticides. If your Aloe has a pest problem it is best to use diluted rubbing alcohol. Clean the leaves and the surface area of your plant and repeat it after about two weeks to make sure that any mealy bug , scale, aphid or wh atever pest attacked your Aloe v era plant is completely gone. Even using straight water to wash off your plants is a good way to get rid of unwanted insect infestations. GLOSSARY 1. propagation : the process of increasing the number of plants 2. pest: a destructive insect that attack s crops 3. infestation: the presence of a large number of insects or animals in a place ACTIVITY 1. Grow an Aloe vera plant and record your observations by listing: Date of leaf s own Temperature Irrigation practices Care taken Type of soil used Humidity pH of soil Sunlight duration Manure and fertilizers applied date and quantity Picture Credit: https://www.aloeveraaustralia.com.au Page 23 of 49 Let us Recall A.

Page 24 of 49 CHAPTER 5 : HARVESTING AND POST -HARVESTING Learning objective - Student s will learn techniques to harvest and store Aloe v era. Learning outcome - Students will be able to harvest and store Aloe vera by freezing. HOW TO HARVEST FRESH A LOE V ERA GEL? 1. Trim the Aloe Choose a thick, long leaf from the bottom of the plant. Use a pair of sharp, clean scissors or a sharp knife to cut off the leaf as close to the trunk as possible. 2. Let the Aloe drain Set the cut aloe leaf upright in a small jar or dish, with the cut side down. After a few minutes, you'll see a red or yellowish liquid draining out of the leaf. This is normal, and it is called aloin. This mucilaginous gel can cause stomach pain an d diarrh oea, so give it about 10 -15 minutes to drain out. 3. Harvest the aloe gel Place the drained leaf on a clean cutting surface and carefully slice off the spiked edges with a sharp knife. Use the knife to carefully cut and lift the top of the green part away from the clear aloe flesh. If you have harvested more aloe leaves than you currently need, you can freeze A loe Vera gel to use later. Recently, I had to harvest many leaves from my aloe plant as it was being transplanted to a new pot. Rather than let the bounty of my necessary harvest go to waste, I froze the gel. HOW TO FREEZE ALOE VERA GEL? Once you have sliced your A loe free from the green leaves, add the slabs of clear gel to a blender. A few gentle pulses are all it takes to change the solid aloe gel into a more pourable state. Pour the gel into ice cube trays and place the tray into the f reezer and let it rest until the cubes are solid. SOME COMMON SIDE E FFECTS OF ALOE VERA Aloe vera leaves contain latex, which comes from underneath the plant's skin. Many people are allergic to latex, which can cause stomach issues like irritation, stomach cramps and low potassium levels. Increased amylase. Consuming Aloe vera juice might cause your blood sugar levels to drop. It has laxative effect , which may increase the chances of electrolyte imbala nce in diabetic patients . If you are a diabetic, it is better to consult a doctor before consuming Aloe vera juice. The laxative effects of Aloe vera can lead to dehydration. Laxatives are generally used to alleviate constipation; ho wever, if taken in more quantities than recommended, they may cause dehydration.

But this is no secret, All plants have green leaves! Shapes and sizes may differ, But they are the heart -the live -wire That enhances the whole plant! One thing is certain about a leaf, It can n ever change its colour! Whether a flowering plant or a dense hedge, Or leaves of tall, sturdy trees, Even the leaf of a forest grass; Leaves are ever steady and trustworthy, Never changing their shade, With the blow of the wind! Look at a basil leaf! Is it different from other leaves? Or striking in appearance? Simple and unassuming, In its simplicity lies its beauty, The beauty of the egoless soul Yearning for the union With the divine soul! Holy Basil -Tulasi The plant that grows in abundance, Tiny bell shaped flowers, A profusion of six bells at each point of the stalk, Twelve clusters lining up like a plume, No hues to marvel about, But with its humble nature Makes its presence felt!

TULSI - THE WONDER H ERB The holy basil plant is widely used in Ayurvedic and traditional medicine. Not only this, it is also often used to make herbal tea for a variety of ailments. Tulsi is considered sacred in Hinduism. It is also used as a culinary herb. Some variety is also used in Thai cuisine is referred to as Thai holy basil and is the key herb in Phat kaphrao , a stir -fry dish. Besides these it also used as an insect repellent. For centuries, the dried leaves of t ulsi have been mixed with stored grains to repel insects. The essential oil has nematicidal properties and is also used as a disinfection agent as it has an ability to destroy microorganisms that might carry disease . Essenti al oils and aroma tic chemicals present in tulsi are used in perfumery, cosmetic industries and also in indigenous systems of medicine. Tulsi is also a potent herb that has many health benefits and cures many ailments. There are many diseases that can affect people again after it has left the person. But with the consumption of Tulsi, you can be sure that these diseases cannot affect you. Tulsi has antibiotic and anti-bacterial properties thus tulsi is very b eneficial to treat skin disorders like ringworm, pimples, and itching which are caused either because of bacteria or fungi. So can we say tulsi is not only anti -bacterial but it contains anti -fungal properties. Not only this it is also used to control high blood pressure and cholesterol which are the major causes of heart related problems making it one of the best heart -healthy foods . It improves the digestive system which again helps in proper digestion and absorption of nutrients from the food that we need. Tulsi is also a rich source of vitamin A , C and zinc. It thus acts as a natural immunity booster and keeps i nfections at bay. We can take t ulsi leaves extract to increase WBCs in the blood thus boosting the immune system to fight the diseases. The juice of the Rama t ulsi leaves along with ginger and honey gives relief from cold, fever, asthma and cough. It is also good for diabetes as it regulates high sugar levels in the blood . As it possesses hypoglycaemic properties. It is recommended to include tulsi in your diabetic diet plan. Do you know what is hypoglycemia, it is another name for lower blood sugar level s, so a person who is diabetic means if they have high blood sugar should definitely include tulsi in their diet as it will help them to control the sugar level in their blood. It decreases the level of uric acid in the body, which is the main reason why kidney stones are formed. Reduction i n uric acid levels also provides relief to patients suffering from Gout. Page 36 of 49 Do you know what uric acid is? it is waste that is excreted through our urine. But if our body is producing it in excess, our kidneys won't be able to excrete it and thus it will make stones in the kidney and this also gets deposited in our joint and lead to arthritis. Tulsi has often been used in herbal toothpaste and that is simply because of its amazing teeth and gum strengthening properties. Moreover, it can act on mouth ulcers and therefore provide complete oral health care. Research has also shown that tulsi has several physical and mental health benefits. For instance, consuming a tulsi drink after a tiring day help to relieve stress and fatigue. Similarly, a tulsi drink during prolonge d hours of study can also help to enhance concentration for students. For centuries, dried t ulsi leaves have been mixed with stored grains to repel insects. Apart from simply repelling insects, the extracts of tulsi leaves can also be applied to insect bites and stings to ease the pain. They also reduce swelling or irritation to a great extent. Moreover, daily consumpti on of tulsi also helps to purify the blood. SIGNIFICANCE IN HINDUISM Tulsi has a special place in Ayurveda as well as considered sacred by Hindus and worshipped by them. It is worshipped as the avatar of Lakshmi and may be planted in front yards of Hindu houses or Hanuman temples.

Page 39 of 49 CHAPTER 4 - LET 'S GROW TULSI Learning objective - Students will learn what is propagation and step s to propagate tulsi. Learning outcome - students will learn how to grow tulsi. Tulsi is a demanding plant due to its medicinal properties . The holy b asil crop is planted in the month of April & May and it can be sown by two methods of seeds and plants. Method 1 HOW TO GROW TULSI FROM SEEDS ? 1. Fill a flower pot with high quality soil and water it thoroughly. You should leave about an inch (2.54 cm) of space at the top of the pot. Add enough water to make the soil very moist, but don't add too much water, because you don't want the soil to be soggy. 2. Sow the seeds \u00bc inch (0.64 cm) beneath the soil. Because tulsi seeds are so small simply sprinkle the seeds on top of the soil, then gently press them down into the surface using your fingers or a small tamper. 3. Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate. The seeds will begin to grow in about 1 -2 weeks. Because the seeds are so delicate, try using a spray bottle to mist the surface of the soil. If you are pouring water int o the pot, do so slowly and carefully so you don't disrupt the seeds. Covering the top of the flower pot with plastic wrap will help seal in moisture, but you will still need to check the soil and add more water if needed. 4. Place the tulsi plant near a warm, sunny window. Your plant requires 6 -8 hours of sunlight a day and temperatures of at least 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C). Set the pot in an area where it can receive plenty of indirect sunlight. Be careful not to leave the plant near open windows or doors if the temperature cools down overnight. Method 2 Rooting Tulsi in Water 1. Cut a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) stem from a mature tulsi plant. Remove the stem right below a set of leaves. Pluck all the other leaves from the bottom portion of your cutting. When cutting the stem, be sure to select one that hasn't flowered yet. You can take a cutting from a flowering stem, but it will be more difficult to root and makes it more difficult for the plant. Picture Credit: https://images.app.go Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl Page 40 of 49 2. Place the tulsi cutting in a glass container filled with water. Use a clear drinking glass and fill it with enough water to cover just the bottom half of the stems. You can place more than 1 stem in the container, just be sure it is not overcrowded. Change the water every day so the stems don't rot from an overgrowth of bacteria. 3. Put your tulsi plant in a warm, sunny spot. Choose a windowsill or table that will allow the plant to get at least 6 -8 hours of bright, indirect sunlight. 4. Transfer the cuttings to a pot of soil when the roots begin to grow. Your cutting will be ready to transfer to the soil when its roots are 14- 12 inch (0.64 -1.27 cm) long. It can take between 7 and 10 days to reach this point. Keep the Tulsi in the potting soil for 2 -3 weeks before planting outdoors if you choose to. SOME IMPORTANT CARE TIPS 1. Pinch off the growing tip of your Tulsi if you wish to grow a bushy plant rather than a single stem. 2. Keep removing the new flowering heads, don't let your plant flower early, and delay the Tulsi flowering as much as you can to keep your plant green, leafy & bushy. 3. Always keep the pot aerated by loosening the soil, don't let the soil get all compact & hard. 4. When grown in poor conditions it might be attacked by some common pests like mealy bugs, aphids, spider mites and sometimes whitefli es. For treatin g pests use Neem -based organic pesticide or insecticidal soap. REQUIREMENTS FOR GROWING THE HOLY BASIL Requirements for growing the holy basil are very similar to the sweet basil a lthough, it's just more drought and heat tolerant. Soil Tulsi grows well in loamy and fertile soil with good drainage. It can be planted in slightly acidic, neutral to slightly alkaline soil pH, a level around 6 to 7.5 is optimal. Sun Holy basil thrives in full sun but grows in partial shade too, at least four hours of sun light a day is required for the best growth. Water Water the plant when the top one inch of soil is dry, but in summer, keep the soil slightly moist. Do not water during rain. Reduce watering in the winter to prevent diseases. Picture Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl Picture Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl Page 41 of 49 NUTRIENTS , FERTILIZERS AND M ANURE REQUIRED Feed your basil plants with a good organic fertilizer every four to six weeks for indoor plants and every 2 -3 weeks for outdoor. A well -balanced fertilizer with equal amounts of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate , will help to boost leaf production. Cow dung manure and Epsom salt are the best fertilizer s for the tulsi plant. To make the fertilizer of Epsom salt , mix one tablespoon of Epsom Salt with about 4 liters of water. Spray it on the leaves of the plant once every two weeks . In the c ase of application o n vegetables, sprinkle a tablespoon of Epsom salt around each seedling as soon as they are transplanted to a pot. Rice water can be very beneficial to plants as it adds valuable minerals and nutrients to the soil. It helps increase bacterial growth in soil which increases the nutrient content of the soil. PESTS AND DISEASES The holy basil plant is generally free from pests and diseases. However, when grown in poor conditions, it can be attacked by some common pests like mealy bugs, aphids, spider mites, and sometimes whiteflies. For treatin g pests, use organic pesticide s or insecticidal soap. WEEDING The first weeding is done one month after planting, and the second 4 weeks after the first. After this, no further weeding is required as the plants become bushy, thereby naturally suppressing the weeds.

Page 44 of 49 CHAPTER 4 - HARVESTING and POST -HARVESTING Learning objective - Student s will learn techniques to harvest and store tulsi . Learning outcome - Students will be able to harvest and store tulsi by using the drying method . HARVESTING AND STORING Reap the aromatic leaves of your Tulsi plant throughout the growing season. Once your plant reaches 8 inches in height, take a pair of scissors and, depending on your needs, cut large single leaves or cut the whole branch. Use fresh leaves on the same day you harve st because they fade quickly. The harvested produce may be allowed to wilt in the field itself for 4 -5 hours so as to reduce the moistur e and also the bulkiness. However, oil quality and its yield do not diminish up to 6 -8 hours after harvest, but further delay may cause considerable loss in yield and quality of the oil. POST -HARVEST After harvesting, the drying of leaves is done. Then steam distillation is done to obtain Basil oil. For transportation , it is packed in airtight bags. Leaves should be stored in dry places . Store your holy basil harvest for future use by drying out the leaves in a warm shady place. Collect branches in a bas ket and place them i n a dry place away from sunlight and toss the stem 2 -3 times every day until leaves become crispy and collapse when you crush them . Its seeds are also ed ible and can be stored to add to teas. For transportation , it is packed in airtight bags. Leaves should be stored in dry places. Several products like Panch Tulsi oil, Tulsi Powder, Tulsi Tea and Tulsi Capsules are made after processing. Picture Credit: https://images.app.goo.gl Picture n.in Page 45 of 49 WARNING Do not wash your holy basil after harvesting. The herb will start to rot if you get it wet. If your holy basil plants need to be washed, then do it one or two days before cutting while the sprigs are still on the plant in the garden. This will give the holy basil time to naturally dry off before harvest. HOW TO CONSUME TULSI? Tulsi is co mmonly consumed in herbal teas and masala chai. You can also add it to soups and smoothies .
