This may be partially due to hormonal changes and resulting bothersome symptoms such as hot flashes and disrupted sleep. In addition, family and personal issues such as the demands of teenage children, children leaving home, aging parents, midlife spouses, and career changes often converge on women during these years. Chronic stress is not good for anyone's health. It may cause increased blood pressure and heart rate, headaches, gastric reflux, [depression/anxiety](/for-women/menopauseflashes/mental-health-at-menopause/depression-menopause), and, over the long term, an increased risk for heart disease. Some believe that chronic stress may affect our immune system, making us more susceptible to illness, infections, and even cancer. Stress affects not only our health but also our relationships, work performance, general sense of well-being, and quality of life. What can I do to reduce stress? There are many tried-and-true ways to reduce stress and maintain calm: - Exercise. Walk with a friend, join a yoga class, bike, hike\u2014whatever you enjoy, exercise is a great way to reduce stress and stay healthy. - Talk. Share your concerns with a family member, good friend, healthcare professional, or counselor. - Eat well. Although eating chocolate may soothe stress in the short run, overindulgence leads to its own set of problems! A healthier strategy is to eat three nutritious meals daily, with healthy snacks, including fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, and yogurt. - Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Herbal tea (iced, if hot flashes are bothersome) provides a soothing alternative to caffeinated drinks (caffeine elevates levels of cortisol, the \"stress\" hormone). Although alcohol may make you feel relaxed and drowsy, it has actually been shown to interfere with sleep quality. And, the potential for alcohol abuse and other health risks makes it a poor option for stress reduction. - Sleep. Adequate sleep is necessary for alert functioning during the waking hours. Most adults require between 6 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Try to determine your sleep needs and then get as much as you need. - Relax. Participate in a \"mind-body\" program (if available in your community), or practice deep breathing, positive thinking, hypnosis, and meditation through books and CDs. - Pamper. Treat yourself to a massage, manicure, or soothing bath. Enjoy a good book, music, or a favorite hobby. Find a creative outlet by enrolling in an art or music program. - Enjoy. And don't forget to laugh and smile at every opportunity! Breathing techniques Another effective method is to use deep-breathing exercises to reduce stress. Try this simple exercise and practice often: - Sit in a straight-back chair with both feet on the floor. - Rest hands on the abdomen. - Slowly count to four while inhaling through the nose and feel the abdomen rise. - Hold that breath for a second. - Then, slowly count to four while exhaling through the mouth\u2014let the abdomen slowly fall. - Repeat this exercise 5 to 10 times. Guided imagery & meditation Finally, we all know that vacations reduce stress, but what can you do if currently there's no extra time or money? Try a brief mental vacation using \"guided imagery\" to achieve a state of deep relaxation. Close your eyes and visualize a scene from your memory that brings joy. Try to get lost in that event or image for several minutes, allowing your mind to return to that pleasurable experience. "}
