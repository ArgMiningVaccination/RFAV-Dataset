Deputy Manager, Global Regulatory Affairs, Emami Limited, chandramohannandi@yahoo.in Abstract Human beings especially womans are obsessed with looking beautiful. Hence, various beauty products have been in use to look charming and young. Herbal ingredients are popular worldwide for use in cosmetics.The word cosmetic was obtained from \"Kosmtikos,\" a Greek word, means having the influence, arrange, and ability in decorating The demand for herbal cosmetic is growing in the world market and is a valuable gift of nature. Herbal cosmetics are formulated using different herbal active ingredients, which are further incorporated in cosmetic bases to nourish and cure various skin ailments. Herbal cosmetics are natural and are found to be safe to use as compared to chemical-based cosmetics. Herbal formulations have always attracted considerable attention because they are free from all the harmful synthetic chemicals which otherwise may prove to be toxic to the skin. The bioactive ingredients from plants include antioxidants, vitamins, essential oils, tannins, alkaloids, dyes, carbohydrates, and terpenoids, which are used as cosmetics for care of skin, body, and its other parts. Cosmetics based on herbal ingredients possess desirable physiological activity such as smoothing appearance, healing, enhancing, and conditioning properties. Various herbal active ingredients which are particularly used for skincare are being discussed in this article. Introduction Herbal cosmetics are the composition incorporating phytochemicals from various botanical sources, impacting the skin functions, and allocate nutrients which are beneficial for the healthy and glowing skin or hairs. These phytochemicals of various sources have dual functions, they can be utilized as a cosmetic product for the skincare purpose, and the botanical components imparting biological activity to the skin and furnish nutrients beneficial for the nourished skin or hair. Anatomy of Skin : The skin is the largest organ of the body. It has three main layers, the epidermis, the dermis and the subcutaneous layer. The epidermis is an elastic layer on the outside that is continually being regenerated. It includes the following: Keratinocytes - the main cells of the epidermis formed by cell division at its base. New cells continually move towards the surface. As they move they gradually die and become flattened. Corneocytes - the flattened dead keratinocytes that together make up the very outer layer of the epidermis is called the stratum corneum or horny layer. This protective layer is continually worn away or shed. Melanocytes - produce the pigment melanin that protects against UV radiation and gives skin its colour. The dermis is the inner layer that includes the following: Sweat glands - produce sweat that travels via sweat ducts to openings in the epidermis called pores. They play a role in temperature regulation. Hair follicles - are pits in which hairs grow. Hairs also play a role in temperature regulation. Sebaceous glands - produce sebum (an oil) to keep hairs free from dust and bacteria. Sebum and sweat make up the 'surface film'. The subcutaneous layer under the dermis is made up of connective tissue and fat (a good insulator). Natural Ingredients in Cosmetics : Skin constitutes the largest living organ that protects the body from the external environment, helping to regulate temperature and fluid balance, keeping out harmful microbes and chemicals and offering some protection against sunlight. The outermost layer of the skin is the stratum corneum, a selectively permeable, heterogeneous layer of the epidermis, which protects against desiccation and environmental challenge and retains sufficient water to allow it to function. Impairment in skin barrier function is often demonstrated by an altered integrity of the stratum corneum, with a consequent increase in transepidermal water loss and decrease in skin hydration. The term \"natural\" is defined as something or an ingredient that is produced by the nature or found in nature and is directly extracted from plants or animal products. Sources of natural ingredients can include herbs, fruits, flowers, leaves, minerals, water and land . The effect of natural ingredients in skin care products depends on their in vitro and in vivo efficacy and the type of dermatological base where they are incorporated. Benefits of Plant Extracts: The use of bioactive extracts or phytochemicals from a variety of botanicals in cosmetics accomplishes two functions: care of the body and as ingredients to influence the biological functions of the skin, providing the nutrients for healthy skin. According to their composition, these extracts can provide different properties: A) Antioxidant activity : The oxidative stress is one of the major mechanisms for skin aging and dermatological conditions. Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight is the most common exogenous factor harmful to the skin. The continuous exposure to environmental factors leads to alterations in the connective tissue due to the formation of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as enzymes action, which results in several skin disorders. Free radical formation is naturally controlled by various beneficial compounds known as antioxidants. These are radical scavengers providing protection to the human body by inhibition of various oxidizing chain reactions. ROS generated exogenously react with various biomolecules present in the skin and play an important role in skin disorders. Phenolic compounds are bioactive substances widely distributed in plants, being important constituents of the human diet. Plant phenolics comprise a great diversity of compounds, such as flavonoids (anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, etc.) and acids, lignins, stilbenes). Natural antioxidants are effective in preventing free radical formation by scavenging them or promoting their decomposition and suppressing disorders. B) Tyrosinase Inhibition Effect : Melanin is a human pigment responsible for the colour of eyes, hair and skin. It is produced and secreted, through a physiological process called melanogenesis, by the melanocytes, which are distributed in the basal layer of the dermis. There are two types of melanin pigments produced by the melanocytes: eumelanin, black or brown, and pheomelanin, red or yellow. The colour of human skin and hair is determined by the type and distribution of melanin pigment. Upon exposure of the skin to sun radiation, melanogenesisis enhanced by the activation of thyrosinase, a melanogenesis key enzyme. Tyrosinase, a polyphenol the oxidation of L-tyrosine to L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) (first reaction) and the oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone (second reaction). Then, dopaquinone, through a non-enzyme-catalysed process, is transformed into leukodopachrome (third reaction). This compound is oxidized into dopachrome (fourth reaction), which is an extremely fast and non-enzyme-catalyzed process. Then, dopachromeis transformed to melanin through a series of chemical- and enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Thus, the referred process shows that dopachrome synthesis can be suppressed when any of the steps are inhibited. Melanin protects the skin against UV light damage by absorbing UV sunlight and removing the reactive oxygen species. Ingredients A to Z of Skin Care Products Avocado Oil : Avocado oil is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, D, and E. In addition to vitamin E, avocado oil contains potassium, lecithin, and many other nutrients that can nourish and moisturize the skin.The outermost layer of skin, known as the epidermis, easily absorbs these nutrients, which also help to form new skin.The antioxidants in avocado oil may help to ease the symptoms of a sunburn.

No changes in pH and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging activity were observed after a 6 months storage period at 20 \u00b0C and in vivo moisturizing effect was demonstrated that, lasted at least 4 h after products application. The safety and stability of this formulation for topical use was verified. It could be relevant in the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-mediated diseases and photo-ageing.
