Black, of- fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Righteous God, refresh our law- makers as a river in the desert and as the cool shadows of large trees in a hot and weary land. May our Senators find in You a hope that illuminates the paths they travel as You guide them with Your great love. Lord, fill them with such wisdom that they will solve our Nation's most challenging problems, making the rough places smooth and the crooked places straight. Deal favorably with them because of Your great love and mercy. Inspire them to live lives that will permit You to bless our Nation and world. We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen. f PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R OM- NEY). The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f USDA RULEMAKING REVISIONS Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to tell my colleagues about a dis-appointment I have in some U.S. De-partment of Agriculture recent revi-sions of a proposed rule. Here is the background: I have long fought to strengthen the safety net so that Iowa family farmers and other farmers are protected from natural dis-asters or other unforeseen events that they have no control over, like flooding or wind storms. Family farmers work hard to make sure that Americans have food on the table. These same family farmers oper-ate on very thin margins. These farm-ers ought to qualify for help during tough times since losing these oper-ations would risk our Nation's food supply. However, taxpayers and nonfarm State lawmakers may stop supporting a Federal farm safety net if spending programs aren't held accountable or left unchecked. Losing urban support for this farm safety net is why I am deeply concerned about the USDA's re-cent proposal to roll back rules that put teeth in the definition of a legal term called ''actively engaged in farm-ing.'' Long-lost relatives, by changing these rules, who have probably never lifted a finger on the farm should not get away with collecting farm pay-ments. Farm payments should only go to operators that\u2014and I have a defini- tion that is a little facetious but some-what realistic\u2014unless they have dirt under their fingernails. A few weeks ago, I recently com- plimented Secretary Perdue on what I thought were very strong rules that were being proposed at that time. Now the USDA's decision to backtrack on their rules means more megafarmers will take advantage of this loophole and people who aren't actively engaged in farming will benefit from farm pay-ments. I am disappointed with this turnaround. Once again, Congress must do what it can to oppose these loopholes so that we have only family farmers benefiting from the farm program. I yield the floor. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma- jority leader is recognized. f CORONAVIRUS Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, when I opened the Senate on Monday, I repeated something Republicans have stated for months now. We need to put partisanship aside and get more bipar-tisan, targeted coronavirus relief out to the American people. Dating back to the summer, and all fall, Senate Republicans tried repeat-edly to advance hundreds of billions of dollars to prevent layoffs, protect small businesses, fund vaccine distribu-tion, and continue assisting workers who have already lost their jobs due to the crisis. Every time, the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader blocked our efforts. It had to be the en-tirety of their leftwing wish list or nothing at all. Finally, this week, we are seeing cracks starting to form in the Demo-cratic leaders' stone wall, and thank goodness for the country that that is finally happening. In the last several days, the Democratic leaders have sig-naled a new willingness to engage in good faith and, yesterday, a number of Senate Democrats proposed a different compromise. But at the risk of repeating some- thing we all know, making law will not just require the Senate's approval but also the signature of the President of the United States. So, after several conversations with the Secretary of the Treasury and the White House Chief of Staff, I put for-ward yesterday another proposal re-flecting what the President is ready to sign into law. What we have proposed would give universities and nonprofits the legal certainty they need. It would create a second draw on the job-saving Paycheck Protection Program to pre-vent more layoffs, and it would extend VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, SENATE S7144 December 2, 2020 two important emergency unemploy- ment benefit programs that were cre-ated by the CARES Act and which will expire in December without action. These programs have been championed by our Democratic colleagues, particu-larly the senior Senator from Virginia, and we made sure they were included in the framework. I hope our Democratic colleagues will finally let Congress pass a bipar-tisan bill that the President will likely sign into law and do so soon. f TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER Mr. M CCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi- dent, on a completely different matter, the Senate revolves around people. The body consists of 100 individuals. One of our key duties concerns the per-sonnel whom we examine and confirm, and there are all these dedicated staff professionals who make this place go. Today, it is both my great honor and regrettable task to honor someone who secured all three parts of that senato-rial triple crown: the senior Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, L AMAR ALEX- ANDER . LAMAR first set foot here as a tal- ented young staffer. Decades later, he appeared before us as a supersuccessful former Governor and university presi-dent with a nomination to the Cabinet. And for the past 18 years, the other 99 of us have gotten to serve alongside one of the most impactful Senators in modern American history. I have known L AMAR for more than 50 years. We first met in 1969, when I was working for a freshman Senator named Marlow Cook and he worked down in the executive branch. We met at the suggestion of his previous boss and mentor, Senator Howard Baker. Either he suspected our paths might cross again later or he just saw two serious young guys in need of some livelier so-cial lives. Now, this may shock the Presiding Officer, but I am afraid young L AMAR ALEXANDER and young MITCH MCCONNELL did not exactly go crazy and paint the town red. But I will take a five-decade friendship any day. Both of us headed back home to con- tinue our careers. It was already clear that a bright future in elected office likely lay in store for him. L AMAR 's reverence for public service started early. I believe he was about 10 years old when his father, himself a longtime local official, took him to meet his hometown Congressman, How-ard Baker, Sr. The father of his future boss shook the boy's hand and handed him a dime. I think L AMAR was hooked, then and there. Decades later, when L AMAR an- nounced his 1996 Presidential run, he was in his hometown of Maryville. His speech began with a story about his mother. She had read where he had lov-ingly described his upbringing as lower middle class, and she had taken um-brage to that. After all, L AMAR had a library card and music lessons. In her words, ''everything you needed that was important.'' And I would certainly add loving par- ents to that list. This son of two educators grew up steeped in the importance of schooling. He would later reference his mother's work in early childhood education by saying he is probably the only Sec-retary of Education in history\u2014in his-tory\u2014who spent 5 years in kinder-garten. That passion would remain through- out L AMAR 's career. His cutting-edge focus on improving opportunities and reforming education benefited Ten-nessee hugely in the 1980s, and our whole Nation during his time in Presi-dent Bush 41's Cabinet. But that isn't the only way L AMAR has honored his roots. You couldn't walk across the entire State of Ten-nessee in a plaid shirt, get elected Gov-ernor before the age of 40, and serve more combined years as Governor and Senator than anyone else in the his-tory of the Volunteer State without be-coming entirely intertwined with the place. Every corner of the State is bet-ter for his service. His groundbreaking work to bring home good-paying auto jobs has paid dividends, so has his major focus on infrastructure and bet-ter roads. But alas, even building a statewide and then national reputation does not always, always, translate into honest- to-goodness celebrity status. I understand that following L AMAR 's Governorship, a stretch of highway in Maryville was fittingly named the Lamar Alexander Parkway to honor him. I further understand that some-time later, L AMAR was driving on that very road and stopped for breakfast. When it was time to pay for his food, he handed over his credit card. The woman on the other side of the counter glanced at the name on the card, and then back at L AMAR . ''Hey,'' she said, ''were you named after this road?'' Now, as a man of faith, I am certain LAMAR knows Luke, chapter 4: ''No prophet is accepted in his hometown.'' Apparently, neither are statesmen to be recognized on their own highway. Here in the Senate, too, L AMAR 's im- pact has been massive, and the convic-tions that fueled it have been straight-forward. He starts with a very firm framework: the right-of-center prin-ciples that Ronald Reagan used to re-build a confident, prosperous America and beat communism. The Federal Government isn't meant to take over our States, neighborhoods, or our lives. But L AMAR 's career has also confirmed that conservative governance is not a contradiction in terms. There are gen-uine public goods it is the govern-ment's job to secure: public roads, pub-lic lands, public education, certain as-pects of public health. He has dedicated himself to making those things better and stronger, especially for those who need opportunity the most. This vision aligns with the greatest traditions of the Republican Party and indeed of American history\u2014govern- ment that is limited but effective and smart; a system where power stays close to the people and working fami-lies can thrive and prosper. These prin-ciples made our colleague a nationally known leader long before he was sworn in as a Senator. But I would say they have reached full flourishing with Chairman A LEXANDER 's astonishingly effective leadership right here in this body. Students, families, and teachers ben- efit every day from the Every Student Succeeds Act, Chairman A LEXANDER 's historic, bipartisan makeover fol-lowing No Child Left Behind. One re-port called it ''the largest devolution of federal control to the states in a quar-ter century.'' Millions of medically vulnerable Americans also have their champion in our friend from Tennessee. The over-whelmingly bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act was the single most impor-tant law of the entire 114th Congress. It is paving the way for more innovation and faster innovation to benefit pa-tients who have no time to waste\u2014an-other L AMAR ALEXANDER production. His leadership was instrumental in the landmark legislation we passed 2 years ago to combat the opioid epi-demic. Just this year, he was the driving force behind the Great American Out-doors Act, the Senate's historic project to secure our parks and public lands for generations to come. The list doesn't end there. There have been other education wins, like permanent funding for historically Black colleges and universities and simplifying the student loan process. There have been laws like the Music Modernization Act, which L AMAR ham- mered out with our former colleague, Senator Hatch\u2014a legislative duet from two musical virtuosos in their own rights. Senator A LEXANDER knows about 50 different issues as well as most Sen-ators know 3 or 4. He is hands down one of the most brilliant, most thoughtful, and most effective legislators any of us have ever seen. He likes to say this about the Senate: ''It's hard to get here; it's hard to stay here; so while you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something.'' Well, mission accomplished\u2014and then some. If you reviewed Senator A LEXANDER 's resume and results without knowing the man, you might suspect he arrived as an established hotshot and threw his weight around. But even as L AMAR has mastered the levers of power here, his character has never been captured by Washington. L AMAR has remained clear that he has just been on loan from Ten-nessee the whole time. So we have had more than just a master legislator to call upon; we have been blessed with a sober, honest, and deliberate statesman\u2014someone who cares as much about preserving this in-stitution as the near-term results he can wring out of it. VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, \u2014 SENATE S7145 December 2, 2020 From daily conversations to com- mittee business, to the most dramatic moments on the floor, whether in the minority or the majority, L AMAR has taken pains to treat his colleagues ex-actly as he would hope to be treated in their shoes. He has worked to build consensus in a consensus-based body. He has cherished and defended the Sen-ate the Framers designed. It is no exaggeration to say L AMAR ALEXANDER is one of the most brilliant people I have met in my life. His mind is a steel trap. I understand he likes to keep his staff experts locked around a conference table for long sessions, turning a complex issue over and over until they have arrived at the best path forward for the country and the most precise, concise way to commu-nicate it. He has a mastery of policy, mastery of the English language, and I can't forget to mention my friend's good cheer. L AMAR really does live by the motto he inherited from his good friend and fellow Tennesseean, the late author Alex Haley: ''Find the good and praise it.'' I myself have leaned on L AMAR 's wis- dom for many years, but I think I have learned just as much from his opti-mism, his can-do spirit, and his ability to look on the bright side and then dis-cern how some more hard work can make it brighter still. So I am going to miss our regular dinners, even with our weeknight scheduling and official one- drink limit. Like I said, we weren't ex-actly party animals in our twenties ei-ther. But here is something else that never changes: How reassuring it is to be weighing a thorny question and see L AMAR ALEXANDER seated across the table. You know, the Senate can be all- consuming. It is not only our col-leagues but their spouses and loved ones who all get folded into the ex-tended family around here. So I am ex-tremely grateful that it turned out that M ITCH MCCONNELL was not the most important young person L AMAR ALEXANDER met during his stint in Washington\u2014not by a mile. Honey Alexander is a remarkable woman. She is a force of nature and in-credible partner for L AMAR . She raised a young family in the Governor's man-sion for 8 years. She charmed and im-pressed more voters during L AMAR 's various campaigns than L AMAR him- self, and she has devoted her own ca-reer to public health and philanthropy. Their shared love and mutual respect inspire everyone. Honey is just about the finest ''in-law'' the U.S. Senate could have ever had, so Elaine and I are grateful to call her our friend as well. So as much as I am dreading life in the Senate without my brilliant friend, even I can't begrudge him the silver lining. The most distinguished public servant has more than earned the right to spend more days fly-fishing or walk-ing trails in the Smokies, more morn-ings waking up on Blackberry Farm, and a much larger share of his time with Honey and their family. About 6 years ago, it fell to L AMAR to eulogize his friend and mentor, Howard Baker. Here on the floor, he quoted an-other Senator who had said that when it came to the Senate, there was How-ard Baker, and then there was the rest of us. Well, my friend, for 18 years, there has been L AMAR ALEXANDER , and there has been the rest of us. So I am sorry that in a few more weeks, it will be just the rest of us left. But you are leaving this body and those of us in it and the Nation it exists to serve stronger and better because you were here. f NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA- TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay before the Senate the House mes-sage accompanying H.R. 6395. The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives: Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives (H.R. 6395) entitled ''An Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for military activities of the Depart-ment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.'', do pass with an amendment. COMPOUND MOTION Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, agree to the request of the House for conference, and appoint the following conferees on the part of the Senate, the list of whom is at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES The following conferees were ap- pointed: James M. Inhofe, of Oklahoma, Chairman; Roger F. Wicker, of Mississippi; Deb Fischer, of Nebraska; Tom Cotton, of Arkansas; Mike Rounds, of South Dakota; Joni Ernst, of Iowa; Thom Tillis, of North Carolina; Dan Sullivan, of Alaska; David Perdue, of Geor-gia; Kevin Cramer, of North Dakota; John Thune, of South Dakota; Rick Scott, of Flor-ida; Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee; Josh Hawley, of Missouri; Jack Reed, of Rhode Is-land; Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire; Kirsten E.

King, Jr., of Maine; Martin Hein-rich, of New Mexico; Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts; Gary C. Peters, of Michigan; Joe Manchin III, of West Virginia; Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois; Doug Jones, of Ala-bama. f RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. f TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me add my words of fond farewell to my friend L AMAR ALEXANDER and the touching moment between the leader and the senior Senator from Tennessee, which is moving to all of us. Now, Senator A LEXANDER and I have not always agreed, but what an amaz-ing and capable legislator and true statesman he has been. He has been in the middle of things for much of his 18 years in the Senate. That is because he is not some ideologue who stood alone in his corner. It is because he is some-one who has been always willing and insistent on reaching across the aisle, on hearing another Senator's perspec-tive, and on searching for common ground, however narrow it may be. He searches to do the right thing. I remember when we did the immi- gration bill. There was a lot of pressure on Senator A LEXANDER to vote against it, and I watched him wrestle with it and churn and churn, and I sort of knew in my heart he would do the right thing, in my judgment, and vote for that bill, as he did, at some real po-litical consequence to himself. And that is who he was and is\u2014a man of principle. We often would talk in the Senate gym almost every morning for a pro-longed period of time\u2014I don't go to the Senate gym post-COVID\u2014and more often than not, we found each other on opposite sides of the Senate gym. We helped open up the amendment process on childcare legislation. Together, we led the Rules Committee for a number of years, and we come from very dif-ferent backgrounds. But I will never forget the weekend that Iris and I spent with Honey and L AMAR at Black- berry Farms, and it was a beautiful weekend for us that we will always, al-ways cherish and remember. Given the opportunity to put a stamp on the Presidential inauguration, L AMAR and I said whoever is in the ma- jority\u2014we didn't know\u2014we would give each other time to speak, and it served us both well. This is the kind of person he has been: someone who is willing to reach out; someone who is willing to see the other side; and someone, above all, in tumultuous and very difficult times for all of us, who is a man of principle and conscience. Senator A LEXANDER will leave this Chamber with a legacy that every Sen-ator would be proud of. I wish him and his family the very best. f TRIBUTE TO MARK KELLY Mr. SCHUMER. Now a few other re- marks. We have a going and we have a coming, and our coming is of a new Senator who will be installed today, and that is CAPT Mark Kelly, who will be sworn in as the next Senator from Arizona. It may not be the role he expected for himself earlier in his life as a U.S. Navy captain and then an astronaut aboard the International Space Sta-tion. As Mark likes to say, his wife Gabby was already the member of the family in Congress. But tragedy upend-ed both their lives and changed so VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, \u2014 SENATE S7146 December 2, 2020 many of their plans. Everyone con- tinues to be inspired by Gabby's recov-ery, by Mark's devotion, and by the courage it took for their family to re-enter public life and public service. But that is who Mark Kelly is\u2014a devoted and honorable man\u2014and we are de-lighted to welcome him to the Senate Democratic caucus and the wider Sen-ate family. So a fond adieu to my friend L AMAR , and a fond welcome to my new friend Mark Kelly. I have some more remarks on the topics, but I think I will defer those, with unanimous consent that I could talk about those later, so we can get right to Senator A LEXANDER 's remarks at the 10:30 scheduled time. f RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRUZ). Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. f CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed. f EXECUTIVE SESSION EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomina-tion, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Kyle Hauptman, of Maine, to be a Member of the National Credit Union Administra-tion Board for a term expiring August 2, 2025. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Tennessee. FAREWELL TO THE SENATE Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my friend Mitch, and I thank my friend Chuck for their remarks. I will have more to say to them later. On March 9, 1967, Senator Howard H. Baker, Jr., the newly elected Senator from Tennessee, made his maiden ad-dress, his first speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. He spoke for too long. The Republican leader of the Senate, who was also Baker's father-in-law, Senator Everett M. Dirksen, walked over to congratulate him and then said, ''Howard, occasionally, you might enjoy the luxury of an unexpressed thought,'' which is good advice for a farewell address as well. As Senator Baker's legislative assist- ant, I was also his speech writer for that maiden address, or at least I thought I was. He had developed a bad habit of not saying what I wrote for his speech. So I asked to see him, and I said: Do we have a problem with our re-lationship? He said: No, we have a perfect rela- tionship. You write what you want to write, and I will say what I want to say. I learned a couple of other things about ''saying what I want to say.'' One came from Alex Haley, the author of ''Roots,'' who heard me speak once and called me aside afterward and said: May I make a suggestion? He said: If, when you begin a speech, you would start by saying, ''Instead of making a speech, let me tell you a story,'' some-one might actually listen to what you have to say. And then, from David Broder, who gave this advice to Ruth Marcus when she got her column for the Washington Post: one idea per column. So here is a story about my one idea for this speech. In August of 1968, Senator Baker was in the Republican leader's office, where Senator M CCONNELL is today. He over- heard this conversation. Senator Dirk-sen was saying: [No,] Mr. President, I cannot come down and have a drink with you tonight. I did that last night and Louella is very unhappy with me. About 30 minutes later, there was a commotion out in the hall, and in the door of the Republican leader's office came two beagles, three Secret Service men, and the President of the United States. And Lyndon Johnson said to Everett Dirksen: ''Everett, if you won't come down and have a drink with me, I'm here to have one with you.'' And they disappeared into the back room. Later that same year, around a long table, in that same office, the Demo-cratic President and the Republican leader worked out the Civil Rights Act of 1968. It took 67 votes to break a fili-buster, but when the bill passed and Johnson signed it, the Senators who voted no went home and said: It is the law. We have to accept it. And it still is today, along with many other civil rights laws. So that is the one idea I have for this speech. Our country needs a U.S. Sen-ate to work across party lines to force broad agreements on hard issues, cre-ating laws that most of us have voted for and that a diverse country will ac-cept. In the 1930s, we needed a Senate to create Social Security; after World War II, the United Nations; in the 1960s, Medicare; in 1978, to ratify the Panama Canal Treaty; in 2013, more re-cently, to tie interest rates for student loans to the market rates, saving stu-dent borrowers hundreds of billions of dollars in the last several years; in 2015, to fix No Child Left Behind. That bill had 100 alligators in the swamp. The Wall Street Journal said, when we finished, that it was the larg-est evolution of power from Wash-ington to the States in 25 years. When President Obama signed it, he said it was ''a Christmas miracle'' because, in the end, 85 Senators voted for it. In 2016, as Senator M CCONNELL men- tioned, there was the 21st Century Cures Act, moving medical miracles faster to patients and into doctors' of-fices. That bill ran off the track every 2 or 3 days. On one of those days, I called the Vice President, Joe Biden. I said: Joe, I am stuck in the White House. I have the President's personal-ized medicine in this. I have your Can-cer MoonShot. Senator M CCONNELL 's regenerative medical proposal is in it. Speaker Ryan has worked out a way to pay for it. But I can't get the White House to move. I feel like the butler standing outside the Oval Office with a silver platter, and nobody will open the door and take the order. And Joe Biden said: If you want to feel like the butler, try being Vice President. Well, in the next few weeks, the Sen- ate rules literally forced us to come to an agreement, and, in the end, we al-most all voted for it. Senator M CCON- NELL said then, as he said today, it was ''the most important legislation'' of that Congress. And, today, it is helping to create vaccines and treatments in record time. Then, in 2018, there was a once-in-a-generation change in the copyright laws to help songwriters be fairly paid; this year, the Great Amer-ican Outdoors Act. Everyone agrees that it is the most important outdoor and environmental bill in 50 years. All of that took a long time, a lot of palavering, many amendments, many years. Too many years, civil rights ad-vocates, students, patients, song-writers, and conservationists would say. But the point was that those bills didn't just pass. They passed by big margins. The country accepted them, and they are going to be there for a long time, and most of them were en-acted during divided government, when the Presidency and at least one body of Congress was of different political par-ties. That offers an opportunity to share the responsibility or the blame for doing hard things, like controlling the Federal debt. That is why our country needs a U.S. Senate, to thoughtfully and carefully and intentionally put country before partisanship and per-sonal politics, to force broad agree-ments on controversial issues that be-come laws that most of us will vote for and that a diverse country will accept. Nearly 60 years ago, I had traveled from my home in the mountains of Tennessee to New York University's Law School in Manhattan, on Wash-ington Square. It was my first trip ever to New York City, and I had asked for a roommate whose background was as different from mine as possible. One of those roommates turned out to be a tall skinny guy from New Jersey. When I would go to his home in New Jersey and spend the night\u2014his mother was a seamstress and his dad was a con-tractor; they were Italian immi-grants\u2014his mother would become so concerned about my frayed collar on my one white dress shirt that she would turn it while I slept. Years later, that roommate, Paul Tagliabue, invited me to go to the Italian American Dinner here in Wash-ington. They were bursting with pride VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, SENATE S7147 December 2, 2020 for the Italian-American heritage at that dinner: cheers for Scalia, the Jus-tice, and for Pelosi, the Congressman, and for Stallone, the actor, and for Tagliabue, the National Football League Commissioner. But what struck me was, as proud as they all were of their Italian heritage, they were most proud to say: We are all Americans. Ken Burns, whose films tell the story of who we are, reminds us that the late Arthur Schlesinger once wrote that our country needs less ''pluribus'' and more ''unum,'' and the fact that we have at-tracted people from everywhere in the world has made our country richer and stronger, but it is more important and a greater achievement that we have combined all of that diversity into one country. That is why the motto above the Presiding Officer's desk is not one word\u2014''pluribus.'' It is ''e pluribus unum''\u2014out of many, one. More than ever, our country needs a United States to turn ''pluribus'' into ''unum,'' to lead the American struggle to forge unity from diversity. Now, some advocate operating the Senate in a different way: End the fili-buster\u2014the Senate's best-known tradi-tion. In the movie S MITH Goes to Washington,'' he calls it ''the right to talk your head off.'' They say: Don't worry about party lines. Pass every-thing with a majority vote. Presidents would like that. They have said so. They would get their way more easily if we allow the passions to roar through the Senate like they roar through the House of Representatives. So if the Democrats are in charge, we could abolish every right-to-work law, repeal all limits on abortion, and pass restrictions on guns. That is very ap-pealing for the moment, but what about if the train roars in the other di-rection and Republicans say: Let's im-pose a right-to-work law on every State and pro-life laws and gun rights laws. Is such back and forth and back and forth what we really want as a coun-try? The Framers didn't think so. They created this cooling saucer for those passions that Washington talked about, and the filibuster\u2014''the right to talk your head off''\u2014is the preeminent tool we use to force broad agreements on tough issues that most of us will vote for and that the country could live with. Alexis de Tocqueville, the remark- able young Frenchman who wandered through our country in 1831 and 1832 and who wrote the best book yet on de-mocracy in America, saw two great dangers for our future: One, Russia; and, two, the tyranny of the majority. Ending the filibuster will destroy the impetus for forcing the broad agree-ments I have been talking about, and it would unleash the tyranny of the ma-jority to steamroll the rights of the minority. Well, you may say that the Senate isn't solving some big problems, and you would be right. We are not even voting on some big problems. Some-times it is because the majority doesn't bring it up, and sometimes the minority obstructs. If a carbon tax is a good idea, why aren't we voting on it? Or if we want to help the DACA kids, why aren't we voting on it? Or if the Federal debt is out of control, why aren't we voting on it? It doesn't take a genius. It doesn't take a genius to figure out how to gum up the works in a body of 100 that oper-ates mostly by unanimous consent. But here is my different view of why we are here. It is hard to get here. It is hard to stay here. And while we are here, we might as well try to accomplish some-thing good for the country. But it is hard to accomplish something if you don't vote on amendments. Lately, the Senate has been like join- ing the Grand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing. It is a real waste of talent. Think about this body. Over the years, we have had astronauts, former Governors, Supreme Court law clerks, military heroes, turnaround CEOs. We even had one of us who ran the Olym-pics. A group of that much talent ought to accomplish a lot more, and you don't have to eliminate the fili-buster to accomplish a lot more\u2014 meaning, restore the Senate to a time when it was working across party lines more often to solve big problems. Not so long ago, the Senate worked Monday through Friday, considered hundreds of amendments. Most votes were by majority, and conferences worked out broad agreements. That was under the existing rules. Let me say that again. That was under the ex-isting rules. So the Senate doesn't need a change of rules. It needs a change of behavior, and the behavior to change first is to stop blocking each other's amendments. If you are against it, vote no. Why stop the entire body from even considering it? Why join the Grand Ole Opry if you don't want to sing? I guar-antee you that if 15 to 20 Democrats and 15 to 20 Republicans decided they wanted to change that practice, they could do it. Some Governors don't like being a U.S. Senator, but not me. The jobs are different. Both jobs cause you to want to see an urgent need, develop a strat-egy to deal with it, and then try to per-suade at least half of the people that you are right. But the Governor's job is more like Moses. You say: Let's go this way. The Senator's job, if you want to get something done, is more like a pa-rade organizer. You pick the route, you recruit the marchers, you select the music, you even pick the drum majors sometimes, and then you march in the middle of the parade and hope it doesn't run off the road more than a half dozen times on the way to where it is going. I love the traditions of the Senate, the hard marble floors, the elaborate courtesies, Barry Black's prayers, and scratching my name beside Howard Baker's and Fred Thompson's names in this desk drawer. I have made a lot of friendships in the Senate. My best friendship began at a softball game between Senator John G. Tower's staff of Texas and Sen-ator Baker's staff, in the summer of 1967, when a 21-year-old Smith College graduate named Honey slid into first base wearing red shorts. I was not only surprised but cap- tivated, and 18 months later we were married. And for 52 years she has been an unselfish and caring wife, mother, campaigner, and advocate for families and children, especially her own. In 1969, as the leader mentioned, Sen- ator Baker said to me: You ought to get to know that smart, young legisla-tive assistant for the new Kentucky Senator, Marlow Cook. That smart, young legislative assistant was M ITCH MCCONNELL , and it began a half cen- tury of friendship. Mario D'Angelo, in the barbershop here, first cut my hair in 1977 when I came up for 3 months to work with Senator Baker when he was suddenly elected Republican leader. Some of my experiences in the Sen- ate haven't been so friendly, such as my confirmation hearing in 1991, when Senator Metzenbaum of Ohio said: Gov-ernor Alexander, I have heard some very disturbing things about you, but I don't think I'll bring them up here. And he then put a hold on my nomina-tion for 2 months, until I was mysteri-ously confirmed late one night\u2014and I still don't know how. Back then I found a new way to make friends among Senators when I went to the Republican retreat, and they said: If you will stop talking and play the piano, we will support Bush's education program. So I did, and they did. I have strengthened friendships in the so-called ''inner sanctum'' that C HUCK SCHUMER and I resurrected downstairs. It provides a private space for Senators to have a snack and a con-versation. One-third of this body, of the Sen- ators and their spouses, have come to the Smoky Mountains to be guests of Honey and me in our home for the weekend. We don't talk about politics much there. We talked about lost hikers and told bear stories. And I have even learned here how to count\u2014how to count my friends. In 2006 I wrote 27 thank-you notes for 24 votes when I lost the race by 1 vote to be the Republican whip. Having learned to count, I got to be the Republican con-ference chairman. I enjoyed that, but 9 years ago I left to focus on issues that I cared the most about. Since then I have done my best to leave footprints that I hope are good for the country: fixing No Child Left Behind and 21st Century Cures and simplifying FAFSA, working with P ATTY MURRAY \u2014MICHAEL BENNET was there at the start for the FAFSA; working with D IANNE FEIN- STEIN in building up our National Lab- oratories and supercomputing; joining the bipartisan parade of Portland and W ARNER and G ARDNER and K INGand MANCHIN and D AINES and H EINRICH and BURR and C ANTWELL that created the Great American Outdoors Act; the law VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec SENATE S7148 December 2, 2020 to help songwriters; working with MURRAY and J ONES and T IMSCOTT on permanently funding Black colleges; with B LUNT and S HELBY on the shark tank of the National Institutes of Health, creating new diagnostic tests, new ways; with B URR and D URBIN and MANCHIN and K INGon the student loan law I mentioned; with C ASEY and E NZI on the Perkins Act; with Harry Reid and Bill Frist, when they were leaders, on the America COMPETES Act. None of this could have been done without an exceptional staff. But in-stead of thanking them in a rushed way now, I am going to make a sepa-rate ''salute to the staff'' speech to-morrow. Maybe I will start a tradition. My favorite time in the U.S. Senate has been with the American history teachers whom I invite to come to the Senate floor before it opens while they are attending the academies that were created by the legislation I introduced in my maiden address 18 years ago. After that address, Ted Kennedy, without my knowing it, went around and got 20 Democratic cosponsors. In the House, R OGER WICKER and M ARSHA BLACKBURN helped pass the bill there, where they were then. The teachers who come to the floor before we open invariably go to our desks. They try to find Daniel Web-ster's desk. They look for the Kennedy brothers' desk. They ask, ''Where is Jefferson Davis's desk?''\u2014Jefferson Davis, who resigned the Senate to be-come President of the Confederacy\u2014be-cause they have heard the story that there is a chop mark on the desk that was imposed by a Union soldier when they captured Washington. The soldier was chopping the desk until his com-mander said: Stop that. We are here to save the Union, not to destroy it. Invariably a teacher will ask: Sen- ator, what would you like for us to take back to our students about being a U.S. Senator? My reply is always the same: Please suggest to your students that they look at Washington, DC, as if it were a split-screen television. On one side are the confirmation hearings and the tweets, and on the other side you have Democratic and Republican Senators working together to strengthen na-tional defense, National Laboratories, national parks, and the National Insti-tutes of Health. Please remind them of what a re- markable country this is: the strongest military, the best universities, pro-ducing 20 percent of all the money in the world for just 4 percent of the peo-ple. Tell them we are not perfect, but, as our Constitution says, we are always working to form a more perfect union and that, as Samuel Huntington wrote, most of our arguments are about con-flicts among principles with which most of us agree, and most of our poli-tics is about disappointments in not being able to reach the noble goals we set for ourselves, such as all men are created equal. The late NAACP President Ben Hooks used to teach his University of Memphis students, ''America is a work in progress. We've come a long way, and we have a long way to go.'' Please remind your students that the rest of the world wishes they had our system of government and that the U.S. Senate has been and I hope con-tinues to be the single most important institution that helps to unify our country by creating broad agreements that most of us can vote for and that the citizens of the United States will accept. Finally, please tell them that I wake up every day thinking I might be able to do something good to help our coun-try and that I go to bed most nights thinking that I have. Please tell them that it is a great privilege to be a U.S. Senator. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Tennessee. TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it is such an honor to be here and to join my colleagues in paying tribute to Sen-ator A LEXANDER today. As you can see, there are many who want to speak and have a few words to say. Now, I think all of us wish that we could do this to a background of music with L AMAR playing the piano. That would definitely be the proper setting. But I am so pleased to stand and to honor the three terms of service that he has had here in this body and the way he has touched the lives not only of individuals in this body but millions of Tennesseans. We know that he has\u2014and he has talked about it in his remarks\u2014worked with educators; he has worked with innovators; he has worked with the healthcare community; and he has worked, yes, with entertainers, many of whom hold him so dear and who call Tennessee home. In fact, when I was serving in the House and representing Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, so many times I would look over here and I would think ''What is L AMAR not working on today?'' because he always had such a broad portfolio of issues that were demanding his attention. And what we know is he accepted that work to address that broad portfolio of issues. His commitment for caring for the needs of all Tennesseans has really manifested itself in what Tennesseans like to see as a lifelong legacy that has really changed lives. As Governor, he worked to streamline our State's gov-ernment, was very successful in those efforts, and he brought that desire to streamline government with him when he came to the Senate. Indeed, this is work that has benefited all Ten-nesseans and all Americans. As Governor of Tennessee, he was very successful in working to persuade Nissan automotive to come into our State. This started a new impact on our State with the auto industry. Then, as the auto industry needed sup-pliers, he turned his attention to infra-structure to make certain that the roads, the highways, the access that were necessary were there to encourage this business. As the former Secretary of Education under President George H. W. Bush, he couldn't not put his personal touch on education policy, working tirelessly, as he said, to fix No Child Left Behind. This earned him the first-ever James Madison Award. He has a reputation for, indeed, being a go-to lawmaker, and as chairman of HELP here in the Senate, he put a spotlight on the issues that affect the most sensitive aspects of Tennesseans' lives, again benefiting all Americans. I like the fact that he talked about bipartisanship and productivity. Be-tween 2015 and 2019, during his term of service at HELP, he has reported 45 bills out of his committee that have be-come law\u201445 bills. As he mentioned, one of those was 21st Century Cures. As a Member in the House and working on originating this bill, we had said: We are going to make this bipartisan. And, indeed, we did, and we moved it from the House to the Senate. And yes, in-deed, there were some days we thought: This is never going to happen. But, in-deed, Senator A LEXANDER insisted, and, yes, it did happen. He mentioned the Music Moderniza- tion Act, and I will tell you, this is vi-tally important to Tennesseans. As we worked this through the House and then it hit some bumps in the road, Senator A LEXANDER and Senator Hatch did such a great job of pushing this for-ward here in the Senate. Then, last September, the Nashville Songwriters Association International awarded him the White Hat Award, which is what they give to legislators who have made a significant impact on the entertainment and music commu-nity. Well, the highlight reel would be too long to cover in one speech. There are many who are waiting to express their thanks. So, with that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S ASSE). The Senator from California is recognized. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Senator L AMAR ALEXANDER , a friend and a colleague who has served in this body for some 18 years now. I have had the pleasure of serving with this Senator on both the Rules Committee and the Appropria-tions Committee, and we sat next to each other as chairman or ranking member on two Appropriations sub-committees\u2014first Interior and then Energy and Water. We have done that since 2009. It has been through these experiences that I truly have come to appreciate Senator A LEXANDER 's fair- ness, his interest in solving problems, and his bipartisanship. Most of all, I so appreciate your friendship and the time we have had to talk together. I do believe that the Senate is going to be diminished by the absence of this Senator. VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, \u2014 SENATE S7149 December 2, 2020 Working closely as chair and ranking member of the Energy and Water De-velopment Subcommittee, we have al-ways been able to find agreement on the annual appropriations bill. That is because we shared a willingness to find common ground. And that is no small thing. We have consistently held com-prehensive subcommittee hearings on a wide range of issues, from nuclear power and nuclear waste to dam safety, to devastating droughts in the West and the future of renewable energy. We were also often among the first, if not the first subcommittee to nego-tiate our bill, draft it, and get it marked up by the full committee, and that includes 4 years of record-level funding for clean energy, the National Laboratories, supercomputing, and water projects. The focus has always been on a fair, open process that seeks compromise. And that track record speaks to the value we place on the process. But more than anything, Senator A LEXANDER will be remembered as someone who dedicated his life to serv-ing the people of Tennessee. Between his 8 years as Governor and 16 years as a Senator, he served longer than any Tennessean who has held both jobs. That doesn't include the 2 years he served as President George H.W. Bush's Secretary of Education. His priorities have always been of great importance to Tennessee, wheth-er Army Corps of Engineers funding for inland waters, particularly his favor-ite, Chickamauga\u2014this is the first time I ever heard the word pro-nounced\u2014Chickamauga Lock, which he often talks about in our hearings, or updating the way musicians are paid for their work. He also led efforts to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015, which President Obama called a ''Christmas miracle.'' As we hear promising news about coronavirus vaccines, we are reminded of the 21st Century Cures Act. That is Senator A LEXANDER 's landmark 2016 bill that streamlined the drug and de-vice approval process to bring treat-ments to market faster. He has a long record of work he can be proud of. L AMAR , you have been a great col- league and a dear friend all these years in the Senate. I am proud of what we have achieved together. I will miss our dinners together and sitting next to you on the dais. I hope you enjoy a well-earned retirement with Honey and your beautiful family. Thank you so much for your service. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first met L AMAR ALEXANDER when he was a candidate for President 25 years ago. He was campaigning in the State of Maine, and after giving an articulate speech outlining his priorities and his policies, he proceeded to charm every- one by playing the piano. Little did I know then that we would one day serve as colleagues and friends in the U.S. Senate. L AMAR , as you heard already today, is an extraordinary legislator. He has the ability to bring people together even on very contentious issues and hammer out a compromise. He is ex-tremely effective because he is always well informed, focuses on the issue at hand, never gives up, and is willing to work across the aisle. He gets things done that matter not only to his con-stituents and his beloved Tennessee but also to citizens across this great country. He has been an extraordinary leader on important issues that many of us care deeply about, such as biomedical research, education, and combating the opioid crisis. He is that rare individual who is far less interested in who gets the credit than in getting the job done. But, in fact, each of us who has had the privilege of working with L AMAR knows that he is the one who deserves the credit. I have served for years with L AMAR on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which he chairs. On one challenging issue after another, when others would throw up their hands and say ''This is impossible; it simply cannot be done,'' L AMAR never gives up the search for a solution and for common ground. L AMAR has been so prolific as a legis- lator that it is difficult to single out one accomplishment among so many, but if forced to do so, I would say that the 21st Century Cures Act is his signa-ture achievement. As the name im-plies, this law is a lasting legacy for him, and it is already providing lasting benefits for our country. Whether it is the BRAIN Initiative that will finally help us to make progress on diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurological illnesses, or the Cancer Moonshot that was done in honor of Beau Biden, or the funding that was included to look at the im-pact of lifestyles on our health, all of the provisions of this landmark law will improve the health of the Amer-ican people far into the future, and it will be L AMAR ALEXANDER who de- serves the credit. As a close second, I would cite the educational reforms he drafted to re-place and improve No Child Left Be-hind to give more autonomy back to the States and local school districts. That law\u2014Every Student Succeeds Act\u2014was a momentous bipartisan achievement, and L AMAR has already explained what it took to get the job done. It is not surprising that in 2016, the Nation's Governors named L AMAR the first recipient of the James Madi-son Award to recognize Members of Congress who support Federalism. As we have heard today, the Wall Street Journal called ESSA the ''largest devo-lution of federal control to the states in a quarter-century.'' In addition to being a skillful legis- lator, L AMAR is also a wonderfully tal- ented musician, as both a pianist and a singer. His hilarious performance at the annual Alfalfa Club dinner back in 2011 is legendary, and thanks to YouTube, it is also immortal. L AMAR was a great friend, as he men- tioned today, of the writer Alex Haley, the author of ''Roots.'' Mr. Haley's per-sonal motto was ''Find the good and praise it.'' L AMAR quotes that often, and he lives by it. Optimism and grati-tude, effectiveness and skill are his de-fining characteristics. To L AMAR , ''the good'' isn't simply what is pleasant; it is what is worthwhile, what makes us better people, better citizens, a better nation. If we follow the advice he gave us today, we will be a better Senate. Not long ago, I was interviewed by a journalist for a retrospective on L AMAR 's service in the Senate. She said that she happened to be in the Senate Dining Room on December 17, 2018\u2014the day that L AMAR announced his inten- tion to retire\u2014and that a room usually alive with chatter was unusually quiet and tinged with sadness. That somber atmosphere was genuine and bipar-tisan. L AMAR , I can't tell you how much personally I will miss serving with you. You are not only a great Senator and extraordinary legislator but a wonder-ful friend. Thank you so much for your many years of public service. I feel very honored to have served with you, to have learned from you, and I wish you and Honey all the best. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as- sistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, his name was the answer to a frequently asked question. It is a question that used to come up in almost every Demo-cratic meeting when we talked about legislative ideas and we talked about making progress on the floor of the Senate. And the question was this: Who can we call on the other side of the aisle? And the answer was almost al-ways L AMAR ALEXANDER . We knew that if we presented an idea to him, he would not only be receptive and re-spectful, we knew that if he came on board, it would lend credibility to our effort, maybe even get a bill passed around here. But it would always have to wear a red tartan badge with it be-cause there was an idea that he wanted to bring to the party, but it was worth it. It was worth it not only for the progress that you can make in terms of legislation, but it was worth it because it was part of developing a friendship. Harry Truman used to recommend fa- mously, ''If you want a friend in Wash-ington, get a dog.'' I thought of that. I told you about it a few months ago when you were on one of those Sunday morning talk shows. You were broad-casting, I think, from your living room or family room at your home in Ten-nessee, and I couldn't get over that stuffed animal that was on the coffee table behind you. It just seemed like it was such an odd little piece of maybe personal pride to have that stuffed ani-mal with you. It turned out it wasn't stuffed at all. It was Rufus, your dog, who slept through your entire perform-ance, wasn't a bit moved by the fact VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, \u2014 SENATE S7150 December 2, 2020 that you were on some Sunday morn- ing talk show. I want to thank you for many things, and I will mention a few of them in terms of legislation, but I especially want to thank you for\u2014I brought a group of friends of mine down to Nash-ville, TN, and you made a recommenda-tion list of places to stop, including the Bluebird, and then came by and joined us for lunch. You couldn't have been more gracious, and I thank you for that. That is a trademark of L AMAR ALEX- ANDER 's life and service to this coun- try. I could talk about many things, but I want to reflect on one that I think is timely and significant and is a reason a lot of us are wearing these masks. We are facing a pandemic with the COVID- 19 virus. It has claimed 273,000 Amer-ican lives, and I am afraid many more will follow. Millions\u2014almost 13 million or more\u2014have been infected by it. We want it to end, and we want it to end as quickly as possible. The really shining ray of hope here is the possibility that a vaccine will be available soon. I pray it will be. I like to think that some of the things that we did together, with others, created an opportunity for that vaccine to be discovered. It was 5 or 6 years ago that I ap- proached you and I approached Senator P ATTY MURRAY and R OYBLUNT with the idea that we ought to make a con-certed, consistent effort to increase the NIH's budget by at least 5 percent per year. Senator B LUNT , whom I see on the floor here today, I want to thank you. You took that cause to heart, along with Senator A LEXANDER . We had the right appropriator and the right authorizer, and P ATTY MUR- RAYserved in both capacities so effec- tively. We dramatically increased the NIH budget over the last 7, 8 years. I am hopeful, and I would like to think that some of those researchers and the work that they did was laying the ground-work for the discovery of these vac-cines quickly in the United States and around the world. That is a legacy you won't soon forget. Do you remember when we first got wind of this COVID-19 and I walked across the Chamber here and I said to you: I am worried about this protective equipment issue and how much we are reliant on going overseas for sourcing; would you join me at least in an effort to find out whether we are dependent on foreign sources at a time when we might desperately need this protective equipment for our own? You said, sure, and we did it together and the investigation is underway. It may not serve us in this particular cri-sis, but it will serve in many genera-tions to come to make sure we have re-liable domestic sources in the United States. I am not going to catalog all of the items that were mentioned earlier by our colleagues Senator B LACKBURN and Senator C OLLINS and Senator F EIN- STEIN \u2014the list goes on and on\u2014but that increase by 38 percent of the Na-tional Institutes of Health was some-thing our little quartet did together, and I am particularly proud to be part of it. It wasn't, by far, the only thing that you have done. You championed an in-crease in the Department of Energy's Office of Science as chair of the Energy and Water Appropriations Committee, which Senator F EINSTEIN noted. Under your leadership with her, that office budget has increased by 38 percent since 2015. You worked with the National Labs, like Oak Ridge, Argonne, Fermilab. Those are near and dear to me as well. And your support for research infra-structure provided essential help to this Lab and Labs across America. I want to just close by saying this. Most of us were moved by your speech. I am sure it was a perfect illustration of your view of this Chamber and the good memories you have and a chal-lenge to all of us to do better. I think the honest answer is it is not the rules of the Senate that make the difference; it is the Senators who make a dif-ference. If we come to the chore of leg-islating with the inspiration of L AMAR ALEXANDER , we are going to get a lot done for America. Thank you for your great service to our country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re- publican whip. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Sen- ate is going to miss L AMAR ALEXANDER . Listening to his farewell address right now made the fact that he is leaving all too real. I don't like to think of a U.S. Senate without L AMAR . He is a Senate institution and a Senate leader, and his leaving is a loss for this body and for the American people. Any tribute to L AMAR has to mention his incredible career, which a lot has been alluded to already: his walk across the State of Tennessee, his 8 years as Tennessee Governor, his time as Secretary of Education under Presi-dent George H.W. Bush, his stint as president of the University of Ten-nessee system, and his time as a pro-fessor at Harvard. Then, of course, are his 18 years in the U.S. Senate, marked by significant legislative accomplishments on every-thing from education to opioids. All that, and he makes a plaid shirt look good, although these days he has switched to a plaid face mask. I first met L AMAR , like our colleague from Maine, Senator C OLLINS , men- tioned, when he attended a Lincoln Day Dinner in South Dakota in 1995, when he was running for President. I really started to get to know him a lit-tle bit when I came to the Senate in 2005. L AMAR had already been here for a couple of years by that time. Of course, he already had an extraordinary career behind him. I know I was not the only young Senator who regarded him as something of a mentor and a role model. I share a couple of things with L AMAR ; one is the fact that we were both Senate staffers long before we came to the Senate as elected officials. We weren't here at the same time. He was a little ahead of me. I came to the Senate the year Howard Baker left, but, like L AMAR , I have great apprecia- tion for the contributions staffers make to the work that we do around here. I know many of L AMAR 's staffers are in the Gallery today. As he leaves, also we lose a tremendous amount of brain power and talent that has con-tributed so significantly to the suc-cesses and accomplishments that he has had as a U.S. Senator. The other is that he and I both have served as chairman of the Senate Re-publican conference, which is the mes-saging and communications office for Republicans in the Senate. I succeeded L AMAR as chairman of the Senate Re- publican conference in 2012. I will tell you, he is a very tough act to follow but an inspiring one because he did such a tremendous job in leading our messaging in the conference. L AMAR has an ability to break down complex subjects and communicate them clearly. He can sum up an issue in one succinct phrase. He mentioned earlier, in his remarks, the idea that there ought to be one column, one idea; one speech, one idea. He really did mas-ter that. I can recall his summary when we were talking a lot about the energy issue: We need to ''find more and use less.'' That is about as clear a sum-mary of our energy priorities as you can get. Many of us used a phrase he popular- ized around here, too, in describing policies of the other side that we thought would be harmful to the econ-omy as casting a big wet blanket over the economy. I don't know how many times you heard that coming out of our mouths, but it all originated with L AMAR ALEXANDER . I think that ability to really break down complex issues and clearly ex-plain them is one of the reasons he was such a good conference chairman and one of the reasons he has been so suc-cessful legislatively. And he has been successful legisla- tively. You already heard a number of my colleagues talk about his many successes. Yet he has managed to get things passed around here that I don't think anyone thought could get passed, particularly in the polarized political environment that we have been in. But L AMAR has an ability to bring people together from across the aisle. You heard our colleagues on both sides speak to that. He is very practical about the business of legislating. He fo-cuses on what is actually possible to do and he finds the common ground and he gets things done. You have heard of the America COM- PETES Act, the Every Student Suc-ceeds Act, the 21st Centuries Cures VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, SENATE S7151 December 2, 2020 Act, the Opioids Crisis Response Act, the Copyright Act, the Great American Outdoors Act. I could go on and on. Those, ladies and gentlemen, are major, major pieces of legislation, tre-mendous accomplishments of the Con-gress by the U.S. Senate, signed into law by the President, all of which couldn't have happened without the leadership of L AMAR ALEXANDER . He has held multiple leadership posi- tions in the Senate: chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions Committee and, as I said, Senate Republican conference chairman, but he has always been a leader, whether or not in an official leadership position or simply by virtue of who he is. As I said before, L AMAR has been a mentor and role model to me and I know to many others here in the Sen-ate. But I also have to mention his per- sonal warmth and hospitality to me and my wife when our daughter was studying at Belmont University in Nashville, TN. He and his wife Honey opened their home to us in Nashville. They hosted us. I am fortunate to be among those he mentioned were at their place in the Smokies, which was a fabulous experience. They took us to a Tennessee Titans game. They went above and beyond. And to this day, we are grateful for their warmth and gen-erosity and for a chance to see L AMAR in his element in his beloved Ten-nessee. L AMAR has dedicated much of his life to his State, his country, and nobody could be more deserving of retirement. I will be surprised if he ever fully re- tires. I am pretty sure, even while sit-ting on his porch, he is still going to be dreaming up ways to make our country better. L AMAR , thank you for your leader- ship and for your mentorship. Thank you for being a role model to so many of us. May God bless you in your retire-ment. I will miss you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Colorado. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I was not planning on speaking today, but I was so inspired by what Senator A LEX- ANDER had to say about his career and about the Senate that I wanted to share a word or two of reflection on what he said. Anybody who has spent any time around Washington, DC, or even around this Capitol knows there are statues built all over this town of peo-ple nobody remembers. When I go by one of those statues in Washington\u2014 whether it is in a circle somewhere in a traffic stop or in the hallway in the Capitol\u2014I think about the importance of dying at the right time. You want to die at a moment when statues are in vogue if you are going to have a statue. But there is no\u2014none of these people are ever going to be remembered in the long view of history. The stoic philoso-phers on whom we base so much, or at least attempt to base so much of what we do here, had a solution to that. Their solution was\u2014whether it was the Greek or Roman philosophers\u2014their solution was: Do your best. Show up and make a contribution. Do your best. Don't worry about how people are going to remember you. Don't worry about your own mortality. So few of us follow that advice. I think L AMAR ALEXANDER embodies that. As President of the University of Tennessee, as Governor, as the Sec-retary of Education, as a Senator, in every one of those jobs, it has always been about doing his best. In a Chamber filled with people who think they have a monopoly on wis-dom, L AMAR has never stopped learn- ing. He has always been curious. Up to this day\u2014I will bet today, he probably got up and asked somebody on his staff or one of his colleagues to tell him about something he wants to learn more about so he can be more effective and make a greater difference so he can do his best. The Senate is going to be diminished by L AMAR 's absence. It is hard to be- lieve we can be any more diminished than we are, but we are going to be di-minished by L AMAR leaving. Susan and I were lucky enough to be invited to his home, spend a weekend there. I am going to say something now I never said to L AMAR ALEXANDER . He gave us the great privilege of standing in the family cemetery in Eastern Ten-nessee, in his beloved Smoky Moun-tains, where he will forever keep the windmills out. As I stood there a little awkwardly in the cemetery\u2014because that is not usually part of a tour\u2014all I could think about was how lucky L AMAR and Honey were to know that would be the place where they would be and that long after they were remem-bered by anybody, they would know that they had done their best; that they had always done their best. What I would say to my colleagues today is, we have an opportunity to fol-low L AMAR 's example and take him up on what he said. We are not memori-alizing L AMAR today. He is going to have a lot more years left to contribute to his State, his community, and to the country, but he won't be in the Senate, and we are in the Senate. We could work in the Senate that works 5 days a week or even 6 days a week. Sign me up for that Senate. We could work in a Senate that has 25 amendments in a bill instead of 25 amendments in a year, as we did last year, because there is no other body in America or in this democracy, as L AMAR said, that is set up to decide the hardest questions that our country is facing and to make those decisions stick. That is what L AMAR ALEXANDER said to us today. He has left us with a challenge, and I hope we will take him up on it because there is no excuse for the way this place has worked, and the American people are tired of hearing that it has been the other side's fault. There are 100 people who can fix this place, and I hope we will. I can't think of a greater legacy for L AMAR to leave than that of a Senate that actually works. That is what the country deserves, and that is the inspiration that L AMAR ALEXANDER has set for me. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we all know that L AMAR ALEXANDER is a per- son of tremendous character and judg-ment, and it is not just because he asked that young woman in the red shorts that he met at that softball game so many years ago to marry him, who happens to be from Victoria, TX, which demonstrates his enormous good judgment. Certainly, we wish him and Honey the best in this next chapter of their lives. When I think about L AMAR ALEX- ANDER , I think about all of the Lamar- isms, and we have heard some of them here today: ''Find the good and praise it''\u2014quotes his friend Alex Haley, which I think kind of speaks to the op-timistic, positive view of life that we could use more of. Then I remember other words. He said: If you want to get a standing ovation before any group of individuals, you need to say, ''It is time to put the teaching of American history and civics back into its rightful place in our schools so our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American.'' He has talked about Alex Haley, his friend, who told him how to give a speech by telling a story. Aristotle also had an idea about how to give a great speech. He basically broke it down to three components. One is the logical argument, another is the emotional argument, but then an-other is about establishing your au-thority. It is about the character of the speaker. When I think about L AMAR , as he has demonstrated again here today, the thing I appreciate about him the most is not just what he has accom-plished here but his incredible char-acter and positive impact on our Sen-ate and on our country. It has been be-cause people know that his heart is in the right place. It is his doing it for all the right reasons that we admire him so much. I would just point out, as I told L AMAR previously, that I admired LAMAR ALEXANDER long before I met him\u2014when I voted for him in the 1996 Republican primary for President. Un-fortunately, he dropped out of that race shortly thereafter, so I told him I wasted my vote, but I have been an ad-mirer for a long time. (Laughter.) L AMAR and I also share something else in common. It is about his prede-cessor as well as mine. He is a person by the name of Sam Houston. I occupy the Senate seat first held by Sam Houston when Texas became a State. Of course, he originally came from Tennessee. He had happened to be a Governor of Tennessee before he had left and gone to Texas. Later, he be-came the Governor of Texas and basi-cally stepped down because he was a VerDate Sep 11 2014 23:41 Dec 02, \u2014 SENATE S7152 December 2, 2020 Union man, recruited by Andrew Jack- son. He loved the Union. He did not agree with secession, but, of course, he went to Texas and became a victorious general of the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. He became the President of the Republic of Texas for the same rea-son. The reason the Texas flag and the American flag fly at the same height is that we were an independent nation be-fore we became part of the United States. I have heard it said that you could never write a novel based on the life of Sam Houston because nobody would believe it. I have read plenty about him, and I still find that to be true. Yet, as I indicated, as proud as Tex- ans are of Sam Houston's contribution to our history and our State, we know we can't claim him entirely because he grew up in Maryville, TN\u2014the same town that L AMAR ALEXANDER did\u2014and went on to become Governor, as I men-tioned a moment ago. Sam Houston's portrait hangs above my desk in the Hart Office Building be-cause it helps to remind me of my re-sponsibilities and of the incredible his-tory and contribution that he made and that, hopefully, each of us can make. While you find Sam Houston's pic- ture above my desk, you will find his walking stick in L AMAR ALEXANDER 's office, which is just down the hall. The many Tennesseans who have visited L AMAR during his time in the Chamber have seen the words ''Sam Houston,'' ''Texas,'' and ''Lone Star'' engraved on its gold cap, and according to L AMAR , several Texans have tried to run off with it. Fortunately, they haven't been successful. The truth is, you can't get through a Texas history class\u2014or at least you shouldn't\u2014without hearing about the pivotal role of the Volunteer State within the history of my State. I al-ways kid L AMAR . I say: The Ten- nesseans who went to Texas who fought at the Alamo and in the Battle of San Jacinto were just one step ahead of a creditor or of an aggrieved spouse. This was a rough-and-tumble group that came from Tennessee to found Texas. There are other Tennesseans, people like Davy Crockett and others, who went to Texas and created our State. The State of Texas has many reasons to be grateful to the contributions of the sons and daughters of Tennessee, and one of those great sons is L AMAR . He has dedicated his life to public serv-ice. As we know, it has led him through an incredible number of important of-fices. Yet I think, to me, the thing that has even more led to his legislative accom-plishments and that has made L AMAR so effective is that we know we can trust him. We know his character. We know that when he says something, it is true, and we have seen it time and again, when L AMAR has used that char- acter and that trust to pass historic legislation in this Chamber. As we have all come to know, when you are work-ing side by side with L AMAR on legisla- tion, you are bound to get things done because he has cracked the code. He knows how to do it. I have been proud to work with L AMAR on legislation to address the opioid epidemic, to support our service-members and veterans, to protect health coverage, and to ensure that folks across the country have the op-portunity to take advantage of the American dream. His presence has been constant throughout our time. We came to the Senate at the same time, and, of course, his retirement makes that all bittersweet. So I thank our colleague from Ten- nessee for his friendship over many years and, as we have heard from Sen-ator T HUNE and others, for the example he has shown to the rest of us as to how to be an effective Member of the U.S. Senate. I also thank him for his decades of service to the country. I don't expect L AMAR to follow in the footsteps of Sam Houston and run for Governor of Texas, but I know he has many more contributions to make to our great country, and I wish him and Honey all the best during this next chapter of their lives. I am sure he is looking forward to spending a little more time in their beloved Smoky Mountains. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have learned in my time in the Senate that if you want to get something done across the aisle, you really need the following: You need someone on the other side who is just as committed to working together as you are, and that Member needs to have the trust of Members on your side of the aisle and on his own, and you both need to be willing to set aside egos and listen and get a realistic understanding of wheth-er the person on the other side of the negotiating table can reach an agree-ment with you that upholds your prin-ciples without compromising his own. Now, what I have laid out might not sound that unusual or rare, but it is ac-tually pretty tough to find these days. I have been very lucky that the Sen-ator whom we honor today on the floor\u2014my colleague and friend, Chair-man L AMAR ALEXANDER , of Tennessee\u2014 is someone who has managed it time and again. I don't think anyone, least of all Sen- ator A LEXANDER himself, would be sur- prised to hear me say that we are as likely to disagree as to agree on many matters. I bring my Washington State values to the table, and he brings his Tennessee values, so you can imagine how that has gone from time to time. Yet, despite our different perspectives and our different approaches we take to policymaking, we have also been able to see where our values and the in-terests of our States and our country converge. We both understood that the broken No Child Left Behind law needed to be fixed. L AMAR listened to me, which I so appreciated, when I told him we should write a bill together rather than to amend the Republican bill that he had begun working on. With our HELP Committee members, we were able to write and pass a new K-12 public edu-cation bill that fixed the most broken parts of No Child Left Behind. It in-cluded Federal guardrails so we could understand how all of our students per-form. It dedicated resources to improv-ing the schools that needed it the most. It also allowed for historic steps forward on early education. We laid the groundwork together for new investments in lifesaving bio-medical innovation and research through the 21st Century Cures Act, in-cluding the Beau Biden Cancer Moon-shot. We worked together to pass land- mark legislation to boost our response to the opioid epidemic, to strengthen our public health preparedness pro-grams, and to permanently fund his-torically Black colleges and univer-sities and minority-serving institu-tions. We not only passed each of these bills, but we did so time and again with huge majorities from this Senate. Now, even still, Chairman A LEXANDER and I, along with our colleagues in the House, are working to get legislation across the finish line to finally ban surprise medical bills. What I have just laid out is by no means a full list at all of Senator A LEXANDER 's accomplishments as chairman. It doesn't even include quite a few things he is still trying to get done as we speak. Senator A LEX- ANDER 's focus on working together has helped countless families in his home State of Tennessee, in my home State of Washington, and nationwide. My Democratic colleagues and I thank Chairman A LEXANDER for the tone and manner with which he has led the HELP Committee over the past 6 years\u2014some of them, admittedly, rockier than others but, throughout, guided by his steady leadership and commitment to working together. For myself, as someone who shares the drive to not only fight for what you believe in but also to look for common ground, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for the many opportunities to dig in and get to work that he has provided, for being willing to hear me and my colleagues out again and again when necessary, and for looking so often for common ground, for another problem we could solve, and for being willing not just to keep talking but to keep listening as well. Finally, I know none of this would have been possible without the support and strength Senator A LEXANDER has received from Honey, his wife, and I ac-knowledge and thank her for her con-tribution as well. Lamar, you will be thrilled to be back full time in the State you love so much\u2014I know that\u2014but I and mem-bers of the HELP Committee want you to know we are going to miss you ter-ribly here in the Senate. Thank you so much for all you have done. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:58 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7153 December 2, 2020 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators C ANTWELL , BLUNT , ROMNEY , SCHUMER , and I be able to complete our remarks before the next vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this discussion except to make one additional point about the unselfishness and humility of this hero of the Senate, whose remarks we will long remember today. There is a framed piece of legislation that hangs on the wall in my con-ference room in the Dirksen Building. It is, in fact, a piece of legislation that Senator A LEXANDER chose to mention as one of his signature accomplish-ments, and that is the American His-tory and Civics Education Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush. There is a story about how I came to have that piece of legis-lation, which Senator A LEXANDER worked so hard on, on the wall in my conference room. I live in North Mississippi, and, as such, I listen to Memphis television a lot. During L AMAR ALEXANDER 's first race for Senator, on came a commer-cial, and, basically, it said just what our friend from Texas just quoted\u2014 that this candidate for Senator, former Governor L AMAR ALEXANDER , wanted to pass an American civics education bill to teach our children what it means to be an American. I stopped at that moment, and I pointed to that tel-evision screen, and I said: If that man gets elected, I want to be part of that bill because that is exactly what we need. So Senator A LEXANDER introduced the bill here in the Senate. I intro-duced it in the House of Representa-tives. We made public appearances to-gether, one in Memphis, TN, that I will always remember. Eventually, the bill gained a lot of support over here, and Senator K ENNEDY , as has been men- tioned, was someone at the forefront of that effort. We were able to pass it in the House. It went to conference to iron out the details, and a decision had to be made as to which one would actually be en-acted by both Houses and go to the President for his signature. L AMAR ALEXANDER allowed the piece of legislation introduced by a rel-atively junior Member of the House named R OGER WICKER to be that piece of legislation that went on to the White House, to the Oval Office, to be signed by the President of the United States. So that is how that piece of legisla- tion hangs on my wall as a bill au-thored by Representative R OGER WICKER but passed very much with the efforts of Senator A LEXANDER also. I just wanted to mention that, not to prolong this discussion but to mention that act of selflessness and humility as another attribute of this great Senator to whom we say farewell today. I think the remarks we heard from Senator A LEXANDER will be taught at civics classes and college-level govern-ment classes for decades and decades to come. It was so profound, and it is a real honor that a piece of legislation that he and I worked on together will always be a part of what I consider to be those immortal remarks. So I thank you very much. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor, too, to thank the Senator from Tennessee for his service to our Nation and for his work here in the U.S. Senate. Some of my colleagues have already mentioned the brevity of words with which Senator A LEXANDER can deliver a message. I, too, remember his com-ments as a Rules Committee member, on the inaugural address, and really capturing the moment of why a transi-tion of power is so important to our Nation. And it struck me that we real-ly had a poet or a writer among us, someone who could sense and feel the moment of what we were going through and express it in words. So I have no doubt that some writing is in L AMAR 's future here, and I look forward to see-ing that. But I wanted to rise today to thank him for his service and what it has meant to my State and to our Nation. My colleague from Washington talked about their work together on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions Committee. I, too, want to thank you for the CARES Act, and I remem-ber your recognition on FOX News about stem cell research and the great work that that has led to. So we are appreciative of those re- search dollars, but I want to focus on a role that maybe has not gotten as much attention\u2014the historic role you have played on our energy budget and our National Laboratory budget. I so appreciate the background of your State and the background of focus on energy funding, from the National Laboratory perspective, which has had to have a constant flow and constantly it has been challenged. Yet it has put every step forward because of the level of investment in helping us make our Nation more secure, create more inno-vation, and create more jobs. So thank you for holding steadfast on the Na-tional Laboratory budget. I also want to thank you for your work on the Manhattan Project Na-tional Historical Park, which we worked together on, which, both, com-memorated the history of our Nation and our Manhattan Project at, both, Oak Ridge and at Richland, WA, and Hanford, and to just thank you for the constant focus on the cleanup budget that we have had to have in the Energy Department, as it related to Hanford. There was a time when we had many cleanup projects around the Nation, and it was very easy to come together and say that we had to get Savannah River, we had to get Oak Ridge, we had to get Colorado, we had to get Idaho, and we had to get Hanford. But as those projects made progress, a lot of people forgot about what it took to clean up Hanford. So I appreciate your constant focus on helping us to get the dollars necessary for cleanup at Han-ford. I also appreciate, recently, your help on making sure that people didn't overstep on the National Nuclear Secu-rity Administration and turn that over to a Defense oversight of people but kept it within the Department of En-ergy. I so appreciate that. But I will be forever grateful for your focus on public lands. We have a saying in my State: Environmentalists make great ancestors. So I don't know if you want that environmentalist term asso-ciated with your name, but I am pretty sure you do want the stewardship. And the man from the Great Smoky Mountains helped us deliver a monu-mental piece of legislation by con-vincing the President of the United States to support the budgetary impact of combining both the national parks enhancement program, which is basi-cally taking care of the national parks backlog, which was in the billions of dollars, and also fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a battle that had been going on for more than a decade. So I want to thank you for that, L AMAR . I want to thank you on behalf of the Washingtonians who will go to so many special places, who will get to visit and commune with their families, who will be able to have outdoor expe-riences, who will be able to really un-derstand the grandeur of Mother Earth. So thank you for pulling off what seemed to be like an impossible effort to convince people to make that level of investment. We are going to miss the harmony of your voice and the harmony of your legislative skills, but we are not going to say permanently good-bye to you be-cause we hope that you will be sending us messages just like the one you sent today and reminding us that we can do better. So thank you, L AMAR , for your con- tribution, in a lot of your life, to these very important issues that affect so many of us. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I first met L AMAR ALEXANDER in 1995, when he spoke at Boston's Lincoln Day Din-ner. Like today, he was folksy, good humored, thoughtful, and impressive. I remarked to Ann that he was surely going to go places. Of course, he had al-ready gone places by then, but he ran for President the next year. One thing L AMAR and I agree on is that the best candidate for President does not al-ways win. I think he may well have been just that. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:58 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7154 December 2, 2020 You all know that he served as presi- dent of a university, Governor, Sen-ator, and Secretary of Education. I have watched firsthand as he has led the Senate's Committee on Health and Education. I don't know any person who has worked longer, harder, and more effectively for the well-being of America's children than L AMAR ALEX- ANDER . His service extends, of course, beyond the children. As we have endured the COVID-19 pandemic, he has led the Senate as we have helped to guide and fund our national response. His healthcare expertise and his deter-mination to keep each of us informed and involved has been invaluable. While America's response to the pan- demic may not have been exemplary, L AMAR ALEXANDER 's leadership of the Senate's role has been superb. The speed at which we will have a vaccine is, in no small measure, a testament to his determination and vision. But L AMAR is much more than a Sen- ator. I have seen the devotion he has for his wife and family. I have watched him entertain rooms full of celebrating Republicans with his piano and sing-ing. And I have experienced very per-sonally the kindness and graciousness that have long characterized this man. He was the first Senator to come to meet me when I joined this body. His impact on the Senate, on the State of Tennessee, and on the Nation extends well beyond his legislative ac-complishments and leadership. His greatest impact has been that of his personal character. He is a man with-out guile. He is true to his conscience. He speaks and acts with truth and hon-esty. He cares about people and endeav-ors to help others. He is a genuine friend, as is evidenced by the many members of his team wearing plaid masks around this room. He has used his talent and energy not to aggrandize himself but to serve. It could be said of L AMAR ALEXANDER that he is a great American of exem-plary character. We are a better people because of L AMAR ALEXANDER . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I think Mark Twain said, among many other things, that there is nothing more troubling than a great example. And, as we have had all of these speeches today, I felt less and less adequate as the speakers talked about the great things that L AMAR has done, the great things he stands for, the incredible character that defines his life and his work. It has been wonderful to be here and to see the appreciation that Sen-ators have for somebody who is proud to be a Senator. Not that often do you get to start a last speech in the Senate referring to somebody else's maiden speech over al-most 50 years ago. But that kind of sense of the Senate, that sense of com-munity, that split screen that L AMAR talked about with educators, where you do have the one screen where it ap-pears that nobody can get along and get anything done\u2014and, particularly in the Senate, you have this relatively small community of people, all of whom got here by figuring out, nor-mally, how to get along with other peo-ple, as one of their attributes of get-ting to the Senate. And then you have rules in the Senate that require you to get along to get anything done. So you have that other screen that doesn't get nearly the attention. But when you do look at the accomplishments, even at a time of great frustration, those accom-plishments have been significant, and so many of them have included L AMAR . I knew L AMAR before I came to the Senate, but, particularly, the last 10 years of working with L AMAR in the Senate have been great for me, and the time that Abby and I have been able to spend with him and Honey have been great. He says things in passing that really define the opportunity to be here in such a significant way. We have heard many of them today. There are others I think of often\u2014one L AMAR told me not too long ago, when I was talking about how well our staffs work to-gether. He said: Well, it always seemed to me that when the Senators obvi-ously got along, the staff figures that out and they understand they are sup-posed to get along too. L AMAR is blessed with a great staff. It will be interesting to see the new standard of having that other speech that so significantly talks about the staff and what the staff means. I have a great staff\u2014many of us do\u2014but when those staffs work together, as opposed to looking for reasons they shouldn't work together, things happen. I remember L AMAR told me one day: They always remember the last thing you do. And if that turns out to be the case, at least the last Senate year of Senator A LEXANDER has been extraordinary, as others have been. But this year I had a chance, as the appropriating chairman of the com-mittee that L AMAR is the authorizing chairman for\u2014and, by the way, he also sits right beside me on the Appropria-tions Committee in most of our hear-ings when Senator S HELBY isn't able to be there, the chairman of our full com-mittee. But in this last year, particu-larly from March on, we have done so many things together. In March, April, May, June, there was almost never a day when we didn't have at least one call with somebody who is running a laboratory or some-one at the FDA or someone who under-stood this investment arm we had, BARDA, that had been designed about 10 years earlier but never used as we have used it to bring the private sector and public sector together in partner-ship in a way that advances both tests and vaccines. We would spend sometimes hours a day in a series of 30-minute phone calls, trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. I remember one day we were talking to someone at the White House, and the comment from his part of the conversation was knowing how many other conversations we had had that day. If people had any idea how much the Senate and the two of you\u2014he was say-ing at that moment\u2014are committed to get things done, they would be sur-prised because that is a story that never gets told. So much of the story of L AMAR \u2014his work here and the good spirit he brings to that work\u2014isn't told, but it is so very obvious, certainly for me. One of the great gifts of my working life has been for L AMAR ALEXANDER to be such an important part of it for the last 10 years. I am grateful for it; I am grateful for him. I look forward to his continued friendship and advice. I think Senator A LEXANDER , like many of us, is more of a next-chapter guy than a last-chapter guy. He is nei-ther shy nor retiring. I expect him to continue to have great impact in his State and in our country. And, in my case, I hope he continues to have great impact in my life. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. E RNST ). The Democratic leader. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I spoke earlier about Senator A LEXANDER , but I would like to com- pliment my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is a fine and rare mo-ment of bipartisanship and support of somebody we all admire and respect. NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS Madam President, now back to reg- ular Senate business\u2014I would like to conclude my remarks from earlier this morning on Senate business, but first I want to mention that I just met with another of President-Elect Biden's ex-ceptionally qualified slate of Cabinet nominees over video conference, and that was Alejandro Mayorkas for the Department of Homeland Security. No one exemplifies the hope and promise of America better than Ali, an immigrant from Cuba who has risen to the highest echelons of public service in his adopted country. We had an ex-cellent conversation about how to re-store integrity and trust at DHS and how to make this into a department that is not just anti-immigrant but rel-ishes the fact that immigrants are so important to the future of America. Now I will note that in previous ad- ministrations, the Secretary of Home-land Security has been confirmed by the Senate on Inauguration Day for President Obama and for President Trump. The Senate should continue the tradition and quickly confirm Ali Mayorkas for the third time so that he can get to work on day one of the Biden administration. BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE Madam President, now, on Senate business, before the end of the year, the Senate has three major priorities: Fund the government; pass the annual Defense bill; and deliver another round of significant COVID relief. VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:58 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7155 December 2, 2020 The appropriators from both sides of the aisle continue to have good discus-sions, and I hope on the funding of the government that the final agreement can be announced soon. Now, the other two priorities, unfor- tunately, are a bit murkier. Yesterday, President Trump issued over Twitter a renewed threat on the annual Defense bill. Previously, the President threat-ened to veto this important legislation over a provision to rename military in-stallations named after Confederate traitors. Now President Trump has issued a veto threat by tweet over a policy con-cerning social media companies, sec-tion 230, which is in neither version of the NDAA already passed by both Houses of Congress. President Trump must have realized that vetoing a pay raise for our troops in order to defend the honor of Confed-erate traitors wasn't the best message to send, so he has found a new com-plaint. After 4 years of ignoring the President's most vitriolic, conspiracy- fueled, and absurd comments on social media, I wonder if our Republican col-leagues would say that they didn't see this particular tweet. The truth is, section 230 may actu- ally need some reform, but that is a se-rious undertaking that should be done in a regular order and can be left for another day, and it is certainly not an acceptable reason to veto the annual Defense bill, which includes policies to keep our military prepared, well- resourced, and equipped to do a dif-ficult and vital job. Nevertheless, it is silly season at the White House. The President seems in-tent on filling each of his remaining days in office with petulance, griev-ance, and self-interest. The President is reportedly asking his staff about whether he can issue preemptive pardons for himself, his family members, and Rudy Giuliani. There is a simple answer: No. No, Mr. President, that would be a gross abuse of the Presidential pardon authority. But I have a more important question: Just how long are our Republican col-leagues going to indulge the President in this nonsense? Many of our Republican colleagues gave the President space to contest the validity of our elections, poisoning Americans' faith in our democracy. Now he is threatening to veto a pay raise for our troops and considering preemptively pardoning the entire Trump family. When are our Repub-lican colleagues in the Senate going to say ''Enough already''? At the very least, with respect to the Defense bill, Senate Republicans ought to find the courage to ignore the Presi-dent's eleventh hour ramblings and pass the NDAA. CORONAVIRUS RELIEF Madam President, now, regarding an- other COVID bill, we seem to be caught in a familiar pattern. We all know that successfully passing legislation through Congress means that a bill must get through the Democratic House and get Democratic votes in the Senate. Passing the law takes a measure of bipartisanship and compromise. That is why Speaker P ELOSI and I sent the Re- publican leader a new offer on the COVID bill. It was an effort to jump- start serious negotiations, but, yester-day, Leader M CCONNELL announced that rather than respond to our offer or the bipartisan offer of the so-called Gang of 8, he will pursue another par-tisan proposal before the end of the year. He said he was going to talk to the Republican leader in the House, the Republican President, and that is it\u2014 not a word with Democrats. From early reports in the press, the latest Republican offer will be even more insufficient than the previous two attempts\u2014so insufficient, that ac-cording to one press report, a Repub-lican Senator said it was ''offensive''\u2014 his word\u2014to struggling Americans for the Republican majority to focus on another messaging bill. Apparently, the latest Republican proposal will not include another dime of unemployment assistance because, according to the Republican whip, it was likely something the President wouldn't sign. Let's be clear. The latest Republican offer on COVID will include immunity for corporations that put their workers at risk of COVID-19 but not a dime for workers who lost their jobs because of the pandemic. The Republican leader should not waste the Senate's time on another in-adequate, partisan proposal and, in-stead, sit down with Democrats to begin a true bipartisan effort to quick-ly meet the needs of the country.

The Senator from Wyoming. FAREWELL TO THE SENATE Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this morn- ing we got to hear the farewell speech of my friend L AMAR ALEXANDER . He is a fantastic speaker and legislator. It has been an honor to serve with him and to learn from him. Now you get to hear from the accountant. I rise today to give my farewell speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the great people of Wyoming in this position for the last 24 years. I have really enjoyed being a Senator\u2014 not for the title, not for the recogni-tion, and certainly not for the pub-licity. I love solving problems for folks in Wyoming and America. I like working on legislation. It might shock those who know me, but I never intended to get into politics. While I always had great respect for those who served in public office, it wasn't my calling when I left college. But over 50 years ago, when I joined the young men's leadership training group known as the Jaycees, at a State convention in Cody I spoke about the value of leadership in communities. The keynote speaker was Al Simp- son, who would go on to serve three terms in the U.S. Senate. After I gave my pitch on the importance of leader-ship training, Senator Simpson did his usual fascinating and humorous speech and then took me aside and said: I don't even know what party you are in, but it is time you put your money where your mouth is on this leadership stuff and get into politics. That town you live in, Gillette, needs a mayor. My wife Diana and I had only moved to Gillette a few years earlier. The town was facing a crisis as the dis-covery of oil, gas, and coal turned it into a boomtown. The population start-ed to skyrocket, and city services were not keeping up. On the way home from that Cody meeting, while my wife was driving, I told her what Senator Simpson had said and that I was thinking maybe I should run for mayor. It must have come as quite a shock because she ended up swerving into the borrow pit and then coming back up onto the road. We ended up talking about it seri- ously for the 4 hours that it took to drive back to Gillette and thought of a lot of things that needed to be done to make a difference in our town. I was new to the community and just 29 years old, but I thought that Gillette was in need of a budget, agendas, and planning\u2014not the most exciting topics to get people's attention. I ran anyway, and I did win. Nearly five decades later, having served as mayor, having served in the State house, having served as a State senator and then as a U.S. Senator, I still find myself motivated by the urge to help my community and my coun-try. I also find myself still pushing those same three ideas that I did when I first VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:06 Dec SENATE S7158 December 2, 2020 ran for mayor: budgets, agendas, and planning. I keep finding myself want-ing to help solve problems. Once you embrace that responsibility, it is hard to ever ignore it again. I have found that many of my colleagues in Con-gress tend to feel the same way. The Senate is a very different place than when I arrived in 1997, and it is a very different place than it was in 1789 when the very first Senate met. But over all those years, it has been a place for folks rising to the challenge of being a leader. We are looking to make our communities and country a better place. We might not always agree on what the solutions are, but we can re-spect each other for working to find one. Over the years, I have learned a great deal from those around me. Just like I listened to Senator Al Simpson all those years back, I have tried to keep an open mind to learning from others. Now that my time in the Senate is coming to a close, I would like to pass along some of the lessons I was taught\u2014and some I learned the hard way\u2014in the hopes that it may be use-ful for my colleagues working to get things accomplished in the Senate and for anybody who wants to be a leader in their community. In my office we have a mission state- ment. It reads: We have been given a sacred trust to work for our families, grandparents, and grand-children. We will respect the wisdom of those before and the future of those to follow. We will discharge this trust through our legisla-tive policy, our constituent services, and the way we treat each other, guided by these three principles: Doing What Is Right Doing Our Best Treating others as They Wish to be Treat- ed These last three principles are advice my mom gave me often, and they re-main my core values. Every member of my staff is given that mission state-ment when they start, and we rely on it to remind us why we are here and how we should act. It isn't just a saying. It is a way to work, a way to build trust, and a way to govern. These values are not always easy to live by. We are all human, and we all struggle to live up to these ideals we set for ourselves, but that is why we call them ideals. I believe these are values we can all agree on, and by remembering the val-ues we share, we can work together to tackle tough problems and find shared solutions. ''Do what is right'' is a great slogan, but you might ask what it means at a practical level. People see a mess in Washington, so how do we actually make progress? I believe it involves fo-cusing on common ground over com-promise, especially when it comes to legislating. People sometimes think that com- promise is the answer. I think it means that I give in to something I don't like, and you give in to something you don't like, and we both wind up with some-thing neither of us likes. That is not legislating. When it comes to legislating, often the best way to get something done that everyone can agree on is to leave out the things you don't agree on and focus on what you can get done. That is why I suggest my 80 percent tool. Generally speaking, people can talk civilly on 80 percent of the issues. It is only on about 20 percent of the issues that we find real contention. Now, even picking a single issue out of the 80 per-cent, you might still find disagree-ment, but once again, you can probably focus on 80 percent of the issue that you can agree on. It is all about focusing on what you can get done and not focusing on the points of disagreement, the weeds of debate that have choked issues, or, to say it another way, it is all about what you leave out. Former Senator Ted Kennedy, from Massachusetts, and I used this tool when we led the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to-gether, and it worked great. It worked even though we were on complete oppo-site sides of the political spectrum. I once showed Senator Kennedy an article that mentioned how unusual it was for the most conservative Senator and the third most liberal Senator to work together, to which he said: So who is ahead of me? We were able to get legislation passed that others had been trying to do for years. Here is how we started working together. When I first got to the Senate, I wanted to change some things with OSHA\u2014the Occupational Safety and Health. Senator Kennedy, at the urging of my predecessor, Sen-ator Simpson, did let me sit down and take him through the bill a section at a time. That is something we always did in the Wyoming Legislature. When we marked up the bill in committee, Senator Kennedy said: In all my years in the Senate, I have never had any-body take me through a bill a section at a time, but I am still going to have to vote against it. It still got out of committee. But later he called me about a safety bill he had been working on for over a decade\u2014a bill to save nurses and medical janitors from acci-dental needlesticks\u2014and asked if I would take a look at it. I did. The big-gest suggestion that I gave was to leave out a couple of small parts that had been jamming up the bill. The bill passed the Senate and the House unamended and was signed. And now you see needle disposals in restrooms and all sorts of places. And the issue has never had to be readdressed. Later, I became the Health, Edu- cation, Labor, and Pensions chair, and Senator Kennedy was the ranking member. We used the 80-percent tool. We were able to get 35 bills through the HELP Committee in the 109th Con-gress. Twenty-seven of them made their way to the President's desk and were signed into public law. In be-tween, we were able to report out 352 nominations for consideration by the full Senate. Here is how the 80-percent tool worked. At the beginning of each year, each of us made a list of the issues the committee should do. We compared lists. We made an effort to argue some to be on both lists. Then we worked on the ones on both lists. We usually had a duplication of about 80 percent of the issues. Then we could pick out any issue and work on it, usually agreeing on 80 percent of that issue. If we couldn't find a new way to do the part that had been argued for years, we sim-ply left it out, believing that 80 percent finished is better than 20 percent that only makes the press. The 80-percent tool is where all of our energy, attention, and talents could be focused. If we just worked on the 20 percent that we don't agree on, and never will agree on, we will only generate headlines about how hard we are working, with nothing actually getting done, just gridlock. When the news comes on, if we are here in the Chamber arguing and bick-ering and getting nothing done, we are focusing too much on the 20 percent. If people do not see much of us, that means we are taking on the 80 percent and making progress without headlines and often with unanimous consent. What we are really talking about is working together. That is what the heart of the 80-percent tool is. Often-times, people say what we need is more bipartisanship, and there is a very practical reason for that. In the Sen-ate, you can't get anything done with-out working with the other side unless one party has 60 votes or more, which is rare. And even with 60 votes from one party, the bills that party passes when they have a supermajority often are flawed. It turns out that when we work together, we can create a better bill than when we just try do it alone or force others to accept our ideas. That is why success is not really about compromise. It is really about what you leave out\u2014or finding a way to ac-complish it doing a mutually agreeable new way. We used to take the people who had similar amendments and send them off to see if they could come up with one amendment. Quite often, they could. It was fascinating, when they came back, they said: It was my idea. And when all of them report to you that it was their idea, you know that you have enough votes to pass it. That is why success is not really about compromise; it is about what you leave out or finding a third way to come up with a mutually agreeable goal. Here are a few key steps that I used to find that common ground to pass legislation. First, find someone from the other side of the aisle who likes to legislate. Second, discover and agree on com- mon goals. Third, consult with stakeholders that will or could affect the changes being discussed. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:06 Dec SENATE S7159 December 2, 2020 Fourth, hold roundtables instead of hearings. With hearings, each side beats up on the other's witness with clever, stump-the-professor-type ques-tions. At a roundtable, people who have actually done something on a policy share their real-life experiences. Finally, you set aside the part of the issues you can't agree on for another day. Now you will have a bill that has a good chance of being passed and signed into law. That is the heart of the 80-percent tool. This way of working also ensures that we can disagree without being dis-agreeable. There is a lot of vitriol in our politics and our world right now, but you can stay true to what you be-lieve in without treating others badly. Nothing gets done when we are just telling each other how wrong we are. Just ask yourself, has anyone ever really changed your opinion by getting in your face and yelling at you or say-ing how wrong you are? Usually, that doesn't change hearts or minds. That might make the attacker feel better in the moment, but it doesn't do much for getting anything accomplished. Fol-lowing the 80-percent tool will not get you notoriety. It won't get you fame. It won't get you headlines. Most media coverage requires ''blood in the water.'' However, the ability to work among your peers using this method can, and will, move us forward and get things done. This tool is only successful if we are actually working on passing legislation together, and that means letting the Senate work as it was intended. One of the best ways to do that is to allow the members of each committee to actu-ally take time to craft bills. The com-mittees are where the experts are and where I think some of the best work gets done. I have already made it clear that I don't think hearings are overly useful and are often wasted on col-lecting soundbites for the evening news. Instead, we should be encour-aging committees to give their mem-bers more say in crafting legislation and working together on best solu-tions. If you look at bills that pass with strong bipartisan support, they are usually because flaws were ironed out in committee. Legislation is often-times at its best when it has taken time in committees being hashed out until it is ready for prime time. You might not always be able to get every-one on board, but if you have done it right, you should see strong bipartisan support. Sometimes this also means letting others take credit for your ideas. An old salesman's trick is to convince oth-ers that your good idea was really their good idea. Don't let your vanity stand in the way of getting the job done. Too often, in the modern Senate, leg- islation is rushed out of committee to the Senate floor. And then once it hits the Senate floor, both sides try to pre-vent amendments, but the process of allowing amendments and debates is a core component of how the Senate was designed to operate. Without it, the Senate can get gummed up. The gears can get jammed. Without the fresh air that new ideas and legitimate debate brings, tensions can rise as Senators feel unable to make progress. The difficulty is that each party is so worried about the next election, look-ing to hold on to the majority, that ev-erybody is either trying to force the other side to take politically perilous votes or trying to avoid taking those votes themselves. No matter which party is in charge, we end up blocking amendments and shying away from al-lowing legislation to be altered on the floor of the Senate. And usually those tough votes don't really make any dif-ference. It might help if Members made it clear to leadership they would be will-ing to take some tough votes in return for more chances to amend major legis-lation on the floor. People might be less likely to demand votes on a poison pill or messaging designed to put the other party in a tough spot if they knew they could face the same treat-ment. In the end, the onus is on the Members of the Senate, on us, to take on a responsibility to work together in return for a chance to pass legislation. I suggest that amendments should have to have 60 votes. If it was so bad that it needed a filibuster, the 60 votes would be required to end that. But that takes about 3 days. So many have been willing to allow their amendment to have a 60-vote threshold, and if it was strong enough, it passed anyway. I also ask you to avoid comprehen- sive. Comprehensive bills make it so large that everyone can find a reason to vote against it. Senator A LEXANDER is a big promoter of step-by-step. That is taking a piece of legislation and solving it, and then taking the next step and solving it, and so on. This practical solution would avoid passing comprehensive legislation. Comprehen-sive legislation is usually a byproduct of compromise, not common ground, and often ends up being incomprehen-sible. Giant bills that try to do every-thing usually end up with too many un-intended consequences and include a litany of unrelated pieces of legislation that are merely hitching a ride because otherwise they would never be able to stand on their own merits. These ''Christmas tree'' bills are often designed so that if you vote against it, you would be voting against some key legislation for your constitu-ents. Once again, the ugly nature of compromise over common ground is clear. A simple solution I have proposed would be to pass more bills as indi-vidual pieces of legislation, that step- by-step. In Wyoming, bills have to be focused on a single subject, and all amendments need to be relevant. In the past, I have introduced a bill that would require that here, but it never was really treated seriously. To talk on a little different article, my favorite article of the Constitution is article V. The reason it is, is it assures that all States will have equal representation in the Senate. And that can't even be changed by a constitu-tional Congress. Since I come from one of those low-population States, it is very important to us. Sometimes we are criticized for being overrepresented in the Senate. We have two Senators, the same as California, New York, and Texas. But in this argument of unfair representation for States, we find the same inherent issues we do with the fil-ibuster; our government was not set up to be majority rule by population alone. Our Founders, through their own debate, were able to understand the risk of pure democracy and the benefits of a federalist system, where ideas were represented not just by population but by regions and shared cultures. Wyo-mingites deserve to have their cultural say in our system protected against the majority. We are all in the United States of America. The Senate represents more than just the people. To protect the individuality of the States, of the culture of those who live in the regions of the country less populated, and it also represents States that founded our federalist sys-tem. Of course, at that time, several of them had little population. I have covered a lot of ground, but for my last piece of advice, I would call on my colleagues to recognize that it is time to formally allow electronics on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is an issue near and dear to my heart and one I think will help how we work in the Senate. It is clear that anyone who watches C-SPAN that all of us are al-ready breaking the spirit of the law, checking our phones on occasion as we walk off or onto the floor. Those de-vices are often inseparable from our ability to do our work. We rely on them to do almost everything. It is time to make this commonsense change, allowing iPads to be used for speeches, as long as they are laid on the lectern like a paper speech. And if Senators could do some work from their desks, like early Senators had to do, we would listen to more of the speeches and get something done. I do remember when I brought that one up before, that it was covered by\u2014 in 1997, I thought it was important that we have that use. TIME magazine did a special article on it. I remember Sen-ator M CCONNELL going to New York City and coming back to report to me that he got in a cab and the cabdriver said: You are a United States Senator, aren't you? Of course, he proudly was. The guy said: So when are you going to let the guy from Wyoming have his computer on the floor? Senator M CCON- NELL told me if I had lobbied it down to cabbies, that it was time to do it. But we still haven't done it. As we move forward, of course, our country has no shortage of problems we need to address. Some are out of our control, but many of our own making. If my experience over the years has taught me anything, it is that we will VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:06 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7160 December 2, 2020 never be able to tackle these chal- lenges unless we find common areas of agreements and work to solve these problems together. I hope that everyone listening\u2014espe- cially my colleagues in the Senate\u2014re-members the core values I spoke of today: Do what is right. Do what is best. Treat others as they wish to be treated. I truly believe if we adhered to these ideals, the world would be a better place for our children and grand-children. I want, again, to thank the people of Wyoming for giving me the oppor-tunity to serve them. I also want to thank my colleagues and friends who supported me over the years. I want to thank all the amazing staff I have had over the years in my personal office, in the DC office, in my State offices in Wyoming; and my staff on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee and on the Budget Committee. Over the years, I have gotten to work with incredible staff that made it pos-sible to do more than a Senator by himself or herself could ever do. Thank you for working so hard over the years. I also want to give the most thanks to my family for all of their support over the years, especially to my wife Diana. It has been a long journey since I told Diana that I was thinking of run-ning for mayor. You have supported me more than anyone can truly comprehend, and, in no uncertain terms, I couldn't have done it without you. It has been more than 50 amazing years together, and I look forward to our next adventure. I yield the floor. (Applause, Senators rising.) The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C OT- TON). The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to this great Wyoming leader. For nearly a quarter of a century, M IKE ENZIhas represented the people of Wy- oming in Washington, and he has done it with intelligence, with intensity, and with integrity. The Cowboy State and the Capitol are going to sorely miss M IKEENZI. He has truly supplemented his legacy as the trusted trail boss of the Wyoming congressional delegation, and it has been an incredible honor and a great privilege for my wife Bobbi and me to serve the people of Wyoming alongside M IKEand his wife, Diana, who is with us today. MIKEis truly a devoted family man, as well as a man of great and deep faith. In fact, M IKE taught Sunday school over the decades. Many in the Wyoming faith community know that M IKE's first Sunday schoolteacher in Thermopolis, WY, was my wife Bobbi's mother Jerry Brown. Jerry and her husband Bob, a World War II and Korean war veteran, both passed away this past year, and they had been married 70 years. She taught Sunday school in Thermopolis, WY, and her star pupil was M IKEENZI, to the point that she actually gave M IKE ENZIhis first Bible, and he still has that today. Here in the Senate, M IKEhas been not just a close friend to me and a mentor to me, but he has been that to many Members of this body. M IKEwas sworn in 1997. Throughout four terms in the U.S. Senate, he has never wavered in his commitment to God, to family, to country, and, of course, to Wyoming. He is known by many as the Senate's moral compass. He is a remarkable spiritual leader of our bipartisan Prayer Breakfast. I am a member of that group and a number of Senators are as well. We met today, and M IKEled us in prayer. I have seen firsthand just how much Republican and Democrat Members de-pend on M IKEfor his moral and ethical guidance. He really is a bipartisan not just policymaker but also a peace-maker, and we have all seen it within this body. His legislation\u2014he talked about the 80-20 rule. It has a long history of gar-nering overwhelming bipartisan sup-port. Over 100 Enzi bills have become law. I have been proud to sponsor and cosponsor many of them with him in my time in the Senate. The thing he didn't point out is that most of the bills passed with over 80 votes. It is rare for an Enzi bill to get to the floor and pass with any more than 15 to 18 ''no'' votes. It is a remarkable accom-plishment. It is important to note that these bills have been signed by Republican and Democrat Presidents. When you go into his office, his whole conference room walls are filled with bills and pens\u2014signed into law with the pens being used by Bill Clinton, by George W. Bush, by Barack Obama, and by President Donald Trump. Behind all of these, as he just talked about, is that very successful 80-20 rule\u2014a rule that he learned while in the Wyoming State Legislature, and it has worked extremely well for him here in Washington as well. But such is the practical Western wisdom in M IKEENZI. Born in 1944 in Bremerton, WA, his father was there serving in the naval shipyards during World War II. He moved his family to Wyoming shortly thereafter, and that is when he started elementary school in Thermopolis, WY. They moved to Sheridan, where he graduated from high school. M IKEdidn't talk about this today, but there M IKEearned his Eagle Scout award. He is a proud Eagle Scout, as is his son Brad. His grandson is working on it as well. M IKEhas been named a ''Distinguished Eagle'' by the Scouts. He has a bachelor's degree in ac- counting from George Washington Uni-versity and an MBA in retail mar-keting from the University of Denver in Colorado. M IKEand Diana moved to Gillette in 1969, where they started their own small business. It is wonderful to listen to M IKEtalk about small businesses. It is called NZ Shoes, not as he spells his last name, E-N-Z-I, but the letter ''N'' and the letter ''Z'' so people could re-member NZ Shoes. They later expanded their successful family business to Miles City, MT, and to Sheridan, WY. But Gillette, WY, is M IKE's true home and where his heart is. He served 2 terms as Gillette's mayor. During his 8 years as mayor, M IKEled Gillette to their first economic boom. He served 10 years in the Wyoming State Legisla-ture as a State rep, as well as a State senator. Wyoming is M IKE's world. Family means the world to M IKE. They are the proud parents of three: Amy, Emily, and Brad; and even prouder grandparents of four: Megan, Allison, Trey, and Lilly. Now, anyone who knows M IKEknows that he loves to fish. Even during Pray-er Breakfast today, when you watched on the Zoom call, behind M IKEyou could see on the wall the fishing rod and all the lures he uses in fishing on display. He is an accomplished and avid fly-fisherman. In August 2015, he achieved every fly-fisherman's dream, completing his Wyoming Cutt-Slam. This Wyoming Game and Fish Depart-ment program increases appreciation for our native cutthroat trout. If you want to talk to M IKEabout anything, talk to him about fishing. His passion comes through with his love of nature for spending so much time in nature's cathedral of the great outdoors. He fishes in majestic spots throughout Wyoming and all over the world. Well, here in Washington, M IKEhas been a leading voice on budget, on tax, and on healthcare issues. He serves on the Senate Budget Committee and has been chairman since 2015. As the first accountant to chair the Budget Com-mittee, M IKEis committed to making government more accountable to hard- working American taxpayers. He has been a tremendous Budget chairman. That is because he learned valuable lessons in the Wyoming Legislature where, like all American families, you need to balance your budget every year and live within your means. Under M IKE's leadership, Congress passed balanced budget resolutions for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and 2018. He worked tirelessly to pass these budg-ets\u2014even working through the night all week for the marathon floor debates called vote-aramas. His budget blue-prints offered a better fiscal path by re-ducing wasteful spending, by light-ening tax burdens, and by boosting eco-nomic growth. M IKE's fiscal year 2018 budget not only provided a path to balance; it paved the way for pro-growth, pro-jobs tax relief legislation, the most com-prehensive reform in the Tax Code in over a generation. As a reconciliation bill, this historic 2017 tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, went through M IKE's Budget Committee. As Budget chairman, M IKEhas also focused on the soaring national debt, budget process reform, and oversight of Federal programs. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:06 Dec SENATE S7161 December 2, 2020 MIKEalso served as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee since his arrival in the Senate. And as a former chair-man and ranking member, he cham-pioned the efforts to ensure a quality education for all. He expanded access to affordable, quality healthcare, and he spearheaded the most significant pension reform in 30 years, securing millions of Americans' retirement. He is also a member of the Senate Fi- nance Committee, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Other policy successes include im- proving mine safety, helping end the AIDS epidemic in Africa, and passing mental health parity. M IKE's highest priority, of course, has always been helping the people of Wyoming. As he said in announcing his retirement, ''I am an advocate for Gil-lette and Campbell County and Wyo-ming.'' He went on to say, ''I point out that everyone lives at the local level. No one lives at the Federal level\u2014or even the state level.'' He said, ''So Diana and I are your Chamber of Com-merce and economic development peo-ple for every town and county in Wyo-ming all the time.'' M IKEstarted several annual events to boost our State\u2014the Inventors Con-ference, the Procurement Conference, and Wyoming Works Tours. In 2009, M IKEand I started Wyoming Wednesdays, and it quickly became a big hit. This is a great tradition. When people of Wyoming come to Wash-ington, we greet them every week and get together for coffee and host a time of doughnuts and friendship, and people love to attend. But M IKE, as well as Diana, are a force in the Senate. Diana did it again just recently. M IKEhas called Diana ''the most thoughtful person'' in the world, and that is no exaggeration. Here in the Senate, every year Diana hosts a Christmas cookie party to thank, as they describe, the ''real workers'' who keep the Senate run-ning\u2014the janitors, cleaning crews, electricians, police officers, and food service workers. Every year, Diana and her friends work hundreds of hours and bake hundreds of dozens of cookies. All the Senate workers look forward to Diana's 200-dozen cookie thank-you event. That is not 200 cookies. It is 200 dozen cookies. It is not unusual for people to come up to Diana in the hall-way and ask when the party is. M IKEis the wonderful cohost. This year, because of coronavirus, she couldn't do all the baking, but they have the cookie festival with baked cookies. Those who couldn't get to re-ceive them in locations, M IKE and Diana walked the halls of this building and the Senate office buildings to make sure that the guards and the custodians and janitors and others got their Christmas cookies. M IKEis usually a man of few words, but in a recent Prayer Breakfast, he re-minded everyone about the importance of thinking before we speak. He titled his presentation ''Me and My Big Mouth.'' He reminded us that our mouths cannot be trained\u2014as you said, M IKE\u2014only guarded. MIKEis a true Wyoming gentleman, someone who will always be a great friend and a mentor to me, to younger people in Wyoming, and to everyone here in the Senate. In my office, there is a picture on the wall of my first day in the Senate, right here in 2007, being sworn in by then-Vice President Cheney, with Sen-ator E NZI, along with former Senator Malcolm Wallop, standing behind. It has been a tremendous privilege to serve with M IKEfrom the very first day in the U.S. Senate. The people of Wyoming owe him an incredible debt of gratitude for his tire-less and faithful service. M IKE's char- acter, his courage, and his credibility have cemented his legacy as a highly respected leader of the Senate. So today many Senators are here gathering to listen to, to honor, and to thank M IKEENZIfor his decades of dis- tinguished service to the Nation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as- sistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is hard to follow those heartfelt words from Senator B ARRASSO about his col- league and friend and our friend M IKE ENZI, but I am going to make a try. Just as our tribute to L AMAR ALEX- ANDER was a tribute to the better an- gels of nature as they are shown in the lives of Senators, so, too, was M IKE ENZI. I join my colleagues in thanking MIKEfor his service to Wyoming and to America. One of the most frequent questions many of us are asked is, Why can't you folks get along in Washington? Why can't you just do things together? I say to them that there are times when we do, and the many times are very impor-tant. When we do come together, it is because of people like M IKE, who worked under his so-called 80-20 rule. We know that well, don't we? He would tell you he believes both sides could agree on 80 percent of the substance, and if negotiators are willing to give up the other 20 percent, we could actu-ally get some things done around here. Wouldn't that be refreshing? One of those items was the Market- place Fairness Act. M IKEhelped to lead the fight for local brick-and-mortar re-tailers in order to give them a chance to compete on an equal and level play-ing field with online sellers, email companies, and internet companies and to allow the States and localities to collect much needed sales tax revenue. It is hard to imagine how many years M IKEput into that effort, but the Mar- ketplace Fairness Act would have given the States the option to require from out-of-State businesses, such as those selling online, the collection of taxes owed under State law in the same way local businesses are required. M IKEknew a lot about local business. As was mentioned on the floor by Sen-ator B ARRASSO , his colleague, he was a small business owner in Gillette, WY, running NZ Shoes. Even as he went on to become mayor of Gillette at age 30, a staff sergeant in the Wyoming Air National Guard, a State representa-tive, and then a State senator, he was always still the small business man from Gillette. In 1996, when he was recovering from open-heart surgery, then-Senator Alan Simpson decided not to run for reelec- tion. Local leaders kept trying to talk M IKEinto running. He really just want- ed to have more time to hunt and fish. In the end, he made an important deci-sion. He ran, and he won. His career has had many legislative successes in having used his 80-20 rule. I will never forget the days when Ted Kennedy would come to the floor and talk about the compromise and the bargain he had struck with you. I had thought what a political odd couple, but the two of you did some remark-able things. Poles apart in terms of political phi- losophy, they treated each other with respect, and they had amazing suc-cesses to show for it. Even when he has differing views on the best ways to re-solve issues, M IKEENZIshows a willing- ness to come to the table and discuss the areas in which we can agree. In 2012, Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan retired. I called M IKE after Byron left and asked if I could take up Byron's position in his fight for the Marketplace Fairness Act. He said: Let's do it. We brought in Senator L AMAR ALEXANDER \u2014that was a pretty smart move\u2014and then Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who both made great con-tributions to our work. It was our luck that Heidi Heitkamp was the petitioner of the 1992 Supreme Court case Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, which made the Marketplace Fairness Act necessary. We were an unexpected group of Sen- ators\u2014two Republicans and two Demo-crats who were literally from all over the United States. We disagreed on some things, sure, but we agreed that Main Street business needed a break and deserved fair treatment. We kept working on it with M IKEENZI's leader- ship, and, in 2013, the Marketplace Fairness Act passed the Senate, over-whelmingly, with 69 votes. Unfortu-nately, the House of Representatives, once again, broke our heart and didn't act on it. We kept introducing the bill. Main Street businesses were still struggling against the unfair advan-tage that internet-only retailers had. Visitors to my office might have no-ticed a little something that was in my office that I have brought to the floor today and wondered what this was all about. This was a gift from M IKEENZI after we were successful in the U.S. Senate. It is a small, wooden, three- note train whistle. It would be a viola-tion of the Senate rules to blow the whistle, but I want to tell you that it was a gift from M IKEfor our work we did together in helping to get the bill down the tracks of the legislative proc-ess. VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:06 \u2014 SENATE S7162 December 2, 2020 We were never able to get the House to take up the measure, but, in 2018, the Supreme Court finally did the right thing. In a 5-to-4 ruling in South Da- kota v. Wayfair, Inc., the Court closed the loophole we had been struggling to fight and address for years. I am proud to be a part of that bipartisan coali-tion. In Illinois, it has meant a lot. We estimate that our State has received $460 million in annual revenue by vir-tue of M IKEENZI's determination and leadership on the marketplace fairness front. In this pandemic crisis, this revenue is more important than ever. M IKEhas always been a force for fairness, a friend, and a leader for whom I have great respect. As we fight this pan-demic, we should strive to abide by M IKE's 80-20 rule and remember that Main Street businesses are really hurt-ing and need our help. I know M IKEwill have more time now for fishing and hunting. I wish him and Diana, his wonderful wife\u2014and she is a wonderful person\u2014and their grand-children happiness. I look forward to reading about the next chapter in M IKE ENZI's life of giving and caring. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, M IKE ENZIand I were both sworn in to do our first terms in the U.S. Senate on Janu-ary 7, 1997. I immediately saw in the gentleman from Wyoming a quiet, ef-fective, and ethical leader who was fo-cused not on partisan advantage but, rather, on results\u2014results that would benefit the people who had sent him to Washington and results that would benefit the American people as a whole. The nearly 24 years since then have only confirmed my initial impression. For the first 14 of those years, M IKE was the sole accountant in the Senate. That discipline, combined with his ex-perience as a small business owner, have served him so well in his role as chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget. He knows how important it is to set a budget, to follow it, and to control spending. His priority has al-ways been the American taxpayer. As chairman of the Committee on the Budget and as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, he has been a leader on tax issues as well. He helped to shape the 2017 tax reform act, which has helped to boost economic growth and the creation of more jobs. M IKE's leadership style is character- ized by his willingness to always search for common ground. He described in great depth today what he calls his 80- 20 rule, and anyone who has ever worked with M IKEENZIon any issue quickly learns about the 80-20 rule. Through it, he forges solutions where many others see only impasse. The key to success in moving legislation, as he told us today, is to focus on the 80 per-cent of issues on which agreement can be found and not waste time on the 20 percent on which the disagreements are insurmountable. That rule served him well when he, along with the late Senator Ted Ken-nedy, sat at the helm of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Well, as M IKEhas described today, it would be difficult to think of two individuals serving in the Senate who had more different polit-ical philosophies than he and Ted Ken-nedy. You could probably say that this is true with his current ranking mem-ber of the Budget Committee. Yet, to-gether, he and Senator Kennedy craft-ed dozens of laws. Neither side got 100 percent of what it wanted. They put aside the areas of disagreement. For them, it was far more important that progress was made for the American people. In serving with M IKEon the HELP Committee, I have seen him employ this rule over and over again to bring about real progress. He has led efforts to help to ensure that everyone can re-ceive a quality education. He has helped to provide Americans with ac-cess to affordable, quality healthcare. He has helped to protect workers and foster job training opportunities. As the leader of the committee, he has worked to oversee the biggest revision in pension laws in 30 years\u2014to strengthen funding rules to enhance re-tirement security for millions of Amer-icans. M IKEcomes from a small business background, and as Senator D URBIN just described, he was passionate about the Marketplace Fairness Act\u2014to en-able States to collect sales and use taxes from out-of-State online retail-ers. He recognized that the brick-and- mortar Main Street businesses that provide local jobs should not be penal-ized. M IKEand I also worked together on successful legislation to improve workplace safety for postal employees and to better protect the American people from deceptive mailings that mimic official government documents. Senator M IKEENZIhas compiled a long record of selfless service as a busi-ness leader, as a member of the Wyo-ming Air National Guard, as a mayor, as a State legislator, and as an in-volved citizen. When he announced his intention early last year to leave the Senate, he said that he had no definite plans other than to find other ways to serve. I am 100 percent certain that the author of the 80-20 rule will continue to contribute to his community, his State, and our Nation. I wish him and his beloved wife Diana all the best in the years to come. I thank the Presiding Officer. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of working with my chairman on the Budget Committee on budget reform initiatives, and I want to take this occasion to thank him for the wonderful way in which he worked with me on those issues and for all of his support. I want to make a pledge to him as well. The effort began with a lot of hearings in the Budget Committee to sort out how we could reform what we were doing. At the moment, the Budget Committee is, probably, the most dys-functional piece of this dysfunctional institution, and Chairman E NZIwas de- termined to remedy that. A lot of work went in at the committee level. Then a bicameral committee was created to look at budget reform, primarily out of the House, and I had the opportunity to serve on that bicameral committee. That was an opportunity that I owe to Chairman E NZI. He both advocated for me to his leader that I should be on that committee, and he gave up a spot on that committee to make sure there was a spot for me there. I hope and be-lieve that I conducted myself in due ac-cord with Chairman E NZI's wishes and principles in the course of that. We had the ability to use that bi- cameral committee process to do a test run of our budget reform, and I am pleased to report that, although the end product was never adopted between the two bodies, the product that came out of the committee included our budget reform as it was then con-stituted. We raised our aspiration from the budget reform as it was then con-stituted, which was entirely voluntary, to actually try to change the Budget Committee's rules to force the process of the Budget Committee into the mold of the voluntary structure. We did good work on that, and we came to an agree-ment. I am sorry to say that its failure to pass into law arose not from prob-lems on the Republican side of the aisle but from problems on my side of the aisle that I have been unable to yet surmount. My pledge to you, Chairman E NZI, is that I will keep at it. Senator B LUNT is here, and he is helpful in that regard. Senator L ANKFORD and Senator P ERDUE are here, and we have a good team, along with Senator K AINE, Senator KING, myself, and others on our side\u2014 another being Senator S HAHEEN . So I will continue the work. I vow to you that I will somehow find a way to get this done, and if I can find a way to call it the Enzi reform, I will find a way to call it the Enzi reform. I will long remember the relationship we had and the good work we did to-gether. I will long remember your 80/20 rule. And maybe\u2014because I have a similar proposal in Rules\u2014maybe we will even be able to get your phones and electronics amendment passed. So thank you to you, sir, for doing what is right, doing your best, and treating others as they would want to be treated. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I feel a little guilty, as the chairman of the Rules Committee, standing in between the Enzi desire to get the devices on the floor. I have watched in recent weeks. If you looked around on the floor, you would assume that we had adopted that VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:06 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7163 December 2, 2020 rule. It is a pretty hard rule to enforce with all the information that Senator E NZIalways knew was there and need- ed to be available in ways that we have not made it available yet. I just want to stand as a particular friend of M IKEENZI. We came to the Congress at the same time. I came to the House, and he came to the Senate. He and Diana and I were together on travel fairly early in that we had an opportunity to go to Lithuania, as they were desperately trying to get included in NATO. And, M IKE, you remember walking on that little square where people had their signs up: We want in NATO. They had been left behind one time; they didn't want to be left behind another time. But that is one of the many memo- ries I have with M IKE. Another is just M IKE's incredible ca- pacity to listen. I think without ques-tion and by plenty of evidence, M IKEis the best listener in the Senate. In fact, he has listening sessions in his State, where what he does, shockingly, is lis-ten. His talking is at a minimum at those sessions. His interest in taking in input from whoever wants to talk\u2014you can envision M IKEat the front of the room with his notepad, taking notes on what everybody says, and then often the move from one speaker to the next is ''Thank you'' and ''Let's hear what other people have to say,'' and he ab-sorbs that in a great way. There are many times when I have come to M IKEin the Senate and said: Tell me what you are thinking about this. And it is amazing how much you can learn by listening. M IKEso often has a different view, a more nuanced view than others do because of that. I also thought, M IKE, as you were speaking today\u2014I know that your driv-er in the State is usually Diana. And even describing the return from the Jaycees event back to Gillette, I no-ticed who was driving, that you spent so many hours together and miles to-gether in a State that maybe doesn't have the most people, but it sure has lots of distance, and I know it was just a challenge to get home to Wyoming every week and then to get to the place you live in Wyoming, in Gillette, as often as you can, and that is not often possible. But what an honor and privilege to serve with you, to spend these 24 years in the Congress together, and for me to get to spend the last 10 years of your Senate time here in the Senate with you. It is a great honor. It is a great privilege. I am trying to learn all I can about listening from the master listener who then takes all that information and ac-tually produces, as we have heard here today, real results. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just want to thank all the people who came and listened, and I hope there were other Senators who were watching on their televisions and taking notes on the 80- percent tool and other things that I mentioned. But I just appreciate the friendships that I have had here. I have no qualms about leaving because of the quality of people who will still be here, still solv-ing problems for America. There is some great teamwork that never gets any publicity but that actu-ally functions around here, and I can't thank my friends enough, particularly Senator B ARRASSO , who has been a part of this team and has helped to bring me along. I have learned a lot from him and gotten to do a lot with him, and he and his wife are good friends of ours. It is not all that common to be good friends with the other person in your delegation, but we have a strong dele-gation and get along well that way. I want to thank Senator W HITEHOUSE for his comments and particularly his promise that he is going to get some reform done so that the committee is actually doing what everybody thinks it does\u2014providing a budget that we will follow. Those were goods reform principles that we put together. I have always said that the only time we are going to have reform to the budget is if we can do it just before a Presidential election year because no-body knows who is going to be in the majority in the Senate and the House, and nobody knows who is going to be the President. Otherwise, we want to make sure that we can keep all of the control for our party that we can. I want to thank Senator B LUNT . I ac- tually remember trying to get some local food and running into Senator B LUNT , who was also looking for local food overseas, and so we had local food together. That was our first year in Congress. I have known him for a long time, and I appreciate your comments. So thank you, everybody. Thank you, all the people from Wyoming.

Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate has just passed the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, 96 to 1, a bill that will bring relief to many Americans suffering from a terrible disease. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. People with ALS tragically lose the ability to con-trol their muscles, leading to paralysis and, ultimately, death. There is no cure. Many are familiar with ALS because of the baseball legend who succumbed to it at the height of his career, Lou Gehrig. Others know Lou Gehrig's dis-ease because it has touched them or a neighbor or a loved one. I have been fortunate to know sev- eral people with ALS. One of my ear-liest supporters in my first campaign was the great Tommy May of Pine Bluff. Tommy, amazingly, has lived with ALS for nearly 15 years, beating the odds with courage and good humor. Given the gift of time, he devoted his energy to finding a cure for ALS, serv-ing as a trustee on the national ALS Association board. ALS advocates are lucky to have a fighter like Tommy on their side. I have also been fortunate to know Kip Jackson of Little Rock and Thom-as Galyon of Rogers and others. Sadly, these ALS advocates have passed away, but I know how pleased they would be to see this bill cross the finish line today. ALS is not like other diseases. It typically appears, without warning, later in life. Its life expectancy within 16 months is only 50 percent\u2014no better than a coin toss. In other words, ALS strikes fast, and it strikes hard. People with ALS typically apply for disability benefits through Social Se-curity. There is a problem. Disability has a 5-month waiting period. This waiting period is meant to ensure that applicants aren't suffering from a tem-porary affliction, and under most cir-cumstances, it is appropriate. But, of course, ALS isn't temporary. For those who have it, given the odds they face, every month counts. That is why, years ago, Senator W HITEHOUSE and I introduced the ALS Disability In-surance Access Act, which will waive this 5-month period for people with ALS. This will ensure they have rapid access to Social Security in the early days of their diagnosis, so they don't have to worry about benefits and can focus instead on the things that really matter during what could be their final months on Earth. On their behalf, I want to thank Sen- ator W HITEHOUSE for his partnership over the years. I want to thank Sen-ator B RAUN for what he has done to help get this bill across the finish line today. I am pleased so many of our col-leagues supported this bill. I want to explain briefly my position on the amendment offered by Senator G RASSLEY . I support the amendment in concept, but I opposed the amendment today because the original purpose of this bill has always been to address ALS specifically. I will support Senator G RASSLEY 's language in future legislation, but to pass this bill in the final days of the 116th Congress, the Senate\u2014and espe-cially in the days ahead in the House\u2014 it was vital that we send the unamended bill to the House. I look forward to working with Sen- ator G RASSLEY in the next Congress to ensure the sustainability of both the Social Security Disability and the ALS trust fund. He has been a great partner in protecting these vital programs, and I know he will be in the future. Finally, I want to close by quoting Lou Gehrig's final address at Yankee Stadium in 1939. He had just received his fatal diagnosis. He didn't focus on the hardships that lay in his future. In-stead, he famously exclaimed: I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth. . . . I might have been given a bad break, but I have an awful lot to live for. The same could be said of every per- son living with ALS today. They have an awful lot to live for, and this bill will help them live. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator C OTTON for his work with me in getting this bill to this happy result. As the Presiding Officer knows, a bill can look like it was easy to get done when it passes 96 to 1, but that doesn't mean that the pathway was easy. This has been years and years of effort. Senator C OTTON really helped make it possible, so I am very grateful to him. I also want to thank Senator B RAUN , who was the first Republican Member to join me in this and who has been a constant ally and source of support and encouragement. I would also like to extend my appre- ciation to Chairman G RASSLEY of the Finance Committee. This is a Finance Committee jurisdiction bill. Chairman G RASSLEY was willing to let it go for- ward as long as he got his amend-ment\u2014without insisting on his amend-ment being part of the bill. He got his vote. We voted it down, and the bill has now gone forward, and that reflects a very high degree of forbearance and courtesy from Chairman G RASSLEY , which I respect and appreciate. I also want to thank the ranking member on Finance, Senator W YDEN , VerDate Sep 11 2014 \u2014 SENATE S7165 December 2, 2020 who has worked very hard to make sure that finance issues were resolved and that he was comfortable with it. He and G RASSLEY were able to give it committee clearance to come to the floor with their support on these terms. I also want to thank Senator L EE\u2014 MIKELEE\u2014for his forbearance. He has been interested in this bill in the past. We debated it on the Senate floor, and he has allowed it to proceed in this way also, so I am grateful to Senator L EE. Of course, that is all the gratitude here within the body for people who made the bill possible, but the people we really need to be grateful to and ap-preciative of are the ALS advocates who come to us to argue for support and for encouragement. They are filled with hope even though there is no cure. They continue to seek investment in the science to try to figure out a way to a cure. They show immense courage. This is a devastating, uniquely bad diagnosis for somebody to get. It is very hard for the individual who re-ceives the diagnosis and also terrible for their family as well. We have all had the experience in this body of seeing our constituents come to advocate on ALS and have the experience of seeing them the first time they come to us with a cane. When they come back the next year, they come back with a wheelchair and, the following year after that, come back with an electronic support mecha-nism with ventilator assistance and are still able to steer around, but it is an apparatus much more complex than a wheelchair. Then, in the next visit, it is their widow who comes alone. We have had the chance to do some- thing good here. It made no sense to re-quire people who have this diagnosis wait 5 months before they can begin to get Social Security Disability Insur-ance benefits. Actually, very often, that first 5 months is when the support makes the most difference in terms of the quality of life that remains during the course of the illness. We have been at this about 5 years now. Today is a good day in that sense. I want to call to mind, just as an ex- ample of how this strikes at home\u2014our small, local, home State paper, the Providence Journal, has a long tradi-tion of being a very distinguished newspaper. Very often people who worked for it went on to the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and big and fa-mous newspapers and made national names for themselves. The Providence Journal is a really significant news-paper. Just in the course of my time in politics, two of its writers have been stricken with ALS\u2014struck down, in fact, with ALS: Brian Dickinson, first, and Bill Malinowski afterward. Each had to learn to write in very unusual ways, including with their eyeballs by blinking as letters went by on a screen or by directing a laser. It is a terrible disease, ALS. But one thing that it does is it displays the ex-traordinary human character of people who fight on through this increasingly disabling condition. The courage that they show and the way that they per-sist\u2014in this case, to keep writing\u2014 Brian Dickinson was writing columns really until the end of his life\u2014stand as an example to all of us of what courage in impossible circumstances looks like. That is a blessing they give to all of us. With many thanks and much appre- ciation to J.R. Pagliarini, the presi-dent of Rhode Island ALS society, and his president emeritus, Kenneth McGunagle, and to their executive di-rector, Beth Flanagan, I am happy to get this done. Now we hope that in the final days of this Congress, our friends over in the House\u2014with 300-plus cosponsors on the bill in the House\u2014ought to be able to get out of each other's way and get this done before this Congress concludes. I yield the floor to my friend and col- league Senator B RAUN with great ap- preciation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Indiana. Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, today I rise in proud support of legislation that will break down barriers for those with medically determined ALS. ALS is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, gradually robbing patients of the ability to eat, speak, and eventu-ally breathe. Currently, there are no meaningful treatments, no known cause, and no cure. But today, we have reason to hope. Since 2016, Senators W HITEHOUSE and COTTON have championed the ALS Dis- ability Insurance Access Act. Thanks to their tireless efforts, we are about to give ALS patients and their families more timely access to their Social Se-curity disability benefits. No longer will these patients have to wait 5 months to access benefits they have earned. Passing this act will help alleviate some of the financial burdens that ac-company an ALS diagnosis and will allow patients and their families to focus their precious time where it needs to be\u2014on their loved ones and their battle against the disease. ALS is not a rare disease. More than 5,600 individuals in the United States are diagnosed each year, meaning 15 Americans are diagnosed each day. Not only is ALS common, it is also ex-tremely personal to many in this Chamber, and it is personal to me. My cousin Anne Seitz lost her battle with ALS on Thanksgiving Day 10 years ago. Her husband Terry Seitz currently resides in my hometown and is my State director of outreach. My budget and appropriations staff- er, Robert Ordway, and his sister Jen-nifer lost their father, Douglas Ray-mond Ordway, to the disease. Kathy Laesch, a member of my Indi- anapolis team, has a son Brian who was diagnosed with ALS this summer. Brian, who also lost his father, has for- tunately been enrolled in a clinical trial. We are all praying for his treat-ments to be effective. In the network of people I have come to know back home and here in the Senate, it shows you just how many lives are affected by it, and there are countless patients it has affected in the Hoosier State. I would like to personally thank Tina Kaetzel, the executive director of the Indiana ALS Association, for bringing this bill to the attention of our office. I would also like to give a heartfelt thank you to Corey Polen, of Brownsburg, IN, for his passionate and unwavering advocacy in support of the bill. Corey has become a friend to our office and has also been a champion of legislation I introduced, the Promising Pathway Act, which would provide new FDA authority to more rapidly approve drugs specifically for diseases like this. I would be remiss if I did not thank I AM ALS, especially Brian Wallach, Danielle Carnival, and Dan Tate, for their unyielding devotion to this and to fixing our broken healthcare sys-tem. Today, we come one step closer to ac- complishing this pursuit. It has been a great honor to cofound the first-ever Senate ALS Caucus with my colleague across the aisle, Senator C HRIS COONS , of Delaware. The passage of the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act has been a priority for this caucus since its inception about a year ago. We readily acknowledge that the bill's passage is long overdue and that there is much more work to be done. We look forward to rolling up our sleeves and coming together to advance policies in the fu-ture that will continue to improve the quality of life for ALS patients. In doing so, we celebrate ALS pa- tients\u2014those we have lost, those who are currently fighting this dreadful dis-ease, and those whose journeys have not yet begun. It is a disease that does not have the luxury of a large commu-nity from which to raise awareness and fight for reforms. ALS has no survivor community. It is up to us, then, to speak up for those who can no longer speak and to stand up for those who can no longer stand. To those whom we have lost to ALS and to those currently battling this disease\u2014Anne Seitz, Douglas Raymond Ordway, Brian Laesch, Corey Polen, Brian Wallach, Dan Tate, and so many others impacted by ALS\u2014we here in the U.S. Senate are your advocates. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Rhode Island. CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today is my 276th climate speech, and my increasingly battered graphic is showing its wear, but for the first time in a really, really long time, there is real hope for climate action in Amer-ica. The light of science will shine in a Biden administration. Our U.S. Gov-ernment will heed actual data. Agen-cies will act on facts. The White House VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:26 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7166 December 2, 2020 will care about the harm carbon pollu- tion does right now across the country. President Biden will restore the EPA to its role of safeguarding our air and water and will task the State Depart-ment to surge climate policy abroad. Every Department\u2014from Transpor-tation to the USDA, to HUD, to the SEC\u2014will have a role in turning this ship around before catastrophe. At last, the Biden administration will cleanse America's government of its grimy infestation of polluter lack-eys, stooges, and hangers-on and will shut off the disastrous handouts to fos-sil fuel industry donors. A flood of cleansing executive actions will wash away the grime. The American Presi-dency, with its great power, will shake free of the polluters' grip, but the Pres-idency alone cannot spare us. Congress must pass a comprehensive climate bill, stop rewarding polluters from polluting, and clean up our en-ergy market so it is not corrupted by or for the fossil fuel industry\u2014for in-stance, putting a real price on carbon to pay for the fossil fuel damage. We have to invest in new, green infrastruc-ture to create millions of jobs. We need to prepare communities along our coasts for rising seas, others for higher temperatures, and other climate dan-gers. We need to address the dangerous systemic financial risks fossil fuel pre-sents to our economic system. There is work to be done, and it is overdue. So what has been stopping us? Four years ago, Senate Democrats came to the Senate floor and here ex-posed this web of denial and obstruc-tion that had been built by the fossil fuel industry to prevent meaningful ac-tion on climate change. This evil web is a front for billionaire polluters like the Kochs and fossil fuel pushers like ExxonMobil and Marathon Petroleum. To hide its funders, this web uses creepy identity-scrubbing groups like Donors Trust and Donors Capital. They move money and people around in the web in a Whac-A-Mole array of dispos-able groups with misleadingly whole-some names like the Heartland Insti-tute and the Franklin Center for Gov-ernment and Public Integrity. Ben-jamin Franklin would vomit at this abuse of his name. Following Big Tobacco's playbook, this web of denial kept the polluters' fingerprints off the dirty work of sow-ing doubt about climate science, just as the tobacco industry fraudulently stood up front groups to dispense de-nial of the harms of tobacco. This pol-luter web of denial also kept the Re-publican Party in line by spending stunning amounts of money in Amer-ican politics. Dr. Robert Brulle, now at Brown Uni- versity, created this graphic off of his research, and it gives you a sense of how big and how complex this web of denial is that the fossil fuel industry stood up, and it is funded by huge amounts of dark money by anonymous funders. When we exposed this web back in 2016, fossil fuel giants like ExxonMobil said it was out of the climate denial and obstruction business. Exxon claimed it had not funded the Heart-land Institutes of the world for a dec-ade. Fossil fuel executives said they knew climate change was a threat, and they claimed to have turned the page on this nonsense. Well, that just ain't so. The network of phony front groups, identity-laun-dering outfits, and bogus PR cam-paigns is alive and well. Like any threatened crooked enterprise, it morphs to hide in its surroundings, but we just caught another glimpse of it through a New York Times expose of the corporate PR firm FTI Consulting. FTI started 40 years ago as a hired gun for parties in litigation and now offers virtually any nasty service a corpora-tion could need. According to the Times, the fossil fuel industry employs FTI for a lot of dirty work. One thing FTI does is to stand up fake front groups. The New York Times chronicles how organizations like Citi-zens to Protect PA Jobs, New Mexicans for Economic Prosperity, and the Lib-erty Energy Project actually all trace back to FTI through common employ-ees, internet domain registrations, and other ties. Each of these pop-up groups suggests that it is a broad coalition of regular Americans. Each sports a flashy website, like this one, with neighborly looking folk in scenic vis-tas, and, of course, they all make the fossil fuel case for cutting corporate taxes and slashing environmental pro-tections. We call these fake environ-mental grassroots groups ''Astroturf''\u2014a product manufactured by big, powerful special interests to look like grassroots support. This one is a classic\u2014Texans for Nat- ural Gas. The Times writes about this outfit: Acting as Texans for Natural Gas rep- resentatives, FTI employees have launched pro-industry petitions, produced videos and reports on the importance of the Permian Basin oil field, and written opinion pieces for local newspapers supporting fossil fuels. The site features testimonials from three women\u2014 I am quoting still\u2014 two of whom are represented with stock photos\u2014 Let me interrupt the quote for a minute because you know you can go to the internet and find stock photos of people you can use. So these aren't real testimonials. These are fake FTI testimonials with stock photos to make it look like it is credible. OK, I will go back to the quote: and one with a photo used without permis- sion from the Flickr page of a photographer in the Philippines. Classy, huh? This bag of polluter tricks is pretty familiar to those who have studied the web of denial here, but FTI is also pulling some new tricks. One new target is fossil fuel's own in- vestors. A new challenge for oil and gas companies is their own shareholders\u2014 even their biggest institutional inves-tors\u2014calling on them to identify and address climate risks. For instance, last spring, BlackRock, the largest in-stitutional investor in the world, voted at a shareholder meeting to remove two Exxon directors and install an independent Exxon chairman, all to improve this oil giant's ''insufficient progress'' in addressing its business risk from climate change. That kind of warning shot sends shivers down the spine of a big polluter. So there is FTI, which popped up a group in 2018 called Main Street Inves-tors, which commissioned studies argu-ing that activist shareholders harm shareholder value, and it launched a website, divestmentfacts.com, to argue against big university endowments, pension funds, and other big investors divesting from fossil fuels. The Times notes about this scheme: ''At least six academic papers published on this website were by professors who, in ad-dition to their university jobs, were also working for Compass Lexecon, [an] FTI subsidiary.'' Neat trick using shareholder money to fool shareholders. Who paid FTI to set up Main Street Investors? The National Association of Manufacturers, which the watchdog group Influence Map has called the worst climate obstructor in America. So it is no surprise that they are pay-ing for this phony nonsense. The ques-tion is, Who paid the National Associa-tion of Manufacturers to set this up? They won't say. So we have to take a guess. There is more that FTI is up to. Don't like your news coverage? FTI can build you your own news site. The Times found FTI lurking behind En-ergy In Depth and Western Wire\u2014two sites that churn out pro-fossil fuel arti-cles and spread them around the inter-net. With mass extinction of real local newspapers underway, FTI is busy set-ting up polluter news pages to fill the void. It is clever, if repulsive. Of course, FTI does dirty work on so- cial media. After New York City filed a climate lawsuit against Exxon, FTI launched a social media attack on New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. In a panto-mime twofer, FTI used content from its phony Energy In Depth news site in its paid-for social media attack. Who paid? They won't say. Take a guess. Another FTI campaign bought social media ads to steer people to another FTI front group, the Arctic Energy Center, which promotes\u2014guess what\u2014 drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off the Alaskan coast. In yet another campaign, FTI's shad- owy special strategic communications unit set up a phony Facebook profile to secretly track environmental pro-testers. It did this for Apache Energy, which wanted to drill for fossil fuel next to a State park in Texas. See the pattern? But wait. It gets even creepier than this, if you can believe it. FTI has a menu that it offers to its clients of fake personas. VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:42 SENATE S7167 December 2, 2020 These fake personas use fake social media and message board accounts to interfere in internet debate\u2014say by harassing local citizens who are con-cerned about pollution and who may be criticizing FTI's clients, so they will bomb into the internet debate around that, offering fake personas as the phony voice to disrupt that debate. This is actually their menu. You have what they call ''the Derailleur.'' ''The Derailleur seizes on a seemingly innocuous section of the otherwise neg-ative narrative and attempts to pull the comment thread into a discursive discussion around that detailed non- issue.'' They offer next the ''Drunken Con- spiracy Theorist Uncle.'' ''The Drunk-en Conspiracy Theorist Uncle agrees with the negative commenter but conflates other unrelated and offensive issues into it, lumping it all together into an unpalatable whole.'' They also offer the ''Semantic Nit- picker,'' who ''asks an endless series of questions seeking clarification or pointing out minor flaws in the way the argument is constructed. This can be played both friendly and oppositionally, but by different stacks of kids.'' On it goes through the ''Skeptical Capitalist,'' the ''Patronizing of the ''Concerned Hipster,'' and be-lieve it or not, here is a real beauty\u2014 the ''Dog Typing on a Keyboard.'' You can pay FTI to send somebody real be-hind a fake persona to go interfere anonymously in somebody else's con-versation\u2014in this case, claiming a dog typing on a keyboard. ''The dog typing on a keyboard chimes in with very poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and posts frequently to clutter up the thread and make it very hard to read''\u2014basically packing the debate with so much nonsense that everybody has to tune out. These are actually services offered to the fossil fuel industry clients that they pay for. They pay to disrupt le-gitimate internet debate using phony, paid-for personas that come in occu-pying these characteristics, I guess you would call them. It is unbelievably dis-gusting behavior for any corporation to engage in, which is probably why they hide the money. You may ask, why? Why on Earth would fossil fuel companies spend big money on all this fancy, fake activ-ity\u2014from phony Astroturf groups to fake attack campaigns, to the dog typ-ing on the keyboard? Why would the fossil fuel industry go through all these complex, phony schemes? Won't they ultimately get caught? Well, the answer is simple, and it is a number\u2014$650 billion. Six hundred and fifty billion dollars is the subsidy for fossil fuel in the United States of America every year. Every year, $650 billion. Another year, another $650 bil-lion, according to the International Monetary Fund, which is kind of a technical bean counter organization that is not an environmental group by any stretch. So let's say you are getting that $650 billion subsidy every year. Even if all this fakery ends up exposed, if in the meantime you have disrupted the oppo-sition and kept your business scheme going, you have reaped another year of multi-hundred-billion-dollar subsidies. I mention in this web of denial the identity-laundering group called Do-nors Trust, and I will come back to them right now because I have called them out over and over. Donors Trust just put a letter to the editor into my home State newspaper to assure its readers that Donors Trust is just as pure as the driven snow. Of all the newspapers in the world, Donors Trust just happened to pick mine. I ap-preciate the attention. But let's get the facts straight because here is Do-nors Trust, right in the middle of the web of denial. It has been called ''the dark-money ATM of the right,'' behind ''the right's assault on labor unions, climate scientists, public schools, [and] economic regulations.'' It has been called ''the Right's favorite dark- money conduit, [which] allows the identities of wealthy conservative do-nors to stay hidden.'' It has been called ''Donors Trust, the Right-Wing Secret Money Machine.'' And it is smack in the middle of this dirty, dark fossil fuel web that has propagated and funded the lie\u2014the lie of climate denial. From FTI and all of its schemes and its typing dogs to Donors Trust, the sleaze and the scale of the fossil fuel scheming is itself a signal of the mis-chief afoot. You don't put up a phony- baloney operation of this magnitude unless you have some real nasty stuff that you are trying to defend and mis-lead people about. Well, for $650 billion a year, you can crank up a lot of sleazy mischief. Here in Congress, we can't keep danc- ing to the tune of this crowd. We still don't know which party will control this Chamber next year, but we do know that the Senate is out of excuses on climate change. It is time for a strong climate bill that can be signed into law by a new President, swept into office with the most votes in history on a strong commitment to climate ac-tion. It is on us. It is on us whether this web of denial will hold us back or whether we will break free at last of its corrupting influence and do, for once\u2014 for once\u2014our duty instead of its bid-ding. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I always appreciate the persistence and integ-rity and intellectual vigor of Senator W HITEHOUSE 's comments on the floor talking about climate and talking about the corruption of big money and climate politics and climate decision making. So to Senator W HITEHOUSE , thank you. REMEMBERING LARRY WILLIS Mr. President, this weekend we lost a great champion for American work-ers\u2014Larry Willis, president of the Transportation Trades Department at the AFL-CIO. Larry dedicated his life to the labor movement, fighting for workers on the frontlines of our transportation sys-tem. He worked to empower busdrivers and ramp workers, flight attendants and train operators around the country so they could fight for better wages and protections on the job and they could build a middle-class life for their families. We know the labor movement is the single biggest reason that we have a middle class in this country. We know that the decline of the labor union movement is the reason that the mid-dle class is shrinking in this country. All of what Larry did said a lot about his character\u2014that he took on that job and spent his whole career fighting to give power to the workers who have so often been denied a voice in this coun-try. Everyone who worked with him at- tests to his skill, his compassion, his commitment to justice, and his love of life. One of his greatest strengths was his ability to find compromise in even the most difficult, thorniest issues in front of us. Make no mistake, Larry was always a fierce fighter for transportation workers. He never compromised when defending worker safety. He always challenged us to make legislation bet-ter, but he also understood that mean-ingful change sometimes comes in smaller steps, not in great bounds. He was willing to work for months, even years, behind the scenes to make real progress for transportation workers. Washington needs more advocates like Larry\u2014someone who believes deeply in the cause and backs it up with relent-less work to find a solution. I want to talk about his grace. He was very direct. He didn't hold back when Congress did something that was not in the best interests of workers, but he never closed the door on anyone, even his adversaries. Larry was always willing to pick back up a conversation to find a path forward. He did not let egos get in the way of progress\u2014some-thing that happens far too often in this town. He never let disputes make him jaded. He always kept his head up and his door open. My staff and I relied on Larry's guid- ance and wisdom for many years. He knew every angle of our Nation's trans-portation system. He used that knowl-edge to help millions of transportation workers. He was a wonderful person. We loved working with him. We are deeply saddened by his pass- ing. We are keeping his wife Amy and daughter Samantha\u2014oh, how he loved both of them and lit up when talking about them\u2014we are keeping them in our thoughts and prayers as they cope with this sudden, heartbreaking loss. We will honor Larry Willis the best way we can\u2014by continuing to fight to VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:26 \u2014 SENATE S7168 December 2, 2020 empower transportation workers around the country and fight with a doggedness that would make him proud. WORKER SAFETY Mr. President, this spring I was talk- ing with a grocery store worker in Southwest Ohio, who told me: You know, they call me essential, but real-ly I feel expendable. That grocery store worker and thou- sands of others are on the frontlines of this pandemic. They risk their lives so that Americans can keep food on their tables and get their packages deliv-ered. They are changing linens in hos-pitals. They drive buses. They stock shelves in supermarkets and drug-stores. Then workers go home at night. They worry they are going to bring to their home the virus and infect their family\u2014always the anxiety they live with. We know that hundreds of thousands of workers have been exposed to the virus on the job. Thousands have died. We don't know exactly how many be-cause the President hasn't directed his government to make it a priority to keep track of these numbers. Think of that. We know UFCW\u2014United Food Com- mercial Workers\u2014reports that more than 16,000 grocery store workers have been exposed at work. More than 100 have died. Sixteen-thousand exposed at work. More than 100 have died. National Nurses United has recorded at least 1,700 deaths, and 58 percent of those healthcare workers who died were people of color. Seventeen hun-dred have died; 58 percent, people of color. In meatpacking plants, we know the toll has been horrific. As of this sum-mer, 16,000 workers in meatpacking plants, including in the Dakotas, the vast majority of them Black and Brown workers, and more than 230 have died. We can only expect those num-bers to be higher. What is the President's response? In the White House, they are putting up holiday displays with a lit-up ceramic post office and ornaments in the shape of garbage trucks and nurses' hats. That is right. Workers are dying around the country, and instead of doing anything at all to protect them, the President of the United States is decking the halls with ornaments. Workers don't need Christmas orna-ments; they need fair pay, and they need protections on the job. President Trump hasn't lifted a fin- ger to protect frontline workers. Let me explain. I make a charge like that, I back it up. He spent 4 years in office putting corporate lawyers in charge of the Department of Labor. The Sec-retary of Labor made millions of dol-lars practicing law by representing cor-porations against workers\u2014sometimes union workers, sometimes unorganized workers. The Department of Labor makes it easier for corporations to skirt safety rules. The point of the Department of Labor, the point of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is to protect workers. Yet this Secretary of Labor, this Department of Labor\u2014 including from IBEW workers to steel-workers, to meatpacking workers\u2014he refused to issue workplace safety re-quirements throughout the pandemic. He failed to get workers the protective equipment and medical supplies they need to protect themselves. He forced people back to work in meatpacking plants around the country. In South Dakota, we know, in a meatpacking plant owned by the Chi-nese Communist Party, 1,300 workers got sick in one plant, and 4 of them have died that we know of. The Trump administration fined this multibillion-dollar meatpacking\u2014Chi-nese Communist Party-owned meatpacking plant\u2014fined them $10 a worker. Thirteen hundred workers got sick and OSHA, the government, the President, fined them $10 a worker. But don't worry, he and his wealthy con-tributors who come for White House tours without masks or social distancing will get to look at some sparkly ornaments. President Trump could crack down on corporations like Smithfield. He could mobilize American manufactur-ers to get every American worker the masks and the protective equipment they need. He could issue an OSHA temporary standard, as we have asked him repeatedly, that would provide clear enforceable requirements for keeping workers safe. He could stand up for workers, but he won't. That is fundamentally why he lost. Eighty million Americans decisively rejected this President and his total lack of empathy, his complete failure to understand the dignity of work. There are a lot of Senators in this body\u2014not a lot. There are some Sen-ators in this body whose mothers or fa-thers carried union cards and knew that was their ticket to the middle class and understood that their moth-ers and fathers were protected by OSHA, protected by the Department of Labor that cared about the safety of those workers in the workplace. But all that the President did do to ignore workers and didn't do to protect workers, none of that is stopping him from trying to do more damage on his way out the door. The Trump USDA, the Department of Agriculture, is try-ing to race through a new rule\u2014trying to push through, in the last weeks, a new rule that actually speeds up chick-en factory processing lines; that is right, not slow them down in the face of record infections at these plants but speed up the line. We know it is a trick. It is the oldest trick in the book. You make more money if you speed up the line. You speed up the line, and workers are more likely to get hurt. When you speed up the line during a pandemic, more workers are likely to get sick. They tried to pass the rule earlier. It was held up over concerns workers would get hurt and salmonella would spread. That is not even counting COVID. But to President Trump and his allies, more workplace injuries and more grandparents hospitalized by sal-monella are a small price to pay if it means more profits for meatpacking companies. Trump and his corporate lawyer Sec- retary of Labor are pushing through a new policy to ensure that companies can continue to exploit workers by classifying them as independent con-tractors. Go back to the childhood of a number of Members of the Senate who had parents who worked in factories and parents who worked in construc-tion jobs, parents who carried a union card. You know what that would mean to those workers and the threat that they could get sick. Think about it now. Corporations love this new business model. It is a way to classify people as independent workers. It is a way to pay people less for the same work, skirt labor laws, wash their hands of responsibility for the workers who make their businesses successful. These workers aren't working for a big insurance company that really does have a public image they are trying to protect. These workers aren't working for a hospital or a big bank that cares about its public image. These workers are working for an entity hired by these big banks or by these insurance companies to prepare the food or to provide the security or to do the custo-dial work\u2014a company you have never heard of that has no public image be-cause this company is all about being hired by large corporations. They then can pay them lower wages. They can then protect them less on the job, and they can then not provide benefits. That is what happens with contract workers\u2014those independent contrac-tors. We know they love this business model. They can pay workers less. They can skirt labor laws. President Trump wants to make that easier, partly, because he probably does that in his business, and he has a whole lot of corporate friends\u2014big contribu-tors to the Trump campaign who make more money by doing that. Fundamentally, President Trump, Senator M CCONNELL , and their cor- porate allies just don't understand the dignity of work. They think workers are always a cost to be minimized in-stead of the engine behind our coun-try's success. Think back again to those Members of the Senate whose parents carried union cards who cared about all this, who had a chance\u2014in a job like this, who had a chance for opportunity be-cause those workers carried a union card and were treated decently on the job. Because those workers carried a union card, their bosses couldn't think of them only as a cost to be minimized. They did think of them as the engine behind their country's success. The American people rejected that\u2014 the 80-plus million people who voted VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:26 \u2014 SENATE S7169 December 2, 2020 for a new President. They voted against the President who treated workers as expendable. They voted for the candidate who put workers at the center of his campaign. Joe Biden had the most pro-worker campaign in a generation, and in Janu-ary we get to work to deliver results. The new President, right now, on Janu-ary 20 can immediately issue an OSHA emergency temporary standard forcing corporations to take important, crit-ical, decisive steps to protect their workers from contracting or spreading the virus in their workplaces. What is more important than pro- tecting workers, especially essential workers who deliver our food, who pre-pare food, who do custodial work, who do security work, who are helping peo-ple in our country live every day? With cases rising and hospitals filling up all over the country, the end of Jan-uary isn't soon enough. Workers put themselves at risk in nursing homes and hospitals. They deliver packages of holiday gifts. They stock supermarket shelves with supplies for holiday meals. Some of those workers are going to get sick. Some of them are going to die. They are going to die because they are essential workers, but we don't treat them like essential workers. We can do something about it now. We could pass a real plan that invests in protective equipment for them. We can pass a real plan of testing and contact tracing. We could get money to small businesses like Liz Valenti's business in Dayton, OH, so they can protect their workers\u2014her two restaurants in Dayton. Well, what is Leader M CCONNELL doing? Ramming through more Trump nominees like Mr. Hauptman and Mr. Waller, who keep stacking the deck in favor of their Wall Street friends, try-ing to hold on to their power even after Americans said: No, we want some-thing different\u201480 million of them. M ITCH MCCONNELL needs to stop let- ting Donald Trump sabotage our eco-nomic recovery on his way out the door and get to work for the people he serves. It is time to remember what makes this country great. If you love this country, you fight for people who make it work\u2014our workers who organized in union halls and church basements and fought for workers' rights, women's rights, and civil rights. In closing\u2014I know that Senator L EE wants to speak. I have worn for my time in the Senate and before that, I wore this pin on my lapel. It is a depic-tion of a canary in a birdcage. You may remember the old labor story of the worker, the coal miner who took the canary down into the mines. If the ca-nary died by suffocation or lack of oxy-gen or some contaminant in the air, the mine worker got out of the mines. He had no union in those days to pro-tect himself, and he had no government that cared enough, that was strong enough to protect him, and he had no government that cared enough to pro-tect him. He was essentially on his own. This pin was given to me at a work- ers' Memorial Day rally by a steel-worker who told me about this pin and what it stood for. He knows that the labor movement changed this country for the better. It created the greatest economy and the strongest middle class on Earth. It said the opposite of what M ITCH MCCONNELL says to work- ers all over the country: Sorry. You are on your own. What this canary pin rep-resents is, we are all in this together. It means we fight for the dignity of work. It means if you love your coun-try, you fight for the people who make it work. We can do that again. We can protect workers from this virus. We can build a better system centered on the dignity of work. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Utah. ALS DISABILITY INSURANCE ACCESS ACT OF 2019 Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is nothing short of a tragedy when anyone suffers from ALS. This is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, one that at-tacks the nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord of its victims and even-tually affects control of the muscles, even the muscles that are needed to move, to speak, eat, breathe, and oth-erwise live. Sadly, this is a disease that is always fatal. The average life expectancy is only 2 to 5 years following diagnosis. Not only are the people who suffer from ALS robbed of time but also their ability to work, imposing great hard-ships on them and on their families. The bill that we had before us today to help these victims by reforming our Social Security Disability Insurance Program is a good cause, and it is one that I think we all support, but I think it goes about the job in the wrong way. It sets bad precedent, and it fails to in-clude other needed reform. We must remember that ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, is one of many simi-larly debilitating and deadly diseases that Americans are suffering from today. While not as well known, all of these victims are also deserving of the same kind of special attention and ac-commodation in Federal policy. Let's review some of the background of the program. The Social Security Disability Insurance Program, or SSDI, was created, in part, to help people who suffer from conditions like ALS, pro-viding monthly cash benefits to those who become disabled and therefore un-able to work. One challenge with a program like this is that the agency administering the program, that is, the Social Secu-rity Administration, has to verify an applicant's eligibility for benefits be-fore they can start sending out the checks. Today, eligibility determina- tion takes an average of 3 12months. For some people and for some diseases, including ALS, 3 12months can be a dangerously long time. So, in 2018, the SSA established a new policy to fast track the applica-tion process for those with serious and urgent medical conditions. Under this Compassionate Allowance Initiative, more than 200 diseases now automati-cally make applicants eligible for expe-dited review. But while the Compassionate Allow- ance Initiative shortens the determina-tion process from an average of several months to an average of 39 days, there is still a lengthy 5-month waiting pe-riod to actually start receiving the benefits, and in the case of urgent, fatal diseases, that is still too long of a wait. The bill that we have before us today seeks to address this problem but only for the victims of ALS. Now, obviously, we should try and help the victims of this tragic disease to the very best of our ability. They are not, however, the only ones who need to be helped. Of the list of compassionate allowance condi-tions, some are just as urgent as ALS and some are even worse. There are, sadly, several for which there is no known cure and that have life expectancies that are terribly short. I want to cite some examples. For in- stance, Creutfeldt-Jakob disease, a de-generative brain disorder, is among these. This particular disease leads to dementia and most often results in death within 6 to 12 months. Trag-ically, there is no cure, and around 1,000 Americans are diagnosed with it every single year, including a dear friend of mine in Utah who a couple of years ago passed away from this ail-ment. Another is cardiac amyloidosis, also known as stiff heart syndrome. This disease affects the way electrical sig-nals move through the heart, leading to abnormal heartbeats and faulty heart signals. For those diagnosed, there is no known cure, and they typi-cally face a life expectancy of only about 6 months after the onset of con-gestive heart failure. About 4,000 peo-ple develop this condition each year. Take peritoneal mesothelioma, this disease is a cancer that develops in the lining of the abdomen, usually leading to death within 12 months of the first signs of illness. Around 600 cases are di-agnosed every year in the United States. That is why I have been working for the past year with my colleagues to broaden the scope of this legislation, so that Congress doesn't waive the SSDI waiting period one disease at a time. It should not matter which fatal, rapidly progressing and debilitating disease an American is suffering from\u2014all fatal diseases with no known cure should have access to disability benefits after their Social Security Administration determination. The men and women who suffer from those conditions and the family mem-bers affected by their ailments have precious little time left, and they are just as worthy of help. They are cer-tainly no less worthy of help than those with ALS. There is always hope that a cure can be found for them or VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:42 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7170 December 2, 2020 that, at the very least, a new treat- ment can further extend the life of these men and women. Rather than re-moving the waiting period for those with one specific disease, we should re-move the waiting period for those who suffer from any of a small select group of conditions that have no cure and have the shortest life expectancies. There is no reason we cannot help those who suffer from ALS and these other conditions. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can protect victims of ALS and these other conditions as well. The bill, as written, sets the stage for only those diseases that have the most recognition and, to put it bluntly, the most fundraising backing to fund bill sponsors, and it would set at a dis-advantage the conditions that are far more rare and underfunded. Who will be the voice for the men and women who suffer from those diseases? Who will fight for them? Adding similarly cruel maladies to this list takes noth-ing away from ALS, and it can make all the difference in the world for Americans suffering from similar dis-abilities. I had hoped to offer my broader ap- proach as an amendment, but after months and months of working with the Social Security Administration and with the Congressional Budget Of-fice, I was, unfortunately, given incom-plete information at the time an agree-ment was reached on scheduling a vote on this bill. I appreciate Senator C OT- TON's and Senator B RAUN 's patience in allowing me to work towards a fix while they remain committed to ad-vancing their legislation, for which I commend them. Additionally, while I would have hoped that my work with the Social Security Administration and the Con-gressional Budget Office could have gone more quickly, I do appreciate their efforts to address my questions and compile the necessary information and tools to estimate my amendment's fiscal impact. While I was pleased to see Senator G RASSLEY 's amendment, which at least would have paid for the removal of the waiting period for ALS, I will continue to work on legislation that will remove the waiting period for diseases that meet a set of criteria\u2014no known cure with a life expectancy of less than 5 years\u2014while not further jeopardizing the solvency of the disability insurance program. It will be ready for introduc-tion soon. My concerns and efforts have not been about waiving the SSDI waiting period for those who tragically suffer from ALS. I certainly agree that we ought to improve the time that they have left. But picking and choosing fa-vorites among those with comparable conditions is not the right way to go about it. The lives of the men and women who suffer from other very similar conditions are just as valuable, and we should be a voice for them, too. FAIRNESS FOR HIGH-SKILLED IMMIGRANTS ACT OF 2019 Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as if in legis- lative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consider-ation of H.R. 1044 and the Senate pro-ceed to its immediate consideration. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title. The bill clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 1044) to amend the Immigra- tion and Nationality Act to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for em-ployment-based immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for family- sponsored immigrants, and for other pur-poses. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to proceeding to the meas-ure? There being no objection, the com- mittee was discharged, and the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani- mous consent that the Lee substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; and the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 2690) in the na- ture of a substitute was agreed to. (The amendment is printed in today's R ECORD under ''Text of Amendments.'') The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time. The bill was read the third time. Mr. LEE. I know of no further debate on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Hearing none, the bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass? The bill (H.R. 1044), as amended, was passed. Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be con-sidered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. TRIBUTE TO ROB BISHOP Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend and colleague, Con-gressman R OBBISHOP . After 18 years of service in the U.S. House of Represent-atives, he has decided to hang up his gloves and embark on his well-deserved retirement. R OBBISHOP has served Utah's First Congressional District with integrity, tenacity, humility, and humor, and it is my high privilege to have worked with him over the last 10 years and, in the process, to have become his friend. Born and raised in Kaysville, UT, R OBhas been a lifelong resident of Utah's First Congressional District, with the exception of the 2-year mis-sion where he lived in Germany while representing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He grad-uated from Davis High School with high honors and later graduated magna cum laude from the University of Utah with a degree in political science. The embodiment of a public servant, R OBbegan his career as a high school teacher at Ben Lomond High School and Box Elder High School, teaching courses in German, AP U.S. history and government, and coaching debate. He notoriously had one rule in the classroom: I am never wrong. That might tell you something about R OB BISHOP . An avid lover of musicals, he was ac- tive in community theater, where he happened to have met his wife Jeralynn. They first met on the pro-duction of ''South Pacific'' at the Pal-ace Playhouse, and they later starred together as the prince and princess in a production of ''Once Upon a Mattress.'' In their real-life love story, they have five children\u2014Shule, Zenock, Maren, and Jashon, with spouses Me-lissa, Kristin, Shalise, and Courtney, as well as nine grandchildren. Inspired in his public service by Barry Goldwater, he was also involved in local politics from a young age, working at various levels of govern-ment and of the Republican Party. He has gone from being a precinct chair to a member of the Republican National Committee and from being vice chair of the Davis County Teenage Repub-lican Club to the adviser to the Utah Teenage Republicans in 1996. Starting in 1997, he served two terms as chair-man of the Utah Republican Party. At just 25, he was elected to the Utah House of Representatives when he was known for always wearing sweaters and no socks. He served in the State legis-lature for 16 years and, during the last 2 years, having been unanimously elected, served as speaker of the house of representatives. In 2002, after serving in the State leg- islature and having spent 28 years of teaching, he decided to serve at the na-tional level. As R OBBISHOP said in one of his most popular campaign slogans: ''Utah has plenty of Bishops\u2014send this one to Washington!'' R OBhas faithfully devoted his life to representing Utah's First Congres-sional District, and he has been doing that ever since making that critical de-cision to run for Congress. I remember one of the first times I worked with him when R OBwas a rel- atively new Member of Congress and I was serving at the time as general counsel to then-Governor Jon Hunts-man. At the time, a private fuel stor-age organization was trying to store spent nuclear fuel rods in above-ground storage casks along the Wasatch Front corridor, just miles from Utah's major metropolitan area and just under the low-altitude flight path of fighter jets flying between Hill Air Force Base to the Utah Test and Training Range. Out of all of the Members of Utah's congressional delegation at the time, all of whom, I would adhere, were simi- larly opposed to this proposal to store spent nuclear fuel in this particular place in this particular way\u2014our con-gressional delegation was united in VerDate Sep 11 2014 S7171 December 2, 2020 that regard\u2014but R OBBISHOP stood out as one who was particularly concerned about it and was particularly deter-mined to prevent such a dangerous idea from taking place. Congressman B ISHOP had a full un- derstanding of the problem, and he had a complete mastery of the scientific facts of the issue, and he had detailed, helpful ideas about how to address it. He also understood the significant and long-lasting potential ramifications that this plan could have had for Hill Air Force Base and the Utah Test and Training Range. Thanks to R OBBISHOP 's vision, direc- tion, and determination, he developed a strategy and worked hard to imple-ment that strategy and eventually worked to pass a bill designating the area in question as wilderness\u2014cre-ating a wilderness curtain around the designated storage area\u2014making it im-possible for the storage plant to be completed. R OBBISHOP thus success- fully prevented spent nuclear fuel rods from coming to Utah and being stored in a particularly unsafe way and in an unsafe place close to Utah's major pop-ulation center. Though relatively new to Congress at the time, R OBwas punching way above his weight. Why? Well, because he is awesome and because he was willing to dive into the nitty-gritty details of an issue and put in the hard work, not knowing and, frankly, not even caring who got the credit. R OBBISHOP just wanted to get it done. That is who R OB BISHOP is, that is how he serves, and that is why we love him. That has characterized R OBBISHOP 's entire time in Congress: doggedly, thoughtfully, and honestly working for Utahns' best interests, and never really caring much who got the attention. He served on the Armed Services Committee, the powerful House Rules Committee, and the Science Com-mittee. As both chair and ranking member of the Natural Resources Com-mittee, he chaired hearings with his characteristically witty quips and wry jokes. He has also chaired the Congres-sional Western Caucus, served on the House German Caucus for his whole tenure, including for 2 years as chair, and he helped found the 10th Amend-ment Task Force. When Speaker of the House John Boehner created committees for con-gressional reform, R OBBISHOP was named chairman of the Committee for Procedural Reform and, later on, lead-er of the Rules group. Under Speaker Paul Ryan, he was named chair of the Federalism Committee. R OBdid all this in addition to being a staunch advocate for the military and, in particular, for Hill Air Force Base. One of his proudest achievements was getting an extension of the Michaels airstrip at the Dugway Proving Ground in Tooele County. When he was told that there was no funding for it to be attained at the Federal level, he suc-cessfully got the Utah State Legisla-ture to appropriate the funding to make it happen. He was instrumental in establishing Falcon Hill, an aero-space research park just outside of Hill Air Force Base and a public-private partnership between the Air Force, the State of Utah, and private developers that was the first of its kind anywhere in the country and a model of many more like it to come. R OBhas also brought his love of base- ball with him to Washington. A huge admirer of Mickey Mantle and Ernie Banks, R OBis known to have actual dirt from the pitcher's mound at Yan-kee Stadium in his Washington, DC, of-fice. He has been a long-time supporter of the Salt Lake Bees, even cham-pioning the construction of their sta-dium while he was in the State legisla-ture, and he is a diehard Cubs fan. Every year, he dons a uniform himself, leading his office in the intramural baseball league on Capitol Hill, with their team name known as the ''Raucus Caucus.'' R OBhas brought the same passion he has for baseball to serving his constitu-ents. He has, for years, worked with the Close Up Foundation to bring high school students to Washington, and he has partnered with teachers and stu-dents to put on an AP government con-ference every year. He has famously led constituent and student groups on long, expert night-time tours of the Capitol Building. In fact, he is known as the guy who gives the very best Capitol tours in all of Washington, and he has consistently spent hours upon hours late into the night making personal phone calls to each constituent who writes in to his office. One of my favorite things about R OB BISHOP is precisely how understated and down to Earth and often self-depre-cating he is. It is a true feat when you have been in Congress as long as he has and accomplished as many things as he has. While he is known for his sharp three-piece suits here in Washington, I can't count the number of plane rides I have taken with R OBBISHOP where he shows up on the plane actually wearing gym shorts, sandals, and a hoodie. In fact, basically every time, he has given me the sage advice not to torture my-self wearing a suit while on a 4-hour plane ride. In fact, just the other day\u2014just this week, as we were flying from Salt Lake City to Washington, DC, he commended me for finally having gotten the memo. At least this time, as he noted, I wasn't wearing a suit, although he derided me a little bit for not wearing shorts. But when you have a conversation with R OBBISHOP , you never feel that he is trying to advance his own agenda or gain attention or fanfare. As a mat-ter of fact, it is quite the opposite. It feels like a real conversation with a real goal to fix a problem. He simply tells it like it is\u2014an altogether rare, refreshing, and much needed quality on Capitol Hill. When R OBran for Congress, he said it was his goal to make Congress less powerful when he left than it was when he came. In all of his time here, he sought to put power in Washington back in the hands of Utahns and back in the hands of people across the coun-try in their respective States. Just so, in all his time here, he slept on either an air mattress or on a futon so that he wouldn't get too comfortable, so that he would never feel too ''at home'' in Congress. Rare is the person who can come to change Washington but not ever be changed by Washington. R OBBISHOP has managed to do just that. He has made a real difference for the people of Utah and the people of the United States of America. It has been a distinct pleasure to call him a friend and a colleague, and I have to say I am going to miss R OB BISHOP 's service here in Washington. Just the same, we have all benefited and we will all continue to benefit for many decades to come from what he has done here, who he has been here, and what he has stood for here so val-iantly and consistently and faithfully and with such great decency and hu-mility. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen- ator from Oklahoma. COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is a rather complicated issue that is out there that not many people are aware of. It emanates from back in 1996 with the passage of something called the Communication Decency Act. Just a few weeks before the 2020 elec- tion, Twitter did what was previously unthinkable: It suppressed a long-standing, legitimate news outlet\u2014that was the New York Post\u2014from sharing an article either publicly or privately it deemed unfavorable to Presidential candidate Joe Biden. Obviously, they were concerned about Joe Biden, and they were using this act to suppress in-formation that may not have been fa-vorable. That is not what is supposed to happen, what it is supposed to do. To make it worse, they suspended an ac-count of the Post\u2014that is a major news outlet\u2014for over 24 hours. While other big tech entities sup- pressed the story as well, the depths of Twitter's censorship reached new heights, telling users that sharing the article could be ''potentially harmful.'' There is no criteria to determine what is potentially harmful; they just de-cided\u2014it is a liberal mindset, and they want to punish people who are not sharing their mindset. Contrast that with the refusal to moderate any comments made by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who called Israel a ''can-cerous growth'' to be ''uprooted and de-stroyed'' and for the ''elimination of the Zionist regime'' through ''firm, armed resistance'' despite having a pol-icy against hateful conduct and glori-fying violence. That is what they did. Those are the words. That is what they did. VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:39 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7172 December 2, 2020 Yet it proves what President Trump has been talking about for a long pe-riod of time on social media. Look what they have done to him over the last 4 years. It is time to make sure that Twitter and other social media platforms are held accountable for engaging in cen-sorship by repealing section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Now, that sounds a little complicated. The Communications Decency Act\u2014we know why it was started, but we know times have changed, and now it has turned into a very liberal political or-ganization. For over 20 years, social media plat- forms have benefited from protec-tionism unprecedented in the modern era\u2014a complete liability shield pro-tecting them from how they moderate or censor content posted for their users. To add insult to injury, there is no one to check the partisan censor-ship of these social media platforms. Instead, they are coddled by section 230's ''Good Samaritan'' provision, which allows ''good-faith'' efforts to re-strict objectionable material. But the problem is, they are the ones who de-cide what is objectionable. We all know Jesus's parable of the Good Samaritan. The moral imperative that comes from the parable has guided many legislative protections for those seeking to do good\u2014doctors responding to problems with people in midair. I can remember many times I was in-volved as a volunteer pilot helping to get people medical care. People who are trying to do the right thing. We know that is significant. We know that is what the history was supposed to be on this section, section 230. It was in-tended to make sure that Twitter could flag and remove unquestionably harm-ful content, like ISIS and their propa-ganda videos. In the case of the social media plat- forms, however, it amounts to nothing more than the fox guarding the hen-house. Instead of focusing on modera-tion to protect users from death threats or harassment and to prevent criminal behavior, Twitter is allowed to determine what is ''otherwise objec-tionable'' and censor it from the plat-form, with no right to appeal and no transparency. I mean, where else can you go in America and find someone who is totally immune from that type of behavior? You can't. It doesn't exist. This is a case in point. Last year, they kowtowed to the Chinese Com-munist Party by removing the ac-counts of more than 100 dissidents ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I remem-ber that well. I remember where I was when that happened. But they didn't want people to know that type of thing actually went on, and that was some-how objectionable. Twitter's censorship and actions over the past few years make it clear it has decided that President Trump is objec-tionable, and they decide that they are just going to act accordingly. That is not surprising when you look at the employee culture they have in that media. Here is the problem with section 230. According to a strict interpretation of the 1996 law, that is allowed. Partisan censorship is allowed. Senator R ON WYDEN even admitted that, when writ- ten, section 230 wasn't about neutrality or protecting the free marketplace of ideas on platforms. Clearly, we need to completely over- haul section 230, and the best way to do it is just repeal it. Repeal the whole thing. That is what the President wants to do. Then you could start over again and build up. Times have changed. The argument we hear against reforming alone or re-pealing would be that any changes to section 230 would give social media platforms like Twitter greater control over content on their platforms. They are not wrong, but that argument ig-nores the fact that censorship is al-ready happening for Americans due to their political beliefs, in violation of the First Amendment\u2014it is supposed to protect people\u2014without any trans-parency or recourse. Others believe in the need to reform 230 incrementally, but those solutions are merely bandaids on a bullet wound. We have seen the negative impact of incremental reforms. They just don't work. A good example: Efforts to hold users accountable for information by requiring a ''real name'' associated with an account has seen Native Amer-icans blocked from platforms for using their legal names. Social media platforms and sup- porters of section 230's last-ditch argu-ment is to tell conservative voices to create their own social media plat-forms since they clearly aren't wel-come in those that are existing today. That sounds good, except that the problem is that Twitter and others have a de facto monopoly on social media. House Democrats agree. They wrote a 400-plus page report arguing Big Tech constitutes a monopoly. Just remember the internet, what it was like back in 1996. In 1996, only 20 million Americans had access to the internet\u2014only 20 million Americans in 1996. Today, 313 million Americans have access. So now it is a way of life. The reality is that section 230 is sim- ply outdated for today's usage and is a strong case for why all laws should sunset. One of the problems I have with laws that are passed is that they can be passed, the problem is corrected that caused the laws to be passed, but the laws stay on the books. That is exactly what has happened with this. Section 230 is outdated and needs to be changed. Otherwise, we will find ourselves here time and again, forced to rectify decades-old laws with mod-ern technology and ideas. Let me simplify. Section 230 allows Twitter and other liberal social media companies to be exempt from liabil-ity\u2014there is no accountability whatso-ever\u2014for what their users say. For ex-ample, Twitter can't be held respon- sible for someone who posts a death threat against me, and I understand that. That is where we are today. But they are also protected from what they censor even if it is in violation of the First Amendment or it is protected speech. No one else has this shield. No one else in society has this, which is why President Trump is right. We need a total repeal. If you look at what they had done to President Trump over the last 4 years, you will know exactly what I am talk-ing about. But the place for repeal is not the Defense authorization bill. There is an idea that the Defense au- thorization bill for 60 years in a row now has passed, and so everybody who has something that doesn't pass nor-mally, they try to put it on as an amendment\u2014having nothing to do with the military and having nothing to do with our defense system for the ensu-ing year. So that is how this one was decided. They put this on. The problem is, if it had that language repealing it, we would not have a defense bill. So there is not a choice in this case. We need a place for repealing section 230, and we need to do it. The NDAA is about making sure that our troops are cared for. It is for our kids in the field. They are the ones we are supporting. They are the ones who need us. If we don't have this Defense authorization bill passed by December 31, our pilots are not going to get flight pay; the kids are not going to get haz-ard pay. The whole thing will fall apart. Just think about the problems we are having in the military. One of the big problems is\u2014and the Presiding Officer recognizes this because he is on this committee\u2014right now, our big problem is how to get more pilots into the Air Force, into the services. They can't do it because of the competition out there. We can't compete with the pri-vate sector. Now, if we take away their flight privileges, then it could be good-bye to most of our pilots. We just need to get this thing done. It should not be on the Defense bill. I want to make this appeal to make sure that no one has the idea that the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act is the place to have it. I give the President and my col- leagues my commitment that I will do everything possible to work toward a complete repeal of section 230 through other means. It has to happen. Presi-dent Trump is right. Total repeal is the only answer if we are going to make sure we get this thing done\u2014not on the bill, not on the Defense authorization bill, but in any of the other vehicles that come along. It has to be done. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:39 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7173 December 2, 2020 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think it is important that we acknowledge what is going on right now. What is going on is that the most significant vote of the year is taking place. It is called the Defense authorization bill, the NDAA. It has passed every year for 60 years now. This will be the 60th year it is passed. Nothing else has a record like that. Yet there is always trauma at the tail end, and the reason there is trau-ma is that everyone knows it is going to pass\u2014and it is going to pass\u2014so anything they can't pass during the normal process of the year, for any number of reasons, they try to put on this as an amendment. Some things are not acceptable because they have the effect of killing the bill. Now, we have two people who have been working with the committees put-ting this thing together. I know that the Presiding Officer knows this, but these people have worked an entire year and many, many more than half the weekends. People have this idea that people don't work in Washington on causes. They do on this one. John Bonsell in my office has been the director, the support of the bill, with Liz King on the Democratic side. They have worked hand in hand to-gether. People talk about how Demo-crats and Republicans fight with each other. Not on this bill. We all support it. We all want it. We all want to make sure it is done and it is done right. So we have a defense authorization bill. It will be the largest one that we have had in the history of the Defense authorization bills. It is one that, with-out it, we are not going to be able to take care of our kids in the field. We have to remember that, while there are a lot of hitchhikers on this bill on causes that we have determined to be worthwhile causes, we don't do it if it is going to be something that will take down the bill. So we want to make sure that nothing would jeop-ardize passing the Defense authoriza-tion bill. Now, the key is December 31 of this year. If we don't have the bill passed by December 31 of this year, I mentioned that we have problems, that any of the specialist groups\u2014and I talk about the pilots; I talk about those involved in hazard occupations\u2014the SEALs\u2014the individuals who are out there risking their lives to a greater extent than others do in the military. And they are out there doing it for this reason, and we want to make sure that they are willing to take these risks. We want to make sure that we are taking good care of people. I run into people all the time who say: You are always so concerned about our military. Yet the chief competition that we have is with whom: Russia and China? Russia and China actually, after the last administration\u2014that was the Obama administration. In the last 5 years\u2014that would be from 2010 to 2015\u2014he knocked down the military budget by 25 percent. It had never hap-pened before\u2014not since World War II anyway. Yet we found ourselves in a situation where we couldn't compete. Now, they will argue with you, and they will say: Well, we spend more money on defense than Russia and China put together. That is true, but there is a big difference, and that is that in Communist countries they don't care about taking care of their troops. Our job is to make sure that our kids have a prosperous career. They want to defend their country, but they also have families. They have to take care of their families. Housing has been a huge problem in the military, so we want to make sure that we have good housing for our troops\u2014not just here in the United States but around the world\u2014and we are doing that. Now, in Communist countries they give them a gun and say: Go out and kill people. They don't care about the troops. They don't spend any of that money. So the largest expense, the largest ticket on running a military operation is taking care of the people. So that is why it is important that people under-stand this. There is also a document that nobody reads anymore. It is called the Con-stitution. You read that and say: What are we supposed to be doing in Wash-ington? We get involved in so many dif-ferent things. Yet, when you read the Constitution, it says that our primary concern should be to defend against an outside enemy, and then other areas\u2014 transportation and a few other areas\u2014 are mentioned. But the No. 1 concern is that we have to have a military that is second to none. We want to make sure. Let me say this about our President. When he first came into office, Presi-dent Trump recognized what had hap-pened to our military and had recog-nized that there are things like hypersonic\u2014that is a very recent, mod-ern technology that they are working on in China and Russia and other places, and we are actually behind them at this time. People assume that America has bet- ter everything in the military than China has and Russia has, and that is not true. They have artillery systems that are better than the artillery sys-tems that we currently have. So we have a job that I consider to be the most significant job\u2014significant job for the defense of our country, and it is just that: to defend our country. I want to applaud all of these people who work long hours. We are now to the point where they are what they call turning the page. We are ready to pass a bill. We are in the process of get-ting signatures from the committees. There are a lot of people who don't like the idea of having to sign a bill and sign on to a bill, yet they know that in order to maintain a superior position over China and Russia, we have to do that, and we have to show our superiority, and we have to make it last. That is what we are doing right now. It is a very significant time. I anticipate that we are going to be able to get this done, and I applaud the President for the time that he has spent and the money that he has spent on rebuilding our military. You hear him say all the time that we now have the strongest military that we have ever had and we are in great shape. But we are still rebuilding. We still have areas where our adversaries have bet-ter equipment than we do. So that is what is going on today. That is what is taking place. It is a very proud time that we can say that we are now addressing those things that are the most significant things going on in Washington today. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ORDER OF PROCEDURE Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I have an amendment to offset the costs to the Social Security's disability in-surance trust fund associated with S. 578. Eventhough my amendment did not gain the 60 vote threshold, I want my colleagues to know that you just can't tap into the Social Security dis-ability trust funds without dire future consequences. VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:39 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7174 December 2, 2020 S. 578 waives a waiting period in the disability program for the compelling case of patients with ALS. There are, of course, other compel- ling cases. And we have to be mindful of the dis- ability trust fund which will eventu-ally face depletion. As the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which is an umbrella orga-nization representing advocates for a number of disabling conditions, puts it: ''Bills that only fix the problem for some people who meet the strict eligibility stand-ards for SSDI are likely to lead to interest groups requesting waiver of wait periods for other impairments.'' So it is likely that Congress will see more requests for waivers of waiting periods for those afflicted with disabil-ities arising from conditions other than ALS. Waiting periods in the disability in- surance program were put into law for various policy reasons. When we waive waiting periods for specific conditions, some of which are terribly disabling and even fatal, we change the nature of the disability pro-gram. We change benefits and don't have any offsetting change to the tax that funds the disability insurance trust fund or any offsetting change to other benefits. However compelling it is to waive waiting periods, whenever we do it, we accelerate the exhaustion of the dis-ability trust fund. And that affects people with all forms of disability. In order to help make Social Secu- rity combined disability and retire-ment trust funds whole, my amend-ment would offset the cost of the ALS bill. My amendment simply changes the minimum monthly withholding thresh-old for recovery of any overpayment of Social Security benefits to reflect the increase in benefits we have seen since SSA established the current minimum of $10 in 1960. My amendment simply changes the threshold amount from $10 to 10 per-cent of the monthly benefit payable, as is already done in the SSI program. With this change, SSA would recover overpayments more efficiently and bet-ter fulfill its stewardship obligations to Social Security's trust funds, while re-taining safeguards for beneficiaries surrounding overpayments. Guardrails to protect beneficiaries to ensure that collections don't create hardships are maintained. Nothing in my amendment leads to benefit cuts of even a penny that a re-tiree or disabled worker has earned. This policy is something that has been in numerous budgets of the Presi-dent, including President Obama and now President Trump. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, to ensure that we protect the integrity of Social Security's trust funds while also protecting bene-ficiaries. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS TRIBUTE TO MARK DAVIS Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mark Davis on the occasion of his retirement. Mark dedicated over five decades to broadcast journalism, including an im-pressive near 37 years with News 8. An award winning-radio news director in Boston, Mark quickly adapted to TV news when he arrived in Connecticut. Throughout his career, he set an exam-ple with his honest, unstinting report-ing. Mark covered the administrations of seven Connecticut Governors, al-ways speaking truth to power. His thorough, efficient responses to stories earned Mark the respect of his colleagues. Holding himself to the highest standard, Mark was always a consummate professional. Mark's out-standing and reliable work leaves a re-markable legacy in Connecticut jour-nalism. As chief political correspondent, Mark remained nonpartisan while dem-onstrating tireless grit. He was coura-geous and never shied away from ask-ing the tough questions. At the same time, Mark had an uncanny ability to put politicians at ease, facilitating dis-cussions and ensuring he could provide a thoughtful, complete story. Trusted by constituents, he was voted our State's best local TV reporter 2 years in a row by Connecticut Magazine. Mark's exceptional record as an in- sightful, driven, and honest reporter leaves a historic mark and emphasizes the vital role he and his fellow report-ers play in keeping people well in-formed in Connecticut and across the Nation. His professional partnership with Joe Sferrazza established a model of unmatched teamwork that will have an impact for years to come. I applaud his lifetime of tenacious commitment to comprehensive, fair work focused on uncovering the truth, and I know my colleagues will join me in thanking Mark for his extraordinary contributions to regional reporting. f TRIBUTE TO JANICE DONALDSON Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair- man of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today I recognize and honor the career of Jan-ice Donaldson, Director of the Small Business Development Center\u2014SBDC\u2014 at the University of North Florida, UNF. At the end of this month, she will retire after serving the small business community for 31 years. Since 1981, Mrs. Donaldson has sup- ported small business owners and en-trepreneurs in the Jacksonville area. After graduating from the University of Georgia in 1980, Janice joined the SBDC at UNF as editor of the office newsletter. After 21 years with the of-fice, Mrs. Donaldson took over as direc-tor in 2002 and has been a resilient leader throughout her years of service. During her tenure as director, the center's service area grew immensely, from one office serving five counties, to seven offices serving 18 counties. Ad-ditionally, SBDC expanded its services from supporting entrepreneurs, to now enabling clients to grow their existing small businesses. In her final year as director, Mrs. Donaldson faced one of her most dif-ficult challenges yet. The COVID-19 pandemic forced her office to work re-motely where they had to quickly ac-climate to the ever-changing economic conditions. Under her leadership, the SBDC team worked diligently to help small businesses adapt to the pan-demic, advising on financial assistance opportunities available, including the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans through the U.S. Small Business Ad-ministration. This year alone, the cen-ter has participated in more than 20,000 consulting hours and facilitated the awards of approximately $50 million in capital to small businesses in her re-gion. Over the years, Mrs. Donaldson has shown paramount dedication to small businesses. She has played a critical role in the economic growth of north-east Florida and has nurtured the American dream. Mrs. Donaldson will be greatly missed by her colleagues and the thousands of business owners she has assisted throughout her notable ca-reer. I wish her the best of luck in all of her future endeavors. f RECOGNIZING LUCKY GOAT COFFEE COMPANY Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that exemplifies the American entrepre-neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-try. It is my privilege to recognize a family-owned business that invests heavily in its customers, employees, and community. Today, it is my honor to name the Lucky Goat Coffee Com-pany of Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. In 2010, Ben Pautsch founded Lucky Goat Coffee Company as a coffee wholesale and distribution company. Ben, a graduate of Florida State Uni-versity\u2014FSU\u2014focused on providing high-quality beans to local coffee cafes. The Tallahassee-based business grew quickly as orders poured in. Their rep-utation for roasting the best grounds led to the creation of the first Lucky Goat coffee shop in 2015. The appealing storefront and large warehouse allowed Lucky Goat to spread their knowledge and passion for coffee through various classes and tours, strengthening their customer relationships in the process. Today, Lucky Goat Coffee has grown to include five coffee shops in Tallahas-see and a franchise location in Jack-sonville. Their Tallahassee-based head-quarters provides more than 350 whole-sale customers across the country with VerDate Sep 11 2014 06:42 Dec \u2014 SENATE S7175 December 2, 2020 premium coffee beans. Ben keeps his strong relationship with FSU. Lucky Goat Coffee products are featured on campus, and Ben regularly hires FSU students and alumni. From the start, Ben has been committed to creating dignified work. He prioritizes career development and professional growth for his employees, with one-time baristas moving up to serve in senior management within the company. Over the years, Lucky Goat Coffee has been recognized for its growth and remained committed to investing in its community. In 2017, then-Governor Rick Scott recognized Lucky Goat Cof-fee with a Governor's Business Ambas-sador Award. As one of the 100 fastest growing companies owned or led by Florida State University alumnus, Lucky Goat Coffee was named to the Seminole 100 in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Ben mentors young entrepreneurs inter-ested in the coffee industry, and Lucky Goat Coffee supports local youth-fo-cused organizations, including local Little League teams and Cub Scouts. They also help Leon County Schools, donating much-needed school supplies for students and equipment, including coffee, for the teachers. Like many Florida small businesses, Lucky Goat Coffee suffered a severe de-cline in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program, a small business relief program that I was proud to author. The PPP provides for-givable loans to impacted small busi-nesses and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pan-demic. A PPP loan gave Lucky Goat the support it needed to retain its em-ployees and survive the pandemic. Lucky Goat Coffee is a notable exam- ple of a small business that provides dignified work to its employees and in-vests in its community. Through their passion and generosity, Lucky Goat fuels Floridians every day with its deli-cious coffee and supports them through community service. Congratulations to Ben and the en- tire team at Lucky Goat. I look for-ward to your continued success. f MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his sec-retaries. f EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED In executive session the Presiding Of- ficer laid before the Senate messages from the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the apppropriate committees.

A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President of the United States and the United States Congress to de-clare the waters of the Straits of Mackinac as ''designated'' for purposes of Great Lakes commercial ship pilotage; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. H OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 244 Whereas, The Great Lakes are integral to Michigan's environment, economic develop-ment, and recreation; and Whereas, The federal Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 established two distinct cat-egories of pilotage on the Great Lakes\u2014des-ignated waters and undesignated waters\u2014 and authorized the President of the United States to determine designated waters. In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower de-clared designated waters on the Great Lakes, including all United States waters of the St. Marys River, the Soo Locks, and approaches thereto. There have been no significant changes in designated waters since that time; and Whereas, The act requires both United States and foreign-flagged vessels sailing in designated waters to be under the naviga-tional direction of a United States or Cana-dian registered pilot to ensure marine safety and effective use of navigable waters. Fur-ther, foreign-flagged vessels operating in un-designated waters on the Great Lakes must have a United States or Canadian registered pilot on board to direct the navigation of the vessel or be available to assist in navigation if necessary; and Whereas, Pilotage of foreign-flagged ves- sels on the Great Lakes is an important function provided by individuals with years of experience sailing on the largest fresh-water sea in the world. Pilots are charged with the safety of the vessel and boating public as well as protection of infrastructure and the environment; and Whereas, The Straits of Mackinac, an envi- ronmentally sensitive area of great impor-tance to the entire Great Lakes ecosystem, is an undesignated water. The Straits are often congested with commercial and rec-reational vessel traffic. Additionally, the area has restricted visibility, narrow water-ways, and important infrastructure includ-ing the Mackinac Bridge and pipelines con-tributing to the unique navigational chal-lenges that exist in the Straits of Mackinac; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives , That we urge the President and the Congress of the United States to declare the waters of the Straits of Mackinac as ''designated'' for purposes of Great Lakes commercial ship pi-lotage; and be it further Resolved , That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional delegation, and the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard. POM-254. A resolution adopted by the Sen- ate of the State of Michigan discouraging the United States Congress from expanding the size of the Supreme Court of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary. H OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 323 Whereas, For over 150 years, there have been nine seats on the Supreme Court of the United States. While the country has grown and changed during that period, the Supreme Court has repeatedly demonstrated its abil-ity to fulfill its constitutional role as the na-tion's highest court and remain an inde-pendent arbiter of the law without addi-tional justices; and Whereas, In recent months, there have been calls to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court in an effort to gain po-litical advantage. The number of justices on the Supreme Court has been fixed by federal law since 1869 and efforts to expand the size of the Supreme Court in the century and a half since have been met with significant re-sistance from the American people; and Whereas, The legitimacy of the Supreme Court is its most valuable asset. The Su-preme Court's ability to issue rulings which are followed nationwide rests on the Amer-ican people's respect for the institution's independence and separation from day-to- day politics; and Whereas, The federal judiciary, particu- larly the Supreme Court, must remain insu-lated from partisan disputes. Politicizing the Supreme Court by adding seats for the pur-pose of generating an ideological shift would be enormously detrimental for the public's faith in the judicial branch as an inde-pendent and impartial branch of govern-ment. The framers of the U.S. Constitution envisioned a system in which Supreme Court justices and federal judges would serve life-time appointments, ensuring that the judici-ary would not experience the kinds of polit-ical pressures that are present in the elected branches; and Whereas, Subjecting the Supreme Court to major structural changes as a consequence of shifting partisan control of the executive and legislative branches would bring the ju-diciary into the political fray in a way that would harm its ability to fulfill its critical role in our system; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives , That we discourage Congress from expanding the size of the Supreme Court of the United States; and be it further Resolved , That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional dele-gation. POM-255. A resolution adopted by the Sen- ate of the State of Louisiana urging the United States Congress to take necessary ac-tions to review and enact federal law to fully protect developmentally or physically dis-abled federal benefit recipients from sexual and physical exploitation or abuse by payees and fiduciaries; to the Committee on Fi-nance. S ENATE RESOLUTION NO. 51 Whereas, the Social Security Administra- tion, through its Representative Payment Program, appoints family, friends, or other individuals to serve as payees' representa-tives for beneficiaries who are incapable of managing their Social Security or Supple-mental Security Income (SSI) payments due to age, developmental disability, physical disability, or mental disability; and Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, through its Fiduciary Pro-gram, appoints family, friends, or other indi-viduals to serve as fiduciaries and receive payments for veterans who are physically or mentally incapable of managing their vet-erans benefit payments due to physical in-jury, disease, or age; and Whereas, recent medical testimony before the Louisiana Senate Select Committee on Women and Children revealed that develop-mentally or physically disabled patients were being sexually and physically exploited and abused by caregivers who were also pay-ees; and Whereas, studies have shown that children are more likely to be abused if they are liv-ing with certain caregivers, and disabled adults with developmental disabilities are more likely to be abused compared to the general population; and Whereas, the Social Security Administra- tion and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs both have programs to as-sess and review the suitability of payees and fiduciaries; and Whereas, the Senate finds that greater ef- forts must be made to protect develop-mentally or physically disabled federal ben-efit recipients from exploitation and abuse by certain caregivers who are payees or fidu-ciaries; and Whereas, Social Security recipients, SSI recipients, and veterans are entitled to health care benefits through Medicare, Med-icaid, and veterans health benefits; and Whereas, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans health benefits cover an annual wellness visit or routine medical examination with a primary care physician or other health care provider; and Whereas, the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana finds that it would further protec-tion efforts to require developmentally or physically disabled recipients of Social Secu-rity, SSI, or veterans benefits to undergo an annual medical examination with their pri-mary care physician outside of the view of a caregiver so as to eliminate or minimize the possibility of sexual or physical exploitation or abuse from their caregiver who is also a payee or fiduciary. Therefore, be it Resolved , That the Senate of the Legisla- ture of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to take necessary ac-tions to review and enact federal law to fully protect developmentally or physically dis-abled federal benefit recipients from sexual and physical exploitation or abuse by payees and fiduciaries; and be it further, VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:39 SENATE S7177 December 2, 2020 Resolved , That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. POM-256. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana urging the Louisiana Attorney General and all appropriate federal agencies, including but not limited to the Federal Communica-tions Commission, to investigate whether Altice USA or Suddenlink Communications has violated state or federal law in its deal-ings with the citizens of Louisiana; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. H OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2 Whereas, internet connectivity has become a more essential service in the light of COVID-19; and Whereas, tens of thousands of students in Louisiana are dependent on internet service to go to school, thousands of Louisianans are reliant on internet services for telemedicine, and small businesses depend on online sales more than ever; and Whereas, the restoration of communica- tion service after a natural disaster is para-mount to relief efforts and Louisianans re-turning to their normal lives; and Whereas, the Louisiana legislature has re- ceived more than one hundred complaints about Suddenlink engaging in deceptive trade practices, charging fees for services that are not delivered, providing poor cus-tomer service, failing to communicate about key events including hurricanes, and engag-ing in various other problematic and poten-tially illegal behaviors; and Whereas, a joint commerce committee hearing examined how Suddenlink has been failing to meet its obligations to reconnect customers to essential communication equipment, has been charging customers for services it has not delivered, and has lagged behind its peers in assisting in recovery: Therefore, be it Resolved , That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby urge and request the Louisiana Attorney General to use the powers granted to him under the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law to investigate Altice USA and Suddenlink Communications and whether they have been engaging in ac-tions that are prohibited under Louisiana law; and be it further Resolved , That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby urge and request any appro-priate federal agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission, to investigate whether Altice USA and Suddenlink Commu-nications have engaged in a violation of fed-eral law in their dealings with the people of Louisiana; and be it further Resolved , That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Louisiana Attorney Gen-eral, the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America, and to each member of the Louisiana congressional dele-gation. POM-257. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana urging the Louisiana Attorney General and all appropriate federal agencies, including but not limited to the Federal Communica-tions Commission, to investigate whether Altice USA or Suddenlink Communications has violated state or federal law in its deal-ings with the citizens of Louisiana; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. H OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2 Whereas, internet connectivity has become a more essential service in the light of COVID-19; and Whereas, tens of thousands of students in Louisiana are dependent on internet service to go to school, thousands of Louisianans are reliant on internet services for telemedicine, and small businesses depend on online sales more than ever; and Whereas, the restoration of communica- tion service after a natural disaster is para-mount to relief efforts and Louisianans re-turning to their normal lives; and Whereas, the Louisiana legislature has re- ceived more than one hundred complaints about Suddenlink engaging in deceptive trade practices, charging fees for services that are not delivered, providing poor cus-tomer service, failing to communicate about key events including hurricanes, and engag-ing in various other problematic and poten-tially illegal behaviors; and Whereas, a joint commerce committee hearing examined how Suddenlink has been failing to meet its obligations to reconnect customers to essential communication equipment, has been charging customers for services it has not delivered, and has lagged behind its peers in assisting in recovery. Therefore, be it Resolved , That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby urge and request the Louisiana Attorney General to use the powers granted to him under the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law to investigate Altice USA and Suddenlink Communications and whether they have been engaging in ac-tions that are prohibited under Louisiana law, and be it further Resolved , That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby urge and request any appro-priate federal agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission, to investigate whether Altice USA and Suddenlink Commu-nications have engaged in a violation of fed-eral law in their dealings with the people of Louisiana, and be it further Resolved , That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the Louisiana Attorney Gen-eral, the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America, and to each member of the Louisiana congressional dele-gation. POM-258. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana urging the United States Congress and the Louisiana Congressional delegation to take such actions as are necessary to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to more efficiently coordinate the removal of dislocated oilfield equipment after natural disasters in Louisiana; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-ernmental Affairs. H OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 7 Whereas, hurricanes that blow through coastal Louisiana, particularly those that come ashore as a Category 3 or higher, such as Hurricane Rita in 2005 and particularly Hurricane Laura in 2020, leave behind de-struction and dislocation of people, homes, and equipment; and Whereas, Hurricane Laura is estimated to have caused between $4 billion and $12 billion in damages mostly to Louisiana and mostly in the coastal areas of Southwest Louisiana; and Whereas, a component of that damage in- volves the dislocation of equipment from the oil and gas industry located in coastal Lou-isiana, including storage tanks, drums, pipe segments, and other equipment used in the oil patch, equipment that is picked up by the wind and water of the hurricane and dropped elsewhere in the coast; and Whereas, nearly eighty percent of the land in coastal Louisiana is privately-owned land, so much of the dislocated oil and gas equip-ment lands on privately-held property; and Whereas, some of the dislocated oilfield equipment contains materials that can cause pollution if the tanks and drums are dam- aged through the dislocation and could also be the cause of marine accidents when they are located in waterways where boat cap-tains do not expect to find such hazards; and Whereas, initial efforts to locate and iden- tify equipment displaced by a hurricane in-clude an attempt to identify the owner of the equipment, notify the owner that their equipment has been found, and request that the owner remove their equipment from an-other person's property; and Whereas, the second step in attempting to address the dislocated equipment is the Lou-isiana Department of Environmental Quality (LaDEQ), the Louisiana State Police, and the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office (LOSCO) working in cooperation with the United States Coast Guard and, under the auspices of FEMA, working to remove any tank or drum that could be the source of pol-lution in the marsh or could be the cause of marine accidents involving boats and dis-placed tanks or drums; and Whereas, after sources of pollution and im- mediate hazards are removed by LaDEQ, State Police, and LOSCO, the Louisiana De-partment of Transportation and Develop-ment and the Louisiana National Guard, again under the auspices of the FEMA, iden-tify the location and nature of additional tanks, drums, and other oilfield equipment dislodged by the hurricane so removal plans can be developed; and Whereas, plans for removal of dislodged equipment that is neither hazardous nor pol-luting include a development of a timeline and an assessment of the potential damage to the marsh that could occur as a result of removal efforts versus the damage that the item may cause by its relocation to the spot; and Whereas, because the process is a bifur- cated process, requiring removal of haz-ardous or polluting items first and then re-moval of the remainder of the equipment, many times a situation arises that results in a displaced tank being bypassed on the way to remove a hazardous or polluting tank when removing all the equipment at the same time would be more efficient, more cost-effective, and require less overall time to remove all the dislodged equipment; and Whereas, the FEMA practices and proce- dures do not allow the removal of nonhaz-ardous, non-polluting items prior to or at the same time as removal of other displaced oilfield tanks, drums, and other equipment, thereby elongating the process and increas-ing the damage to the private property lo-cated in the marshes of coastal Louisiana; therefore be it Resolved , That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are nec-essary to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency to more efficiently co-ordinate the removal of dislocated oilfield equipment after natural disasters in Lou-isiana; and be it further Resolved , That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana con-gressional delegation.

R ES. 782 Whereas, on December 13, 1920, the Honor- able George Pratt Shultz was born in New York City as the only child of Margaret Len-nox and Birl Earl Shultz; Whereas, upon graduating cum laude from Princeton University with a major in eco-nomics and a minor in public and inter-national affairs in 1942, Shultz joined the Marines and nobly served his country as a captain with a Marine anti-aircraft unit de-ployed with the United States Army's 81st Infantry Division to the Pacific for the bit-terly fought Battle of Angaur in the Palau Islands; Whereas, following the war, Shultz earned a doctorate in industrial economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught in the Department of Eco-nomics and at the Sloan School of Manage-ment until taking leave to serve on Presi-dent Eisenhower's Council of Economic Ad-visors; Whereas Shultz then went on to join the University of Chicago as Dean of the Grad-uate School of Business from 1962 until 1968; Whereas Shultz left academia to honorably serve his country in a number of critical eco-nomic positions, including as Secretary of Labor, the country's first Director of a mod-ernized Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Secretary of the Treasury; Whereas, during his time at the Depart- ment of the Treasury, Shultz co-founded the ''Library Group'', which helped coordinate follow-up to the abolishment of the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system and develop what would eventually become the ''Group of Seven'' or the ''G-7'', an impor-tant forum that has strengthened inter-national economic and security policy by regularly bringing together the world's ad-vanced economies to assess global trends and tackle pervasive and crosscutting issues; Whereas Shultz served as Secretary of State from 1982 until 1989 and was directly involved in bringing Russian President Mi-khail Gorbachev and President Reagan to-gether through a process based upon mutual and verifiable trust, thereby allowing them to reach agreement on the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Trea-ty), which eliminated ground-launched bal-listic and cruise missiles with ranges of be-tween 500 and 5,500 kilometers, and to ini-tiate negotiations to reduce long-range stra- tegic nuclear arms; Whereas, during his tenure as Secretary of State, Shultz had a strong and mutually sup-portive relationship with the career Foreign Service, which he relied upon heavily to ad-vance key international initiatives and at-tain the foreign policy achievements of the Reagan Administration; Whereas Shultz recognized the need to bet- ter prepare a new generation of diplomatic service officers, whether Foreign or Civil Service, and ensured the creation of what be-came the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center (NFATC), thus ex- panding short-term skills training to hun-dreds of ever more diverse Department of State and Federal Government personnel; Whereas, upon returning to private life in 1989, Shultz became a Distinguished Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, wrote and edited several books, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along with more than a dozen other awards and prizes; Whereas, in his later years, Shultz passion- ately advocated for a world without nuclear weapons; Whereas Shultz recently called for the strengthening and modernization of the pro-fessional education and training of our ca-reer diplomats: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) honors the life, achievements, and dis- tinguished public service of the Honorable George Pratt Shultz; (2) recognizes Shultz on the occasion of his 100th birthday and expresses its thanks and commendations to his family; (3) celebrates the statesmanship that has consistently characterized Shultz's life; (4) acknowledges Shultz's published con- cern for rebuilding and strengthening United States diplomacy and its home institution, the Department of State, and his call for the creation of a school of diplomacy at the Na-tional Foreign Affairs Training Center; and (5) commends to future generations Shultz's example as a patriot and public servant both in war and in the pursuit of a more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative world order. f SENATE RESOLUTION 783\u2014DESIG- NATING NOVEMBER 2020 AS ''NA-TIONAL HOSPICE AND PALLIA-TIVE CARE MONTH'' Ms. ROSEN (for herself, Mr. B AR- RASSO , Ms. B ALDWIN , and Mrs. F ISCHER ) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: S.
