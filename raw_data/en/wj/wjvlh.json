The fully awakened shrines of this land serve as a doorway to finding our own Divinity within. It is a land of the wish-granting goddess, Kamakhya, in Assam, and the embodiment of beauty and bliss, Tripurasundari, in the state of Tripura. It is the land of Sri Lakshmi, as sacred water bodies of Manipur, and it is the land of peace and serenity which we can breathe while walking through the forests, streams, and hills of Meghalaya. Excursion Overview Enter the world characterized by its pristine hills, valleys, rivers, lakes, forests, and living root bridges \u2014 all exuding the intrinsic beauty of their creator. To this day, the forces unique to this part of the world have protected the people of the Northeast from succumbing to consumerism and exploitation of natural resources, and helped their people to retain their purity, simplicity, and love and veneration for nature. As a result, The Northeast remained a custodian of culture and spirituality which supersedes all man-made \"isms\" \u2014 a culture and spirituality which mirrors and supports the temples and shrines that we are. Key Highlights of this 15-Day Excursion: Come and See for Yourself... \"This pilgrimage is a step toward finding our own essence; the essence of our Creator and Her creation.
