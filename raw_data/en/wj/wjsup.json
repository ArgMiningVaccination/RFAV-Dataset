If you love hearing about other people's daily routines, and discovering epic habits, hacks and techniques that you can implement in your own life to amplify your results, then you're going to LOVE this conversation. Like always, there's no skating over the surface here. Nick and I go deep into the details of the routines we've consciously tried, tested and refined in order to improve not just our performance and productivity, but also our levels of joy, play, rest and presence. You'll also hear how having a baby has changed the framework of our days, and how we've adapted our daily rhythms in order to spend as much quality time with our little one as possible. So if you want to discover the genius way we structure our work time (which allows us to get more done in a few hours than most people do in a day), the workout routines that are giving Nick major results right now, the green juice recipe that's given me the glowiest skin of my life, and the exact nutritional combos we eat at specific times of the day (and why), then pop in those earbuds... this one's for you.
