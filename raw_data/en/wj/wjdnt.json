Infrared saunas use infrared light to penetrate your body's skin barrier to raise your core temperature. This is different from a traditional sauna that has to heat the air before it actually heats you. Because of these differences, an infrared sauna gets less hot, allowing you to spend more time inside reaping the benefits. Infrared saunas typically emit far-infrared, but the infrared spectrum consists of three different wavelengths - each with their own healing capabilities. Near-infrared (NIR) penetrates the least past the skin barrier to help more on a surface-level by fighting against signs of aging and helping to heal wounds. Mid- infrared (MIR) goes a little deeper to help reduce inflammation and chronic pain and far-infrared (FIR) goes the deepest into the body to help with chronic pain as well as draw out toxins. I always recommend [Sunlighten](https://www.sunlighten.com/?leadsource=drwilliamcole&utm_source=drwilliamcole&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=drwilliamcole) to anyone looking for an infrared sauna as they are the only brand to offer three separate heating elements to deliver all three spectrum benefits at peak wavelengths.

What are the health benefits of infrared saunas? Infrared saunas help heal many chronic health problems through targeting key underlying factors that contribute to many of these illnesses. Here are just a few of the reasons why I love infrared saunas as a [functional medicine](https://drwillcole.com/functional-medicine-doctor) benefit: 1. Lowers inflammation Almost every health problem - autoimmune conditions, digestive issues, brain problems, and hormonal imbalances included - can be [traced back to inflammation gone wild](https://drwillcole.com/the-inflammation-spectrum/). Infrared saunas naturally calm down inflammation in the body. 2. Restores energy A recent [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15992574/) (1) showed that after 20 days of consistent infrared sauna use, participants with [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://drwillcole.com/exhausted-8-natural-ways-overcome-chronic-fatigue-good/) saw significant improvement in their symptoms. 3. Supports detoxification The amount of toxins we are exposed to on a daily basis has risen exponentially. This rise of toxins is pervasive in our environment and bodies with more and more studies [linking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566242/) (2) our exposure to the rise of autoimmune and other chronic diseases. Sweating is the body's way of naturally detoxing, so with a simple infrared sauna session, you can help flush out these chemicals. 4. Enhances brain function BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factors, increase with sauna use and are responsible for facilitating the growth of new brain cells to improve memory and brain function. 5. Boots immunity Raising body temperature is a natural way to help your immune system [fight off](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC312877/) (3) viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. 6. Reduces chronic pain Infrared saunas work to stimulate circulation to bring down inflammation throughout the whole body. They also have the ability to increase the production of white blood cells which help fight inflammation and calm swelling to [alleviate chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12925192). (12) Research also [shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685882) (9) that infrared saunas can reduce pain even for those dealing with painful conditions like, [fibromyalgia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21742283), (10) [chronic headaches](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636135), (11) and rheumatoid [arthritis](https://drwillcole.com/autoimmune-health/a-functional-medicine-guide-to-rheumatoid-arthritis), by releasing your body's natural painkillers, or endorphins, which have an opioid-like effect. Fibromyalgia An estimated 6 million Americans are afflicted with this chronic condition that causes fatigue, headaches, and stiffness and pain in muscles, joints, and tendons. A Japanese study showed that after just one infrared sauna session, patients experienced a [70% decrease](https://www.prohealth.com/library/efficacy-of-waon-therapy-for-fibromyalgia-source-internal-medicine-tokyo-aug-15-2008-25369) (13) in their pain levels! Chronic fatigue syndrome According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome one must be experiencing muscle pain and pain in multiple joints without redness or swelling for at least six months. A 2005 study showed that after 15 to 25 sessions, participants' symptoms such as fatigue and pain were drastically reduced. Even after discontinuing treatment, symptoms either didn't return or get worse. Chronic fatigue syndrome is also associated with an overload of toxins in the cells. An infrared sauna works wonders for detoxing the cells since sweating promotes the secretion of toxins. Arthritis Research [has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685882) (14) that using an infrared sauna can reduce pain in people suffering from severe conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Infrared wavelengths promote circulation to help relieve stiff joints and sore muscles. 7. Improves skin health People who used saunas had an [improvement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18525205) (4) in both skin hydration and overall complexion 8. Eases stress and anxiety You can down green juice and kale all day, but if you also feed your body a slice of stress every day, your body will still have a problem. Studies show that chronic stress raises inflammation which is linked to multiple different health problems. Infrared saunas promote relaxation and give you a chance to zen out and recharge. Sauna use can [restore](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2759081) (5) balance to the (HPA) axis, when out of whack, is responsible for [adrenal fatigue](https://drwillcole.com/energy/facts-about-adrenal-fatigue). And the rise in BDNF levels also works to [improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20594764) (6) depression and anxiety. 9. Increases longevity Consistent sauna use has been shown to dramatically reduce the risks associated with heart disease as well as your risk of dying from other health causes. In fact, those who use saunas between four to seven times a week are 48 percent [less likely](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2130724) to die from heart disease compared to those who only used a sauna once a week. (7) 10. Prevents cancer Using an infrared sauna can also benefit cancer patients. One study found that a one-hour sauna session at 109 degrees F [killed off](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227168/) (8) bone cancer cells. Vibration Therapy Vibration therapy is just one more way to ease chronic pain by using low frequency vibration to contract and relax muscles - 30 to 50 times every second - it gives the whole body a workout just from standing or sitting still to increase blood flow, strengthen joints, and increase growth hormone to repair and regenerate muscle and reduce overall pain. [Sunlighten](https://www.sunlighten.com/?leadsource=drwilliamcole&utm_source=drwilliamcole&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=drwilliamcole) has enhanced the infared sauna experience with the amazing benefits of vibration therapy with the addition of their SO Sound Therapy option. This technology uses sound waves synergistically with their infrared saunas to deliver the most targeted relief for chronic pain. The SO Sound System attaches to specific locations in the Sunlighten sauna to emit tactile elements from the music it produces. Unlike a subwoofer where the volume has to be really load to experience the vibrations, the SO Sound System produces soft musical harmonic resonance to produce the same effects on your body. Are infrared saunas safe? Recommended treatment times for infrared saunas range from 10 to 30 minutes, and with proper use, pose no serious side effect risk and are safe for the majority of people. Due to the higher temperatures and sweating, some people can experience lightheadedness. Here's what you should keep in mind when using or considering using an infrared sauna: - Hydration It's important to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated since you are losing fluids through sweating. Drink water before using an infrared sauna to prepare your body and after using it to replenish yourself from the sweat loss. - Underlying conditions If you have heart problems, are on medications, or are sensitive to heat, it is always a good idea to talk with your doctor to make sure infrared sauna use is right for you. - Length of time: If you're new to using an infrared sauna, start out with a duration of 10-15 minutes. From there, you can increase the time in increments of 5 minutes. This way you can work your way up to the suggested 25 to 30 minutes. Temperature: You should also start out at a lower setting when it comes to temperature if you are just beginning to use an infrared sauna. What should you look for in an infrared sauna? There are obviously great infrared sauna benefits, but that doesn't mean they are all made equal. You want to look for brands that test for EMFs, electromagnetic fields, since in high doses can be harmful to your body, especially if you plan on using this sauna on a regular basis. There are many fantastic brands, but my personal favorite is [Sunlighten](https://www.sunlighten.com/?leadsource=drwilliamcole&utm_source=drwilliamcole&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=drwilliamcole) since they go above and beyond with testing and providing low-EMF infrared sauna systems.
