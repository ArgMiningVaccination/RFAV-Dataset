The pending rule becomes final and effective at the conclusion of the legislative session, unl ess the rule is approved, rejected, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution in accordance with Section 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved, am ended, or modified by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specified in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 56-1003 and 56-1023, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of a ny change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. The current EMS rules establish a statewide EMS Advisory Committee (EMSAC) to provide counsel to the Department in administering the Emergency Medical Services Act (Sections 56-1011 through 56- 1023, Idaho Code). The membership requirements and organizat ional representation on the EMSAC are being updated in these rules to reflect the addi tion of the Idaho Transportation Department. The Department is writing this new chapter to provide the representation on the committee, and the committee's duties and responsibilities. Under Section 56-1013A, Idaho Code, the Idaho EMS Physician Commission was created and assumed responsibility for the provi der scopes of practi ce from the Board of Medicine. Because of this change, the represen tation of the Board of Medicine is being removed from the EMS Advisory Committee and replaced with representation from the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), Offi ce of Highway Operations and Safety, since the majority of EMS requests for serv ices are related to traffic accidents. This new chapter of rules will provide the following for EMS Advisory Committee: 1. Establish the required membership and or ganizational representation, including the addition of the Idaho Transportation Depa rtment (ITD), and removal of the Idaho Board of Medicine representation; 2. Provide length of terms of membership;3. Provide guidelines, duties, and resp onsibilities of the committee; and 4. Provide definitions and other required sections needed to meet APA requirements for rules.

The membership requirements and organizational representation on the EMSAC need to be updated in these rules to reflect the ad dition of the Idaho Transportation Department.

Under Section 56-1013A, Idaho Code, the Idaho EMS Physician Commission was created and assumed responsibility for the provi der scopes of practi ce from the Board of Medicine. Because of this change, the represen tation of the Board of Medicine will be removed from the EMS Advisory Committee and replaced with representation from the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), Offi ce of Highway Operations and Safety, since the majority of EMS requests for serv ices are related to traffic accidents. This new chapter of rules will provide the following for EMS Advisory Committee: 5. Establish the required membership and or ganizational representation, including the addition of the Idaho Transportation Depa rtment (ITD), and removal of the Idaho Board of Medicine representation; 6. Provide length of terms of membership;7. Provide guidelines, duties, and resp onsibilities of the committee; and 8.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and amending the te mporary rule and a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: Rule changes were made in this chapter to allow households to conduct business with the Department electronically, and allow the Depar tment to e-mail notices to participants. Rule changes were also made to streamline the proce ss for determining student eligibility, as well as the recertification process for simplified re porting households. Finally, rule changes were made to add a Job Search Assistance Progr am (JSAP) exemption for women who are in their third trimester of pregnancy, to refine the definition of prohibited participation, and to ensure that Idaho is in compliance with federal food stamp regulations. Amendments are being made to the temporary and pending rule in response to feedback from the federal Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Some of the previously proposed changes have been removed as they woul d have inadvertently imposed additional requirements that would necessitate costly au tomation and a need for increased staffing resources in order to implement.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed regular rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pur suant to Section 56-203, Idaho Code, and 7 CFR Part 273. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerni ng this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-fiv e (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than October 19, 2011.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Rule changes are being made in this chapt er to allow households to conduct business with the Department electronically and a llow the Department to e-mail notices to participants. Rule changes are also needed to streamline the process for determining student eligibility, as well as the recertification process for simplified reporting households. Finally, rule changes are needed to add a Job Sear ch Assistance Program (JSAP) exemption for THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED WITH THE TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED RULEDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0304-1101 Rules Governing the Food Stamp Program in Idaho PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 121 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKwomen who are in their third trimester of pregna ncy, to refine the definition of prohibited participation, and to ensure that Idaho is in compliance with federal food stamp regulations. Specifically, this includes:1. Allow the Department to send eligibility notices electronically to participants who voluntarily chose an electroni c method of communication. 2. Average student hours over the month, rather than by the week, when determining food stamp eligibility. This will simplify the business process for the Department and increase participation among st udents by allowing them flexibility to schedule their work hours around academic responsibilities and remain eligible for food stamps. 3. Allow for the interview requirement to be waived at the 6-month recertification in certain cases, allowing for written contact and subsequent verification of the participant's circumstances in lieu of the interview. This streamlines the recertification process for participants and staff by allowing for a higher completion rate, and resulting in fewer new applications (which are more labor and time intensive than the 6-mo nth recertification). 4. Exempt women from JSAP who are in their third trimester of pregnancy, due to the difficulty in gaining employment in advanced stages of pregnancy. 5. Prohibit a child from receiving Temporary Assistance for Famili es in Idaho (TAFI) with one caretaker relative while receiving Food Stamps in another household. This allows the Department to proactively end participation for children who would otherwise create an overpayment resulting in subsequent hardship for the family involved. 6. Extend the penalty period for participants who refuse to cooperate with a state quality control review per federal rule change. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67- 5226(1)(b) and (c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporar y adoption of the rule is appropriate. Some changes comply with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs (due to changes in 7 CFR Part 273), and the rest confer benefits to Food Stamp participants. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousa nd dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year. N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67- 5220, Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because this rulemaking is being done to bring this chapter of rules into compliance with 7 CFR Part 273, and to streamline and update the Food Stamps Program thereby conferring benefits to Food Stamp participants.DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0304-1101 Rules Governing the Food Stamp Program in Idaho PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 122 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: No materials are being incorporated by reference into these rules.

Allowing for electronic and telephonic signatures improves access for our rural state where offi ces are not always close by and helps to support communities where offices were closed. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year.

(3-19-07) 03. Preventing Deterioration for Children . Skilled care is needed to prevent, to the extent possible, deterioration of the child's cond ition or to sustain current capacities, regardless of the restoration potential of a child, even where full recovery or medical improvement is not possible. (3-19-07) 04. Specific Needs for Children . When the plan of care, risk factors, and aggregate of health care needs is such that the assessments, interventions, or supervision of the child necessitates the skills of a licensed nurse or a lice nsed physical therapist or licensed occupational therapist. In such cases, the specific needs or ac tivities must be documented by the physician's orders, progress notes, plan of care , and nursing and therapy notes. (3-19-07) 05.

If an admission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care will be deemed to exist. (3-19-07) ( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 257. NURSING FACILITY: DEVELOPMENT OF THE RATE. Nursing facility rates are prospective, with new rates effective July 1st of each year, and are recalculated annually with quarterly adjustments fo r case mix. The rate for a nursing facility is the sum of the cost components described in Subsection 257.04 through 257.0 98 of this rule. In no case will the rate be set higher than the charge for like services to private pay patients in effect for the period for which payment is made as computed by the lower of costs or customary charges. For the rate period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, rates will be calculated using cost reports ended in calendar year 2010 with no allowa nce for inflation to the rate period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012. (5-8-09) ( ) 01. Applicable Case Mix Index (CMI) . The Medicaid CMI used in establishing each facility's rate is calculated based on the most re cent assessment for each Medicaid resident in the nursing facility on the first day of the month of th e preceding quarter (for example, assessments as of April 1are used to establish the CMI needed to establish rates for the quarter beginning July 1st). Facility-wide CMI is calculated based on the most recent assessment for all residents in the nursing facility. The CMI is recal culated quarterly and each nursing facility's rate is adjusted accordingly. A facility-wide CMI is also established each year by averaging four (4) calendar quarter CMIs for the cost reporting period from histor ical data to represent each fiscal quarter in the cost reporting period (for example, an Octobe r 1 CMI would represent the fiscal quarter ended September 30th). (3-19-07) DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-1104 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 285 2012 PENDING RULE BOOK02. Applicable Cost Data . The cost data used in establishing the cost components of the rate calculation are from the audited or unaudi ted cost report which ended during the previous calendar year (for example, cost reports ending during the period from January 1, 1998 - December 31, 1998 are used in setti ng rates effective July 1, 1999). The draft audit of a cost report submitted by a facility will be issued by the Department no later than five (5) months after the date all information required for completion of the audit is filed with the Department. (3-19-07) 03. Interim Rates . Nursing facilities with unaudited cost reports are given an interim rate established by the Department until a rate is calculated based on an audited cost report. When audited data are available, a re troactive adjustment to the payment rate is made through the calculation of the finalized rate. (3-19-07) 04. Direct Care Cost Component . The direct care cost component of a nursing facility's rate is determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. The direct care per diem cost limit applicable to the rate period for a nursing facility type (free-standing and urban hospital- based nursing facility or rural hospital-based nursing facility) is identified. The identified dir ect care cost limit is divided by the statewide average CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's facility- wide CMI for the cost reporting period to derive the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit. (3-19-07) b. The adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is compared to the nursing facility's inflated direct care per diem co sts. The lower of the two (2) amounts is then case mix adjusted. (3-19-07) i. If the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is lower, the adjusted limit is divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for th e cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's most recent quarterly Medicaid CM I for the rate period to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) ii. If the inflated direct care per diem costs are lower, these costs, minus raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs, are divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, then multiplied by the nursi ng facility's most recen t quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period. Raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs are then added back to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) 05. Indirect Care Cost Component . The indirect care cost component of a facility's rate is the lesser of the facility's inflated indirect care per diem costs, or th e indirect per diem cost limit for that type of provider -- free-standing and urba n hospital-based nursing facilities, or rural hospital-based nursing facilities. (3-19-07) 06. Costs Exempt From Limitation . Costs exempt from cost limits are property taxes, property insurance, utilities and costs related to new legal mandates as defined in Section 264 of these rules. (3-19-07) 07. Property Reimbursement . The property reimbursement component is calculated DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-1104 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 286 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKin accordance with Section 275 and Subsection 240.19 of these rules. (3-19-07) 08. Revenue Offset . Revenues from products or serv ices provided to nonpatients will be offset from the corresponding rate component(s ) as described in Section 257 of these rules. (3-19-07) 258. NURSING FACILITY: COST LIMI TS BASED ON COST REPORT. Each July 1st cost limitations will be establis hed for nursing facilities based on the most recent audited cost report with an end date of June 30th of the previ ous year or before. Calculated limitations will be effective for a one (1) year pe riod, from July 1 through June 30th of each year, which is the rate year. For the rate period of July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2012, the direct and indirect cost limits were calculated using the most recent finalized cost reports adjusted to the midpoint of the cost reporting year's end in calendar year 2010, to allow for no inflation to the rate year . (5-8-09) ( ) 01. Percentage Above Bed-Weighted Median . Prior to establishing the first \"shadow rates\" at July 1, 1999, the estimated Medicaid paym ents under the previous retrospective system for the year period from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, will be calculated. This amount will then be used to model the estimated payments unde r the case mix system set forth in Sections 255 through 257 of these rules. The percentages above the bed-weighted median, for direct and indirect costs, will be establis hed at a level that approximate s the same amount of Medicaid expenditures as would have been produced by the re trospective system. The percentages will also be established to appr oximate the same distribution of total Medicaid dollars between the hospital-based and freestanding nursi ng facilities as existed under th e retrospective system. Once the percentage is established, it will be used to calculate the limit by multiplying the bed-weighted median per diem direct cost times the calculated percentage for that class of provider. There will be a direct and indirect percentage that is app lied to freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facilities, and a higher direct and indirect percenta ge that is applied to rural hospital-based nursing facilities. Once established, these percentages will re main in effect for futu re rate setting periods. (3-19-07) 02. Direct Cost Limits . The direct cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adju stment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be normalized and arrayed from high to low, with freestanding and hospital-based nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (3-19-07) 03. Indirect Cost Limits . The indirect cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which th e limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be arrayed, with freestanding a nd hospital- based nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (3-19-07) 04. Limitation on Increase or Decrease of Cost Limits . Increases in the direct and indirect cost limits will be determined by the limit ations calculated in the most recent base year, indexed forward each year from the midpoint of the base year to the midpoint of the rate year by the inflation factor plus one percent (1%) per annum . The calculated direct and indirect cost limits DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-1104 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 287 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKwill not be allowed to decrease below the limitati ons effective in the base year. The maximum rate of growth on the cost limits, and the minimum co st limitation, will be examined by the oversight committee periodically to determine which factors to use in the calculation of the limitations effective in the new base year and forward. (3-29-10) 05. Costs Exempt From Limitations . Costs exempt from limitations include property taxes, property insurance, and utilities. These co sts will be reimbursed on a per diem basis and will not be included in the calcul ation of the direct or indirect care component. However, property taxes and property insurance will be subject to minimum occupancy levels as defined in Section 278 of these rules. (3-19-07) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 307.

Evaluate the past three (3) years of Medicaid expenditures from the participant' s profile, excluding physician, pharmacy, and institutional services; (3-19-07) b. Review all assessment information iden tified in Section 512 of these rules; (3-19-07) c. Identify the level of support derived from the most current SIB-R. The level of support is a combination of the individual' s functional abilities and maladaptive behavior as determined by the SIB-R. Six (6 ) broad levels of support have been identified on a scale from zero to one hundred (0 - 100) (see Table 514.01.c.). There are six (6) levels of support, each corresponding to a support score range. (3-19-07) d. Correlate the level of support identified by the SIB-R to a budget range derived from the expenditures of individuals at the same level of support across the adult DD population. This correlation will occur annually prior to the development to the plan of service; (3-19-07) 02. Negotiating an Appropriate Partic ipant Budget Prior to October 1, 2006 . The assessor, the participant, and the plan developer must use all the information from Subsections 514.01.a. through 514.01.d. of these rules to negotiate an appropriate budget that will support the participant' s identified needs. (3-19-07) 031. Individualized Budget Beginning on October 1, 2006 . Beginning October 1, 2006, for DD waiver participants, and begi nning January 1, 2007, for all other adult DD participants, the Department sets an individua lized budget for each participant according to an individualized measurement of the participant' s functional abilities, behavioral limitations, and medical needs, and other individual factors related to the participant's disability. Using these specific participant factors, the budget-setti ng methodology will correlate a participant's characteristics with the participant's individua lized budget amount, so participants with higher needs will be assigned a higher individualized budget amount. (3-29-10) ( ) a. During the implementation phase of using the new individualized budget-setting methodology, the budget calculation will include reviewing the participant's previous year's budget. When the calculated budget is less than five percent (5%) above or below the previous year's budget, the participant's set budget amount is the calculated budget amount. When the TABLE 514.01.c. - LEVEL OF SUPPORT Support Score Range Level of Support 1-24 Pervasive 25-39 Extensive 40-54 Frequent 55-69 Limited 70-84 Intermittent 85-100 Infrequent DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-1105 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 347 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKcalculated budget is greater than five percent (5%) above or below the previous year's budget, the participant's set budget amount is the previous year's budget amount. The Department will collect information on discrepancies between the calc ulated budget and the previous year's budget as part of the ongoing assessment and improvement process of the budget-setting methodology. (3-19-07) ba. The Department notifies each pa rticipant of his set budget amount as part of the eligibility determination process or annual redeter mination process . The notification will include how the participant may request reconsideration of appeal the set budget amount. (3-19-07) ( ) cb. Individualized budgets will be re-evaluated annually. At the request of the participant, the Department will also re -evaluate the set budget amount when there are documented changes in the participant's individualized needs and it is demonstrated that these additional needs cannot be supported by the current budget condition resulting in a need for services that meet medical necessity criteria, and this is not reflected on the current inventory of individual needs . (3-19-07) ( ) 042. Residential Levels of Support . Reimbursement for residential ha bilitation - supported living is base d on the participant's assessed level of support need. All plans of service that include supported living must include community integration goals that provide for maintained or enhanced independence, quality of life, and self- determination. As a participant's independence increases and he is less dependent on supports, he must transition to less intense supports. (3-19-07) a. High support is for those participants w ho require twenty-four (24) hour per day supports and supervision and have an SIB-R Support Level of Pervasive, Extensive, or Frequent. High support allows for a blend of one-to-one and group staffing. Participants authorized at the high support daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These servic es are included in the high support daily rate. (3-19-07) b. Intense support is for those exceptional participants who require intense, twenty- four (24) hour per day supports and supervision. This support leve l typically requires one-on-one staffing, but requests for a blend of one-on-one and group staffing will be reviewed on a case-by- case basis. Participants authorized at the inte nse support daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These services are included in the intense support da ily rate. To qualify for this level of support, participants must be evaluated to meet one or more of the following criteria: (3-19-07) i. Recent felony convictions or charges for of fenses related to the serious injury or harm of another person. These participants must have been placed in a supported living setting directly from incarceration or directly afte r being diverted from incarceration. (3-19-07) ii. History of predatory sexual offenses a nd are at high risk to re-offend based on a sexual offender risk assessm ent completed by an appropr iate professional. (3-19-07) iii. Documented, sustained history of serious aggressive behavior showing a pattern of causing harm to themselves or others. The serious aggressive behavior must be such that the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-1105 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 348 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKthreat or use of force on another person makes that person reasonably fear bodily harm. The participant must also have the capability to carry out such a threat. The frequency and intensity of this type of aggressive beha vior must require continuous monitoring to prevent injury to themselves or others. (3-19-07) iv. Chronic or acute medical conditions that are so complex or unstable that one-to- one staffing is required to provide frequent inte rventions and constant monitoring. Without this intervention and monitoring the participant would re quire placement in a nursing facility, hospital, or ICF/ID with twenty-four (24) hour on-site nursing. Verification of the complex medical condition and the need for this level of se rvice requires medical documentation. (3-19-07) c. Hourly support is for those individuals that do not meet criteria for either high or intense supports or those individuals who qualify for a daily rate but whose needs can be met with less than twenty-four (24) per day support. The combination of hourly supported living, developmental therapy, community supported em ployment, and adult day care will not be authorized to exceed the maximum set daily amount established by the Department except when all of the following conditions are met: (3-19-07) i. The participant is eligible to receive the high support daily rate; (3-19-07)ii. Community supported employment is included in the plan and is causing the combination to exceed the daily limit; (3-19-07) iii. There is documentation that the Person- Centered Planning team has explored other options including using lower cost services and natural supports; and (3-19-07) iv. The participant's health and safety need s will be met using hourly services despite having been assessed to qualify for twenty-four (24) hour care. (3-19-07) 515.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Department is updating these rules to meet federal requirements for the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatme nt and Adoption Reform Act (CAPTA).

This will alleviate delays in law enforcement's investigatio n of child abuse and neglect. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Board rules currently require that applicants for certification as a medication assistant pass an examination as a measur e of beginning competence.

The rulemaking removes this impediment by authorizing the Board to measure beginning level competency through an alternative process. The temporary rulemaking was approved by the 2011 Legislature. The complete text of the temporary rule was published in the December 1, 2010 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V ol. 10-12, pages 169 and 170 . FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than te n thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: None.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The new crop residue burning rules have been in effect since 2008. Upon completion of the second year of burning under the new rules, it became apparent that some smaller crop residue burns could and should be regulated under the rules differently than those large scale high fuel content burns. This temporary/proposed rule sets out provisions for obtaining spot burn, baled agricultural residue burn, and propane flaming permits. Farmers desiring to burn crop residue, members of the regulated community who may be subject to Idaho's air quality rules as well as special interest groups, Idaho State Department of Agriculture, tribes, public offi cials, and members of the public who have an interest in the regulation of air emissions from sources in Idaho may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Langu age the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ in tends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2011 for adoption of a pending rule. The pending rule is expected to become fina l and effective upon adjournment of the 2012 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. DEQ will submit the final rule to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED WITH THE TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED RULE July 7, 2011, 3:30 pm Department of Environmental Quality Conference Room B 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Idaho DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0101-1001 Control of Air Pollution in Idaho PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 553 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKbe included in the State Implementation Plan as required by Section 110 of the Clean Air Act. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the ru le is appropriate in that the rule confers a benefit. Adoption of a temporary rule enables farmers with small crop residue burns to burn within a streamlined proc ess under certain conditions. Adoption of Section 624 does not in itself au thorize the open burnin g of crop residue in Idaho. Before burning under Section 624 can be co nducted, several actions must take place, including development of a revi sed State Implementation Plan (SIP) and approval of the SIP by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Prior to EPA SIP approval, those desiring to conduct spot burns, baled agricultural residue burns, or propane flaming must obtain a permit by rule in accordance with Sections 618 through 623. Contact DEQ before burning.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226(1), Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality is co mmencing proposed rulemaking. This action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rule will be held as follows: The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5 ) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to repeal IDAPA 58.01.01, Section 199, Electric Generating Unit Cons truction Prohibition, and IDAPA 58.01.01, Subsection 107.03.o., which specifically excludes the Federal Re gister publications regarding coal fired utilities from incorporation by reference into the Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho, IDAPA 58.01.01. In November 2006, DEQ was required by the federal Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) to submit a plan to EPA that (1) ensured the st ate would meet its Annual Coal Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Unit (EGU) Mercury (Hg) budget for the appropriate periods; and (2) required EGUs to comply with various monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting provisions. As part of the plan, DEQ proposed the adoption of a rule to opt out of, or not participate in, the federal cap and trade program for Hg emissions from EGUs, codified at 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart HHHH (Subsection 107.03.o) . Additionally, to meet the state of Idaho's zero budget, DEQ proposed a rule that prohibits the construction of any EGU with Hg emissions (Section 199). These rules were adopted by the Board of Environmental Quality in 2006 and approved by the Idaho Legislature in 2007. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the CAMR in New Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574 (D.C. Circuit 2008). DEQ initiated this rulemaking following legislative approval of air quality rules designed to limit and control mercury emissi ons from certain facilities (Pending Rule Docket No. 58-0101-0904).

TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate in that the rule confers a benefit. Temporary adoption of this ru le confers a benefit to the state of Idaho in that construction of electric generating units would no longer be prohibited.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226(1), Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality is co mmencing proposed rulemaking. This rulemaking action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been sche duled. Pursuant to Section 67- 5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hear ing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be recei ved by the undersigned on o\u00ecr before June 15, 2011. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to revise the priority rating criteria for the wastewater pl anning grants to closely match the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan crit eria, address the need to redu ce the obligation to conduct an environmental study in those cases in which a grant recipient will not immediately pursue federal aid for construction, and update the cost eligibility criteria to achieve consistency. The change to make the environmental study op tional will reduce costs for grant recipients in their preparation of facilit y planning studies by making the environmental study aspect of facility planning optional. Additionally, this rulemaking will bring the Wastewater Planning Grant Program into closer alignm ent with related DEQ programs (the Clean Water SRF Program and the Drinking Water Planning Grant Program). This temporary/proposed ru le includes the following: Priority rating criteria for the wastewater pl anning grants have been revised to closely match the Clean Water SRF loan criteria. The requirement to produce an environmental study as part of a planning document has been made optional. Cost eligibility criteria have been updated to achieve consistency. This rule also includes revisions that are typographical and nonsubstantive in nature (e.g., revisions made for consistency with other sections in this rule chapter and other DEQ rules).

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Idaho's Rules an d Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain consistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's federal regulations implementing the Resour ce Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Man agement Act (HWMA). This proposed rule updates the federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2011. In addition, this proposed rule incl udes corrections in Sections 005, 006, 011, and 018. In Section 005, the reference to the Pe rmits and Enforcement division of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has been changed to Waste Management and Remediation Division. Sections 006, 011, and 018 h ave been revised as a result of technical corrections made to the federal regulations. Groups interested in hazardous waste and handlers of hazardous waste including generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Langu age the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ in tends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in November 2011 for adoption as a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and ef fective upon the conclusion of the 2012 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the incorporation by reference is necessary: Idaho has historically adopted both required and optional federal regulations so that Idaho's hazardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Optional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows the DEQ to keep its rules up to date with fede ral regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idaho's authorization current.

This rulemaking action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been sche duled. Pursuant to Section 67- 5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hear ing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the unders igned on or before June 15, 2011. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to make the necessary revisions for consistency with the recent chan ges to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF). Recent changes to the federal statutes (Pub. L. No. 111-88, 123 Stat. 2904 (2009)) governing the Clean Water SRF require that DE Q update and revise the state Rules for Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans. Federal law now requires that DEQ consider system sustainability practices as a measure of fitness for municipalities and districts to receive a loan. Federal law also re quires that a certain amount of each year's federal Clean Water Act grant be provided in the form of a subsidy. In addition, this rulemaking will bring Idaho's Clean Water SRF Program into closer alignment with other related DEQ programs (the Drinking Water SRF Program and the Wastewater Planning Grant Program). This proposed rule includes the following: Priority rating criteria have been revise d to incorporate points for sustainability. The step-by-step process to arrive at a loan subsidy has been revised so that interest rates and loan repayment periods will be used in a more flexible manner. The priority list rating and cost eligibilit y criteria have been updated to achieve consistency with other DEQ rules. This proposed rule also includes revisions that are typographical and nonsubstantive in nature (e.g., revisions made for consistency with other sections in this rule chapter and other DEQ rules). Prospective loan recipients, consulting engineers, grant administrators, and other funding agencies may be interested in commenting on this proposed ru le. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the age ncy proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ in tends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2011 for adoption of a pending rule. The THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED WITH THE PROPOSED RULE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0112-1001 Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 616 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKpending rule is expected to become fina l and effective upon adjournment of the 2012 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature.

In conjunction with the standard loans, the Department may award disadvantaged loans to applicants deemed disadvantaged using the following criteria: ( ) 01. Qualifying for a Disadvantaged Loan . In order to qualify for a disadvantaged loan, a loan applicant must have an annual user rate for wastewater service for residential customers which exceeds one and one-half percen t (1\u00bd%) of the applicant community's median household income. The applicant shall agree to a thir ty (30) year loan unless the design life of the project is documented to be less th an thirty (30) years. The annual user rate would be based on all operating, maintenance, replacement , and debt service costs (both for the existing system and for upgrades). If the applicant's service area is not w ithin the boundaries of a municipality, or if the applicant's service area's median household income is not consistent with the municipality as a whole, the applicant may use the census data for the county in which it is located or may use a representative survey, conducted by a Department approved, objective third party, to verify the median household income of the applicant's service area. ( ) 02. Adjustment of Loan Terms . DEQ will equally apporti on funds available for principal forgiveness to all prospective disadvantaged loan recipients. Consistent with achieving user rates of one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the applicant community's median household income, and where possible with available funds, loan terms may be adjusted in the following order: decreasing the interest rate and providing principal forgiveness. ( ) a. Decreasing Interest Rate. The loan interest rate may be reduced from the rate established by the Director for standard loans to a ra te that results in an annual user rate equal to one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of median household income. The interest rate may be reduced to as low as zero percent (0%). ( ) DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0112-1001 Administration of Water Pollution Control Loans PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 624 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKb. Principal Forgiveness. If even at zero percent (0%) interest, the annual user rate per residential user still exce eds one and one-half percent (1\u00bd% ) of median household income, the principal which causes the user charge to exceed one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) may be reduced except the principal reduction cannot ex ceed fifty percent (50%) of the total loan. Principal forgiveness terms may be revised (from initial estimates established in the annual Intended Use Plan) based upon final construction costs, such that loan terms do not result in user rates that are below one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the applicant community's median household income. ( ) 0212. SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS. In conjunction with loans, the Department may award state funded supplemental grants, not to exceed ninety percent (90%) of total eligible costs, to applicants loan recipients in the following manner: (5-8-09) ( ) 01. Projects Not Funded by Loans . Planning and design projects may receive grant assistance up to ninety percent (90%) funding of eligible costs not funded by a loan; and (1-1-89) 02. Costs in Excess of Financial Ability . (3-30-01) a. Applicants Loan recipients may receive supplemental grant assistance for eligible costs that exceed the amount a loan recipient is able to pay. In order to qualify for a supplemental grant, a loan recipient must have the following: (5-8-09) ( ) i. An annual cost user rate per household which exceeds one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the median household income from the most recent census data. If the applicant's loan recipient's service area is not within the boundaries of a municipality, the applicant loan recipient may use the census data for the county in which it is located or may use an income survey approved by the Department; and (5-8-09) ( ) ii. The annual cost user rate includes all operating, main tenance, replacement and debt service costs, both for th e existing system and for upgrades , being financed with state revolving funds .

This rulemaking action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 76, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been sche duled. Pursuant to Section 67- 5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hear ing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the unders igned on or before June 15, 2011. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to make the necessary revisions for consistency with the recent ch anges to the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF). Recent changes to the federal statutes (Pub. L. No. 111-88, 123 Stat. 2904 (2009)) governing the Drinking Water SRF requir e that DEQ update and revise the state Rules for the Administration of Drinking Wa ter Loan Program. Federal law now requires that DEQ consider system sustainability practi ces as a measure of fitness for municipalities and districts to receive a loan. Federal law also requires that a certain amount of each year's federal Safe Drinking Water Act grant be provided in the form of a subsid y. In addition, this rulemaking will bring Idaho's Drinking Water SRF Program into closer alignment with other related DEQ programs (the Clean Water SRF Program and the Drinking Water Planning Grant Program). This proposed rule includes the following:Priority rating criteria have been revise d to incorporate points for sustainability. The step-by-step process to arrive at a loan subsidy has been revised so that interest rates and loan repayment periods will be used in a more flexible manner. The priority list rating and cost eligibilit y criteria have been updated to achieve consistency with other DEQ rules. This proposed rule also includes revisions that are typographical and nonsubstantive in nature (e.g., revisions made for consistency with other sections in this rule chapter and other DEQ rules). Prospective loan recipients, consulting engineers, grant administrators, and other funding agencies may be interested in commenting on this proposed ru le. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the age ncy proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed.

Qualifying for a Disadvantaged Loan . In order to qualify for a disadvantaged loan, a loan applicant must have an annual cost of user rater for drinking water service for residential customers which exceeds one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the applicant DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0120-1001 Administration of Drinking Water Loan Program PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 648 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKcommunity's median household income. (4-2-08) a. The annual cost includes user rate would be based on all operating, maintenance, replacement, and debt service costs (bot h for the existing system and for upgrades) being financed with state revolving funds . If the applicant's service area is not within the boundaries of a municipality, or if the applicant's service area's median household income is not consistent with the municipality as a whole, the applicant may us e the census data for the county in which it is located or may use a representative survey, c onducted by a Department approved, objective third party, to verify the median household income of the applicant's service area. (4-2-08) ( ) b. For disadvantaged applicants for which the annual cost exceeds one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the median household income, those applicants must agree to seek assistance from all other available state and federal agenc ies offering grants before loan terms can be adjusted. (4-2-08) 02. Adjustment of Loan Terms . Loan terms may be adjusted in the following sequence: DEQ will equally apportion funds available for principal forgiveness to all prospective disadvantaged loan recipients. Consistent with achieving user rates of one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the applicant community's median household income, and where possible with available funds, loan terms may be adjusted in the following order: increasing the repayment period, decreasing the interest rate, and providing principal forgiveness. (5-3-03) ( ) a. Increasing Repayment Period. First, t The length of the loan repayment may be extended in increments of years from twenty (20) years up to a maximum of thirty (30) years until the annual cost user rate equals one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of median household income. (4-2-08) ( ) b. Decreasing Interest Rate. If at a thirty (30) year repayment, the annual cost user rate still exceeds one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of the median household income, the loan interest rate may be reduced from the rate established by the Director for standard loans to a rate that results in an annual charge user rate equal to one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of median household income. The interest rate may be reduced to as low as zero percent (0%). (4-2-08) ( ) c. The interest rate may be reduced to as low as zero percent (0%). Principal Forgiveness. If even at zero percent (0%) interest and a thirty (30) year repayment, the annual charge user rate per residential user still exceeds one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) of median household income, the principal which causes the us er charge to exceed one and one-half percent (1\u00bd%) may be reduced except the principal reduction cannot exceed an amount greater that fifty percent (50%) of the total loan.

This clar ification is necessary due to a typographical error that occurred when the temporary/proposed rule was pu blished in the June 1, 2011 issue of the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. Th ere was a discrepancy between the alpha value of \"sixty-one\" and the numeric value of \"(60)\". The temporary rule adopted by the Board in April 2011 provided that number of points given in Subsection 020.02.b. is \"up to sixty (60) points.\" IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: There is no federal law or regulation comparable to IDAPA 58.01.22, \"Rules for Adminis tration of Planning Grants for Public Drinking Water Facilities.\" Therefore, the rule does regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government but is not broader in sc ope or more stringent than federal law. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousa nd dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective: Not applicable.

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0122-1001 Planning Grants for Public Drinking Water Facilities PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 662 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKPaula J. Wilson, Hearing Coordinator 1410 N. Hilton Department of Environmenta l Quality Boise, Idaho 83706-1255 (208)373-0418/Fax No. (208)373-0481 paula.wilson@deq.idaho.gov EFFECTIVE DATE: The temporary rule is effective April 26, 2011 . AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226(1), Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board of Environmental Quality has adopted a temporary rule and the Department of Environmental Quality is co mmencing proposed rulemaking. This rulemaking action is authorized by Chapters 1 and 36, Title 39, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been sche duled. Pursuant to Section 67- 5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hear ing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the unders igned on or before June 15, 2011. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The purpose of this rulemaking is to revise the priority rating criteria for the drinking water planning grants to closely match the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan crit eria, address the need to redu ce the obligation to conduct an environmental study in those cases in which a grant recipient will not immediately pursue federal aid for construction, and update the cost eligibility criteria to achieve consistency. The change to make the environmental study op tional will reduce costs for grant recipients in their preparation of facilit y planning studies by making the environmental study aspect of facility planning optional. Additionally, th is rulemaking will bring the Drinking Water Planning Grant Program into closer alignment with related DEQ programs (the Drinking Water SRF Program and the Wastewater Planning Grant Program). This temporary/proposed ru le includes the following: Priority rating criteria for the drinking wa ter planning grants have been revised to closely match the Drinking Water SRF loan criteria. The requirement to produce an environmental study as part of a planning document has been made optional. Cost eligibility criteria have been updated to achieve consistency. THE FOLLOWING NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED WITH THE TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED RULE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0122-1001 Planning Grants for Public Drinking Water Facilities PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Page 663 2012 PENDING RULE BOOKThis rule also includes revisions that are typographical and nonsubstantive in nature (e.g., revisions made for consistency with other sections in this rule chapter and other DEQ rules). Prospective grant and loan recipients, consulting engineer s, grant and loan administrators, and other funding agencies m ay be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Langu age the agency proposes to add is underlined. Language the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which pub lic comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ in tends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality in October 2011 for adoption of a pending rule. The pending rule is expected to become fina l and effective upon adjournment of the 2012 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the ru le is appropriate in that the rule confers a benefit. Adoption of this temporar y rule confers a benefit to the ci tizens of the state of Idaho in that it reduces costs for grant recipients and makes the program more efficient. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: There is no federal law or regulation comparable to IDAPA 58.01.22, \"Rules for Adminis tration of Planning Grants for Public Drinking Water Facilities.\" Therefore, the proposed rule does regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government but is not broader in scope or more stringent than federal law. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiation s conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code, and IDAPA 58.01.23.810-815.
