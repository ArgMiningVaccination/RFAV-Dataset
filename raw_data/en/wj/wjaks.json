Disclaimers Disclaimers Photography Although we always strive to provide clear, accurate images of our crystals and other products, we photograph under professional lighting, which is meant to mimic sunlight. If you get your piece and think it looks a little different under low or artificial light, try checking it out again in sunlight! Our crystals are one-of-a-kind art, created by nature. No two pieces are the same, and there is no such thing as \"perfection\" in nature. When it comes to our hand-carved items, remember that artists work with and around imperfections, druzy pockets, and other natural variations to bring each carving out of a piece of natural stone. We consider these imperfections to be one of the most wonderful parts of crystal collecting, and we invite you to embrace each carving's uniqueness! We will always try to portray each piece honestly, so be sure to look closely at our images and videos to ensure you know what to expect.
