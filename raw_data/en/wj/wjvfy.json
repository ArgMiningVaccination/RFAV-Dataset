The Sun Dance ritual occurs during the summer. Like other Native American ceremonies, the Sun Dance is about prayer and endurance. Dancers take no food or water while participating. Sun Dancers seek power from spiritual forces. The Sun Dance helps dancers to reconnect to the earth. It is a prayer for life. It is also a prayer for the healing of people and the earth. For the dancers, it is a quest to receive spiritual guidance from their ancestors. In some ceremonies, dancers take part in piercings, whereby the dancer sacrifices a part of his flesh for the community. Those participating in a Sun Dance often take over a year to prepare for the ceremony, which requires help from the community. The community erects a large pole on the plains, symbolizing the connection to the divine; the Sun Dance is about reconnection to the earth. Many dancers seek spiritual power, but the Sun Dancer may also take part for personal reasons, such as healing, spiritual insight, or gratitude for surviving difficult circumstances. The Sun Dance began as a Lakota tradition, but is no longer exclusive to that tribe. The Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow, Blackfeet, Plains Cree, and Wind River Shoshoni also have a Sun Dance. Venues for the Sun Dance include Pine Ridge, Rosebud Creek, and Spring Creek reservations. Traditionally, many tribes take part in the Sun Dance. Each tribe would camp in circular form, as part of a larger circle, with a sheltered circular area prepared for dancers. A large cottonwood tree would become a central pole. Sun Dance volunteer worker Jeffrey Zelitch explained that the cottonwood has special significance to the Lakota: the bark could be fed to horses, when cut the wood has a five-pointed star, and as a rustling tree, it prays or sings to the wind. Once placed on the dance site, the cottonwood was then decorated. The ceremony would begin at sunrise the day after the site was prepared. Before taking part in the Sun Dance, dancers would purify themselves by taking part in a sweat lodge ceremony. Each dancer would be guided by a mentor throughout the ceremony. The Native American Sun Dance takes place during the summer and lasts for four days. The Ponca Sun Dance takes place over four days during mid-summer. The Cheyenne held their dance each summer after the Sacred Arrow ceremony. While tribes might vary in the Sun Dance, the ritual has many commonalities among the different tribes, but also some differences. For example, not all tribes use piercing. The ritual begins as an elder chooses the cottonwood tree which will form the central pole. Elders fell a cottonwood tree, but it cannot touch the ground when it falls. An elder woman will then strip the pole. The tree is erected in the center of the dancing area and decorated. The dance floor is covered with sage, an important part of the ceremony. Each Sun Dancer will be guided through the process by a mentor or elder, and the dance begins with a shuffle around the central pole. Drums and pipes are played during the long dance. The dancers often paint their bodies and begin with a shuffle which will carry on over four days. Dancers can rest intermittently, but do not take in any food or water. On the fourth day, those who have agreed to having their flesh pierced will prepare themselves, and the piercing will take place on the fourth day. Each dancer will leave the tipi, led by their elder or mentor. They circle the tipi four times. When the first Sun Dance song is heard, they dance and blow whistles. They will then turn in the four directions of the wind. Dancers can ritually smoke the pipe. Before their time for sacrifice, the dancers can lie on a buffalo robe while their skin is pierced. The dancer who has elected to be pierced will have incisions made into his torso and pieces of buffalo bone will be inserted into the incisions. Some dancers may elect to be suspended until the pieces of bones become torn from the flesh. Others, who do not wish to be suspended, will dance with buffalo skulls tied through the incisions for the purpose of having the skulls tear through the incisions. Some dancers may choose to dance while pierced while others may dance staring up toward the sun. Once the blood sacrifices have been made, the ceremony has been concluded and dancers are honored by their communities. The Blood Sun Dance involves the sacrifice of flesh for the good of the community. Participants are often shocked by their participation in the Sun Dance and are taken to lie on sage beds after the ceremony, where they reveal their insights or visions to a mentor or elder. While participants go into shock, there is also a sense of rebirth. In the past, only males would take part in the Blood Sun Dance, but with the freedom of women, the female Lakota Sun Dancer is also able to choose to pierce. The Native American Sun Dance was banned in 1883. Academic Peter Bolz wrote about the history of the Sun Dance, and explained that during the 1880s, governments had set up mission schools. The missionaries wanted to break down Native American culture and children were introduced to Christian traditions. While it was believed that the children might reform quickly, medicine men were seen to be a threat because they believed strongly in old traditions. Dancing was seen to be dangerous and even warlike. The governments believed that by banning the Sun Dance ceremony, missionaries could work toward transformation. This ban changed the nature of the Sun Dance from an open and public ceremony to an underground form of resistance. The Sun Dance shifted and transformed to ensure its survival, and the ban was repealed in 1934. After this happened, attendance waned for a while, but then increased over time. This increase meant that by the 1990s, a greater number of people were attending the Sun Dance than ever before. The Sun Dance is a traditional ceremony originating with the Lakota tribe. While the overall dance is about reconnection to, and healing for, the earth, each dancer has a personal motivation for participating in the ceremony. The dancer takes part in a ceremony of endurance, which takes a great deal of preparation. The Sun Dance takes place in the summertime, over four days. Dancers do not take any food or drink while participating in the ceremony. The Sun Dance takes place around a decorated cottonwood pole. Elders guide the individual dancers through the grueling process. Some dancers select to make a blood sacrifice and will be pierced with bones or skulls. These piercings will eventually tear away from their flesh. This is known as the Blood Sun Dance, and is symbolic of death and rebirth for participants. The Sun Dance was banned by the American and Canadian governments when missionaries wanted to introduce Native American communities to Christianity and break down old customs. The medicine men who guided the Sun Dancers were seen to be a threat. The Sun Dance was banned in 1983 and repealed in 1934. While banned, the Sun Dance was carried out in secret and became an act of resistance. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.

The dance is about reconnecting to the earth and to the ancestors. No, the Sundance is no longer illegal. It was made illegal in 1883 in a quest to break down Native American culture and was unbanned in 1934. The Sundance takes place over a four day time period. Dancers sometimes choose to be pierced on day 4, and after they break free from their piercings, the sacrifices have been made and the dance comes to an end. The Sundance is a ritual involving prayer, drumming, and dancing. Sometimes dancers choose to be pierced, making a blood sacrifice for their communities. The Sundance was banned during 1883 when governments supported the missionaries in their quest to convert Native American people into Christianity. The Sundance was a traditional practice, which threatened the conversion. The Sundance isn't illegal anymore but was banned because of the connection it had to traditional Native American culture. Missionaries wanted to convert Native American people to Christianity and believed that the Sundance, lead by medicine men, was a barrier. Already a member?
