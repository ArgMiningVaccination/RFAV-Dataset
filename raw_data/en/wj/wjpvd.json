Please see link here Clarification on Tongue and Pulse Assessments Pulse Assessment Pulse assessment dates back to antiquity, Avicenna (981-1037 CE) Egyptians, Indian system of medicine, African system of medicine, Chinese system and many other but was made popular in western by the Santorio (29 March 1561 - 22 February 1636). Pulse assessment is a tool within the scope of practice of all healthcare professions, regulated or non-regulated. It is within the scope of practice of western traditional natural (Nature's) health practitioners in North America since its inception. Tongue Assessment: The widespread adoption of tongue examination as part of western medical practice appears to be peculiar to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and extended to the Americas and Europe. John Haller, in a brief paper, suggests an eighteenth-century origin, although the clinicians he credits with its dissemination - John Abernethy (1764-1831) and Fran\u00e7ois Broussais (1772-1838) - were, in terms of their working lives, largely early nineteenth-century. Tongue inspection, however, can be traced back to antiquity times within all cultures. Tongue assessment is a tool within the scope of practice of all healthcare professions regulated or-non-regulated. It is within the scope of practice of natural(Nature's) health practitioners in North America since its inception. "}
