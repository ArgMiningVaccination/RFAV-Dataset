This is because the amount of methylprednisolone in your body is increased.

If you use these drugs together, you may experience side effects such as seizures. - Ketoconazole: Your doctor may adjust your dosage of methylprednisolone if you take ketoconazole. Your doctor may do this to avoid increased side effects from methylprednisolone.

Or they might not work as well to thin your blood. Your doctor should monitor you closely if you take either of these drugs with methylprednisolone. Interactions that can make your drugs less effective When methylprednisolone is used with certain drugs, it may not work as well to treat your condition.
