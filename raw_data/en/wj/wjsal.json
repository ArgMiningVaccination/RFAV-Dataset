There is also a dedicated autonomous research organization running a Postgraduate course. What is Homoeopathy: Homoeopathy is one of the seven Ayush systems. It is most preferred system of complementary medicine. The term Homoeopathy is derived from two Greek words 'homoio' meaning 'similar' and 'pathos' meaning 'suffering' or 'like cures likes'. The fundamental principles of Homoeopathy were laid down by the German physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann. Homoeopathy is a therapeutic method of treatment based on the concept of individualization and holism. Homoeopathy is a unique system of medicine in terms of its sources and preparation. Method of preparation includes the potentization of medicinal substance to the minute level by which the most inert substance can become the most potent dynamic medicine, enough to stimulate the body's self-healing capability. These remedies are made from natural substances such as part of plants, animals, their healthy or diseased secretions, minerals and imponderabilia. Homoeopathy can successfully treat the acute, long-standing chronic diseases where allopathy has limitation without its after effects. Though this system of medicine was born in Germany,now it has become an integral part of the Indian system of medicine. Career Prospects: A well-trained Homoeopathy practitioner can work as a medical officer at various private and government Homoeopathy hospitals/ dispensaries. He or she can start his or her own clinic after getting the requisite degree in Homoeopathy. One with interest in research can pursue research as a career by becoming a research scientist.
