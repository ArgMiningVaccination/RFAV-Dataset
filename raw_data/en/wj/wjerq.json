[Each lesson](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/duwell/wellness-activities) is free and open to students, staff and faculty. All skill levels are welcome. Tom Szigethy, associate dean of students and director of the Student Wellness Center, said mindfulness practices, like these classes, assist people in managing mental and emotional well-being, a core area of the [Healthy Duke Initiative](https://healthy.duke.edu/). \"The lessons teach us daily behaviors to facilitate a wellness practice that expands beyond nutrition and exercise,\" he said. \"We are striving to shape a community culture of wellness.\" John Little, who works in Bostock Library, attends tai chi classes at the Student Wellness Center. The ancient Chinese tradition is a series of movements performed slowly with deep breathing. \"The tai chi classes were a nice way to decompress at the end of work,\" said Little, data science librarian for Duke University Libraries.
