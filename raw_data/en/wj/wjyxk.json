Although dandruff can cause itching of the scalp, not all itching in the scalp are due to dandruff. Definition of Fungal Infection of Scalp Fungal infection of the scalp is commonly called tinea capitis or ringworm of the scalp. This is a superficial fungal infection (dermatophytosis) of the scalp hair follicle with hair shaft involvement. It is caused by fungal species in the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. Is dandruff a fungal infection? Dandruff is not a fungal infection. It is generally believed that dandruff represents nothing more than physiologic scaling of the scalp. Dandruff is non-contagious. However, the condition is most often associated with a yeast-like fungus called Malassezia, the most prevalent being M. restricta and M. globosa (Gemmer et al,2002). These fungal organisms are part of normal skin flora feeding on skin oils on the scalp. The fungus does not cause any problems on the scalps of most healthy individuals. There is a higher population density of Malassezia yeast on the scalps of those with dandruff than those without dandruff, suggesting a role of Malassezia yeasts in triggering excessive shredding of skin scales on the scalp. More studies are needed to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiological role of Malassezia in the dandruff condition in some individuals. Some host factors that contribute to dandruff are : - Genetic predisposition -dandruff tends to run in families - Emotional component - endocrine Human source such as hormonal changes and neurological mediated factors such as emotional stress - Changes in quantity and composition of sebum - oily scalp - Certain illnesses - Patients with Parkinson's disease, AIDS patient with weakened immune system Types of fungus infecting scalp There are two (2) genera of dermatophytes that can infect the scalp - Common Microsporum species - canis - audouinii - Common Trichophyton species - schoenleinii - tonsurans Parasitic patterns of hair involvement by dermatophytes There are generally 2 types of parasitic hair infection by dermatophytes. They are: - endothrix : Invasion of fungal elements with mainly arthrospores (broken-up hypae) inside the hair shaft - endo-ectothrix : Invasion of hyphae inside the hair shaft with arthrospores and/or hyphae surrounding the hair shaft. This type of hair invasion is sometimes known as ectothrix infection eg. Microsporum canis Ringworm of scalp caused canis Microsporum canis causes gray patch tinea capitis. It is an ectothrix infection of the hair. Arthrospores (fungal spores) form a sheath around the hair shaft. | | Tinea capitis showing extensive hair loss caused by M.canis (Reference: Dr David Ellis,www.mycologyonline.adelaide.edu.au) |Microscopic view of a culture of Microsporum canis | (Reference: Dr David capitis .
