During adolescence, there can be concerns relating to [acne](/skin), [weight changes](/weight-wellness), contraception, and menstrual abnormalities. During the reproductive age, there can be concerns like endometriosis or ovulation dysfunction, as well as issues related to [pregnancy](/fertility), labor, post-labor, and breastfeeding. During midlife, a woman can become concerned about menopause and [aging](/antiaging) issues like hot flashes and osteoporosis. Any of these can be debilitating or strongly reduce a woman's life quality. It's important to have health care professionals, like the doctors at Tao Of Welness, who are not only experienced in woman's health issues but also strong advocates for youthfulness, beauty and vitality. Our Holistic Approach to Women's Health When it comes to top concerns regarding a woman's health, many people think breast [cancer](/cancer) is the number one killer but this is far from the truth. [Heart disease](/heart) and stroke are actually the number one health risk for women. Fortunately for many, having a balanced and healthy lifestyle can help reduce some of these concerns and this is the primary work we do at Tao of Wellness. The problem with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is that women are more likely than men to be underdiagnosed and undermanaged. Risk factors for CVD [overweight or obese](/weight-wellness), lack of activity, drinking alcohol, having metabolic syndrome, and [sleep apnea](/sleep). When it does come to [cancer](/cancer), the ten most common cancers in American women are breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and rectal cancers, endometrial cancer, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma (skin cancer), ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukemia. Age is the most common risk factor for cancer. About 77% of all cancers occur in people who are 55 years old or older. Therefore a woman will need regular checkups to detect early signs of cancer as a woman ages. [Type 2 diabetes](/diabetes) is on the rise mainly due to poor dietary habits. About 9.2 million women in the United States have diabetes. With a good lifestyle, better eating habits, and reduced stress, a woman can live a long and healthy life with diabetes. Chinese medicine can be very helpful in managing, if not completely reversing, the disease. Other problems that may arise include [autoimmune diseases](/autoimmune-conditions), blood disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, [pregnancy](/pediatrics), breastfeeding, mental health, domestic violence, [urological](/urinary-disorders) and kidney health, [digestive health](/digestive-disorders), [respiratory health](/cough-asthma), oral health, and [skin](/skin) and hair health. At Tao of Wellness we help our patients with a comprehensive program of safe, natural and effective therapies including [acupuncture](/acupuncture), [Chinese herbal medicine](/herbal-medicine), [nutritional therapy](/nutrition), [mind body exercise](/tai-chi-qi-gong), and others.

Mind Body Exercise Tai chi and qi gong are low-impact exercises that can be tailored to address many different conditions. They can be made quite vigorous to address weight conditions or a weakened circulation. As well, the circular movements inherent to these forms of exercise have been studied for their ability to stave off arthritis and other pain conditions like fibromyalgia.
