Review ChiropracTED! Ted offers a holistic wellness practice with a philosophy of seeing you healed. I greatly appreciate that Ted integrates many synergistic disciplines such as physical therapy, kinesiology, nutrition and essential oils into his practice and also teaches Zumba at several gyms. When I see Ted for a session, I feel taller, stronger, more metally/emotionally positive! Wow! Best Chiropractor in town. I'm a group fitness instructor and I teach multiple classes a week and sometimes 2 a day. I felt my knee give out during my class and was bothering me all day. I stopped by the office to check of any openings or set up an appointment. They saw me right away since I'm already a patient and they have my info. Dr. Ted took his time and asked me what was bothering me or areas that needed more attention. All I can say, thanks to his treatment, I'm ready to teach my class tonight. Thanks Dr. Ted! Once you visit this Chiropractor you will realize that there is an obvious reason why he was rated one of the TOP 10 doctors of las Vegas and Henderson area for two years in a row. To me going to see Dr. Ted is a whole experience, from the way he friendly schedule you to the way he walk you through and follow up on your treatment. He knows what he is doing and help you out with your health needs. I also recommend him for kids. After we were involved in a car accident he helped me and my 11 year old daughter with therapy and she loved him. I know from my personal experience that he is VERY passionate about his career. He is all about helping and educating his patients and the community in general. If you want to be listened to and treated with respect this is the place that you should choose. Dr Ted takes time to explain you in detail what is your medical condition and what are your options. I have to recognize that I was skeptical at firs because i have been suffering of neck pain for a long time but i didnt want to end up hooked on pain killers. I have to say after my second appointment in the clinic my pain went away and I was in shock. Dr Ted has hands of angel. Thank you Dr Ted!!!! I started out in so much pain that I would have to ice my lower back multiple times every single day and see Dr. Ted twice a week. Teddy's amazing work now has me down to once a week visits and I hardly ever have to ice my lower back! Thank you so much Dr. Ted! You gave me my life back!
