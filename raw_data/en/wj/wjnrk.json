As noted on the map below, the District Health Authorities are made up of several health services regions that include a number of different health services fac ilities from hospitals to clinics to community health boards. All of these fa cilities work together to provide the utmost quality of care to the people of Nova Scotia in accordance with the Canada Health Act's tenants of portab ility, accessibility, universality, comprehensiveness and publ ic administration. In this report, various health measures will be reported; from cancer mortality and incidence rates to patient days at hospitals. Each indicator's report will include technical specifications, significance and rational for reporti ng, analysis and data graphs or tables for the 2001/02 fiscal year. 8 Acknowledgements The Nova Scotia Department of Health wishes to acknowledge and thank the many individuals and divisions that contribut ed to the development of this report.

The determinants of health are: Income and Social Status Social Support Networks Education Employment/Working Conditions Social Environments Physical Environments Personal Health Practices and Coping Skills Healthy Child Development Biology and Genetic Endowment Health Services Gender Culture For instance, studies have shown that obesity plays a major role in the development of Type 2 diabetes and card iovascular disease. We know that obesity most often results from poor nutri tion or lack of physical activity. People could have poor nutrition habits for a num ber of reasons, including a lack of education on appropriate nutriti on, or perhaps not having sufficient income or time to buy and prepare nutritious foods. By examining the c haracteristics of obese people in our population, we can plan effective programs and services targeted at the underlying causes of obesity such as inadequate income or inadequate nutrition education. Enacting progra ms and services to get at the root of the problem of obesity results in reduced rates of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the long run. In this section, indicators that reflect the determinants of health, called \"population health indicators,\" are included to give us an idea of how healthy our population really is. Health promotion indicators show us the number of people 1 Preamble to the Constitution of the World Heal th Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19-22 June, 1946; sign ed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Record s of the World Health Or ganization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948. 10 using the services and programs in pl ace that promote proactive health and disease prevention. One of the ways that we collect information on popul ation health and health promotion indicators is through populat ion surveys such as the Canadian Community Health Survey and the Na tional Population Health Survey. Several of the indicators in this repor t are from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.1, released in May of 2002. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) collected informati on from 30,000 Canadians, aged 12 to 102 years, about health conditions, health pr actices and lifestyle, access to health care and general information such as age, sex, income, and education. People in the military, living on Indian Reserves or living in some remote areas were not included in the Canadian Community Health Survey. All Canadian Community Health Survey data responses are self-reported. Canadian Community Health Survey data are weighted to represent the proportion of Nova Scotia's population in each District Health Authority. All Canadian Community Health Survey data must include a measure of variance in order to illustrate the robustness of the estimate.

Breastfed / Tried to Breastfeed Last Child 2. Length of Time Breastfeeding Last Child Definition The percentage of women, of child bear ing age, who breastfed or tried to breastfeed their last infant. The perc entage length of time, women of child bearing age, breastfed their last infant. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Numerous studies have shown the health and well being benefits to the infant and to the mother from breastfeeding. Measuring the incidence of breastfeeding is one indicator of healthy choices in early childhood development. Measuring the duration of breastfeeding is another i ndicator of healthy choices in early childhood development Technical Specifications Calculation: 1. ((The number of women aged 15 to 55 w ho have given birth in the last five years who breastfed or tried to breastfeed t heir last child even if only for a short time)/(The total number of women aged 15 to 55 who have given birth in the last 5 years) X100) for each of Nova Scotia's 9 District Health Authorities, Nova Scotia, and Canada. 2.

General Population 2. Youth (12 to 19) Physical Activity Index by Gender Definition The percentage of people whose physical activi ty was either active, moderate, or inactive. The percentage of female and male youth (aged 12 to 19) whose physical activity was active, moderate, or inactive. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Regular sustained physical activity along with a healthy diet, maintenance of appropriate weight, avoidance of smoki ng, and adequate rest forms the basis of a healthy lifestyle. This is especially true for youth. T he links between regular and sustained physical activity and impr oved health for individuals has been clearly demonstrated in the m edical literature. Therefor e to monitor the amount of physical activity of a population gi ves an estimate of general health and possible future health problem s and health system use. Technical Specifications Calculation: ((The number of people aged 12 to 102, who were either active, moderately active, or inactive; [based on energy expendi ture of physical activity (amount and duration)]/(The total number of people aged 12 to 102) X100) for each of Nova Scotia s 9 District Health Authorit ies, Nova Scotia, and Canada.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Alcohol consumption is common adult C anadians. Some medical studies have suggested that regular but minimal use of certain alcoholic beverages may provide increased heart-health. Chroni c heavy use has been clearly shown, however, to be detrimental to the drin ker's health. Moreover, alcoholism and alcohol-related injuries and fatalities o ccur frequently. Measuring the regular use of alcohol gives an indication of t he possibility for alcohol-related injuries and health problems. The measure does not illust rate the timing of the more than 12 drinks, for instance, all at once or some each day. Technical Specifications Calculation : ((The number of people aged 12 to 102 who have had at least one drink in their lives and who drink at leas t 12 drinks per week/(The total number of people aged 12 to 102 who have had at least one drink in their lifetime) X100) for each of Nova Scotia's 9 District Health Authorities, Nova Scotia, and Canada. 16 Source : Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 1.1, Statistics Canada, 2000 2001, Ottawa, Ontario. Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke Definition Proportion of the non-smoki ng population regularly exposed (as indicated by exposure in the last month) to environm ental tobacco smoke in Nova Scotia Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation This indicator reflects the effectiveness of the public health system in protecting non-smokers against exposure to tobacco smoke in public spaces and work places. The relationship between environment al tobacco smoke and adverse health effects is well accepted. Second-hand smoke exposure is linked to increases in mortality from lung cancer and cardiova scular disease. Second-hand smoke has serious consequences for children: smok ing mothers bear children with lower birth weights, and children living in homes where they are exposed to tobacco smoke have higher rates of asthma and re spiratory tract problems. There is strong evidence of an association betw een exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and respiratory illness.

The strategy addresses seven key components: taxation, smoke-free places legislation, treatment/cessa tion, community-based programs, youth prevention, media awareness, and moni toring and evaluation. Through this comprehensive approach, by 2004-2005 we hope to have decreased the second-hand tobacco smoke exposure rate to the Canadian average or less.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable illness and death in Canada. Health Canada estimates that smoking is responsible for more than 45,000 deaths per year. These indicators r epresent the proportion of teenagers and total population who report current smoki ng habits. Because of the addictive nature of nicotine, youth smoking is of par ticular concern. Nova Scotia aims to decrease the percentage of youth who smoke. Strategies to achieve this target include continued implementation of all components of the Comprehensive Tobacco Strategy. Technical Specifications The data are based on the question: At t he present time do you smoke cigarettes daily, occasionally or not at all? Numerator: weighted number of individuals aged 12-19 who report a) currently smoking and b) daily smoking, wei ghted number of individuals aged 12+ who report a) currently smoking and b) daily smoking Source:Percent Current Daily and Occasional Teenage Smokers, Age 12 - 19 Nova Scotia vs Canada, 1994 - 2000 0510152025 1994 1996 1998 2000Percent (%) Canada NS Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey, National Population Health Survey, 1994/96/98; ISQDue to a large coefficient of variance, NS data for 1994 -1998 should be used with caution. 19 Denominator: total population aged 12- 19, total population Calculation: (Numerator/Denominator) x 100 Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Communi ty Health Survey; National Population Health Survey, 1994, 1996, 1998; ISQ Source:Percent Daily Smokers Nova Scotia by Sex and Age Groups, 2000 4030 20 10 0 10 20 30 40 12-14 years 15-19 years 20-24 years 25-34 years 35-44 years years 65-74 years 75 years and overAge Grou p Percent (%) Females Males N/A Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health SurveyDue to a large coefficient of variance, age 12 - 14 data was not available.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Depression is one of the most preval ent mental health conditions in the population. The 'predicted probability of depression' score is calculated from responses to a series of questions, which were designed to 'diagnose' clinical depression (based on the Diagno stic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3 rd. Edition) .The results show the percent age of the population in each district who have a 90% probability of being depr essed. Statistics Canada recently reported ( The Health of Canada's Communities , 2002) that Health Zone 3 (DHA 4 and 5) has, significantly, the second highest depression rate in the country, however, no statistically signific ant differences were reported at the DHA level here, nor between Nova Scotia and Canada. This maybe due to small sample size, however, more investigat ion will be required to account for the reported discrepancy.

Percent of Respondents W ho Have Had a PAP Smear or PSA Blood Test 2. Per cent of Respondents Who Have Had a PAP Smear or PSA Blood Test within the Last 12 Months Definition The percentage of women aged 18 years pl us who have had a PAP smear in the last 12 months and percentage of men aged 40 years plus who have had a PSA blood test in their lifetime. The percentage of women aged 18 years pl us who have had a PAP smear in the last 12 months and percentage of men aged 40 years plus who have had a PSA blood test in the last 12 months Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and P ap Smear Tests are used to screen for prostate and cervical cancers. These canc ers that affect a large proportion of the population can, with early detection, be treated and m anaged quite effectively. Early and regular testing for these cancers, in the populations at risk, leads to earlier detection and better health outcomes. Measuring the percentage incidence of women and men taking the tests, and the frequency of screening, Percent of Respondents who have had a PAP Smear or PSA Blood Test within Last 12 Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 1.1, Statistics Canada, 2000 - 2001, Ottawa, Ontario 23 provides an estimate of health serv ices resources used and perhaps the amount of further cancer testing educ ation that needs to be done.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation The goal of the Nova Scotia Breast Scr eening Program is to \"reduce the mortality from breast cancer in Nova Scotian women aged 50-69 years of age by 30%...\" Since the establishment of the N SBSP in 1991 71, 284 women have been registered in the provincial br east-screening database. 192,422 mammograms have been done. Women aged 50 to 69 are most at risk for breast cancer, making adequate screening measures imperat ive for this age gr oup. Examining and reporting the number of first time breast screenings for women aged 50-to- 69 enables the NSBSP program to monitor program pr omotion and usage in each DHA, allowing evaluatio n of the program and indi cation of where extra attention may be needed.

Mammography Screening, Women 50-69, DHA 25 Respondents Age 65+ Who Reported Having Had a Flu Immunization in the Last Year Definition The proportion of adults 65 years of age and older who reported that they had received an influenza vaccination in the last year. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation The Canadian Consensus Conference on Influenza (1993) recommended that by the 2000/01 flu season 70% of individual s in high-risk groups (such as those aged 65+) should receive flu shots. Nova Scotia has a comprehensive strategy for promotion of Flu Immunizations. May 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey data shows 81% Nova Scotia residents aged 65 + reported having had an influenza vaccination at some point in their lives. Technical Specifications Calculation: 1. (The number of respondents who said yes to A: being 65 years of age or older, B: to having received a flu vaccination at some point in their lives and C: to having had that flu vaccination in the last year/ The total number of respondents who said yes to A: being 65 years of age or older) 2. (The number of respondents who said yes to A: being 65 years of age or older, B: to having received a flu vaccination at some point in their lives/ The total number of respondents who said yes to A: being 65 years of age or older) Respondents Age 65+ Who Reported Having Had a Flu Immunization in th e Last Year, by DHA, Survey (CCHS) Cycle 1.1, Statistics Canada, 2000 - 2001, Ottawa, Ontario 26 Source: Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 1.1, Statistics Canada, 2000 2001, Ottawa, Ontario. Disclosures: Small sample sizes may affect data. Due to this, confidence intervals are available for this indicator by contacting the Department of Health. Future use of this data should be done cognizant of accompanying confidence intervals.

Lookin g at disease incidence tells us which diseases are most common, how long peo ple are living with disease, and which diseases we should focus our prevent ion programs and proactive screening services around. In this section, two types of disease are examined: communicable diseases and cancers. Often when looking at disease incidence and disease mortality rates, statisticians use a method of analysis called age standar dization. Age standardization is a way of looking at the proportion of illne ss in a specific place and asking, \"what would we expect the proportion of illness to be if this place had the same age structure as the rest of Canada?\" The rates shown therefor e do not cite the actual number of observed cases, but the numbers of expected cases in the standard population. Using this method allows for valid com parisons across different parts of the province/country to see if health problem s are actually more serious in one place than in another. Age standardized statis tics must be standardized to the same population census data. Data is not compar able if, for instance, some data (for a particular variable) is standardized to 1996 population data and some is standardized to 1991 population data. Age-standardized cancer incidence rates measure the appearance of new cases of cancer. This incidence rate is influenc ed by two main groups of factors: (1) the underlying rate of cancer incidence, which reflects, in part, the prevalence of risk factors such as smoking, and, in turn, the success of primary prevention efforts, and (2) the rate of detection and diagnosis of cancers, which can be influenced by the intensity and effectivene ss of cancer scr eening programs. Unfortunately from the viewpo int of interpreting this indicator, these two factors work in opposite directions. For ex ample, an increase in measured cancer incidence could reflect either deteriorati on in healthy life styl e or an improvement in screening. However, this latter kind of \"screening artifact\" is unlikely to carry on for a long period of time so that generally, a declining incidence of cancer suggests a positive change in population he alth. This interpretation issue is being addressed by the additi on of staging data to the c ancer registry systems. Cancer staging provides information on how advanced (serious) the cancer is at the time of diagnosis. As a general comment on using incidence figures, there is an increasing awareness that a successful decrease in one disease may simply lead to an 28 increase in the incidence of some other conditions, with no net benefit. Therefore, when one cause of death or disability is replaced by another, it is important to know if there is a net increas e in life span or if t here is a significant gap in time between the decrease in mortality for one cause and increased mortality for another. Quality of health during the remaining years is also crucial. Age-standardized cancer mortality rate tr ends may indicate long-term success in reducing deaths from these diseases. Lower death rates indicate success in cancer or cardio-vascular disease prevention, detection, and treatment. More information on cancer incidence and mortality and cancer programs can be obtained at Cancer Care Nova Scotia's website: http://www.cancercare.ns.ca or at the national Cancer Care Society website: www.cancer.ca . Communicable diseases pass between peo ple through bodily contact, exchange of bodily fluids or gases, or through c ontact with an infected agent such as food and water. Communicable are o ften preventable and treatable. More information on communicable diseases can be obtained through the Nova Scotia Department of Health website: www.gov.ns.ca health or through Health Canada's website: www.hc-sc.gc.ca . 29 Age Standardized Breast Cancer Incidence Rate Definition The reported number of newly diagnosed prim ary breast cancer cases in a given year per 100,000 population that would hav e occurred in the standard population if the observed age-specific rates in a given population had occurred in the standard population.

A confirmed case is defined as invasi ve disease (e.g. meningitis and /or septicemia with possible progression to purpura fulminans, shock, and death) with laboratory confirmation of infection through isolation of Neisseria meningitidis from a normally sterile site (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, joint, pleural or pericardial fluid) or demonstration of N. meningitidis antigen in cerebrospinal fluid. 5 Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Epidemiological data on invasive meningococcal disease enables evidence- based planning for immunization programs. The decreasing annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal disease in Nova Scotia has reflected a similar trend in Canadian rates over the past decade. Following an outbreak in 1992, overall incidence in No va Scotia has remained consistently low and since 1998, has averaged 2 ca ses per 100,000 annually in those less than 20 years of age. Incidence ha s been shown to be highest among young 5 Advisory Committee on Epidemiology and Division of Disease Surveillance, Bureau of Infectious Diseases, Laboratory Centre for Di sease Control, Health Protection Branch, Health Canada.

Rates of infection can be used as an indicator for the effectiveness of prevention programs. The number of reported case s of genital Chlamydia ( Chlamydia trachomatis ) infection in Canada showed a steady dec line over the pe riod 1992 (year became nationally notifiable) to 1997 followed by a 14% increase from 1997 to 1998 (27% and 10% increase among males and females respectively). A more sensitive laboratory testing method is thought to be one factor responsible for this increase, particularly for males. 1 Advisory Committee on Epidemiology and Division of Disease Surveillance, Bureau of Infectious Diseases, Laboratory Centre for Di sease Control, Health Protection Branch, Health Canada. Case Definitions for Diseases Under National Surveillance. Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada, 2000 44 In Nova Scotia, incidence rates for genital Chlamydia in females increased over the period of 1997 to 2001 and far exceeded the rates in males in both the 15-19 and 20-24 year age groups.

Measuring the number of surgical interventions performed provides an indication of accessibility, health care syst em responsiveness, service provision, and disease incidence. Surgical interventions are analyz ed using age-standardized data. Age standardization is a way of looking at the pr oportion of surgical interventions in a specific place and asking, \"what would we expect the proportion of illness to be if this place had the same age structure as the rest of Canada?\" The rates shown therefore do not reflect t he actual number of observed cases, but the numbers of expected cases in the standard population. By using this method we can make valid comparisons of surgery rates across different parts of the province/country . These data must be standardized to the same population census data. Data is not comparable if, for instance, some data is standardized to 1996 population data and some is standardized to 1991 population data. In April 2001, a new classification system for capturing dis eases and clinical interventions, ICD-10-CA/ CCI, was implem ented by CIHI. The ICD-10-CA is the Canadian modification of the ICD-10 used by the World Health Organization (WHO). The CCI or Canadian Classifica tion of Health Interventions was developed by CIHI. Some indicators may show significant changes in time- trended data from the years pr ior to the introduction of the new classification system in 2001/02. The CCI classification system combines some procedures into one code whereas in the previous classification system, ICD-9 CM, more than one code was often used to describe the intervention. Caution must be used in interpreting trend data between t hese classification systems. 48 TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENTS Definition Surgical removal of the hip joint with r eplacement by a synthetic hip joint.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Medical debate surrounds the need for h ysterectomy procedures for reasons other than cancer. Traditionally, hyst erectomy procedures have also been used for the treatment of diseases such as fibroids and menorrhagia. With new treatment alternatives, the need for hyst erectomies to be performed, save for cancer treatments should decrease. Canada has one of the highest rates of hysterectomy procedures in the world second only to the United States. Differences in rates often reflect the debate over appropriate use of this procedure and in physician practices.

Measuring the number of cardia c catheterizations performed provides an indication of how many people in the population are ex periencing symptoms of heart disease and having diagnostic procedures performed to determine the cause of symptoms. Provincially, age standardized cardiac cat heterization rates have increased from 191 per 100,000 in 1997/98 to a high of 267 per 100,000 in 2001/02. The increase in 1999/00 is partially due to im proved reporting practices at the QEII. There was a slight decrease to 246 per 100,000 in 2000/01 and a rise in 2001/02.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) rate s reached a high of 84 per 100,000 in 2001/02 after falling slightly in the previ ous two years. In 2001/02 the rates for CABG ranged from a high of 97 per 100,000 in DHA 2 to a low of 64 per 100,000 in DHA 6.

Many of these programs provide specialized services offered outside of the hospit al environment. These programs help to facilitate and provide appropriate care and develop disease prevention and promotion programs. The data these programs collect provides information on the health care needs of specific communities and age groups and a llows effective planning and funding of services in these areas. 61 MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS 1.

(EHSNS Communications Centre) Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Emergency Health Services (EHS) is one component of a wider continuum of care. This continuum encompasses all as pects of care from before an event occurs to the patient returning home. EH S is primarily responsible for the pre- hospital aspects of this care continuum . EHS strives to promote healthy living and injury prevention; coordinates the Medical First Reponses to the patient through the EHS Communications Centre , and provides basic and advanced levels of care through the registered paramedics in the system.

This section provides typical health system performance indicators including those listed below. Population by physician and registered nurse are useful indicators of the number of physicians and nurses relative to the population but any inference from total numbers or ratios as to the adequacy of pr ovider resources should not be made. Things like the populations' access to hospi tals, health care facilities, technology; physician type (primary care physicians vs. specialists); physician age and gender can influence whether the supply of provider resources is appropriate. Beds per 1000 population, patient days per 1000 population, and average length of stay are all indicators of hospital efficiency and utilization. It has been shown that preadmission testi ng and surgery on the day of admission helps to decrease the length of stay for a patient. This translates into reduced health care costs for hospitals. Readmission rates have long been used as one method of following the effect of bed closures and the shortening of hospital lengths of stay. Ambulatory care sensitive conditions are a CIHI indicator. These conditions are chronic diseases and it is felt that appr opriate ambulatory care could prevent the onset of this type of illness or condition, or control an acute episodic illness or condition, or manage a chronic disease or condition. Districts and/or hospitals can monitor the volume of cases and total days to see if perhaps better or more ambulatory care could be provided. Inflow/outflow ratios compare hospital serv ices given in a specific district to hospital services received by resi dents of the same district. Caesarian sections have long been monito red as an indicator of health system performance. An elevated rate of c-se ctions may increase the risk of pregnancy and delivery complications. Wait times are difficult to collect c onsistently. Monthly wait times for cardiovascular procedures have been collected and monitored by the Cardiovascular Division of the Queen Elizabeth II Heal th Sciences Centre and the Department of Health for several years. This is also an indicator of health system performance. 83 . POPULATION PER PHYSICIAN Definition Map of population per physician, including specialists, by district health authority. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Population per health care pr ofessional is used as an indicator of relative access to the health care system. Reflecting the location of the province's tertiary facilities and the vast majori ty of medical specialists, the population per physician is lowest within the Capital distric t, indicating greater access. The highest population per physician (least access) occu rs in the southwest portion of the province (DHA 2). Note: On its ow n, population per prof essional does not indicate whether or not there are suffici ent numbers of heath professionals in a given area.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Total number includes any physician (full time, part time, locu m) who was paid by the province during the fiscal year. Type of Practice is based on Functional Specialty. Functional Specialty is intended to reflect the spec ialty that the physician pr actices for the greatest percentage of his/her time. It may not be consistent with the physician's licensed specialty. General Prac titioners functioning primar ily as Emergency Room physicians are included in the specialists count not in the General Practice count.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Patient Days per 1000 population is an indi ctor of resources use and service planning. Throughout the country, pati ent days and days per thousand have decreased during the 1990's and this conti nues in Nova Scotia. Standardizing removes the effects of age (and/or sex) in the population. The resulting standardized rate provides a more appropriate comparis on between geographic areas and time periods than does the crude rate. Age standardized patient days per 1000 popul ation range from a high of 977 in DHA 8 to a low of 610 in DHA 1. Patient days per 1000 have decreased in Nova Scotia from a high of 917 in 1997/98 to 854 in 2001/02.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation CIHI (Canadian Institute for Health Information) has provided the ALC designation in order to c apture those hospital inpatient s no longer receiving acute care. This indicator is designed to assess the processes that ensure the placement of patients in t he most appropriate care setti ng. Differences in rates between facilities, districts and province s may reflect differences in reporting practices rather than differences in hospita l utilization or patient mix. ALC rates range from a high in DHA 3 to none in DHA 5.

All prepar atory investigation complete d prior to admission. Interventions performed in an operati ng room or an endoscopy room are included. (Excludes obstetrical procedures.) Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Preadmission testing followed by sur gery on the day of admission help to decrease the length of stay for a patient. This translates into reduced health care costs for hospitals. The percentage of elective surgeries done on the day of admission has increased steadily from 7% in 1990/91.

Unlike the previous readmission field captured for CIHI, the definition for 2001/02 has nothing to do with the diagnosis but shows only whether readmission is planned or unplanned. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation Hospital readmission rates have been used to measure the effects of decreasing bed numbers and lengths of stay. Pe rcentages of unplanned readmission are low for the province with t he highest being 3.5% for DHA 5.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation While not all admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions are avoidable, it is assumed that appropriate ambulatory care could prevent the onset of this type of illness or condition, or control an acut e episodic illness or condition, or manage a chronic disease or condition.

Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation A ratio of less than one indicates that hos pital stays utilized by residents of a DHA exceeded hospital care provided wi thin that DHA, suggesting an outflow effect. A ratio greater than one indica tes hospital stays provided by a DHA exceeded the quantity of stays utilized by its residents, suggesting an inflow effect. A ratio of one indicates that the volume of hospital discharges in the DHA is equivalent to that gener ated by its residents, suggesting that inflow and outflow activity, if it exists at all, is balanced. Inflow/outflow ratio ranges from a high of 1.4 in DHA 9 which indicates an inflow which would be expected as the tertiary ca re facilities are located in DHA 9 to a little over .06 for DHA 4.

The number of caesarean sections performed, as a per cent of all deliveries, in each DHA. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation An elevated number of Caesarean sect ions may increase the risk of pregnancy and delivery complications (rupture of ut erine scar, fatal anaesthesia accidents) during subsequent pregnancies. In some countries sepsis control after C-sections poses additional risks and has been shown to add to maternal mortality. A careful assessment of overall C-se ction rates and established remuneration mechanisms can help to reduce the amount of undesirable operative deliveries by increasing the compensation for vaginal delivery. The overall risks associated with what would normally be an exc eptional interventio n would be reduced 7 The provincial target for caesar ean sections is a maximum of 20%. The overall Caesarean section rate has been climbing for the province since a low of 19.6% in fiscal 1995/96. For 2001/01 the rate for the province is 25%. Small volumes of deliveries and C-sections in a given DHA result in significant variation in C-Section rates. Cauti on should be used when making comparisons of rates across DHAs. 7 WHO Reproductive Health Focus http://www.wpro.who. int/themes_focuses/theme2/focus3/about/definitions2.htm Cesarean Sections as a % of All Deliveries, by DHA of Residence, Fiscal Mix Groups (CMG's) 601 to 604 (C-Sects) and 601 to 611 (all deliveries) (The total number of caesarean sections by DHA (or province) / the total number of deliveries) X 100 per fiscal year Source: NSDoH CIHI DAD Cesarean Sections as a % of All Deliveries, by Hosp ital, Fiscal 2001- 2002 CBHCC IWK 100 NOVA SCOTIA CARIOVASCULAR SURGERY WAIT TIMES (URGENT, SEMI - A&B) 050100150200250300350 A M J J A S O N D J F M Standard Days Urgent Semi-A Semi-BWait Times by Category and Month April 2001 to March 2002 Produced By: Performance Measurement & Health Informatics, Nova Scotia Department of Health Source: Queen Elizabeth II, Health Sciences Centre, Cardiac/Emergency/Critical Care Division April 16, 2002 CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY WAIT TIMES 1. Urgent 2. Elective Definition 1. Maximum wait time in days for card iovascular surgery for urgent patients by month. Urgent patients are critically ill and cannot be discharged from hospital prior to receiving surgery. They have failed maximal medical therapy and remain unstable. The current wait time standard is 7 days. Semi-Urgent \"A\" patients are unstable, have failed m edical therapy and are at si gnificant risk of heart attack or heart failure and mo rtality. In many instanc es, patients are transferred back to their District hospital wh ile arrangements are being made to have surgery. The current wait ti me standard is 2-3 weeks. Semi-Urgent \"B\" patients have coronary artery disease and are doi ng poorly on medical therapy. They would have chest pain walking 1-2 blocks and are incapable of employment. If these patients can exercise greater than 2 mets (a met is a standardized score on a cardiac stress test) but less than 5 me ts during a stress ECG test they fall into this category. The current wait time standard is 6-8 weeks. 2. Maximum wait time in days for cardiova scular surgery for elective patients by month. Elective patients are stable on medical therapy; unable to work due to cardiac limitations; and felt to further improve with bypass su rgery. The current waiting time standard is 3 months. Significance - Rationale and Notes for Interpretation 101 Systematic collection and comparison of wait time data is complex. Historically, different groups have defined and monitored wait times in different ways. For example, some calculate wait times fr om when a person first visits a family doctor. Others start the cl ock when the patient is assessed by a specialist or when test results confirm the need for fu rther treatment or from some other point. There are advantages and di sadvantages to each approach. Nonetheless, such differences have to be reconciled if meaningful comparisons between jurisdictions are to be made.

Source : NS DoH, Health Economics, Annual Statistical Tables 112 Section 7 Management Information Systems Indicators 8 The MIS Guidelines are national standards that provide an integrated approach to managing financial and statistical data re lated to the operations of Canadian health service organizations. They were developed in recognition of the need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health service organizations in Canada through better information and measures of productivity. These guidelines address information at the functional centre and service recipient-specific level, but do not encompass information related to the care, treatment or clinical status of the service recipient, or attempt to quantify or assess the quality of such services. The indicators found in this section det ail how financial and statistical data may be integrated to yield information that is useful for planning, control and evaluation. All functional centre stat istics and indicators are designed to provide managers with useful information that can assist them with pl anning, staffing, budgeting and efficiency management. I ndicators link two data elements together to measure perfo rmance and to provide information which can be used to facilitate decisions or compare performance. Here are some definitions that may help your understanding of the information presented in this section: Adult/Child Inpatient Days: the days during which services are provided to an inpatient (excluding newbor ns), between the census-taking hours on successive days. The day of admission is counted as an inpatient day but the day of separation is not an inpatient day. W hen the service recipient is admitted and separated (discharged or died) on the same day, one inpatient day is counted. Inpatient days apply to nursing inpatient functional centres (primary accounts 712*). Compensation Expense: is the sum of gross salaries expense, benefit contribution expense, purc hased compensation expense, and fees for service expense arising from the remunerati on of management and operational support personnel, unit-producing personnel, and m edical personnel employed by, or under contract to the health service organization. Compensation - Medical Personnel (Medica l Fees): this account is used to record the compensation ex pense for medical practiti oners who provide medical services and who are remunerated by the health service organization on a salary or contractual basis. Excludes medica l personnel who fulfill a management role. 8 The content of this introduction comes, for the most part, from MIS Guidelines: 2001 113 Direct Costs: include all the expenses for salaries, supplies, equipment, amortization, and other outlays seen in t he accounts of the functional centre, including direct expense transfers. Direc t costs exclude costs of absorbing cost centres that initially resided in the acc ounts of transient cost centres, but have subsequently been allocated as indirect expense. Direct Operating Expense (Functional Cent re): the operating expenses charged directly by the basic health servic e organization's accounting system to a functional centre. Operating expenses include nature of expenses such as compensation, supplies, equipment, sundry, referred-out services and traceable supplies and other expenses. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): the total earned hours charged to a functional centre, expressed in terms of equi valent full-time positions, according to the health service organization's normal ear ned hours per full-time position. The above definition can be expre ssed by the following formula: Periodfor Hours Earned NormalPeriodin Hours Earned TotalFTE= Workload Unit: one minute of unit-produc ing personnel time spent performing service recipient and non-service recipient activities of the functional centre. 114 Direct Cost (Exc.
