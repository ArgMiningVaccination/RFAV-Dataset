In Memory of William Preuit Jonna Hughes Memorial Ms. Jonna Hughes was born in Ashford, Alabama on January 20, 1928 and passed away on July 21, 2009. Ms. Hughes became a resident of Redlands, California in 1952. S he was a licensed funeral director and co-owner of Hughes Loma Linda Mortuary and Hughes Funeral Chapel in Yucaipa for over 40 years. While she lived in Redlands, Ms. Hughes opened her home to many ladies who were enrolled in the Physical Therapy program. The ladies lived, ate, studied and laughed in her home. Boarding the PT ladies brought much joy to Ms. Hughes. Jonna will be remembered as a talented musician and for her caring and compassionate life in service to others. The Jonna Hughes Scholarship was established by Jonna's son, Dr. Billy Hughes, to continue his mother's tradition of service. The endowed scholarship in her memory will be awarded annually to a woman in the Physical Therapy department who has risen above personal circumstances to commit to a life of service to others. The Robert L. Wilkins Memorial Fund was established to honor the memory of alumnus and longtime faculty member Dr. Robert L. Wilkins. Dr. Wilkins was born on April 21, 1954 in Camden, New Jersey and passed away on September 11, 2010. He served as faculty member in the Department of Cardiopulmonary Sciences at Loma Linda University School of Allied Health Professions from 1979 to 2006. Bob is survived by his wife of 36 years, Kristi (Boas); and two sons, Nicholas Ryan and Tyler Robert, along with daughter-in law, Lindsey (Lugo); and grandchild, Easton Tyler; mother, Ruby; and sister, Linda W. Chu, M.D. Bob will be lovingly remembered as a son-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle, and cousin by his Ohio and Virginia families. This scholarship in memory of Dr. Wilkins is given to a student with nancial need, who is in good standing with the department and has an interest in research and/or teaching. William Preuit passed away December 9, 2010 at his home in Riverside, due to cancer. William was born December 12, 1943 in Washington DC. He served in the Air Force for four years, earning the rank of Airman 2nd Class. He received his Bachelors in Respiratory Therapy at LLU in 1976 and soon became the Chair of the Respiratory Department at LLUMC. He then worked for Viasys/ CardinalHealth for 30 years. William is survived by his wife, Jose na Preuit of Riverside; daughter, Andrea Hurtado of Clovis and step-daughter, Atchley of Oakland; sons, both York; step-mom, Preuit of Oxnard; brother, Richard Preuit of West Covina; sister, Anne Keeley of Saugus; 4 grandchildren. In lieu of fl owers the family requested that gifts be send to support the Department of Cardiopulmonary Sciences Scholarship Endowment. Funds in this scholarship are used to provide nancial aid to students enrolled in the Department who require assistance.

But Abraham Hoyos is truly in a position to comfort patients experiencing fear. Nearly 17 years ago, Abraham underwent a lifesaving heart transplant at Loma Linda University, and in June, he graduated from the same institution with a degree in medical radiography. Now, when he interacts with patients\u2014some of whom are also facing the possibility of heart procedures\u2014he can offer hope. \"I tell them, 'I had a heart transplant,'\" he says. \"They look at me and they think, 'What?' There's still a misconception that there is no quality of life following a transplant.\" Looking at Abraham, one can see he's vibrant and full of life. And he's fulfilling his career dream. Since he was a freshman in high school, Abraham was interested in x-ray technology. But it didn't always look possible that he would be able to pursue this hoped-for career\u2014or anything at all. Abraham's illness started out at age 15 as a simple autumn flu\u2014or so it seemed. But when he went to his pediatrician complaining of symptoms including fever, runny nose, sneezing, and stomach pain, the doctor recognized signs of a bigger problem. The physician referred him to Loma Linda University Medical Center, where the medical staff at International Heart Institute ultimately diagnosed him with cardiomyopathy\u2014otherwise known as heart failure\u2014which affects one out of 100,000 children under 18 in the United States. With this condition, abnormalities in the heart's muscle fibers prevent it from contracting and relaxing normally, weakening the heart and resulting in decreased circulation. In Abraham's case, the disease was brought on by a viral infection. \"I went from being really healthy in high school and doing all kinds of activities to just having to be at home on oxygen,\" he says. \"It was really, really quick.\" As time went by and Abraham didn't improve, he decided to have a heart transplant rather than being treated by medication. His parents stood by in support but ultimately let him make the decision himself. \"I was really protected by my faith,\" he says, \"so I was never shaken up. I said, 'Here I am, Lord, I'm in your hands.' Of course I was only 15, so I wanted to live, and I said 'Let's do a heart transplant.'\" His parents were, of course, more scared. Abraham was placed on the transplant list December 5, 1993. Since the illness had begun a couple of months before, he had been in and out of LLU Medical Center. Twice, he almost suffered a heart attack. But his family found comfort in that the doctors and nurses would pray with Abraham. Throughout his illness, Abraham wanted the Lord's will to be done. He also wanted to live. \"My prayers were 'Lord, heal me through a miracle or heal me through a transplant.'\" In January, he had been in the hospital for about a week. Late one night, as he was lying in bed having trouble breathing, transplant coordinator Kay Ogata came into the room. She told Abraham and his mother that there was a donor heart available that matched perfectly. \"Do you still want the heart transplant?\" she asked. The answer was yes. Abraham's medical team prepped him and took some labs, and within a couple of hours, he was rushed into the operating room. To this day, he bears a large scar on his chest and on his wrists, where they hooked up the heart-lung machine that kept him alive as his old heart was being replaced by the new. He awoke to a whole new day.\"Honestly, it was almost like a rebirth,\" he says. \"I went from feeling really sick, to then going under anesthesia, and then when I woke up I realized 'I feel refreshed. I can breathe on my own.' I was a little sore, but other than that I felt healthy again. It was pretty cool.\" Abraham's mother, Luz Saucedo, felt relief tempered by confusion and some resentment. While she believed that Abraham, as her child, was a gift borrowed of God, who could take him back if it was His will, she didn't understand why this was happening to a good young man. Despite the successful transplant, she remained worried. \"I didn't think he was going to have a future,\" she remembers. \"At that time, they weren't giving heart transplant recipients too much time to live.\" By now, heart transplant recipients have proven that life can extend for decades after the procedure. But Ms. Saucedo thought her son's new heart would only keep him alive for another handful of years. \"You have that in the back of your mind for quite a bit of time, until you start to see that they're capable of doing anything, like any other normal person,\" she says. And it was true that, physically, Abraham could do anything he wanted to. But he thought his planned career path was now closed off to him. One of his doctors advised that perhaps he should pursue a career that didn't involve being around sick people, because of the immunosuppressing medication he takes to prevent his body from rejecting his new heart. So in college, Abraham started studying graphic design and Abraham will be spending a lot of time with equipment such as this fluorscopy C-Arm during his career as a medical radiographer. 4 Spring/Summer 2011 | alliedhealth.llu.edu/alumniRADIATION TECHNOLOGY FROm PATIENT TO GRAD uATE: Abraham Hoyos Received a New Heart and New Career Future at LLu By HEATHER REIFSNYDERLLU TODAY Newspaper February 2011 \"My prayers were 'Lord, heal me through a miracle or heal me through a transplant.'\" 7070TAbraham will be spending a lot of time with equipment such as this fl uorscopy C-Arm during his career as a medical radiographer. THE LINK | SAHP Newsletter 5RADIATION TECHNOLOGY photography. He never fi nished it. \"I just always had in the back of my mind x-ray, x-ray,\" he remembers. \"I just enjoy helping people that are sick and helping people get better. And it was that way before I had my transplant.\" Several years later, Abraham asked another doctor whether he could become an x-ray technician. This time, the doctor said, \"Go for it.\" So Abraham went back to school and started taking all his prerequisites at San Bernardino Valley College. And he thought about where he'd like to earn his degree. \"Ever since I was a patient here, I knew that Loma Linda was a faith-based institution, and I really appreciate that,\" he says. \"So I always had it in the back of my mind that it would be really neat to go to Loma Linda because of that.\" Though his grades weren't top of the class, Abraham says God's grace helped him get into LLU. With only 33 students in the incoming class, they formed a tight-knit group among themselves and their instructors. \"The professors are really here for you,\" he says. \"I made a lot of good friends and just got to meet a lot of people from different walks of life, different religions,\" he says. In the two years the program took, Abraham said the work was diffi cult and intense. He was up studying at all hours, his mother remembers. But he impressed his teachers. Assistant professor Mike Iorio, MPA, describes him as a superb student who demonstrated caring and altruism. \"It is these attributes that set him apart because he places the needs of others before his own,\" says Mr. Iorio. Dedication is what clinical instructor Jerone Murphy, RT(R), noted about Abraham: \"He was determined to learn without being lazy; he was determined to walk with confi dence; and he was determined to live without excuse.\" In June of 2010, Abraham graduated with his associate's degree in medical radiography from the School of Allied Health Professions. On that day, he was excited to have made it into LLU and to have accomplished his ultimate goal. It was also an emotional day for his mother. \"I feel like God has given Abraham a second opportunity to do what he wanted in life,\" Ms. Saucedo says. \"I was so surprised to see him get his diploma because you always have it in the back of your mind 'What if he gets sick and loses some semesters and is not able to graduate?' \"I thank God because he made it,\" she says. She's not the only one. Abraham's transplant surgeon, Leonard Bailey, MD, has this to say about the achievement: \"We are all so proud of him and his accomplishment. May God bless him and keep him well.\" 7070Abraham Hoyos and Dr. Craig Jackson (SAHP Dean) at Graduation 70 70 70 70 Two thousand and eleven is a hallmark year for our Department.

In 2010, the OT Department developed and implemented eight projects including: At Risk Youth, Emotionally Disturbed Children, Life Skills for Junior High Students, Developmentally Delayed Students, Domestic Violence Shelters and Transitional Mental Health Programs. The collaborations and learning opportunities were exceptional, especially as students refl ected on their experiences and saw that they truly made a difference! We would like to especially thank our alumni for your generous donations to the \"Pay It Forward\" fund which has helped us and will continue to assist us in these projects! Christmas Christmas Christmas 6 Spring/Summer 2011 | alliedhealth.llu.edu/alumniOCCuPATIONAL THERAPY What's Happening in the OT Department?Honduras For During the Fall 2010 quarter, the OT department used the medical simulation lab in the Centennial Complex for the rst time. The students performed skilled competencies such as bed mobility, transfers, and activities of daily living. In another competency exam, students were expected to perform an assessment of a \"live\" patient, and write appropriate intervention goals based on their assessment. Dr. Elizabeth Crepeau was invited to LLU as a visiting scholar on August 11-12, 2010. At a dinner presentation for invited Inland Empire OT practitioners, she spoke on the topic of the Role of Narrative in Health Care. The following day she gave a presentation to the OT students on the topic of Engaging Occupations: Conceptualizing Occupation and Narrative Perspective. Heather Thomas presented at OTAC Conference on Oct 15, 2010. Topic: Prepare for the Requirements for Re-entry into OT. Heather Javaherian-Dysinger and Jessica De Brun presented at OTAC Conference on October 17, 2010. Topic: Perspectives of Mothering and Domestic Violence. Sharon Pavlovich received her Master of Arts degree in Management from Redlands University in May of 2010. She is also the chair of the Faculty Council Executive Committee in SAHP. Judi Palladino was honored with Alumna of the Year Award for the Dept. of Occupational Therapy at San Jose State University in May 2010. She also received the President's Award at the awards banquet of the 2010 OTAC conference in October 2010. Heather Javaherian-Dysinger was the speaker for the 9th Annual Afternoon Tea with a Scholar, on Sept 26, 2010, sponsored by Region 2 of OTAC. Her topic was: Domestic Violence: Occupational Justice and Journeys to New Meaning and Identity. Christy Billock developed the Occupational Therapy Spiritual History (OTSH) tool as a means for OT practitioners to integrate spirituality into practice with their clients. A research study is being conducted to assess the usability of the tool. Arezou Salamat's article, Right on Cue: Interpreting Infant Self-Regulation, was published in OT Practice , October 2010 Edition. Heather Thomas is a PhD candidate at Touro University, and has received IRB approval for her research dissertation.In December of 2010, three Occupation- al Therapy students, Shane Gemoto, Emily Pinkerton and Yvette Paquin, embarked upon a week-long SIMS (Students for International Missions) mission trip to Pe\u00f1a Blanca, Hon-duras. They worked diligently with Pan Amer-ican Health Service (PAHS), an organization that provides nutrition, medical assistance and education to starving children. The mission team consisted of students majoring in Nu-trition, Social Work, Public Health, Dental Hygiene and Dentistry as well as professional members of the community including a Medi-cal Doctor, Physician Assistant and Dentist. The following is the Mission Trip experience according to Shane, Emily and Yvette: Shane Gemoto In December, I was given the oppor- tunity to revisit the small commercial vil-lage of Pe\u00f1a Blanca, Honduras where my fellow classmate, Emily Pinkerton and I had been only a year prior to help design and implement a Play/Art Therapy pro-gram for an orphanage run by Pan Ameri-can Health Service, Inc. The program's purpose was to promote the children's fi ne and gross motor skills. It was so great to use the professional skills that I have learned as an occupational therapy stu-dent. This year, we were blessed to have another classmate, Yvette Paquin, with us to re-evaluate the program and make nec-essary adjustments to align with the chil-dren's skill levels and interests. During a conversation with an avid orphanage volunteer, I realized how meaningful it was to the children that we would return to the orphanage. This showed the children that we cared, which was honestly not hard to do. It was so natural for all of us to love the babies, chil-dren and older individuals at the orphan-age. Because these children meant so much to me, I felt a heavy burden to do some-thing to make a long term difference in at least one of their lives. Through prayer, I followed a conviction I felt to sponsor a child. I sponsored a little girl named Ros-ita, with whom I had established a strong bond. She will be starting school this year! Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas This sponsorship is extremely meaningful to me because I actually know her! My relationship with the children and orphanage personnel showed me that there is a great need for help not only in Honduras, but throughout the world. To me, third world countries look very similar to each other, just with different people, languages and traditions. The more I go on mission trips, the more I view myself as a future missionary. I am really looking forward to where God will lead me next. Emily Pinkerton As with any mission trip, using one set of special skills is not the only way to reach out and help people. Perhaps the most important thing of all is the connec-tion and love that occurs between people who give care and those who receive it. It is that human connection that continues to drive me toward medical mission trips. My perspectives have been reshaped and my outlook on life now refl ects a simpler view that focuses on what really matters. Loma Linda has been so instrumental in fueling my passion for medical missions. So many of the children and fami- lies touched my heart during this week of service; particularly a fi ve-year-old girl named Lily. Lily has been diagnosed with spina bifi da. She has no functional use of her legs and was limited in her trunk con-trol. She was either carried or pushed in a stroller to get from place to place. Amaz-ingly, Dr. Tom Wieg, DDS, had received a donation of an adult-sized powered wheelchair that he had shipped to PAHS. At his request, Yvette and I performed a wheelchair evaluation and modifi cation with Lily, and soon, the wheelchair was hers. It felt so amazing to be able to help Lily and her family in that way. It was a perfect mixture of science, heart and God. Yvette Paquin Since discovering my dream of be- coming a Pediatric Occupational Thera-pist, I have thought of the rich opportuni-ties that going on an international mission trip would offer. I was aware of the SIMS mission trip to Pe\u00f1a Blanca in 2009, but had never been to a third world country and felt that the trip would be too far out of my comfort zone. In early 2010, I put aside my nerves and chose to accompany one of my professors, Heather Thomas, and three other OT students, on a two-week medical mission trip to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Upon returning from Haiti, I felt that the vast amount of hands-on experience and guidance from Heather Thomas had prepared me to help others no matter where I was. At that point, I was more than ready to help the children in Honduras in the December 2010 mis-sion trip. The Play/Art Therapy proved to be a great success. Every day around 9am, Emily, Shane, and I set up a few activities for the older children to facilitate gross and fi ne motor skills, encourage positive social interactions and provide structure to their unstructured days. Also, we were often assigned to assist the caretakers in the \"Casitas,\" which is where infants and young children live. During the second day at the orphan- age, Emily and I met an 11-year-old girl named Lola. We learned of her heart-breaking story and of the pain she has al-ready endured in her short life. She was raised by an extremely abusive father who murdered three of her siblings; one of which, Lola was unfortunately forced to witness. Emily and I were so effected by her story that we wanted to help. We decided to sponsor her with funds that would go toward paying for her educa-tion. I'm so happy to know that we will always be a part of Lola's life. I spent the last two and a half years learning about the therapeutic benefi ts of Occupational Therapy. I can't quite ex-plain the rewarding feeling of sharing this knowledge with people who cannot af-ford medical services. I went to Honduras expecting to spend time with the children and share as much love and affection as I could, but I never expected to get so much in return. The children have taught me that interpersonal relationships and cre-ating a family out of the ones you love is what makes life worth living.

She is supposed to (1) help the patient sit at the edge of the bed (2) then stand with the help of a front wheel walker (3) and march in place \u2014 if the patient is strong enough. The student comes to the fl oor in the hospital, introduces herself to the nurse, reviews the chart, washes her hands, puts gloves on, then proceeds to enter the patient's room. She introduces herself to the patient and they exchange greetings and pleasantries. The student informs the patient of what the therapy will consist of and proceeds with assessment. As the student begins transitioning the patient from supine (lying down with the face up) to sitting position, the beeping sound of the monitor changes, the O2 saturation readings begin to drop, the respiration rate readings begin to escalate, and the patient tells the student that he does not feel well. In an instant the student has to make a decision of what course of action to take. Her clinical instructor is outside of the room and the nurse is at the nurses' station. The student tells the patient that all will be fi ne and works to place him back in bed in the supine position. She checks for any changes in the monitor and sure enough, the O2 saturation levels are back to above 90%, the respiration rate is in the normal ranges and his blood pressure normal. The student instructs the patient to take deep breaths through his nose making use of the nasal cannula (a narrow, fl exible plastic tubing used to deliver oxygen through the nostrils). The patient communicates to the student that he is feeling better and the student is relieved that she was able to control the situation. Now the clinical instructor and the nurse walk in and tell the student that the simulation is over. This is just one of the many scenarios that PT students are able to experience in the new simulation center at LLU. We are hoping to better prepare our students in meeting real-life situations in their clinical assignments so that when similar situations arise they will be able to cope with the stress of making clinical decisions. After the simulation, the student will debrief with fi ve of her classmates who were witnessing the whole event through a one-way mirror. The instructor, the nurse and the students evaluate the whole process, expressing their opinions as to what the student did correctly and what she could have done better in that scenario. Students in the fi rst, second, and third year of the DPT program have expressed great satisfaction in completing the simulations. Even those students who were inside the room treating the patient expressed that they were able to learn and feel better prepared to deal with a real situation in a clinical setting. The simulation lab is a state of the art facility that provides real ICU and acute setting equipment, nurses, and mannequins that use high fi delity PHYSICAL THERAPY By TONY VALENZUELA, DPT, Ed.D., ACCEPT Faculty/ProfessorAugust 2010 Below Photo: First year DPT students identify lines and monitors following a lecture.

The simulation lab is located in the new Centennial Complex on campus. We hope that in the future we can incorporate the simulation lab with other areas of emphasis and not just with the acute setting. As clinical coordinators of education for the DPT program, Theresa Joseph and I feel that our students need to be prepared to deal with these type of situations while in their clinical rotations. In the past, our clinical instructors have expressed that our students are coming to them with very little preparation on how to deal with the acute patient in the hospital setting. We are now hoping to better prepare them before they have to encounter these scenarios in the real world. Continued on next page... ...continued from page 8'94 PT graduate Inducted Into Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Brad Budde had a distinguished athletic career, as demonstrated by his December induction into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. But to him, sports was more than a game and more than a career. It taught him how to live life. As a starting offensive lineman during his four years at the University of Southern California, Mr. Budde played for the Trojans in three Rose Bowls, one leading to the 1978 national championship title. Among other honors, he received the Lombardi Award. Mr. Budde went on to become a fi rst-round pick of the Kansas City Chiefs, with whom he played for eight years in the 1980s in the same position his father, Ed, had played on the same team from 1963-76. It was as a child, observing his father's team from year to year at summer training camps, that Brad Budde began to learn about concepts such as teamwork and leadership. In his own playing days, he further discovered how being a good sportsman also translates into a life well lived. One way he learned this is by preparing weekly for a game, playing it, and then critically studying his mistakes on the game tapes in order to play better next time. \"Off the fi eld, the routine of discipline has helped me be prepared for life's tests,\" he said. \"You have to objectively look at yourself, strengthen your weaknesses, and take another crack at things. That's how I live my life.\" Mr. Budde observed several key traits in good players. One is being coachable\u2014doing what your leader asks of you. The second is the ability to remain competitive by rarely making the same mistake twice. The third is to be comfortable with change. Mr. Budde believes not in adapting yourself, but leaving safety behind and entirely adopting a new system if the situation calls for it. Successfully playing football also requires critical thinking and problem solving. Such skills are useful for everyone in life, Mr. Budde said. \"I think sports helps you get a little jump-start on that if you're paying attention.\" During his football career, Mr. Budde knew it wouldn't last forever. He observedlife around him to see what he might like to do next. When he was treated by a physical therapist for a shoulder injury, he grew attracted to the profession because\u2014like football\u2014he would need to use both his mind and body together in order to help people regain full use of their physical and mental capabilities. Mr. Budde chose to study at Loma Linda University because faith is important to him, and he valued Loma Linda's \"wholistic\" approach to wellness. Another factor in his decision was the relationship he formed with Edd Ashley, Ed.D., chair of the physical therapy department. Mr. Budde felt that Dr. Ashley realized he was a passionate man who had the ability to connect with patients not only ratio- nally but also in their hearts. Dr. Ashley said the two of them bonded over the fact that both had formerly played professional ball and then tran- sitioned into physical therapy. For the past 17 years, Mr. Budde has operated Budde Physical Therapy, Inc., which works with senior citizens in their homes. He chose to specialize in gerontology because he felt it was the most challenging, and he also believes the elderly are a forgotten people not given the attention and respect they deserve. \"That?s a tragedy,\" he said. \"I grew up nurtured and loved and disciplined. My parents taughtme that I?m supposed to make a difference in this world.\" In addition to his work as a physical therapist, Mr. Budde devotes about one third of his time to Gameday Performance Systems, Inc., which he founded in 2005. He conducts seminars for businesses as well as government agencies, in which he teaches them to apply the traits neces- sary for top athletic performance to the work- place. He aims to help managers become better leaders and teams to perform more effectively. Photo Courtesy: Art KroetzBy HEATHER REIFSNYDERLLU TODAY NewspaperMarch 2011Assistant Professor James Syms, DSc, cares not only about his own physical therapy students at LLU, but about all California young people who want to enter the profession. That's why he successfully helped advocate for legislation that will allow students to get their doctorates in physical therapy at California State University campuses. And as the newly elected president of the California Physical Therapy Association (CPTA), he will continue to further the profession at the state level. Currently of particular concern to Dr. Syms is the restriction in California that physical therapists cannot see patients unless they have fi rst been diagnosed by a physician. He points out that in California's neighboring states, individuals who know they need a physical therapist can go to one directly. The restriction here is based on a legal opinion formed decades ago when physical therapists only had bachelor's degrees. \"Our students work hard, and they're trained to have a greater knowledge base and skill set than what the state legislature will allow them to use,\" Dr. Syms says. \"There are other examples I also want to address, all concerning unwarranted practice restrictions placed on our graduates.\" For his advocacy on behalf of the physical therapy doctorate at California State University, Dr. Syms was recognized by the alumni association at the Northridge campus\u2014his undergraduate alma mater\u2014with the 2010 Volunteer Service Award. He was also commended by State Assemblyman Bob Blumenfi eld and others. The shift from the master's program to the doctoral level is crucial at Cal State, Dr. Syms explains, because in 2015, students must graduate with a doctorate in order to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education. Historically, the state mandate has been that Cal State campuses do not offer doctoral degrees, which have been reserved in most cases for the University of California system. Yet only one UC school offers physical therapy training. Dr. Syms says he did not want to see students who cannot afford private school\u2014as he couldn't when he got his fi rst degree\u2014lose the option to fulfi ll their professional goals. Furthermore, he didn't want to see the already growing shortage of physical therapists worsen by as much as 30 percent if public schools didn't offer the doctorate. Dr. Syms has been teaching at LLU since 1991. While here, he also earned his master's degree in 1995 and his doctorate in 2005 from Loma Linda University. His involvement with the California Physical Therapy Association began years ago at the level of the local Inland Counties District and grew from there. These days, his presidency keeps him fl ying to Sacramento nearly every week. 10 Spring/Summer 2011 | alliedhealth.llu.edu/alumniPHYSICAL THERAPY Physical Therapy Alumni Reunion in New Orleans, Louisiana On Thursday evening, February 10, nearly 70 Physical Therapy alums, current PT students and faculty from the PT department gathered for an exciting reunion and networking reception in a Marriot conference room in downtown New Orleans. This gathering gave many of our guests a chance to either reconnect with former classmates and instructors, or network and chat about their beloved profession; a profession that led them all to New Orleans for the APTA's Annual Combined Sections Meetings held in the Morial Convention Center. During this event, Dr. Craig Jackson (SAHP Dean) spoke to the crowd about some exciting new developments in the PT department back in Loma Linda.

Where's the bathroom? I don't understand\" in Mandarin Chinese, and I desperately need to learn how to say all those phrases correctly very soon, because... I'm going to China and paying nothing for the airfare! How does that work, you might ask? As a senior in Health Information Management (HIM) at LLU, one must choose a healthcare facility to fulfi ll the senior affi liation experience course requirements before graduation. Every year, our department provides the opportunity for seniors to apply for the Shaffer Endowment Scholarship Award, which provides travel expenses for clinical experience at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital in Hangzhou, China. I simply could not let this fantastic opportunity go by without applying for the scholarship, and now I am honored to announce that I have been chosen to receive the award along with my classmate, Trina Merrill. The trip to China will fulfi ll two weeks (one acute care and one non-acute care) of our senior affi liation. Audrey Shaffer, Assistant Clinical Professor in the HIM department, will be on site at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital to guide the affi liation experience. The following is a list of some of the objectives we'll be fulfi lling during our affi liation experience: tour the hospital campus, observe and/or help with all functions in the Health Information Department, provide in-service training for coders, review the hospital committee structure, review forms control for the hospital, and complete a special project for the Health Information Department of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. Weekend/evening activities will include visiting scenic and interesting places such as museums, parks, and shopping markets in China. Visiting these places in southeastern China will give us the opportunity to appreciate and discover China's fascinating culture. I am very grateful for this wonderful opportunity to complete my senior affi liation experience at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital. I am also very grateful for those who provide the funds for students at Loma Linda University to travel internationally. One of the goals in my life has always been to serve in a foreign country and now that I have the opportunity to do so I want to learn as much as I can from the two weeks in Hangzhou, China. I look forward to sharing my experience when I return from this exciting trip. Trina Merrill (Left) and Evelyn Rivera, recipients of the 2011 Audrey Shaffer Scholarship\"Nho! C\u00e8suz\u00e0inli?

Sophie Hung, 26, who recently received a Master's in Public Health, began working on the project as a student and came back to participate and help coach students on proper seed planting techniques. Since graduation, she has enrolled in a \"Master Gardener\" program to learn some of the fi ner points in plant raising. Like many students participating in the garden project, Anny Ha, 31, in her second year of study for a Master's degree in Nutrition, plans to use what she learns about raising crops to teach others. Among the fi rst seeds planted in a total of eight raised beds were carrots, beets, spinach, lettuce, peas and kale. Some beds were left untouched so that future crops can be added. \"Usually people fi nd a recipe they like in a book, then buy the food to make it, said Cory Gheen, executive chef for the Nutrition and Dietary programs. \"But with the garden, students will be learning how to deal with the plants dictating what the cooking will be.\" \"When the crops come in, students will be challenged to fi nd interesting and diverse ways to cook them while they are still at their freshest point,\" remarked Gheen. \"Growing the food they eat will give them a new respect for their food and cause the students to waste less.\" Eddy Jara, an assistant professor of Nutrition and Global Health said that students will be learning techniques they can use to teach families with lower incomes how to supplement their diets with inexpensive, healthy foods.By JIM STEINBERgStaff Writer for Redlands Daily FactsNovember 12, 2010 www.redlandsdailyfacts.com www.foodincmovie.comLLU Students Get in theNuTRITION & DIETETICS to Learn About CropsDirt Photo Courtesy: Jaclyn Pruehs Photo Courtesy : stoCk.xChng www.foodincmovie.com THE LINK | SAHP Newsletter 13LLU Students Get in theStudent and Future Dietitian Headed to Johns Hopkins for Clinical Practicum The LLU Nutrition Council Sponsored by the Schools of Allied Health and Public Health Press Release, January 2011NuTRITION & DIETETICS to Learn About Crops Photo Courtesy: Jaclyn Pruehs Photo Courtesy : stoCk.xChng The LLU Nutrition Council Sponsored by the Schools of Allied Health and Public Health Press Release, January 2011 On January 14, 2011, Dr. Ernie Schwab announced the development of the Loma Linda University Nutrition Council made up of students from both the School of Allied Health Professions (SAHP) and the School of Public Health (SPH). The Nutrition Council is an association created especially for nutrition students by nutrition students. The mission of the Council is to represent, empower and support the diverse nutrition student body of LLU through nutrition education, leadership and advancement programs. The vision of the Nutrition Council is to create a prominent, visible and intellectually advanced Nutrition and Dietetics student body that is involved in promoting and advancing the fi eld. A quarterly newsletter will be produced by the Council as a way of providing meaningful information about the Nutrition programs, updates on events and projects, as well as educational information such as \"Forming Great Habits,\" \"Words From the Wise,\" and discovering \"Cultural Culinary Traditions.\" The council believes that good nutrition is an integral part of living a whole and balanced life and therefore challenges its members and readers to \"learn from your failures and put them aside knowing that God is there to pull you through...you are beautiful and complete even in your short comings...be fearless!\" ~Jenna Abrassart, Council Member. You may contact the LLU Nutrition Council on facebook or at llu.nutrition.council@gmail.com. utrition and dietetics student Ksenia Koudriachova (known as KayKay) is hitting the road this summer, taking her passion for healthy living to a competitive clinical practicum at Johns Hopkins Hospital. \"I'm expecting to have a challenging and growing experience,\" says Ms. Koudriachova, a native of Vladivostok, Russia. She will spend 10 weeks in Baltimore with patients on the hospital fl oors. What Ms. Koudriachova loves about the fi eld of dietetics is counseling people on better eating habits. She gained experience doing just that during her community rotation at LLU's Drayson Center, where she and her colleagues hosted weekly nutrition classes. She also did an administrative rotation in Nome, Alaska, in the summer of 2010. \"There's no better feeling than to guide someone to achieve health,\" she says. \"It is my passion to present healthy living in a way that's approachable and simple.\" Her advisor, Maxine Taylor, EdD, RD\u2014assistant professor and clinical coordinator of nutrition and dietetics, School of Allied Health Professions\u2014said she expects Ms. Koudriachova to do well at Johns Hopkins. \"She is an excellent student and is very anxious to learn and share her knowledge with others,\" says Dr. Taylor. The nutrition and dietetics department's relationship with Johns Hopkins began in 1999 due to Dr. Taylor's connection with a student she used to teach at Oakwood College in Alabama. The student, Joycelyn Peterson, went on to become a registered dietitian who formed her own consulting company in Maryland. Dr. Taylor began to send students on clinical rotations to Ms. Peterson, who arranged for them to also spend several days at Johns Hopkins. Even since Ms. Peterson moved (she is now completing a DrPH from the LLU School of Public Health), the hospital has continued to accept LLU students, now on a full-time basis. During her time at Johns Hopkins, Ms. Koudriachova will participate in patient rounds with health care teams and counsel patients on nutrition, according to Dr. Taylor. She will assess inpatients' nutritional status, determine evidence-based recommendations for diet modifi cation, and teach both individuals and groups how to change their eating behavior to improve health. Dr. Taylor points out that students at Johns Hopkins have participated in a wide variety of experiences from observing organ transplantation, to recipe development, to web design, and menu review. \"Student dietitians at Loma Linda University benefi t from assigned supervised practice experience at a broad spectrum of excellent facilities from Alaska and Hawaii to Florida, Maryland, and Maine,\" says Dr. Taylor. \"Each facility brings the classroom learning to life in a somewhat different format,\" she adds. \"Students return to the university to share with classmates and new students the learning from the facilities to which they were assigned. Thus each benefi ts from the opportunities of others.\" In June, Ms. Koudriachova will graduate from the School of Allied Health Professions with a master's degree in nutrition and dietetics. She plans to sit for the registration examination for dietitians from the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the American Dietetic Association in September.

At the Silo\u00e9 Clinic our patients range from a few weeks old to the elderly with ailments that include diabetes, acute infections, hypertension, dermatological conditions and everything in between. Currently, the medical clinic is open to patients Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the dental ministry receives patients on Mondays. This clinic is run solely on donations. We do not charge for consultations and we will pay the lab fees and medications if patients are unable to do so. The clinic has contracted with a local laboratory that has agreed to perform testing at reduced fees. Some patients make a small donation if possible and others have shown their gratitude with gifts of fresh fruit or homemade tortillas! In addition to providing medical care and education, the staff of Clinica Comunitario Silo\u00e9 desires to edify each patient's spiritual health. We pray regularly with patients, provide Bibles for those who may not have them, invite our patients to church and, most importantly, share the good news and love of Jesus Christ. Over the past few years, we have been exploring new ways to reach out to our surrounding communities. In December of 2009, Silo\u00e9 hosted a Christmas outreach and party at a migrant farm-worker camp, providing a hot meal, gifts for children and the Christmas gospel message. In the Summer of 2010, we partnered with a visiting church to host a children's health fair. We are always seeking funding for future outreach and expansion of our ministry's scope as God leads us. What's in store for 2011... In addition to providing continued clinical care, health education and family counseling to our local village, we would like to expand our outreach efforts in nearby rural communities. Many families are in severe poverty and without hope. We would like to offer them medical care and share the love of Jesus with them. We have recently received several new computers, and are prayerfully considering opening an Internet Caf\u00e9 in our village. We would love to create a safe place for young people to do their homework and learn computer skills.How you can help... PrayPlease pray for our ministry and our family, and that God would guide our every step and decision in the coming year. Support Our Patients Our patient fund is at its lowest level in more than a year. Any donation to our general fund will go toward ensuring that we can continue providing medical care and health education to the village of Santa Anita in 2011.

We know that our faculty expect excellence, not only from their students, but from themselves. For this reason, and many more, we are proud to welcome Frank Sirna, PA-C back to the Physician Assistant department and to the greater SAHP family. Mr. Sirna was one of the founding Physician Assistants to start the PA Program in the School of Allied Health Professions in 1999 and served as Clinical Coordinator and instructor in the department until 2003. Sirna found himself moving to Southern California in 1975 to get into the Respiratory Therapy Program at San Bernardino Valley College. He received his degree in 1976 and completed a Respiratory Therapy internship at the Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) in 1977. After the one-year internship, he remained working in Respiratory Therapy at the LLUMC for several more years where he was a Clinical Instructor and was involved with the ground and aero-medical transport teams, including the Loma Linda helicopter transport team. He has lived in the Loma Linda area since 1975, with the exception of \"a few trips to Saudi Arabia with the Overseas Heart Surgery team thrown in there\" says Frank, \"as well as the absence of two years to get my PA Degree.\" Frank traveled across the US to become a Physician Assistant at the Medical College of Georgia, now named the Georgia Health Sciences University. He received his degree in 1986 and immediately returned to California. He completed the residency program at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center for Emergency Medicine Physician Assistants in 1988. \"For a number of years I worked in various capacities as a PA; Cardiovascular Surgery, Emergency Medicine, Pediatric Intensive Care in Las Vegas and Surgery, Emergency and Family Care for Kaiser Healthcare System in both San Diego and Fontana, Calif.,\" remarks Sirna. When asked how he became a part of the founding Physician Assistants of the program in the School of Allied Health Professions, he responded, \"I had done some teaching for the Respiratory Care Program [in SAHP] prior to becoming a Physician Assistant. The late Robert Wilkins, who chaired the Respiratory program at the time, got a hold of me and asked if I would be interested in helping to start up a PA program. So he more or less talked me into it.\" After a few years of serving as Clinical Coordinator and instructor, Sirna chose to focus more on Clinical Practice and served as a PA in the Pediatrics Department for the Faculty Physicians and Surgeons at Loma Linda University. In December of 2010 he returned to the LLU Physician Assistant Department and now works as the Didactic Coordinator and instructor, teaching classes such as Physical Diagnosis and Clinical Medicine. \"It's interesting to see how the program has grown. We started out accepting 15 people and we plan to accept up to 30,\" says Sirna. \"As we expand the program we have two goals, one is to make sure that we're modeling the mission, values and vision of the University as a whole, and the second is that we would like to turn out the best PA's that we can.\" PA Alumni Reunion in Palm Springs, California Reunions are great fun, and this group of Physician Assistant graduates proved it! On Saturday night, October 9, the Alumni, Development and Dean's of ces from the School of Allied Health hosted a dinner reunion at the Kaiser Grille Restaurant in Palm Springs, California. This reunion was purposefully scheduled during the Annual CAPA (California Academy of Physician Assistants ) Conference held at the Palm Springs Convention Center, in hopes that many of our alumni would be able to join us. And many did join us! Over 30 alumni lled the tables with laughter and energetic conversations. Our back room in the restaurant was quickly lled, con rming our need for more tables and more fun! Nearly every graduating class was represented by a few of their graduates, and to prove it, class photos were taken throughout the evening. For those who attended the reunion, we hope you had a fantastic time and we look forward to seeing you again at the next Physician Assistant reunion. We really enjoy keeping up with you all!

Each year, they host annual meetings, exhibits and CE workshops, and on October 22 through 25, the 71 st Annual CAMLT event commenced at Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel in Southern California. The organization traditionally sponsors a student forum on Saturday of the event where all CLS programs in California are invited to send student representatives to present a case study, research project or an evaluation of scientifi c literature to a room full of their peers. \"It's really great for our students to have the opportunity to rub shoulders with other professionals and showcase what they are learning at Loma Linda,\" says Katherine Davis MS, MT(ASCP), Program Director and Assistant Professor in the SAHP Clinical Lab Department. \"However, since this forum has always been hosted on a Saturday, it has excluded our students from participating.\" Davis had been in dispute with the organization for several years with the request to host the event on a Friday. It was thought that the attendance would suffer if the event were held on a Friday due to program directors not wanting to take out a normal day of class schedule. Davis continued to push for the change in schedule remarking that \"it is an educational activity that would benefi t the students just as much as a normal course day.\" This year, CAMLT fi nally made the change and shifted the schedule to hold the forum on a Friday. Amazingly, there were more in attendance than ever before with 120 students from CLS programs such as Cal State Dominguez Hills, San Francisco State, San Jose State, and also several hospital-based programs like UCI and the Kaiser System in Northern California. All 17 CLS seniors did countless hours of research on the case of a baby born in the LLU Medical Center with an Omphalocele, a condition in which the internal organs are outside of the body, and the corresponding infections. \"From the student standpoint, they were looking at the hematology, microbiology, blood bank and chemistry laboratory results and correlating them to the patient's condition,\" remarks Davis. \"They had to put the whole picture together for the presentation and I'm very proud of them. There was such a massive amount of laboratory data that they were overwhelmed at fi rst, but with a lot of hard work they were able to synthesize the information and organize their thoughts into an excellent and informative presentation.\" Four students, Bao Nghiem, Bruce Campbell, Karl Tangonan and Averil Austin presented the poster and PowerPoint at the forum. \"We had the largest group at the forum representing our LLU program,\" exclaims Davis, \"they all were very professional and did an exceptional job.\" Each student who attended the forum entered their name into a drawing for scholarships from the CAMLT organization. At the end of the presentations, several names were chosen for $500, including three of our own: Denise Veloria, Bao Nghiem and Maiphuong Le. Congratulations! The seniors returned to campus with a lot to tell the junior students. They received such a confi dence boost in their abilities as Clinical Lab Scientists and they learned that, by comparison to other schools and hospitals, Loma Linda University has an excellent CLS program. Their positive reactions from this forum have generated a lot of interest from the juniors for next year. They have already begun to fundraise for next year's trip to CAMLT's 72 nd Annual Meetings and Student Forum in Northern California.The demand for Speech-Language Pathologists, especially in public schools, seems to increase every year. In spite of state and federal budget cuts, there are still plenty of jobs for master's level SLPs. In response to the community's needs, and in order to increase income, the CSD Department in the School of Allied Health Professions will increase the number of admissions to the Master of Science program over the next two years. Twenty-four students (compared to the long-established 18) will be admitted for Autumn quarter 2011. In 2012, thirty new students will be admitted to the program. Alumni may well ask about space, teaching loads, and particularly, clinical placements, given this radical increase in size. Lecture-format classes generally can be accommodated in Nichol Hall, or in the new Centennial Complex. Problem-based learning classes (now used by Drs. Shaughnessy, Mainess, and Douglas) call for the small group format, and will require some creativity as we adjust to the greater numbers of students. The driving force in maintaining the relatively small number of students has always been the availability (or lack) of externship placements in the summer. The department continues to keep its commitment to educating and training excellent beginning clinicians for both school and medical settings; therefore, we were not willing to eliminate either experience from the curriculum. The issue, then, became how to expand the numbers of students and continue to provide the breadth and depth of experience that is our hallmark. In order to do this, the department has taken the bold step of reorganizing the sequence of the courses, such that the externship and advanced directed teaching placements will be removed from the summer, and placed at the end of the program (winter and spring quarter of the second year). Applicants are informed in advance that, while we will continue to try to place them locally, they should prepare for placement out of town or out of state, if necessary. Students with families will be placed locally, and students who have family in other states may be asked to go there. Students will not attend classes during the two quarters of externship and directed teaching; however, they will have a full course load during the summer between first and second-year of the program. Of course, the faculty and staff are hoping that these changes will go smoothly; however, planning is always easier than implementing, and the reality is that we may have a few rough spots to smooth out over the next few years.

On January 28, 2011, Brian Sharp passed his \"proposal defense\" and has been advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. in Rehabilitation Sciences and Disorders. He now has official permission to begin his research. He hopes to graduate in June 2012. On Thursday April 14, 2011 (9:00-3:00), Brian Sharp will present a supervision workshop: Supervising SLPAs, Student Clinicians, & Clinical Fellows - Working through Generational Differences . On the same day (9:00-12:00), Jennifer St. Clair and Paige Shaughnessy will present their refresher workshop: Supervision, Clinical Instruction, & Mentoring . Both are sponsored by the Department and will be held in Nichol Hall. Paige Shaughnessy recently presented supervision workshops at the Alumni Association of Fresno State, the Los Angeles County Administrators of Special Education, the Metropolitan New York City Clinic Directors, the CSHA State Convention, CSHA District 10, and the Medical Speech Pathology Council of California (MSCC), with focus on generational diversity. Brian Sharp recently presented workshops on supervision for CSHA District 10 and Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. Paige Shaughnessy will be awarded the CSHA Fellow and will be honored at the Honors Banquet on March 26 at the annual CSHA convention in Los Angeles. Heather Knutson Petersen '06, Jessica Cockerham University of Redlands, and Paige Shaughnessy, professor at LLU, developed and implemented a hearing conservation program in the Redlands Unified School District. Now in its fourth year, the program provides the opportunity for students from both universities to work together to provide comprehensive hearing screening in the district. The experience is a part of the Portfolio class for the LLU students. Their poster, Collaboration and Service Learning: A Novel Approach to State-Mandated Hearing Screening (Petersen, Cockerham, Wolgemuth, & Shaughnessy, 2010) , was presented at the 2010 Annual ASHA convention in Philadelphia, PA. Two new clinics are providing much needed services and are giving students the opportunity to expand their skills: The Phonology Clinic , conducted by Jennifer St. Clair, is located at the SACHS-Norton Clinic. This clinic, which meets once a week, is a preschool group, made up of children with phonological delays. The Accent Modification Clinic , conducted by Terry Douglas, provides individual and group sessions for those who wish to improve their ability to speak American English without a foreign accent. LLU has a long-standing commitment to fostering the knowledge and skills needed in all clinical settings. The master's program in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders has always pledged to their students that, when they graduate, they will have all the clinical hours necessary to begin the Clinical Fellowship Experience. In recent years, it has become more difficult to find medical placements for our externship students. We recognize how much time and effort is required to provide quality clinical instruction and we are so grateful to those clinical instructors who see this as their responsibility to the profession. The Department is committed to providing incentives and rewards for clinical instructors and facilities who help us prepare these young professionals. We are not able to provide monetary incentives, but we are able to provide free supervision seminars to facilities. Those interested in these free seminars, or clinical instruction, should contact Brian Sharp (bdsharp@llu.edu) or Jennifer St. Clair (jstclair@llu.edu). classCSD Department increases SizeIn January 2011, Loma Linda University began its inaugural year of the newly founded Cardiac Electrophysiology Technology Program (CEPT) for allied health professionals. The program was created when the authors found a lack in the number of EP-trained professionals on the west coast, and saw the need to create this formal clinical EP program. The Background In 2007, Joe Giron's then staffi ng/consulting fi rm helped one Southern California hospital start a electrophysiology (EP) program. Within six months, this program had completed its fi rst EP procedure and had successfully advanced into complex atrial fi brillation (AF) ablations. After this success, many requests to his staffi ng/consulting fi rm came in from surrounding hospitals for similar opportunities for their cardiovascular service lines. It quickly became apparent that many hospitals in the western region lacked properly trained EP professionals. As a former graduate of Loma Linda University, Mr. Giron felt that LLU would be the perfect place for such a pioneering program. Mr. Giron presented his research and vision with a core group of administrators at LLU, including Dr. Laura Alipoon (Department Chair of Radiation Technology), Dr. David Lopez (Department Chair of Cardiopulmonary Sciences and Physician Assistant Sciences), and Dr. Ernie Schwab (Dean of Academic Affairs). After many meetings, LLU decided to develop the fi rst clinical EP training program for allied health professionals on the west coast. The Emerging Swell In the world of EP, atrial fi brillation is just one segment in the overall spectrum of treatable arrhythmias. AF is the most common arrhythmia in the U.S., affecting 80% of adults who are 65 years of age and older. Over the last few years, many research and clinical studies have established and further refi ned AF therapies, and with additions to the technology advancements, the effects have compounded the effi ciency and precision in successful EP and AF therapies. However, there remains a national disparity between the mega medical centers, which comprise much of the east coast regions, and the vast expanse of mostly community hospitals that occupy the west. Specifi cally speaking in terms of EP, which is more comprehensive and a continuing emerging health science, the American west and much of the international community have seen a shortage of trained and skilled electrophysiology professionals. With the continued growth in systems and equipment technologies from the bio-tech companies that supply this industry with products, these companies compound the void of EP professionals by recruiting most of their EP support staff from the hospital community. These are some of the reasons why the CEPT program here at the Southern California campus of Loma Linda University benefi ts bio-tech companies and hospitals alike. The Curriculum LLU will have two CEPT programs. The fi rst will offer an online certifi cate in the Cardiac Electrophysiology Technology Program. This program is 12 months in duration, and requires an Associate's degree ( does not have to be a health sciences degree ) and a healthcare background, such as radiography, respiratory care, nursing, cardiovascular technology, emergency medical technology, or a current EP technologists. The second program offers an Associate of Science degree in the Cardiac Electrophysiology Technology Program; this is a face-to-face, 12-month program that will start in September of 2011. The Associate's Degree is for individuals without a healthcare background who have the necessary prerequisites. Approximately 880 hours of clinical education will be completed by students in both programs. The Graduates Graduates of the CEPT program will be qualifi ed to sit for boards and for employment with not just acute care hospital CCL/EP labs, but also with hospital or physician rhythm management clinics, clinical support, and sales positions with various bio-technology companies. The development of this program was in large part directed from internal research that demonstrated that the future needs of hospitals, physicians, bio-tech companies and healthcare reform was to meet the emerging challenges of science and therapy required for the maturation of electrophysiology.

Diabetes mellitus affects nearly 7.8% of the U.S. population, with approximately 5-10% affected by Type I and 90-95% by Type II. Diabetes is the most common type of endocrine disease and was the seventh leading underlying cause of death listed on death certifi cates in 2006. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 223,619 deaths were attributed to diabetes in 2005. It's important to train and educate students of prehospital care on key indicators of a diabetic emergency. The assessment of a diabetic patient is best taught as a case-based simulation. A traditional classroom lecture format allows for student participation but limits the instructor's ability to create realistic situations. This environment doesn't allow the student to identify presentation cues, be active in their own learning or apply their skills without endangering the lives of patients. Instead, instructors should combine case- and simulation-based techniques when teaching diabetic assessment. Case-based education adds a real-world aspect to the learning environment. The use of simulation-based instruction enables a student to learn at their own pace and allows them to repeat sequential steps to gain confi dence and profi ciency...

SAHP goodies and prizes were taken home by all our alumni. In addition, each attendee was given a ticket and entered into a drawing for items such as an embroidered School of Allied Health Professions ball cap, as well as sun shades, water bottles and more bearing the LLU SAHP name. Many in attendance at this evening reception were taking part in the 56th International Respiratory Congress at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Simulation-based LIVING By AMBER ANg ELIE DiscoverMagazine.com Published online January 11, 2011 Laugh Well, Live Well Researchers have long known that laughter boosts the immune system, lowers cholesterol and blood pressure, and reduces stress. In a preliminary new study, psychoneuro-immunologist Lee Berk and his team at Loma Linda University show that the parallels between laughing and exercise go even further: Shifts in appetite hormones following a case of the giggles resemble the effects of a moderate session at the gym. Berk measured blood levels of ghrelin, a hunger- regulating hormone, before and after 14 study participants watched 20 minutes of humorous TV (selected from a menu including Saturday Night Live, Bill Cosby's stand-up, and Seinfeld). He then compared the data with hormone levels recorded before and after the test subjects watched the distressing opening battle scenes of Saving Private Ryan. Regardless of the order in which they saw the clips, people's ghrelin concentrations spiked after the funny session, \"just like after a workout,\" Berk says. Elevated levels of ghrelin signal the brain that the body is using energy and will soon need more fuel. Laugh therapy will not replace exercise for weight loss, then, but it could help people with conditions that cause appetite loss, such as depression and chronic pain. Berk is now studying whether laughter can also reduce inflammation associated with many illnesses, including cancer and heart disease.

The Program for Health Care Educators is hosted by the Harvard University School of Medicine and invited 55 select participants form medical schools around the world to study five themes: learning and teaching, educational technology, curriculum, evaluation and leadership. The program is an intensive learning experience. Learning formats include whole-group presentations, problem-based learning, observations, reflective use of journals, simulation teaching, and case-based teaching. In addition, participants are able to observe master model teachers and to contribute to development of individual and small group projects for curriculum innovation and leadership for change. Dr. Escobar-Poni's project focused on developing leadership and professional growth in medical students, and it incorporated the annual memorial service for cadavers. Dr. Rice's project includes the publication of a manuscript titled \"Right-Side-Up Learning.\" The book discusses the full implementation of all phases of the ideal learning cycle, and it emphasizes the importance of adequate preparation for learning, as well as appropriate closure of the learning experience. More than 30 examples of sets and closures are included. The book is designed for higher education faculty, with examples from the health education and medical education classroom.

Photo Courtesy : stoCk.xChng\"Stand up and speak out against heart disease by wearing red on Friday, February 4\" says the American Heart Association. And that's just what the School of Allied Health Professions did. National Wear Red Day was a bright sight to see throughout Nichol Hall as faculty, staff and an unbelievable amount of students sported red shirts, ties, scarves and shoes in order to raise awareness of heart disease. Nearly 100% participation was shown by students in Professor Christine Wilson's PT class that Friday ( see cover photo of half of the class ). Nevermind that it was an extra credit effort, the students had fun showing their support for this important day of awareness. Karen Westphal, student events coordinator/marketing assistant, and Kate Gattuso, Respiratory Therapist faculty, have organized SAHP's Wear Red events for the past few years. And each year, faculty, staff and student participation increases. This particular February 4, Respiratory Care Seniors checked blood pressure of passers-by in the lobby. In addition, laptops were available for people to fill out the \"Life Simple 7\" American Heart Association questionnaire to receive a heart health assessment. There were also flyers and pamphlets on diabetes, high blood pressure and other heart/health related issues for people to grab and get informed.

It has been clearly demonstrated that spiritual health dramatically impacts physical health in human beings. It is for this reason that Dr. Wil Alexander has pioneered a hands-on approach to caring for ill and hurting patients by discovering their spiritual strengths and enhancing all aspects of their life, not just their physical wellbeing. In order to implement this innerweave of spiritual care, Dr. Alexander recommends orienting patients toward the importance of their spiritual life in whole person health care. He encourages physicians to take a spiritual history, which includes asking questions about a patient's spiritual journey. One can then interpret the spiritual history as part of the whole history of an illness and assess the spiritual resources and strengths of the patient, ultimately making spiritual connections in the management of the patient's problems and concerns. As he begins his 90th year, Dr. Alexander shares how he championed this intuitive process, allowing you to see just why his name is attached to the Wil Alexander Wholeness Series for students and professionals in the healthcare field. Dr. Wil, when did you first become passionate about wholeness and whole person care? ... \"When I was senior pastor of the White Memorial Church in Los Angeles, and spent time with the physicians in hospital and clinics.\" What exactly do wholeness and whole person care mean to you? ... \"Wholeness is living the whole of life in communion with God and others. Whole person care is care of the whole body, whole soul, and whole spirit\u2014toward restoration of the image of God, and for loving God and His world and creatures.\" Initially, how receptive were healthcare professionals to this idea? ... \"Early on there was wariness, some open hostility, and a wait-and-see attitude.\" How has the climate in US healthcare changed as far as discussing patients' spiritual needs with them, and what is considered good practice now? ... \"In 1973 there were two medical schools interested in whole person care, today there are over 100 medical schools that have a required course in whole person care. Good practice now requires the intentional practice of spiritual care in addition to physical, mental-emotional, and relational care\u2014dealing with illness and brokenness along with disease.\" What exactly is the Wil Alexander Wholeness Series and how many years has it been in existence? ... \"Since the fall of 2003 the Wil Alexander Wholeness Series has been a component of the Allied Health portfolio program. It is comprised of 50 minute workshops given by experts in the community on topics pertaining to diversity, wholeness, Christ-centered values, collaboration, lifelong learning, and communication.\" What do you hope the series does for the students? ... \"I hope it gives them the opportunity to investigate and experience things they would not ordinarily do in their academic curriculum.\" How can alumni help sponsor the series? ... \"Alumni can give feedback to Deans and professors about how this material has been helpful in their careers. They can also mark some of their giving for the series.\" What are the needs? ... \"A complimentary meal is served after workshops to encourage a sense of community and to allow students to discuss the topics with the speaker and with each other. Sponsors are needed to help defray the cost of the meal for the 100-200 students in attendance per workshop.\" How can Allied Health alumni practice wholeness in their daily lives and encourage their patients to do so? ... \"They can examine their present intentional practice, infrastructure, and assessment for future success. It's also important to keep in touch with their school to affect change in curriculum and practice.\" As you turn 90 this year, what dreams do you have for the future of LLU, its faculty, staff and students? ... \"It would be incredible to see total buy-in of the wholeness concept and whole person care by board, administration, faculty, students, clinical workers, residents, practitioners, patients, and clients in each of the schools, to continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus.\" For more information on how you can partner with the Wil Alexander Wholeness Series with your gifts, contact Ardis Wazdatsky at awazdatskey@llu.edu. 22 Spring/Summer 2011 | alliedhealth.llu.edu/alumniWIL ALEXANDER SERIES Dr. Alexander / Photo By: Art KroetzInterviewed by ARDIS WAZDATSKY Director of Portfolio, LLU March 2011Innerweaving Spiritual Connections in Whole Person Health Care \"All illness is meaningful, although its meaning may never be translatable into entirely rational terms. The point is not only to understand the cause of the disease and then solve the problem, but get close enough to restore the particular spiritual connection with life at which it hints...In a very real sense we do not heal diseases, they heal us by restoring and deepening our spiritual participation in life.\" Thomas Moore ETHE LINK | SAHP Newsletter 23ALumNI uPDATES Todd Peterson, '00 Emergency Medical Care, lost his battle with cancer and passed away on January 30, 2011.
