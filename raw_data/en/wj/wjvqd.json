In addition, these manuals serve as an Annex to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the Department of Public Health (DPH) Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). The purpose of this manual is two-fold. First, to serve either as the official Policies and Procedures for the Administration of Vaccines and Provision of Immunization Services by a health district, or to be utilized as a guide for writing a district's Immunization Policies and Procedures. District Health Directors who choose to utilize these two publications as their district Policies and Procedures should review and sign both manuals annually. We encourage District Health Directors, Clinical Coordinators and Immunization Coordinators, as well as other providers, to review this manual and ensure that their district's policies are in conformance with those outlined in this document. Secondly, the purpose is to delineate the responsibilities and working relationships of state, district and county personnel in matters that concern the Immunization Office. Any discrepancies or errors found in the manual should be brought to the attention of the Immunization Office at (404) 657-3158 or email immunization@dhr.state.ga.us. Thank you for your support of the Immunization Office in Georgia.

INTRODUCTION Introduction to the Manual Georgia Immunization Office Central Staff (REPLACE) Immunization Office Consultants (REPLACE) District Immunization Coordinators (REPLACE) Request for Immunization Forms---Form 3184 (REPLACE) Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health Introduction To Manual 6/2015 1 The Georgia Immunization Manual is intended to provide District and County personnel with up-to-date information and guidance. The Georgia Immunization Manual is based primarily on the Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The ACIP Recommendations are provided as a separate manual. These two manuals should be utilized together as the basis for formulating policies and procedures for administering vaccines and providing immunization services. The Department of Public Health also recognizes the Red Book (Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases) of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Another important reference is the package insert supplied by the manufacturer of the vaccine. This manual and the ACIP Recommendations Manual represent official state policies and standards, and the recommended policies and procedures for administering vaccines, providing immunization services, and documenting and evaluating quality assurance. In addition these manuals serve as an annex to the Standard Operations Procedures (SOP) of the Department of Public Health (DPH), Emergency Operations Plan EOP). Districts may utilize these two manuals as the district's written Policies and Procedures for Administering Vaccines by Registered and Licensed Practical Nurses or use this manual as a guide to write their own. In addition, districts may utilize the Quality Assurance (QA) document included in this manual as a tool to document and evaluate the credentialing, policies, training, administration of vaccine and provision of immunization services. If a district chooses to utilize their own QA instrument, it should include all elements in the QA document in this manual. Constructive criticism, questions and notification of apparent error will be welcome, but deviation from state policy should not be undertaken lightly. Statements made in this manual take precedence over contradictory policy statements or memos that predate the manual pages. Occasionally, due to ongoing research and evaluation, ACIP recommendations may differ from the manufacturer's package insert or the information in the Red Book, which is published every three years. When this occurs, the State Immunization Program utilizes the most current ACIP Recommendations. Frequently, the ACIP publishes provisional guidelines prior to receiving final approval from the Director of the CDC and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). To facilitate the administration of newly licensed vaccines, the Georgia Immunization Program will utilize these provisional recommendations when necessary in developing guidelines. From time to time, children present at DPH clinics with requests or orders from private physicians to administer vaccines under unusual circumstances. When the request clearly falls outside the ACIP Recommendations, such as using reduced dosage schedules, it simply should not be honored. When a child has a history or condition which calls for careful judgment as to whether it might be a contraindication and the physician assures that vaccine may be given safely, the District Health Director must make a decision whether to immunize or refer the child back to the physician. Each subject in the manual is dated. When changes are made, appropriately indexed pages will be made available on the program website to replace outdated material. Transmittal letters should be logged and filed in the Memo section in the manual. When recommendation changes occur between the annual manual updates, health districts will be notified by memos from the State Immunization Program. The Immunization Program Manual will be updated at least annually to include the recommended changes. Health districts are responsible for developing and implementing a plan to ensure that all memos and manual revisions are distributed, discussed, and implemented within a month of receipt with all appropriate clinics and staff and that the Immunization Program Manuals and ACIP manuals are kept current. When questions arise that are not covered adequately anywhere in the manual, the Immunization Program personnel are eager to field them and provide or obtain clarification. A staff person is available for on-call questions Monday through Friday, from 8:00 A.M. until 5:00 P.M. The Immunization Program telephone numbers may be found in Section 1 of this manual.

Recommended Schedule and Standards - 7/2015 Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics 1 A. Guidelines for Administration The Georgia Immunization Program recommends that all DPH clinics follow the current Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule that is developed and published annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). A copy of the most current schedule, including the footnotes, is inserted in this section of the manual. Additional charts and tables are included to provide assistance in further defining and clarifying the recommended schedule. Also included is a recommended infant/child screening questionnaire to assist providers in identifying possible contraindications and precautions for administering vaccines. The Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule and a Screening Questionnaire for Adults are also included in this section. The charts and tables are meant to serve as standards and provide quick references for individuals assessing immunization records and administering vaccines. Detailed information regarding vaccines and vaccine administration policies should be obtained from the most current ACIP Recommendations. These recommendations may be accessed from CDC's web site (see Immunization Resources in Section 13, Attachment A of this manual). It is imperative that all those who administer vaccines follow the guidelines put forth in the General Recommendations on Immunization ACIP statement1, the Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the \"Pink Book\"), 2 as well as those found in this manual in Chapter 13, Quality Assurance. The following principles are merely a summary of these recommendations and are not meant to be all-inclusive: 1. Ascertain the client's need for the recommended immunizations to avoid drawing up vaccine that will not be used. 2. Select correct needle size for vaccine, route, and size of client. 3. Double-check the vial label and expiration date before AND after drawing up vaccine. 4. If preparing multiple vaccinations, label each syringe or use labeled tray in order to correctly identify vaccines before administration. 5. Use aseptic technique throughout vaccine preparation, administration, and disposal of syringes and other materials. 6. Avoid prefilling syringes because of the risk for administration errors. Other problems that could be associated with this practice are vaccine wastage and possible bacterial growth in vaccines that do not contain a preservative. In addition, syringes other than those that are prefilled by the manufacturer are designed for immediate administration, not for vaccine storage. 7. If it is necessary to reconstitute more than one vaccine dose, as for a large influenza clinic, only prefill a FEW syringes at a time, which you can administer while someone else is prefilling a few syringes they will administer. Any syringes left at the end of the clinic day should be discarded . 8. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should MMR, MMRV, Zoster or varicella vaccine ever be reconstituted and drawn prior to the immediate need for the vaccines. These live virus vaccines are unstable and begin to deteriorate as soon as they are reconstituted with diluent. Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards - 7/2015 Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics 2 9. All providers who administer vaccinations should be aware of the potential for syncope (fainting) after vaccination and take appropriate measures to prevent it. Thus, clinicians should (1) make sure that people who are being vaccinated are always seated; (2) be aware of symptoms that precede fainting (weakness, dizziness, pallor, etc.); and (3) take appropriate measures to prevent injuries if such symptoms occur.3 Vaccine providers should strongly consider observing vaccinated people for 15 minutes after vaccination.4 This is particularly important when vaccinating adolescents and young adults. 10. From time to time, children present at DPH clinics with requests or orders from private physicians to administer vaccines under unusual circumstances. When the request clearly falls outside the ACIP Recommendations, such as using reduced dosage schedules, it simply should not be honored. When a child has a history or condition which calls for careful judgment as to whether it might be a contraindication and the physician assures that vaccine may be given safely, the District Health Director must make a decision whether to immunize or refer the child back to the physician. B. Guidelines for Eligibility for VFC and State-Supplied Vaccines Eligibility criteria are outlined in each of the Immunization Program Vaccine Guidelines in this section. In addition, the table following this document outli nes the eligibility criteria for vaccines provided by the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) and by the Georgia Immunization Office. All clinics are responsible for screening and docume nting a person's eligibility for receiving state supplied vaccines. For the purposes of these documents, a child is defined as a person from 0 through 18 years of age. An adult is anyone 19 years of age or older. The following mandates should be utilized when conducting eligibility screening for either group: I. Eligibility Criteria for Children A. All children 0 through18 years of age should be screened to determine VFC eligibility using the following terms and definitions: 1. Medicaid---is eligible for Medicaid services. 2. American Indian/Alaska Native---self-reported by the patient. 3. Uninsured children---have no health insurance. 4. Underinsured children---have insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit.5 Example: An insurance company may not cover certain vaccines, such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The child will qualify for VFC for that particular vaccine only. Example: An insurance company may cover immunizations up to a certain age. Up to that age, the child is fully insured. After that age, the child is considered underinsured (has insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit). Example: An insurance company may only provide $100.00 per year to cover the costs of immunizations. The child is fully insured up to $100.00. Once this amount is exhausted, the child is then eligible to receive VFC vaccine. 5. PeachCare for Kids---has a current PeachCare for Kids card at the time of service.5 B. Any child who has insurance coverage for immunizations is not eligible to receive state-supplied vaccines. This is the case even when the insured has a high deductible --- the child is considered fully insured. These children should be: 1. referred to their private provider; or 2. administered vaccine purchased by the district. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards - 7/2015 Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics 3 II. Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by VFC for minors presenting for services without proof of insurance. Please use the following guidance: A. Unaccompanied minors through the age of 18 who are being seen in a public health STD or Family Planning clinic, and who present without proof of insurance, may be immunized using VFC vaccine. 1. Hep A, Hep B, and HPV are the only vaccines that may be administered to someone under the age of 18 based on their own consent. 2. Be aware that you may come across an 18 year old patient who is still covered by their parent's insurance, but is unable to access it. Because the patient is 18 she or he may legally consent for additional vaccines, all of which should be included on the Title X form ( located in Chapter 9 of this manual). B. To document eligibility screening, records should reflect 'Uninsured' for this population. C. Complete Title X log sheet for any minor receiving vaccine in this category. III. Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults (Refer to table on following pages.) C. Standards for Documentation All public health clinics should be utilizing the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS) for reviewing and documenting the immunization status of all clients. Public health clinics should have the technological capability and staff trained to ensure that, regardless of the individual software system used, immunizations administered will be entered into the GRITS system within 2 business days. 1 General Recommendations on Immunization, MMWR , January 28, 2011 Vol. 60, RR-2, pg. 3 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The intent of these tables: /square4 IS NOT to determine which children, adolescents and/or adults should be immunized, but /square4 IS to define which groups can be immunized with federally funded VFC, federally funded Section 317, or CHIP purchased vaccines. For specific vaccine guidelines refer to Section 2, Recommended Schedules and Guidelines, of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. The vaccine must be provided at no cost to the patient. Vaccine administration fees for self-pay clients are capped at $21.93 per injection for both non-Medicaid VFC and Section 317 funded vaccine. No client should be refused vaccination with VFC, Section 317, or CHIP vaccine due to inability to pay the administration fee. If a client meets at least one eligibility criterion for each component of a combination vaccine (e.g., Pediarix, Comvax, MMRV, Twinrix), they are eligible to receive that combination vaccine if the state supplies it.

Recommended Schedule and Standards---7/2015 Combination Vaccines 2 General Standards for the Use of Combination Vaccin es 1 To minimize the number of injections children rece ive, parenteral combination vaccines should be used, if licensed and indicated for the p atient's age, instead of their equivalent component vaccines. Recommended intervals and ages for single antigen vaccines, when used in combination series, should be observed. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines, in either monovalent or combination formulations from the sam e or different manufacturers, are interchangeable for sequential doses in the vaccina tion series. Using the same acellular pertussis vaccine product from the same manufacturer is preferable for at least the first three doses. How ever, if the brand is not known, ACIP recommends to vaccinate the child using the DTaP va ccine that is available. When patients have already received the recommende d vaccinations for some of the components in a combination vaccine, administering the extra antigen(s) in the combination is often permissible if doing so will r educe the number of injections required and if the other components are not contraindicated . To avoid recording errors and ambiguities in the n ames of vaccine combinations, extra care should be taken to record exactly what was giv en. 1 General Recommendations on Immunization, MMWR , January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, No. RR-2 A.

Recommended Vaccine Schedule 1 Dose 1 Dose 2 12-15 months 4-6 years 12-47 months 2 15-12 years 3 48 months and older 3 1 MMRV should only be used when both of the component vaccines (MMR and varicella) are indicated and the child is 12 months through 12 years of age. Routinely recommended ages for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccination are 12 through 15 months of age for dose 1 and 4 through 6 years of age for dose 2. 2 Dose 1 at Ages 12 through 47 Months * For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at ages 12 through 47 months, either MMR and varicella vaccines or MMRV vaccine c an be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benef its and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Compared with use of MMR and varicella vaccines at the same visit, use of MMRV vaccine results in one fewer injection but is assoc iated with a higher risk for fever and febrile seiz ures 5 through 12 days after the first dose among children aged 12 through 23 months* (about one extra febril e seizure for every 2,300-2,600 MMRV vaccine doses). Use of MMR and varicella vaccines avoids this increased risk for fever and febrile seizures follo wing MMRV vaccine. Providers who face barriers to clearly communicating these benefits and risks for any reason (e.g., language barriers) should adminis ter MMR and varicella vaccines. 3 Dose 1 at Ages 48 Months and Older and Dose 2 at any Age For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at ages 48 months and older and for dose 2 at any age (15 months through 12 years), use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vac cines (i.e., MMR and varicella vaccines). Considerations should include provider assessment, patient preference, and the potential for adverse events. * The 47 month cut-off was chosen on the basis of the epidemiology of febrile seizures: first febrile seizures are uncommon after ages 4 years, approxima tely 94% of febrile seizures occur in children aged less than 4 years. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---7/2015 Combination Vaccines 14 Minimum Age and Dose Intervals Dose Mini mum Age Time Interval to Dose 2 1 12 months 3 months Spacing and timing of MMRV from individual componen t vaccines (MMR and varicella): At least 1 month should elapse between a dose of a measles-containing vaccine and a dose of MMRV. At least 3 months should elapse between a dose of varicella vaccine and a dose of MMRV. However, if a 2 nd dose was administered after at least 28 days follo wing the 1 st dose, the 2 nd dose does not need to be repeated. Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously Contraindications A. Contraindications Anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of any of th e vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella) or to the vaccine components Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever Altered immune status due to such things as malign ancy, immunodeficiency, or immunosuppressive therapy Receipt of blood products---consult Appendix A of the listed reference for a table denoting the spacing of live virus vaccines and blo od products. Steroid therapy---doses of systemic prednisone or equivalent at a dose of >2 mg/kg of body weight per day or 20 mg/day Persons receiving ongoing salicylate therapy In persons who develop a rash post-vaccination, th ere is a minimal risk of transmission of vaccine virus to close contacts. Thus, vaccinee s in which vaccine-related rash develops, particularly healthcare workers and house hold contacts of immunocompromised persons, should avoid contact wit h susceptible persons who are at high risk of serious complications. Pregnancy Untreated, active TB MMRV should not be administered to HIV infected pe rsons who are severely immunocompromised. Consult Appendix A of the \"Pink Book,\" 13th edition, for directions on administration of single antigen live virus vaccines to immunocomprom ised persons. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---7/2015 Combination Vaccines 15 B. Precaution A personal or family (i.e., sibling, parent) histor y of seizures is a precaution for MMRV vaccination. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or family history of febrile seizures or family history of epilepsy are at incre ased risk for febrile seizures compared with children who do not have such histories. Children w ith a personal or family history of seizures generally should be vaccinated with MMR and varicel la vaccines because the risks of using MMRV vaccine in this group of children generally ou tweigh the benefit of MMRV vaccine. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration May be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, DTaP, Tdap, is lice nsed for active immunization for prevention of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) and meningococcal serogroups C and Y. MenHibrix\u00ae is approved for use in children 6 weeks of age through 18 months of age. Immunization with MenHibrix does not substitute for routine tetanus immunization. MenHibrix is recommended by ACIP only for infants at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Infants with the following conditions are at incr eased risk of contracting meningococcal disease: persistent complement component deficiencies functional or anatomic asplenia sickle cell disease meningococcal serogroups C or Y disease outbreak e nvironments MenHibrix is a solution for injection supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted with the accompanying vial of saline diluent.

Precaution If Guillain-Barre syndrome has occurred within 6 w eeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, the decision to give any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, including MenHibrix, should be based on considerati on of the potential benefits and possible risks Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with a dministration of injectable vaccines, including MenHibrix. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusions following syncope. Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including MenHibrix, to infants born prematurely should be ba sed on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination.

DTaP Diphtheria and Tetanus and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine is an inactivated vaccine containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and purified inactivated components of Bordetella pertussis cells. DTaP is the recommended substitute for whole-cell DTP but should not be used if DTP has been contraindicated. Combination diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine is no longer available. B. TT Tetanus toxoid is an inactivated bacterial toxoid that may be prescribed for active immunization of persons over age 7 years. It is NOT to be used for the treatment of tetanus infection. F. Other information Single antigen diphtheria toxoid is not available. Diphtheria toxoid is available combined with tetanus as pediatric DT or adult Td, and with tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine as DTaP or Tdap. Use of single antigen tetanus toxoid is not recommended. DTaP and DT vaccines contain similar amounts of tetanus toxoid as adult Td vaccine, but 3-4 times as much diphtheria toxoid as adult Td vaccine.

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards- 5/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 4 Recommended Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis Vaccine Schedule A. DTaP 1, 2, 3 Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine is recommended as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and 4-6 years of age. Regardless of age and timing of doses, no more than a total of 6 DTaP vaccines should be given before 7 years of age. Dose Age Interval4 Primary 1 2 months ----------- Primary 2 4 months 8 weeks after 1st dose Primary 3 6 months 8 weeks after 2nd dose First Booster 15-18 months5,6,11 6-12 months after 3rd dose7,8 Second Booster 4-6 years9, 10 Tdap or Td Booster 11-12 years B. DT If the child begins the series at <1 year of age, follow the schedule outlined above. If the child is 12 months of age at the time the 1st dose of DT is administered, a 2nd dose should be administered 4-8 wks later, followed by a 3rd dose given 6-12 months after the 2nd dose. This completes primary vaccination with DT. A booster dose should be given at 4-6 years of age. C. Tdap use in adolescents and adults- based on ACIP guidelines for use of Tdap in adolescents and the guidelines for use of Tdap in adults. A (one-time dose) is recommended for persons 11 years of age through adulthood, providing they have previously completed the recommended DTP/DTaP/Td series and have not already received a dose of Td: Give in place of Td at the 11-12 year old healthcare visit. For those older adolescents or adults who have not already received a dose of Td. Can be given one time for tetanus prophylaxis in wound management, if a dose of Tdap has not previously been given. Can be used as any one of the 3 doses when administering a primary Td series to a person in the licensed age groups. Adults aged 65 years and older (e.g., grandparents, child-care providers, and health- care practitioners) who have or who anticipate having close contact with an infant less than 12 months of age and who previously have not received Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis and reduce the likelihood of transmission. For other adults aged 65 years and older, a single dose of Tdap vaccine may be given instead of Td vaccine, in persons who have not previously received Tdap. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus- or diphtheria- toxoid containing vaccine. Healthcare personnel (HCP), regardless of age, should receive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap and regardless of the time since the last Td dose. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards- 5/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 5 D. Tdap use in pregnancy ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. A dose of Tdap should be administered during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap. Special situations o Pregnant women due for tetanus booster. If a tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy (i.e., >10 years since previous Td), then Tdap should be administered. o Tdap may be administered any time during pregnancy, but vaccination during the third trimester (between 27 and 36 weeks gestation) would provide the highest concentration of maternal antibodies to be transferred closer to birth o If Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. E. Td (refer to Tdap guidelines above for situations when that vaccine would be recommended instead of a dose of Td.) If administering as a primary series at 7 years of age, give at 0, 1, and 6 months. A Td booster is recommended at any age for persons regardless of interval since the previous dose of any tetanus-containing vaccine. Subsequent boosters are recommended at 10 year intervals. For wound management, give booster if >5 years have elapsed since last dose. F. Use of DTaP, DT, Td, Tdap, and Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG)12 for Wound Management Refer to wound management guidelines in ACIP Manual: \"Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis: Recommendations for Vaccine Use and Other Preventive Measures, \" MMWR, August 8, 1991, pg. 16; \"Preventing Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Among Adolescents: Use of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines,\" MMWR, March 24, 2004, pg. 25. 1 Use diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, adsorbed (DT), if encephalopathy has occurred after administration of a previous dose of pertussis-containing vaccine. 2 ACIP recommends using the same brand of DTaP vaccine for all doses of the series. However, if the brand used for previous doses is not known or not available, use any brand of DTaP to complete the series. 3 Pertussis vaccine given as DTaP is not recommended for children 7 years of age. 4 Prolonging the interval does not require restarting the series. 5 If using Daptacel, this dose is recommended to be given at 17-20 months of age. ( MMWR , July 5, 2002, Vol. 51, No. 26, pp.574.) 6 Pediarix is licensed only for the primary series of 3 doses, not for the booster doses (#4and #5) 7The 4th dose of DTaP may be given as early as 12 months of age, provided 6 months have elapsed since the 3rd dose and if the child is unlikely to return at 15-18 months of age. TriHIBit can be administered as the 4th dose following a primary series with either DTaP or whole-cell DTP and following a primary series with any Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine. 8 DTaP #4 does not need to be repeated if administered 4 months after DTaP #3. 9 A 5th dose is not necessary if the 4th dose was given on or after the 4th birthday. 10 Kinrix is licensed for the booster dose at age 4-6. \u00b9\u00b9 Pentacel is licensed for the primary series and 1st booster dose (Doses 1-4.) \u00b9\u00b2 The state does not supply TIG.

The combined DTaP-HepB-IPV vaccine is approved for the primary series only (Doses 1-3). For adequate immune response, the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given at 24 weeks of age and therefore this combination vaccine should not be administered as a complete primary series on an accelerated schedule at 4 week intervals for prevention of pertussis. 3 The combined DTaP-Hib-IPV vaccine may be used when any component of the combination is indicated, and if the other components are not contraindicated. The combined DTaP-Hib-IPV vaccine is approved for the primary series and first booster dose (Doses 1-4). The combined DTaP-Hib-IPV vaccine is not indicated for children 5 years. 4 The combined DTaP/Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine is indicated for the fourth dose at age 15-18 months. 5 The combined DTaP-IPV vaccine may be used when any component of the combination is indicated, and if the other components are not contraindicated. The combined DTaP-IPV vaccine is approved for the booster dose at age 4-6 years. 6 Tdap is indicated for a single booster dose at age 11 or 12 years if the childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series has been completed. Tdap is preferred over Td as adolescents are susceptible to pertussis due to waning immunity, though Td may be indicated rather than Tdap in special situations (more information is available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtm/rr5503a1.htm?s_cid=rr5503al_e). Adolescents who did not receive Tdap at age 11 or 12 should receive a single dose of Tdap in place of a single Td booster dose. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus of diphtheria containing vaccine. 7 Tdap for Person without a History of DTP or DTaP All adolescents and adults should have documentation of having received a series of DTaP, DTP, DT or Td Persons without documentation should receive a series of 3 vaccinations One dose should be Tdap, preferably the first Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, 13th edition. 8 the ACIP Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Resolution for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC), (Resolution No. 6/11-2) Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 2.

DTaP CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction following a previous dose. Defer further use of this vaccine because of the uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible. However, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons who experience anaphylactic reactions may be referred to an allergist for evaluation and, if specific allergy can be demonstrated, desensitized to tetanus toxoid. Encephalopathy following a previous dose not attributable to another identifiable cause. An acute, severe central nervous system disorder occurring within 7 days after vaccination and generally consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, or generalized or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, without recovery within 24 hours, is a contraindication to further administration of any DTaP-containing vaccine. B. PRECAUTIONS If any of the following events occurs within the specified period after administration of DTaP vaccine, providers and parents should evaluate the risks and benefits of administering subsequent doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine: Temperature of 105\u00b0 F. ( 40.5\u00b0 C.) within 48 hours, not attributable to another identifiable cause. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. Persistent crying lasting 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. II. DT A. CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction. Defer further use of this vaccine because of the uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible. However, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons who experience anaphylactic reactions may be referred to an allergist for evaluation and, if specific allergy can be demonstrated, desensitized to tetanus toxoid.

PRECAUTIONS Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions. These are exaggerated local reactions that present as extensive, painful swelling, often from the shoulder to the elbow. Persons who experience arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions or a temperature of 103\u00b0 F (39.4\u00b0 C.) following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid usually have high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should not be given DT or even emergency doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years, even if they have a wound that is neither clean nor minor. Guillain-Barre\u00b4 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after a previous dose of tetanus toxoid containing vaccines. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. Latex Allergy. III. Tdap A. CONTRAINDICATIONS An immediate anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine containing any of the 3 Tdap components: tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis. Encephalopathy not attributed to another identifiable cause, within 7 days of administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine (this is a contraindication for the pertussis components; Td can be used). B. PRECAUTIONS Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions following a prior dose of a tetanus toxoid Progressive neurological disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy, or progressive encephalopathy until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized. If decision is made to withhold pertussis vaccination, then Td may be used instead of Tdap.

Recommended Schedule & Standards- 5/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis 11 3-J. Inadvertent Administration of Tdap or Pediatric DTaP To help prevent inadvertent administration of Tdap when pediatric DTaP is indicated or pediatric DTaP when Tdap is indicated, vaccine providers should review product labels before administering these vaccines; the packaging might appear similar. Tdap is not indicated for children aged <10 years. Tdap contains lower amounts of diphtheria toxoid and lower amounts of some pertussis antigens compared with pediatric DTaP. Studies of the immune responses to Tdap among infants have not been conducted. Pediatric DTaP is not indicated for persons aged >7 years; the increased diphtheria toxoid content is associated with higher rates of adverse reactions in older persons ( 24-28 ). Guidance on the best approach to vaccination following inadvertent administration of Tdap or pediatric DTaP is based primarily on expert opinion. The family should be informed of any inadvertent vaccine administration. Adverse events associated with inadvertent vaccine administration can be reported to VAERS (see Reporting of Adverse Events after Vaccination). If Tdap is inadvertently administered instead of pediatric DTaP to a child aged <7 years as any one of the first three doses of the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination series, the Tdap dose should not be counted as valid, and a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP should be administered. If the inadvertent administration is discovered while the child is in the office, the pediatric DTaP can be administered during the same visit. If the child has left the office, some experts suggest administering the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP within approximately 72 hours, or administering it 4 weeks later to optimize the child's immune response to the antigens in pediatric DTaP. This practice helps ensure that the child stays on the primary series schedule and has adequate protection against diphtheria and pertussis. However, the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP can be administered as soon as feasible at any interval after the inadvertent Tdap dose. The remaining doses of the pediatric DTaP series should be administered on the routine schedule, with at least a 4 week interval between the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP and the next dose of pediatric DTaP. For example, if an 8-week week old infant inadvertently received a dose of Tdap instead of the first dose of pediatric DTaP and does not receive a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP within about 72 hours, a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP can be administered 4 weeks after the inadvertent Tdap dose (age 12 weeks). The routine schedule of pediatric DTaP can then be resumed 4 weeks after the pediatric DTaP replacement dose (age 16 weeks) with the other recommended vaccines ( 1,23). If Tdap is inadvertently administered as the fourth or the fifth dose in the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination series to a child aged <7 years, the Tdap dose should be counted as valid and does not need to be repeated; the child who received Tdap as a fourth dose should complete the pediatric DTaP schedule (23). The routine adolescent Tdap vaccination recommendations would apply when this child becomes an adolescent. For example, a child who inadvertently receives Tdap at age 5 years instead of the fifth dose of pediatric DTaP should receive a second dose of Tdap at age 11-12 years. If Tdap or pediatric DTaP is inadvertently administered to a child aged 7-9 years instead of Td as part of catch-up vaccination or for wound management, this dose can be counted as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive an adolescent booster dose of Tdap according to the interval guidance used for Td to Tdap (see Routine Tdap Vaccination [section 1-A] and Pertussis Outbreaks and Other Settings with Increased Risk for Pertussis or its Complications [section 3-C]). In either case, the child should receive a dose of vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids no longer than 10 years after the inadvertent Tdap or pediatric DTaP dose or according to the guidance for catch-up vaccination (Appendix E). If pediatric DTaP is inadvertently administered to an adolescent aged 11-18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. The adolescent should receive the next dose of a vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids 10 years after the inadvertent pediatric DTaP dose or according to the guidance for catch-up vaccination (Appendix D).* * This page excerpted from \"Preventing Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Among Adolescents: Use of Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines,\" MMWR , March 24, 2006, Vol. 55, No. RR-3, pg. 27.

Children who are not vaccinated by age 2 years can be vaccinated at subsequent visits. States, counties, and communities with existing hepatitis A vaccination programs for children aged 2-18 years are encouraged to maintain these programs. Recommendations for persons who are at increased risk of infection: Persons traveling to developing countries which have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A Men who have sex with men (MSM) Users of injecting and non-injecting illegal drugs Persons who have clotting factor disorders Food handlers: may be considered based on local epidemiology Persons with chronic liver disease Close personal contacts of children adopted from countries with high rates of hepatitis A Virus (HAV) \u00b9 Although hepatitis A may occur in other groups or settings, serologic surveys have not found that they are at increased risk for hepatitis A because of their occupation or setting, and are therefore not routinely recommended to receive vaccine.2 These would include: Child care centers, employees or attendees Health-care workers Sewage plants or sanitation workers \u00b9 \"Updated Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization (ACIP) for use of Hepatitis A Vaccine in Close Contacts of Newly Arriving International Adoptees,\" MMWR, September 18, 2009, Vol. 58.

If the interval between the first and booster doses of hepatitis A vaccine is longer than the recommended interval of 6-18 months, it is not necessary to repeat the first dose. For both vaccines, the booster dose given should be based on the person's age at the time of the booster dose, not the age when the first dose was given. For example, if a child received the first dose of the pediatric formulation of VAQTA at 18 years of age, and returns for the booster dose at age 19 years, the booster dose should be the adult formulation, not the pediatric formulation .

Recommended Schedule and Standards\u20147/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 4 Contraindications and Precautions to Vaccine1 Contraindications: 1. Allergy to any vaccine component. (For a complete listing of components, see package insert.) 2. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever Precautions: 1. Pregnancy. The safety of hepatitis A vaccination given during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because hepatitis A vaccine is produced from inactivated HAV, the theoretical risk to the developing fetus is expected to be low. The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in women who may be at high risk for exposure to HAV. 1For Twinrix\u00ae Contraindications and Precautions see \"Combination Vaccine Guidelines\" in this section. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration Hepatitis A vaccine may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, A Immunoprophylaxis (see January 2, 2008 Memorandum, \"New Policy for Hepatitis A Postexposure Prophylaxis\" located at the end of these guidelines) A. Immune Globulin (IG) Hepatitis A Immunoprophylaxis with Immune Globulin (IG) is routinely recommended in 2 situations: 1. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for international travel; and 2. Post-exposure prophylaxis for persons <12 months of age or >40 years of age who are contacts to acute cases of hepatitis A The provision of IG is available from the Epidemiology Branch for hepatitis A postexposure prophylaxis. The State Office of Pharmacy no longer stocks an IG supply. To obtain IG for this purpose, contact: 1. The appropriate designated district epidemiology personnel; and 2. Hepatitis epidemiology staff in the state office at (404) 657-3158 or (404) 657-2588. (When calling to request IG, please have on hand the necessary information regarding name of hepatitis A case and number of contacts, with some descriptive information [i.e., ages].) Supplies of IG given for pre-exposure prophylaxis, i.e. international travel, should be purchased by districts. The guidelines below are only a minimum reference and any decision to use IG should be prefaced by further research using available resources, including medical providers. For more specific information, please see Chapter 6, \"Surveillance and Reporting\" in this manual, the ACIP Hepatitis A statement and the 2012 Red Book references cited in the opening paragraph of \"Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A.\" Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards\u20147/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 5 Pre-exposure Prophylaxis For persons traveling to certain parts of the world where hepatitis A has high or intermediate endemicity, immunoprophylaxis is indicated. For persons 1 years of age, vaccine is preferable over IG. However, for children under 1 year of age, and for those whose travel plans are imminent and therefore do not allow enough time for vaccine to provide adequate protection, IG may be the better choice. (Not supplied by the State) Post-exposure Prophylaxis for persons <12 months of age or >40 years of age Household and sexual contacts of persons with acute hepatitis A. Administration of IG should take place within 2 weeks of most recent exposure, and is not indicated if that period of time has already elapsed. IG should be administered as age appropriate to all previously unvaccinated staff and attendees of child care centers or homes if 1) one or more cases of hepatitis A are recognized in children or employees, or 2) cases are recognized in two or more households of center attendees. If a food handler is diagnosed with hepatitis A, IG should be administered to other food handlers at the same establishment. In the event of a common-source outbreak, IG should NOT be administered to exposed patrons after cases have begun to occur because the 2-week period during which IG is effective will have been exceeded. For children aged <12 months, immunocompromised persons, persons who have had chronic liver disease diagnosed, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated, IG should be used. NOTE: IG would not routinely be recommended for: School settings, unless transmission within the school is documented. Hospital personnel caring for patients with hepatitis A disease, unless an outbreak among patients or between patients and staff is documented B. Hepatitis A Vaccine1,2 For healthy persons ages 12 months through 40 years, single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred to IG for post-exposure prophylaxis to hepatitis A infection because of vaccine advantages that include long-term protection and ease of administration. For person over 40 years of age, IG is preferred; vaccine can be used if IG cannot be obtained. 1 \"Update: Prevention of Hepatitis A After Exposure to Hepatitis A Virus and in International Travelers,\" MMWR , October 19. 2007, Vol. 56, No. 41 2 See pages 1-5 of the Hepatitis A guidelines for the recommended schedule, minimum intervals, and contraindications and precautions for hepatitis A vaccine.

Ordinarily, no more than 5 mL should be administered in 1 site in an adult or large child; lesser amounts (maximum 3 mL) should be given to small children and infants in one site. Contraindications and Precautions to IG Contraindications: 1. Persons with IgA deficiency. Anaphylaxis has been reported after repeated administration of IG to these persons. 2. Pregnancy or lactation is NOT a contraindication to IG use. Precautions: 1. IG can interfere with the response to live injected vaccines, such as MMR, varicella, and LAIV. Administration of live vaccines should be delayed for at least 3 months after administration of IG (See Table 4 of ACIP \"General Recommendations on Immunization\" for more specific guidelines.) 2. Unless the benefits of IG prophylaxis exceed the benefits of vaccination, IG should not be administered for 2 weeks after measles-, mumps-, and rubella-containing vaccines, and for 3 weeks after vaccination with varicella vaccine. If IG is given during this period, the person should be revaccinated with the live vaccine, but not sooner than 3 months after administration of IG. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards\u20147/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 7 Simultaneous Administration of IG with Vaccines Immune Globulin does not interfere in general with inactivated vaccines or to yellow fever vaccine. It may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, Hib, hepatitis PPSV23, HPV, MCV4, MPSV4. Seroconversion rates are not impaired by simultaneous administration of IG with the first dose of Hepatitis A vaccine, but lower serum antibody concentrations may be achieved. This decreased immunogenicity is not likely to be clinically important.

Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or to treat ongoing PHN. Vaccination of Persons who have received Varicella Vaccine Zoster vaccination is not recommended for persons of any age who have received varicella vaccine. However, health-care providers do not need to inquire about varicella vaccination history before administrating zoster vaccine because virtually all persons currently or soon to be in the recommended age group have not received varicella vaccine. In the United States, varicella vaccination began in 1995. Since that time, few adults aged 40 years would have been susceptible to varicella and thus eligible to receive varicella vaccine. The number of persons eligible for zoster vaccine who have received varicella vaccine is extremely small and will remain so for at least a decade.

HPV typ es 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer. Types 6 and 11 cause approxima tely 90% of genital wart cases. This product does not contain a preservative or ant ibiotics. After thorough agitation, it is a white, cloudy liquid. Gardasil 9 is a non-infectious 9-valent vaccine whi ch contains HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. 9vHPV targets five addi tional cancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 9vHPV ca n be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not comp leted the 3-dose series.

Recommended Schedule and Standards---7/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Human Papillomavirus Infection 2 and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously Cervarix \u00ae is a Human papillomavirus bivalent (types 16 and 1 8) vaccine, recombinant] for the prevention of cervical pre-cancers and cervical cancer associated with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 for use in girls and young women (aged 10- 25). It is important to emphasize these points: Females should continue to have routine cervical c ancer screening as recommended by their healthcare provider. Females do not need to get an HPV test or Pap test before receiving vaccine. If the person is already infected, the tests cannot tell w hich type of HPV she has. There are many types of HPV and vaccination would provide protection against infection with those types not already acquired. The vaccine will not have a therapeutic effect on e xisting HPV infection, genital warts or cervical lesions. There is no ACIP recommendation for additional 9-va lent HPV vaccine doses for persons who started the series with quadrivalen t or bivalent HPV vaccine and completed the series with 9-valent HPV vaccine.

Recommended Schedule and Standards 8/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Influenza Considerations for the Use of Live Attenuated Influ enza Vaccine and Inactivated Influenza Vaccine When Either is Available for 2015 -16, ACIP recommends the following: 1. All persons aged 6 months should receive influenza vaccine annually. Influenza vaccination should not be delayed to proc ure a specific vaccine preparation if an appropriate one is already availa ble. 2. For healthy children aged 2 through 8 years who have no contraindications or precautions, either LAIV or IIV is an appropriate o ption. No preference is expressed for LAIV or IIV for any person aged 2 thr ough 49 years for whom either vaccine is appropriate. An age-appropriate f ormulation of vaccine should be used. 3. LAIV should not be used in the following populat ions: Persons aged <2 years or >49 years; contraindications listed in the packag e insert: /square4 Children aged 2 through 17 years who are receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products; /square4 Persons who have experienced severe allergic reacti ons to the vaccine or any of its components, or to a pr evious dose of any influenza vaccine; not been studied in immunocompromised persons. Persons with a history of egg allergy Children aged 2 through 4 years who have asthma or who have had a wheezing episode noted in the medical record with in the past 12 months, or for whom parents report that a health ca re provider stated that they had wheezing or asthma within the last 12 months (Table, footnote). For persons of any age with asth ma might be at increased risk for wheezing after administration of LAIV 4. In addition to the groups for whom LAIV is not recommended above, the LAIV package insert indicates that persons of any a ge with asthma might be at increased risk for wheezing after administrati on of LAIV . The package insert also notes that the safety of LAIV in persons with other underlying medical conditions that might predispose them to compl ications after wild-type influenza virus infection (e.g., chronic [including diabetes mellitus]), has not been established. These conditions, in addition to asthma in persons a ged 5 years, should be considered precautions for the use of LAIV. 5. Persons who care for severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protective environment should not receive LAIV, or should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after receipt, given the theoretical risk for transmissi on of the live attenuated vaccin e virus to close contacts.

The two prev ious doses need not have been given during the same season or consecutive seasons. Chil dren in this age group who have not previously received a total of 2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vacc ine before July 1, 2015 require 2 doses for 2015-16.

Recommended Schedule and Standards 8/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Influenza Influenza Vaccination of Persons With a History of Egg Allergy For the 2015-16 influenza season ACIP recommends the following: 1. Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Because re latively few data are available for use of LAIV in this setting, IIV or trivalent recom binant influenza vaccine (RIV3) should be used. RIV3 may be used for persons aged 18 years who have no other contraindications. However, IIV (egg- or cell cultu re-based) may also be used, with the following additional safety measures (Figure 2): Vaccine should be administered by a health care pr ovider who is familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy; and Vaccine recipients should be observed for 30 minutes for signs of a reaction after administration of each vaccine dose. 2. Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving such symptoms as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical i ntervention, may receive RIV3 if they are aged 18 years and there are no other contraindications. If RIV3 is not available or the recipient is not within the indica ted age range, IIV should be administered by a physician with experience in the recognition and management of severe allergic conditions (Figure 2). 3. Regardless of allergy history, all vaccines sho uld be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment for rapid recognition and t reatment of anaphylaxis are available. 4. Persons who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic. Egg-allergic persons m ight tolerate egg in baked products (e.g., bread or cake). Tolerance to egg-containing foods does not exclude the possibility of egg allergy. Egg allergy can be conf irmed by a consistent medical history of adverse reactions to eggs and egg-containing foo ds, plus skin and/or blood testing for immunoglobulin E directed against egg proteins. 5. For persons with no known history of exposure to egg, but who are suspected of being egg-allergic on the basis of previously performed a llergy testing, consultation with a physician with expertise in the management of aller gic conditions should be obtained before vaccination (Figure 2). Alternatively, RIV3 may be administered if the recipient is aged 18 years. 6. A previous severe allergic reaction to influenz a vaccine, regardless of the component suspected of being responsible for the reaction, is a contraindication to future receipt of the vaccine .

Moderate or severe illness with or without fever 3. Pregnancy - Because of the theoretical risk to t he fetus, women of childbearing age should receive MMR or its component vaccines only i f they state they are not pregnant and are counseled not to become pregnant for 4 week s after vaccination. However, MMR or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccination inadv ertently given during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to consider inter ruption of pregnancy. 4. Known altered immunocompetence - Replication of vac cine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune deficiency diseases and in p ersons with immunosuppression. Severe immunosuppression may be caused by many dise ase conditions (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, hematol ogic or generalized malignancy) and by therapy with immunosuppressive agents, inclu ding large doses of corticosteroids. The degree to which affected perso ns are immunocompromised can depend on the disease, its severity, and the treatm ent stage. Ultimately, the patient's physician must assume responsibility for determinin g whether the patient is severely immuno-compromised based on clinical and laboratory assessment. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards--- 3/2016 Vaccines to Prevent Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 5 Contraindications and Precautions (cont'd) B. Precautions 1. Thrombocytopenia---Persons who have an episode o f thrombocytopenic purpura within 6 weeks of vaccination with MMR should weigh the risk versus the benefit of receiving a 2 nd dose. Serologic testing of immunity should be con sidered in lieu of MMR vaccination. 2. Recent receipt of blood, plasma, or immune globu lin (in past 3-11 months) --- Blood and other antibody containing blood products, inclu ding immune globulin (IG) preparations, can diminish the immune response to M MR or its individual component vaccines. MMR or its component vaccines should be given at least 2 weeks before administration of an immune globulin or blood or bl ood-containing product or deferred until 3 or more months after administration of such preparations. (See Table 4 in this chapter for more specific guidelines regarding the time to wait before administering vaccine.) 3. Tuberculin skin tests --- MMR vaccine may interf ere with the response to a tuberculin test.

These guidelines are meant to provide information f or those districts and clinics that administer this vaccine using privately purchased stock. ACIP Recommendations for Administration of MPSV4 ACIP recommends that MPSV4 should be used for adult s age 56 and older who are at risk for meningococcal disease. For adults who have received MenACWY previously, li mited data demonstrate a higher antibody response after a subs equent dose of MenACWY compared with a subsequent dose of MPSV4. For menin gococcal vaccine-na\u00efve persons aged 56 years who anticipate requiring a single dose of meningococcal vaccine (e.g., travelers and persons at risk as a result of a comm unity outbreak), MPSV4 is preferred. For persons now aged 56 years who were vaccinated previously with MenACW Y and are recommended for revaccination or for whom multi ple doses are anticipated (e.g., persons with asplenia amd microbiologists), MenACWY is preferred. The following high risk populations in that age group are recommended to be vaccinated with MPSV4, if not vaccinated previously with MenACWY: Persons who are traveling to countries in which N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local po pulation will be prolonged Persons with terminal complement deficiencies and t hose with anatomic or functional asplenia Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory pers onnel who routinely are exposed to N. meningitidis in solutions that may be aerosolized Persons who might have been exposed to meningococc al disease during an outbreak Revaccination: Persons who previously were vaccinated with MPSV4 at age 7 years and are at prolonged increased risk should be revaccinated 5 y ears after their previous meningococcal vaccine with MCV4. Persons who previo usly were vaccinated at ages 2 months --6 years and are at prolonged increased risk shoul d be revaccinated 3 years after their previous meningococcal vaccine with MCV 4. Persons at prolonged increased risk for meningococcal disease include 1) persons with incre ased susceptibility such as persistent complement component deficiencies (e.g., C3, properdin, Factor D, and late complement component deficiencies), 2) persons with anatomic or functional asplenia, and 3) persons who have prolonged exposure (e.g., m icrobiologists routinely working with Neisseria meningitidis, or travelers to or resident s of countries where meningococcal Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2.

Vaccine Description Trivalent oral polio vaccine was the vaccine of choice in the U.S. from the time it was licensed in 1963. Since wild virus-induced paralytic polio was essentially eliminated in the western hemisphere by 1979, vaccine-induced paralytic polio (VAPP) became the greater risk. Therefore, in order to further the goal of eliminating any paralytic polio in the U.S., the ACIP recommended that inactivated polio vaccine be used exclusively, beginning in 2000. Oral polio vaccine is no longer available in the U.S. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced in the U.S. in 1955 but was largely replaced by OPV in the 1960's. Enhanced-potency IPV (e-IPV) was licensed in 1987 and is now the preferred polio vaccine.

However, vaccination should not be deferred because the product used for a previous dose(s) is not available or unknown. Continue or complete the series with product available. NOTE: Infants who have had rotavirus gastroenteritis befo re receiving the full course of rotavirus vaccinations should still initiate or com plete the 3-dose schedule because the initial infection frequently provides only partial immunity .

Moderate to severe illness---vaccinate infants a s soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. 3. Preexisting chronic gastrointestinal disease---p roviders should consider the potential risks and benefits of administering this vaccine to infants with this preexisting condition. Infants with short-gut syndrome, or persistent vomiting of unknown cause) and not undergoing immunosuppressive therapy should benefit from rotav irus vaccination and the benefits outweigh the theoretical risks. 4. Intussusception---the current rotavirus vaccine has shown no evidence of an association with intussusception. However, additio nal post-licensure surveillance data are required to confirm that the vaccine is not associated with intussusception. Until post-licensure data on safety of rotavirus vaccine are available, the risks and benefits of vaccinatio n should be considered when vaccinating infants with a previous episode of intussusception. Until further safety data is available, vaccination of th ese infants with rotavirus vaccine should be delayed. 5. Altered immunocompetence---providers should cons ider the potential risks and benefits of administering rotavirus vaccine in this situation. Shedding of the vaccine virus may be possible, particularly after administr ation of the first dose. Caution is advised when considering whether to administer rota virus vaccine to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts. No safety or efficacy data are available for the administration of this vaccine to infants who a re potentially immunocompromised including: a. Infants with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphom as of any type or other malignant neoplasms b. Infants on immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose systemic corticosteroids) c. Infants with primary and acquired immunodeficien cy states d. Infants who are HIV-exposed or infected. However , two considerations support vaccination of HIV-exposed or infected infa nts: first, the HIV diagnosis might not be established in infants born to HIV-infected mothers before the age of the first rotavirus vaccine and s econd, vaccine strains of rotavirus are considerably attenuated.

Moderate or severe illnesses with or w ithout fever Varicella vaccine can be administered to persons with minor illness, such as diarrhea; mild upper respiratory tract infection, with or without low grade fever; or other illnesses with low grade fever. Persons wi th an illness associated with a moderate or severe fever should be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Although no data exist as to whether varicella or live varicella virus vaccine exacerbates tubercul osis, vaccination is not recommended for persons who have untreated, active tuberculosis . Tuberculin skin testing is not a prerequisite for varicella vaccinatio n. 3. Altered immune status Altered immune status due to: a malignant conditi on (blood dyscrasia, leukemia, 1 lymphoma, or other neoplasms affecting the bone m arrow or lymphatic system); primary or acquired immune deficiency, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other clinical manifestations of HIV infection, cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia, and dy sgammaglobulinemia; family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficienc y, unless immune competence of possible vaccine recipient is demonstrated; and i ndividuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy. See ACIP statement ci ted in the opening paragraph of \"Vaccines to Prevent Varicella.\" 4. Receipt of blood products Varicella virus vaccine should not be given for at least 5 months after receipt of blood (except washed red blood cells) or plasma transfus ions, Immune Globulin (IG), or Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG). In additi on, IG and VZIG should not be administered for 3 weeks after vaccination unless the benefits of receiving the IG or VZIG exceed the benefits of vaccination. 5. Steroid therapy Receiving doses of systemic prednisone or its equi valent at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight per day or 20 mg/day. 6. Exposure of immunocompromised persons t o vaccinees In persons who develop a rash post-vaccination, th ere is a minimal risk of transmission of vaccine virus to close contacts. Thus, vaccine es in whom vaccine-related rash develops, particularly health care workers and hou sehold contacts of immunocompromised persons, should avoid contact wi th susceptible persons who are at high risk of serious complications. 7. Salicylates Due to the association between wild varicella zoste r infection, salicylates, and Reye syndrome, if feasible, vaccine recipients should a void using salicylates for 6 weeks after receiving varicella virus vaccine. Vaccination wi th subsequent close monitoring should be considered for children who have conditions req uiring therapeutic aspirin because the risk for serious complications associated with aspirin is likely to be greater in children in whom natural varicella disease develop s than in children who receive the vaccine containing attenuated varicella zoster vir us.

Pregnancy Theoretically, it is best not to administer varicel la vaccine to pregnant women. Woman who are not pregnant but are of childbearing age wh o receive the vaccine should be advised not to become pregnant for at least 1 month after each injection. Merck and the CDC have established a hotline to monitor the m aternal/fetal outcomes of women who are vaccinated with varicella 3 months before o r at any time during the pregnancy. The phone number is (800) 986-8999. 9. Nursing mothers Whether attenuated varicella (VZV) vaccine is excre ted in human milk and, if so, whether the infant could be infected, are not known. Most live vaccines have not been demonstrated to be secreted in human milk. Therefo re, varicella vaccine may be considered for a nursing mother. 1 Except under research protocol Note: A prior history of chicken pox is not a contraindic ation to varicella vaccination. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration Varicella vaccine may be administered simultaneousl y with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, MMR, Hib, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis PPSV23, Influenza, HPV, MPSV4 and MCV4 Tuberculin Skin Testing: While no data are availab le regarding the effect of varicella vaccination on tuberculin reactivity, it is prudent to apply th e same precautions as with MMR when using the varicella vaccine. See guidelines for simultaneous tuberculin skin testing (TST) and the administration of live virus vaccines in the ACIP s tatement, \"General Recommendations on Immunization,\" MMWR , January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, RR-2, page 24. CDC Recommendations for Use of VariZIG- varicella z oster immune globulin The decision to administer VariZIG depends on three factors: 1) Whether the patient lacks evidence of immunity to varicella, 2) Whether the exposure is likely to result in in fection, and 3) Whether the patient is at greater risk for var icella complications than the general population. For high-risk patients who have additional exposure s to varicella-zoster virus 3 weeks after initial VariZIG administration, another dose of VariZIG should be considered. Timing of VariZIG administration CDC recommends administration of VariZIG as soon as possible after exposure to Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---6/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 7 varicella -zoster virus and within 10 days. Patient groups for whom VariZIG is recommended Immunocompromised patients without evidence of immunity. Newborn infants whose mothers have signs and sy mptoms of varicella around the time of delivery (i.e., 5 days before to 2 days after). Hospitalized premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh 1,000 g at birth, regardless of their mothers' evid ence of immunity to varicella. Pregnant women without evidence of immunity. VariZIG Administration VariZIG is supplied in 125-IU vials and should be a dministered intramuscularly as directed by the manufacturer. The recommended dose is 125 IU/10 kg of body weight, up to a maximum of 625 IU (five vials). The minimum dose is 62.5 IU (0.5 vial) for patients weighing 2.0 kg and 125 IU (one vial) for patients weighing 2.1- 10.0 kg Patients who become eligible for vaccination, varic ella vaccine should be administered 5 months after VariZIG administration. Because vari cella zoster immune globulin might prolong the incubation period by 1 week, any patient who receives VariZIG should be observed closely for sig ns and symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure. Contraindications History of anaphylactic or severe systemic reac tions to human immune globulins and IgA-deficient patients with antibodie s against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity How to Obtain VariZIG VariZIG can be ordered from the exclusive U.S. dist ributor, FFF Enterprises (Temecula, California) (telephone, 800-843-7477; on line at http://www.fffenterprises.comExternal Web Site Icon ).

Additional information For contraindications and precautions to use of a vaccine and for additional information regarding that vaccine, vaccination providers should consult the relevant ACIP statement available online at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . For purposes of calculating intervals between doses, 4 weeks = 28 days. Intervals of 4 months or greater are determined by calendar months. Vaccine doses administered 4 days or less before the minimum interval are considered valid. Doses of any vaccine administered 5 days earlier than the minimum interval or minimum age should not be counted as valid doses and should be repeated as age-appropriate. The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by the recommended minimum interval.

Red Book: 2015 report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases. 30th ed. Elk Grove Village, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics. 1. Hepa titis B (HepB) vaccine. (Minimum age: birth) Routine vaccination: At birth: Administer monovalent HepB vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge. For infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers, administer HepB vaccine and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. These infants should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) at age 9 through 18 months (preferably at the next well-child visit) or 1 to 2 months after completion of the HepB series if the series was delayed; CDC recently recommended testing occur at age 9 through 12 months; see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6439a6.htm. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, within 12 hours of birth administer HepB vaccine regardless of birth weight. For infants weighing less than 2,000 grams, administer HBIG in addition to HepB vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if mother is HBsAg-positive, also administer HBIG for infants weighing 2,000 grams or more as soon as possible, but no later than age 7 days. Doses following the birth dose: The second dose should be administered at age 1 or 2 months. Monovalent HepB vaccine should be used for doses administered before age 6 weeks. Infants who did not receive a birth dose should receive 3 doses of a HepB-containing vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1 to 2 months, and 6 months starting as soon as feasible. See Figure 2. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks), administer the third dose at least 8 weeks after the second dose AND at least 16 weeks after the first dose. The final (third or fourth) dose in the HepB vaccine series should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks. Administration of a total of 4 doses of HepB vaccine is permitted when a combination vaccine containing HepB is administered after the birth dose. Catch-up vaccination: Unvaccinated persons should complete a 3-dose series. A 2-dose series (doses separated by at least 4 months) of adult formulation Recombivax HB is licensed for use in children aged 11 through 15 years. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 2. Rota virus (RV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for both RV1 [Rotarix] and RV5 [RotaTeq]) Routine vaccination: Administer a series of RV vaccine to all infants as follows: 1. If Rotarix is used, administer a 2-dose series at 2 and 4 months of age. 2. If RotaTeq is used, administer a 3-dose series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. 3. If any dose in the series was RotaTeq or vaccine product is unknown for any dose in the series, a total of 3 doses of RV vaccine should be administered. Catch-up vaccination: The maximum age for the first dose in the series is 14 weeks, 6 days; vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged 15 weeks, 0 days or older. The maximum age for the final dose in the series is 8 months, 0 days. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 3. Diph theria and tetanus toxoids and acellular Quadracel]: years) Routine vaccination: Administer a 5-dose series of DTaP vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The fourth dose may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. Inadvertent administration of 4th DTaP dose early: If the fourth dose of DTaP was administered at least 4 months, but less than 6 months, after the third dose of DTaP , it need not be repeated.3. Diph theria and acellular pertussis (cont'd) Catch-up vaccination: The fifth dose of DTaP vaccine is not necessary if the fourth dose was administered at age 4 years or older. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 4. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine. (Minimum Routine vaccination: Administer a 2- or 3-dose Hib vaccine primary series and a booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) at age 12 through 15 months to complete a full Hib vaccine series. The primary series with ActHIB, MenHibrix, or Pentacel consists of 3 doses and should be administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The primary series with PedvaxHib or COMVAX consists of 2 doses and should be administered at 2 and 4 months of age; a dose at age 6 months is not indicated. One booster dose (dose 3 or 4 depending on vaccine used in primary series) of any Hib vaccine should be administered at age 12 through 15 months. An exception is Hiberix vaccine. Hiberix should only be used for the booster (final) dose in children aged 12 months through 4 years who have received at least 1 prior dose of Hib-containing vaccine. For recommendations on the use of MenHibrix in patients at increased risk for meningococcal disease, please refer to the meningococcal vaccine footnotes and also to MMWR February 28, 2014 / 63(RR01);1-13, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr6301.pdf . Catch-up vaccination: If dose 1 was administered at ages 12 through 14 months, administer a second (final) dose at least 8 weeks after dose 1, regardless of Hib vaccine used in the primary series. If both doses were PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB or COMVAX), and were administered before the first birthday, the third (and final) dose should be administered at age 12 through 59 months and at least 8 weeks after the second dose. If the first dose was administered at age 7 through 11 months, administer the second dose at least 4 weeks later and a third (and final) dose at age 12 through 15 months or 8 weeks after second dose, whichever is later. If first dose is administered before the first birthday and second dose administered at younger than 15 months, a third (and final) dose should be administered 8 weeks later. For unvaccinated children aged 15 months or older, administer only 1 dose. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. For catch-up guidance related to MenHibrix, please see the meningococcal vaccine footnotes and also MMWR February 28, 2014 / 63(RR01);1-13, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr6301.pdf . Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions: Children aged 12 through 59 months who are at increased risk for Hib disease, including chemotherapy recipients and those with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ) infection, immunoglobulin deficiency, or early component complement deficiency, who have received either no doses or only 1 dose of Hib vaccine before 12 months of age, should receive 2 additional doses of Hib vaccine 8 weeks apart; children who received 2 or more doses of Hib vaccine before 12 months of age should receive 1 additional dose. For patients younger than 5 years of age undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment who received a Hib vaccine dose(s) within 14 days of starting therapy or during therapy, repeat the dose(s) at least 3 months following therapy completion. Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) should be revaccinated with a 3-dose regimen of Hib vaccine starting 6 to 12 months after successful transplant, regardless of vaccination history; doses should be administered at least 4 weeks apart. A single dose of any Hib-containing vaccine should be administered to unimmunized* children and adolescents 15 months of age and older undergoing an elective splenectomy; if possible, vaccine should be administered at least 14 days before procedure.4. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (cont'd) Hib vaccine is not routinely recommended for patients 5 years or older. However, 1 dose of Hib vaccine should be administered to unimmunized* persons aged 5 years or older who have anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease) and unvaccinated persons 5 through 18 years of age with HIV infection. * Patients who have not received a primary series and booster dose or at least 1 dose of Hib vaccine after 14 months of age are considered unimmunized. 5. P neumococcal vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for PCV13, 2 years for PPSV23) Routine vaccination with PCV13: Administer a 4-dose series of PCV13 vaccine at ages 2, 4, and 6 months and at age 12 through 15 months. For children aged 14 through 59 months who have received an age-appropriate series of 7-valent PCV (PCV7), administer a single of 13-valent PCV (PCV13). Catch-up vaccination with PCV13: Administer 1 dose of PCV13 to all healthy children aged 24 through 59 months who are not completely vaccinated for their age. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions with PCV13 and PPSV23: All recommended PCV13 doses should be administered prior to PPSV23 vaccination if possible. For children 2 through 5 years of age with any of the following conditions: chronic heart disease (particularly cyanotic congenital heart disease and cardiac failure); chronic lung disease (including asthma if treated with high-dose corticosteroid therapy); diabetes mellitus; cerebrospinal asplenia; HIV infection; chronic renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; diseases associated with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, and Hodgkin disease; solid organ transplantation; or congenital immunodeficiency: 1. Administer 1 dose of PCV13 if any incomplete schedule of 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) were received previously. 2. Administer 2 doses of PCV13 at least 8 weeks apart if unvaccinated or any incomplete schedule of fewer than 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) were received previously. 3. Administer 1 supplemental dose of PCV13 if 4 doses of PCV7 or other age-appropriate complete PCV7 series was received previously. 4. The minimum interval between doses of PCV (PCV7 or PCV13) is 8 weeks. 5. For children with no history of PPSV23 vaccination, administer PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PCV13. For children aged 6 through 18 years who have cerebrospinal fluid leak; cochlear implant; sickle cell disease and functional asplenia; congenital chronic renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; diseases associated with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, and Hodgkin disease; generalized malignancy; solid organ or multiple myeloma: 1. If neither PCV13 nor PPSV23 has been received previously, administer 1 dose of PCV13 now and 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks later. 2. If PCV13 has been received previously but PPSV23 has not, administer 1 dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PCV13. 3. If PPSV23 has been received but PCV13 has not, administer 1 dose of PCV13 at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of PPSV23. For children aged 6 through 18 years with chronic heart disease (particularly cyanotic congenital heart disease and cardiac failure), chronic lung disease (including asthma if treated with high-dose oral corticosteroid therapy), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, or chronic liver disease, who have not received PPSV23, administer 1 dose of PPSV23. If PCV13 has been received previously, then PPSV23 should be administered at least 8 weeks after any prior PCV13 dose. A single revaccination with PPSV23 should be administered 5 years after the first dose to children with sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies; anatomic or functional asplenia; congenital chronic renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; diseases associated with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or radiation therapy, including malignant neoplasms, leukemias, lymphomas, and Hodgkin disease; generalized malignancy; myeloma. 6. I nactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) Routine vaccination: Administer a 4-dose series of IPV at ages 2, 4, 6 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. Catch-up vaccination: In the first 6 months of life, minimum age and minimum intervals are only recommended if the person is at risk of imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (i.e., travel to a polio-endemic region or during an outbreak). If 4 or more doses are administered before age 4 years, an additional dose should be administered at age 4 through 6 years and at least 6 months after the previous dose. A fourth dose is not necessary if the third dose was administered at age 4 years or older and at least 6 months after the previous dose.6. I nactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) (cont'd) If both OPV and IPV were administered as part of a series, a total of 4 doses should be administered, regardless of the child's current age. If only OPV were administered, and all doses were given prior to 4 years of age, one dose of IPV should be given at 4 years or older, at least 4 weeks after the last OPV dose. IPV is not routinely recommended for U.S. residents aged 18 years or older. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 7. I nfluenza vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 months for inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV], 2 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) Routine vaccination: Administer influenza vaccine annually to all children beginning at age 6 months. For most healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2 through 49 years, either LAIV or IIV may be used. However, LAIV should NOT be administered to some persons, including 1) persons who have experienced severe allergic reactions to LAIV, any of its components, or to a previous dose of any other influenza vaccine; 2) children 2 through 17 years receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products; 3) persons who are allergic to eggs; 4) pregnant women; 5) immunosuppressed persons; 6) children 2 through 4 years of age with asthma or who had wheezing in the past 12 months; or 7) persons who have taken influenza antiviral medications in the previous 48 hours. For all other contraindications and precautions to use of LAIV, see MMWR August 7, 2015 / 64(30):818-25 available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6430.pdf . For children aged 6 months through 8 years : For the 2015-16 season, administer 2 doses (separated by at least 4 weeks) to children who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time. Some children in this age group who have been vaccinated previously will also need 2 doses. For additional guidance, follow dosing guidelines in the 2015-16 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations, MMWR August 7, 2015 / 64(30):818-25, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6430.pdf . For the 2016-17 season, follow dosing guidelines in the 2016 ACIP influenza vaccine recommendations. For persons aged 9 years and older: Administer 1 dose. 8. M easles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months for routine vaccination) Routine vaccination: Administer a 2-dose series of MMR vaccine at ages 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since the first dose. Administer 1 dose of MMR vaccine to infants aged 6 through 11 months before departure from the United States for international travel. These children should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the first at age 12 through 15 months (12 months if the child remains in an area where disease risk is high), and the second dose at least 4 weeks later. Administer 2 doses of MMR vaccine to children aged 12 months and older before departure from the United States for international travel. The first dose should be administered on or after age 12 months and the second dose at least 4 weeks later. Catch-up vaccination: Ensure that all school-aged children and adolescents have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine; the minimum interval between the 2 doses is 4 weeks. 9. V aricella (VAR) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) Routine vaccination: Administer a 2-dose series of VAR vaccine at ages 12 through 15 months and 4 through 6 years. The second dose may be administered before age 4 years, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the first dose. If the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid. Catch-up vaccination: Ensure that all persons aged 7 through 18 years without evidence of immunity (see MMWR 2007 / 56 [No. RR-4], available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5604.pdf ) have 2 doses of varicella vaccine. For children aged 7 through 12 years, the recommended minimum interval between doses is 3 months (if the second dose was administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose, it can be accepted as valid); for persons aged 13 years and older, the minimum interval between doses is 4 weeks. 10. Hepa titis A (HepA) vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) Routine vaccination: Initiate the 2-dose HepA vaccine series at 12 through 23 months; separate the 2 doses by 6 to 18 months. Children who have received 1 dose of HepA vaccine before age 24 months should receive a second dose 6 to 18 months after the first dose. For any person aged 2 years and older who has not already received the HepA vaccine series, 2 doses of HepA vaccine separated by 6 to 18 months may be administered if immunity against hepatitis A virus infection is desired. Catch-up vaccination: The minimum interval between the 2 doses is 6 months. For further guidance on the use of the vaccines mentioned below, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html .For further guidance on the use of the vaccines mentioned below, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html . 10. Hepa titis A (HepA) vaccine (cont'd) Special populations: Administer 2 doses of HepA vaccine at least 6 months apart to previously unvaccinated persons who live in areas where vaccination programs target older children, or who are at increased risk for infection. This includes persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of infection; men having sex with men; users of injection and non-injection illicit drugs; persons who work with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory; persons with clotting-factor disorders; persons with chronic liver disease; and persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity. The first dose should be administered as soon as the adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. 11. M eningococcal vaccines. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for Hib-MenCY [MenHibrix], 9 months for MenACWY-D [Menactra], 2 months single dose of Menactra or Menveo vaccine at age 11 through 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. Adolescents aged 11 through 18 years with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV ) infection should receive a 2-dose primary series of Menactra or Menveo with at least 8 weeks between doses. For children aged 2 months through 18 years with high-risk conditions, see below. Catch-up vaccination: Administer Menactra or Menveo vaccine at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated. If the first dose is administered at age 13 through 15 years, a booster dose should be administered at age 16 through 18 years with a minimum interval of at least 8 weeks between doses. If the first dose is administered at age 16 years or older, a booster dose is not needed. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. Clinical discretion: Young adults aged 16 through 23 years (preferred age range is 16 through 18 years) may be vaccinated with either a 2-dose series of Bexsero or a 3-dose series of Trumenba vaccine to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. The two MenB vaccines are not interchangeable; the same vaccine product must be used for all doses. Vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions and other persons at increased risk of disease : Children with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease) : Meningococcal conjugate ACWY vaccines: 1. Menveo o Childr en who initiate vaccination at 8 weeks: Administer doses at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. o Un vaccinated children who initiate vaccination at 7 through 23 months: Administer 2 doses, with the second dose at least 12 weeks after the first dose AND after the first birthday. o Childr en 24 months and older who have not received a complete series: Administer 2 primary doses at least 8 weeks apart. 2. MenHibrix o Childr en who initiate vaccination at 6 weeks: Administer doses at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. o If the first dose of MenHibrix is given at or after 12 months of age, a total of 2 doses should be given at least 8 weeks apart to ensure protection against serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease. 3. Menactra o Childr en 24 months and older who have not received a complete series: Administer 2 primary doses at least 8 weeks apart. If Menactra is administered to a child with asplenia (including sickle cell disease), do not administer Menactra until 2 years of age and at least 4 weeks after the completion of all PCV13 doses. Meningococcal B vaccines: 1. Bexsero or Trumenba o P ersons 10 years or older who have not received a complete series. Administer a 2-dose series of Bexsero, at least 1 month apart. Or a 3-dose series of Trumenba, with the second dose at least 2 months after the first and the third dose at least 6 months after the first. The two MenB vaccines are not interchangeable; the same vaccine product must be used for all doses. Children with persistent complement component deficiency (includes persons with inherited or chronic deficiencies in C3, C5-9, properidin, factor D, factor ACWY vaccines: 1. Menveo o Childr en who initiate vaccination at 8 weeks: Administer doses at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. o Un vaccinated children who initiate vaccination at 7 through 23 months: Administer 2 doses, with the second dose at least 12 weeks after the first dose AND after the first birthday. o Childr en 24 months and older who have not received a complete series: Administer 2 primary doses at least 8 weeks apart. 2. MenHibrix o Childr en who initiate vaccination 6 weeks: Administer doses at 2, 4, 6, and 12 through 15 months of age. o If the first dose of MenHibrix is given at or after 12 months of age, a total of 2 doses should be given at least 8 weeks apart to ensure protection against serogroups C and Y meningococcal disease.11. M eningococcal vaccines (cont'd) 3. Menactra o Childr en 9 through 23 months: Administer 2 primary doses at least 12 weeks apart. o Childr en 24 months and older who have not received a complete series: Administer 2 primary doses at least 8 weeks apart. Meningococcal B vaccines: 1. Bexsero or Trumenba o P ersons 10 years or older who have not received a complete series. Administer a 2-dose series of Bexsero, at least 1 month apart. Or a 3-dose series of Trumenba, with the second dose at least 2 months after the first and the third dose at least 6 months after the first. The two MenB vaccines are not interchange - able; the same vaccine product must be used for all doses. For children who travel to or reside in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, including countries in the African meningitis belt or the Hajj administer an age-appropriate formulation and series of Menactra or Menveo for protection against serogroups A and W meningococcal disease. Prior receipt of MenHibrix is not sufficient for children traveling to the meningitis belt or the Hajj because it does not contain serogroups A or W. For children at risk during a community outbreak attributable to a vaccine serogroup administer or complete an age- and formulation-appropriate series of MenHibrix, Menactra, or Menveo, Bexsero or Trumenba. For booster doses among persons with high-risk conditions, refer to MMWR 2013 / 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.htm .

(Minimum age: 10 years for both Boostrix and Adacel) Routine vaccination: Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years. Tdap may be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus and diphtheria toxoid- containing vaccine. Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant adolescents during each pregnancy (preferred during 27 through 36 weeks gestation) regardless of time since prior Td or Tdap vaccination. Catch-up vaccination: Persons aged 7 years and older who are not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive Tdap vaccine as 1 (preferably the first) dose in the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. For children 7 through 10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose at age 11 through 12 years should NOT be administered. Td should be administered instead 10 years after the Tdap dose. Persons aged 11 through 18 years who have not received Tdap vaccine should receive a dose followed by tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter. Inadvertent doses of DTaP vaccine: -If administered inadvertently to a child aged 7 through 10 years may count as part of the catch-up series. This dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive a Tdap booster dose at age 11 through 12 years. -If administered inadvertently to an adolescent aged 11 through 18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. For other catch-up guidance, see Figure 2. 13. Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. (Minimum age: 3-dose series of HPV vaccine on a schedule of 0, 1-2, and 6 months to all adolescents aged 11 through 12 years. 9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV may be used for females, and only 9vHPV or 4vHPV may be used for males. The vaccine series may be started at age 9 years. Administer the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose (minimum interval of 4 weeks); administer the third dose 16 weeks after the second dose (minimum interval of 12 weeks) and 24 weeks after the first dose. Administer HPV vaccine beginning at age 9 years to children and youth with any history of sexual abuse or assault who have not initiated or completed the 3-dose series. Catch-up vaccination: Administer the vaccine series to females (2vHPV or 4vHPV or 9vHPV) and males (4vHPV or 9vHPV) at age 13 through 18 years if not previously vaccinated.

Use of licensed combination vaccines is generally preferred to separate injections of their equivalent component vaccines . When administering combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest age for any of the individual components (exception: the minimum age for the first dose of MenHibrix is 6 weeks); the minimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of any of the individual components. 2 Information on travel vaccines including typhoid, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, is available at www.cdc.gov/travel . Information on other vaccines that are licensed in the US but not distributed, includ ing anthrax and smallpox, is available at www.bt.cdc.gov . 3 Ages and intervals less than 4 months may be expressed in weeks. When the term \"months\" is used to express an age or interval , it means calendar months. 4 A hyphen used to express a range (as in \"12- 15 months\") means \"through.\" 5 Combination vaccines containing a hepatitis B component (Comvax, Pediarix, and Twinrix) are available. These vaccines should not be administered to infants younger than 6 weeks because of the other components (i.e., Hib, DTaP, HepA, and IPV). 6 The minimum recommended interval between DTaP -3 and DTaP -4 is 6 months. However, DTaP -4 need not be repeated if administered at least 4 months after DTaP -3. This is a special grace period (2 months long) that can be used while evaluating records retrospectively. An additional 4 days should not be added to this grace period. 7 A special grace period of 3 months, based on expert opinion, can be applied to the minimum age of 15 months when evaluating r ecords retrospectively, which will result in an acceptable minimum age of 12 months. An additional 4 days should not be added to this grace period. 8 Children receiving the first dose of Hib or PCV vaccine at age 7 months or older require fewer doses to complete the series. 9 If PRP -OMP (Pedvax -Hib) was administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. 10 HepB -3 should be administered at least 8 weeks after HepB -2 and at least 16 weeks after HepB -1, and should not be administered before age 24 weeks. 11 Herpes zoster vaccine is recommended as a single dose for persons 60 years of age and older. 12 Bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is approved for females 9 through 25 years of age. Quadr ivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) is approved for males and females 9 through 26 years of age. 13 The minimum age for HPV -3 is based on the baseline minimum age for the first dose (9 years) and the minimum interval of 24 weeks between the first and third doses. Dose 3 need not be repeated if it is given at least 16 weeks after the first dose (and if the intervals between doses 1 and 2 and doses 2 and 3 are maintained at 4 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively). 14 One dose of influenza vaccine per season is recommended for most people. Children younger than 9 years of age who are receiving Influenza vaccine for the first time should receive 2 doses this season. See current influenza recommendations for other factors affecting the decision to administer one vs. two doses to children younger than 9 years. 15 The minimum age for inactivated influenza vaccine varies by vaccine manufacturer and formulation. See package inserts for vaccine- specific minimum ages. 16 Combination measles -mumps -rubella- varicella (MMRV) vaccine can be used for children aged 12 months through 12 years. (See CDC. General Recommendations on Immunization: recommendations of the ACIP. MMWR 2011;60[No. RR -2],7.) 17 Revaccination with meningococcal vaccine is recommended for previously vaccinated persons who remain at high risk for meningococcal disease. (See CDC. Updated recommendations from the ACIP for vaccination of persons at prolonged increased risk for meningococcal disease. MMWR 2009;58:[1042- 3]) 18 Menactra can be given as young as 9 months for high- risk children. Menveo can be given as young as 2 months for high- risk children. MenHibrix can be given as young as 6 weeks for high-risk children. MenHibrix is given as a four dose series at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12- 18 months. 19 A second dose of PPSV 5 years after the first dose is recommended for persons <65 years of age at highest risk for serious pneumococcal infection, and for those who are likely to have a rapid decline in pneumococcal antibody concentration. (See CDC. Prevention of pneumococcal disease: recommendations of the ACIP. MMWR 1997;46[No. RR -8].) 20 A fourth dose is not needed if the third dose was administered on or after the 4th birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. 21 The first dose of rotavirus must be administered between 6 weeks 0 days and 14 weeks 6 days. The vaccine series should not be started after age 15 weeks 0 days. Rotavirus vaccine should not be administered to children older than 8 months 0 days, regardless of the number of doses received before that age. 22 If two doses of Rotarix are administered as age appropriate, a third dose is not necessary. 23 Only one dose of Tdap is recommended. Subsequent doses should be given as Td. For management of a tetanus -prone wound in a person who has received a primary series of a tetanus -toxoid containing vaccine, the minimum interval after a previous dose of any tetanus - containing vaccine is 5 years. 24 For persons beginning the series on or after the 13th birthday, t he minimum interval from varicella- 1 to varicella -2 is 4 weeks. While it is not recommended, if a child younger than 13 years receives varicella-2 at an interval of 4 weeks or longer from varicella- 1, the dose does not need to be repeated. 25 A special grace period of 2 months, based on expert opinion, can be applied to the minimum age of 15 months when evaluating records retrospectively, which will result in an acceptable minimum age of 13 months. An additional 4 days should not be added to this grace period. June 2014 Adapted from Table 1, ACIP General Recommendations on Immunization.

Concentrations of measles antibody in an IG preparation can vary by manufacturer's lot. Rates of antibody clearance after receipt of an IG preparation also might vary. Recommended intervals are extrapolated from an estimated half-life of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg. 1 Does not include zoster vaccine. Zoster vaccine may be given with antibody- containing blood products. 2 Assumes a serum IgG concentration of 16 mg/mL. 3 Measles vaccination is recommended for children with mild or moderate immunosuppression from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and varicella vaccination may be considered for children with mild or moderate immunosuppression from HIV, but both are contraindicated for persons with severe immunosuppression from HIV or any other immunosuppressive disorder. 4 Contains antibody only to respiratory syncytial virus . 5 Licensed VariZIG is a purified human IG preparation made from plasma containing high levels of anti -varicella antibodies (IgG ).

Additional information Additional guidance for the use of the vaccines described in this supplement is available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/index.html . Information on vaccination recommendations when vaccination status is unknown and other general immunization information can be found in the General Recommendations on Immunization at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6002a1.htm. Information on travel vaccine requirements and recommendations (e.g., for hepatitis A and B, meningococcal, and other vaccines) is available at wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list. Additional information and resources regarding vaccination of pregnant women can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/pregnant.html . 2. Influenza vaccination Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons aged 6 months. A list of currently available influenza vaccines can be found at http:// www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/vaccines.htm. Persons aged 6 months, including pregnant women, can receive the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). An age-appropriate IIV formulation should be used. Intradermal IIV is an option for persons aged 18 through 64 years. High-dose IIV is an option for persons aged 65 years. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV [FluMist]) is an option for healthy, non-pregnant persons aged 2 through 49 years. Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV [Flublok]) is approved for persons aged 18 years. RIV, which does not contain any egg protein, may be administered to persons aged 18 years with egg allergy of any severity; IIV may be used with additional safety measures for persons with hives-only allergy to eggs. Health care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons who require care in a protected environment should receive IIV or RIV; health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunosuppressed persons for 7 days after vaccination. 3. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap) vaccination Administer 1 dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant women during each pregnancy (preferably during 27-36 weeks' gestation) regardless of interval since prior Td or Tdap vaccination. Persons aged 11 years who have not received Tdap vaccine or for whom vaccine status is unknown should receive a dose of Tdap followed by tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster doses every 10 years thereafter. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the most recent tetanus or diphtheria-toxoid-containing vaccine. Adults with an unknown or incomplete history of completing a 3-dose primary vaccination series with Td-containing vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series including a Tdap dose. For unvaccinated adults, administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. For incompletely vaccinated (i.e., less than 3 doses) adults, administer remaining doses. Refer to the ACIP statement for recommendations for administering Td/Tdap as prophylaxis in wound management (see footnote 1). 4. Varicella vaccination All adults without evidence of immunity to varicella (as defined below) should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine or a second dose if they have received only 1 dose. Vaccination should be emphasized for those who have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (e.g., health care personnel and family contacts of persons with immunocompromising conditions) or are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers; child care employees; residents and staff members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions; college students; military personnel; adolescents and adults living in households with children; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; and international travelers). Pregnant women should be assessed for evidence of varicella immunity. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive the first dose of varicella vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health care facility. The second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first dose. Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following: \u2014 documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine at least 4 weeks apart; \u2014 U.S.-born before 1980, except health care personnel and pregnant women; \u2014 history of varicella based on diagnosis or verification of varicella disease by a health care provider; \u2014 history of herpes zoster based on diagnosis or verification of herpes zoster disease by a health care provider; or \u2014 laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. 5. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination Three HPV vaccines are licensed for use females (bivalent [9vHPV]) and two HPV vaccines are licensed for use in males (4vHPV and 9vHPV). For females, 2vHPV, 4vHPV, or 9vHPV is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13 through 26 years, if not previously vaccinated. For males, 4vHPV or 9vHPV is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13 through 21 years, if not previously vaccinated. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. HPV vaccination is recommended for men who have sex with men through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. Vaccination is recommended for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. A complete HPV vaccination series consists of 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks (minimum interval of 4 weeks) after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 24 weeks after the first dose and 16 weeks after the second dose (minimum interval of 12 weeks). HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. However, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination. If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, no intervention is needed; the remainder of the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion or termination of pregnancy. 6. Zoster vaccination A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults aged 60 years regardless of whether they report a prior episode of herpes zoster. Although the vaccine is licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use among and can be administered to persons aged 50 years, ACIP recommends that vaccination begin at age 60 years. Persons aged 60 years with chronic medical conditions may be vaccinated unless their condition constitutes a contraindication, such as pregnancy or severe immunodeficiency. 7. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination Adults born before 1957 are generally considered immune to measles and mumps. All adults born in 1957 or later should have documentation of 1 or more doses of MMR vaccine unless they have a medical contraindication to the vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases. Documentation of provider-diagnosed disease is not considered acceptable evidence of immunity for measles, mumps, or rubella. Measles component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who: \u2014 are students in postsecondary educational institutions, \u2014 work in a health care facility, or \u2014 plan to travel internationally. Persons who received inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type during 1963-1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Mumps component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who: \u2014 are students in a postsecondary educational institution, \u2014 work in a health care facility, or \u2014 plan to travel internationally. Persons vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk for mumps infection (e.g., persons who are working in a health care facility) should be considered for revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Rubella component: For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year, rubella immunity should be determined. If there is no evidence of immunity, women who are not pregnant should be vaccinated. Pregnant women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health care facility. Health care personnel born before 1957: For unvaccinated health care personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps, and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health care facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval for measles and mumps or 1 dose of MMR vaccine for rubella. 8. Pneumococcal vaccination General information \u2014 Adults are recommended to receive 1 dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and 1, 2, or 3 doses (depending on indication) of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). \u2014 PCV13 should be administered at least 1 year after PPSV23. \u2014 PPSV23 should be administered at least 1 year after PCV13, except among adults with immunocompromising conditions, anatomical or functional asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implant, for whom the interval should be at least 8 weeks; the interval between PPSV23 doses should be at least 5 years. \u2014 No additional dose of PPSV23 is indicated for adults vaccinated with PPSV23 at age 65 years. \u2014 When both PCV13 and PPSV23 are indicated, PCV13 should be administered first; PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be administered during the same visit. \u2014 When indicated, PCV13 and PPSV23 should be administered to adults whose pneumococcal vaccination history is incomplete or unknown. Adults aged 65 years (immunocompetent) who: \u2014 have not received PCV13 or PPSV23: administer PCV13 followed by PPSV23 at least 1 year after PCV13. \u2014 have not received PCV13 but have received a dose of PPSV23 at age 65 years: administer PCV13 at least 1 year after PPSV23. \u2014 have not received PCV13 but have received 1 or more doses of PPSV23 at age <65 years: administer PCV13 at least 1 year after the most recent dose of PPSV23. Administer a dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the most recent dose of PPSV23. \u2014 have received PCV13 but not PPSV23 at age <65 years: administer PPSV23 at least 1 year after PCV13. \u2014 have received PCV13 and 1 or more doses of PPSV23 at age <65 years: administer PPSV23 at least 1 year after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the most recent dose of PPSV23. Adults aged 19 years with immunocompromising conditions or anatomical or functional asplenia (defined below) who: \u2014 have not received PCV13 or PPSV23: administer PCV13 followed by PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after PCV13. Administer a second dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years after the first dose of PPSV23. \u2014 have not received PCV13 but have received 1 dose of PPSV23: administer PCV13 at least 1 year after the PPSV23. Administer a second dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the first dose of PPSV23.Footnotes\u2014Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Y ears or Older: United States, 2016 (Continued on next page) \u2014 have not received PCV13 but have received 2 doses of PPSV23: administer PCV13 at least 1 year after the most recent dose of PPSV23. \u2014 have received PCV13 but not PPSV23: administer PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after PCV13. Administer a second dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years after the first dose of PPSV23. \u2014 have received PCV13 and 1 dose of PPSV23: administer a second dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the first dose of PPSV23. \u2014 If the most recent dose of PPSV23 was administered at age <65 years, at age 65 years, administer a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the last dose of PPSV23. \u2014 Immunocompromising conditions that are indications for pneumococcal vaccination are: congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (including B- or T-lymphocyte deficiency, complement deficiencies, and phagocytic disorders excluding chronic granulomatous disease), HIV infection, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, generalized malignancy, multiple myeloma, solid organ transplant, and iatrogenic immunosuppression (including long-term systemic corticosteroids and radiation therapy). \u2014 Anatomical or functional asplenia that are indications for pneumococcal vaccination are: sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies, congenital or acquired asplenia, splenic dysfunction, and splenectomy. Administer pneumococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before immunosuppressive therapy or an elective splenectomy, and as soon as possible to adults who are newly diagnosed with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection. Adults aged 19 years with cerebrospinal fluid leaks or cochlear implants: administer PCV13 followed by PPSV23 at least 8 weeks after PCV13; no additional dose of PPSV23 is indicated if aged <65 years. If PPSV23 was administered at age <65 years, at age 65 years, administer another dose of PPSV23 at least 5 years after the last dose of PPSV23. Adults aged 19 through 64 years with chronic heart disease (including congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathies, excluding hypertension), chronic lung disease (including chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema, and asthma), chronic liver disease (including cirrhosis), alcoholism, or diabetes mellitus, or who smoke cigarettes: administer PPSV23. At age 65 years, administer PCV13 at least 1 year after PPSV23, followed by another dose of PPSV23 at least 1 year after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the last dose of PPSV23. Routine pneumococcal vaccination is not recommended for American Indian/Alaska Native or other adults unless they have an indication as above; however, public health authorities may consider recommending the use of pneumococcal vaccines for American Indians/Alaska Natives or other adults who live in areas with increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. 9. Hepatitis A vaccination Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and persons with any of the following indications: \u2014 men who have sex with men; \u2014 persons who use injection or noninjection illicit drugs; \u2014 persons working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; \u2014 persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates; \u2014 persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A (see footnote 1); and \u2014 unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A (see footnote 1). The first dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6-12 months (Havrix), or 0 and 6-18 months (Vaqta). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30 followed by a booster dose at 12 months. 10. Hepatitis B vaccination Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and persons with any of the following indications: \u2014 sexually active persons who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (e.g., persons with more than 1 sex partner during the previous 6 months); persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD); current or recent injection drug users; and men who have sex with men; \u2014 health care personnel and public safety workers who are potentially exposed to blood or other infectious body fluids; \u2014 persons who are aged <60 years with diabetes as soon as feasible after diagnosis; persons with diabetes who are aged 60 years at the discretion of the treating clinician based on the likelihood of acquiring HBV infection, including the risk posed by an increased need for assisted blood glucose monitoring in long-term care facilities, the likelihood of experiencing chronic sequelae if infected with HBV, and the likelihood of immune response to vaccination; \u2014 persons with end-stage renal disease (including patients receiving hemodialysis), persons with HIV infection, and persons with chronic liver disease; \u2014 household contacts and sex partners of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive persons, clients and staff members of institutions for persons with developmental disabilities, and international travelers to regions with high or intermediate levels of endemic HBV infection (see footnote 1); and \u2014 all adults in the following settings: STD treatment facilities, HIV testing and treatment facilities, facilities providing drug abuse treatment and prevention services, health care settings targeting services to injection drug users or men who have sex with men, correctional facilities, end-stage renal disease programs and facilities for chronic hemodialysis patients, and institutions and nonresidential day care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. Administer missing doses to complete a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine to those persons not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated. The second dose should be administered at least 1 month after the first dose; the third dose should be administered at least 2 months after the second dose (and at least 4 months after the first dose). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, give 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose Twinrix schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30, followed by a booster dose at 12 months. Adult patients receiving hemodialysis or with other immunocompromising conditions should receive 1 dose of 40 mcg/mL (Recombivax HB) administered on a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1, and 6 months or 2 doses of 20 mcg/mL (Engerix-B) administered simultaneously on a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. 11. Meningococcal vaccination General information \u2014 Serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal vaccine is available as a conjugate (MenACWY meningococcal (MenB) vaccine available as a 2-dose series of MenB-4C vaccine (Bexsero) administered at least 1 month apart or a 3-dose series of MenB-FHbp (Trumenba) vaccine administered at 0, 2, and 6 months; the two MenB vaccines are not interchangeable, i.e., the same MenB vaccine product must be used for all doses. \u2014 MenACWY vaccine is preferred for adults with serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal vaccine indications who are aged 55 years, and for adults aged 56 years: 1) who were vaccinated previously with MenACWY vaccine and are recommended for revaccination or 2) for whom multiple doses of vaccine are anticipated; MPSV4 vaccine is preferred for adults aged 56 years who have not received MenACWY vaccine previously and who require a single dose only (e.g., persons at risk because of an outbreak). \u2014 Revaccination with MenACWY vaccine every 5 years is recommended for adults previously vaccinated with MenACWY or MPSV4 vaccine who remain at increased risk for infection (e.g., adults with anatomical or functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies, or microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis). \u2014 MenB vaccine is approved for use in persons aged 10 through 25 years; however, because there is no theoretical difference in safety for persons aged >25 years compared to those aged 10 through 25 years, MenB vaccine is recommended for routine use in persons aged > 10 years who are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease. \u2014 There is no recommendation for MenB revaccination at this time. \u2014 MenB vaccine may be administered concomitantly with MenACWY vaccine but at a different anatomic site, if feasible. \u2014 HIV infection is not an indication for routine vaccination with MenACWY or MenB vaccine; if an HIV-infected person of any age is to be vaccinated, administer 2 doses of MenACWY vaccine at least 2 months apart. Adults with anatomical or functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies: administer 2 doses of MenACWY vaccine at least 2 months apart and revaccinate every 5 years. Also administer a series of MenB vaccine. Microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis: administer a single dose of MenACWY vaccine; revaccinate with MenACWY vaccine every 5 years if remain at increased risk for infection. Also administer a series of MenB vaccine. Persons at risk because of a meningococcal disease outbreak: if the outbreak is attributable to serogroup A, C, W, or Y, administer a single dose of MenACWY vaccine; if the outbreak is attributable to serogroup B, administer a series of MenB vaccine. Persons who travel to or live in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic: administer a single dose of MenACWY vaccine and revaccinate with MenACWY vaccine every 5 years if the increased risk for infection remains (see footnote 1); MenB vaccine is not recommended because meningococcal disease in these countries is generally not caused by serogroup B. Military recruits: administer a single dose of MenACWY vaccine. First-year college students aged 21 years who live in residence halls: administer a single dose of MenACWY vaccine if they have not received a dose on or after their 16 th birthday. Young adults aged 16 through 23 years (preferred age range is 16 through 18 years): may be vaccinated with a series of MenB vaccine to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. 12. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination One dose of Hib vaccine should be administered to persons who have anatomical or functional asplenia or sickle cell disease or are undergoing elective splenectomy if they have not previously received Hib vaccine. Hib vaccination 14 or more days before splenectomy is suggested. Recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) should be vaccinated with a 3-dose regimen 6-12 months after a successful transplant, regardless of vaccination history; at least 4 weeks should separate doses. Hib vaccine is not recommended for adults with HIV infection since their risk for Hib infection is low. 13. Immunocompromising conditions Inactivated vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, and inactivated influenza vaccines) generally are acceptable and live vaccines generally should be avoided in persons with immune deficiencies or immunocompromising conditions. Information on specific conditions is available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip -recs/index.html .Footnotes\u2014Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Y ears or Older: United States, 2016TABLE.

Vaccine package inserts and the full ACIP recommendations for these vaccines should be consulted for additional information on vaccine-related contraindications and precautions and for more information on vaccine excipients. Events or conditions listed as precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and risks for administering a specific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should be considered. If the risk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vaccine should not be administered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the risk, the vaccine should be administered. A contraindication is a condition in a recipient that increases the chance of a serious adverse reaction. Therefore, a vaccine should not be administered when a contraindication is present. 2. For more information on use of influenza vaccines among persons with egg allergies and a complete list of conditions that CDC considers to be reasons to avoid receiving LAIV, see CDC.

MMWR 2015;64(30):818-25. 3. LAIV, MMR, varicella, or zoster vaccines can be administered on the same day. If not administered on the same day, live vaccines should be separated by at least 28 days. 4. Immunosuppressive steroid dose is considered to be >2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg of prednisone or the equivalent. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 1 month after discontinuation of such therapy. Providers should consult ACIP recommendations for complete information on the use of specific live vaccines among persons on immune-suppressing medications or with immune suppression because of other reasons. 5. Vaccine should be deferred for the appropriate interval if replacement immune globulin products are being administered. See CDC. General recommendations on immunization: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR 2011;60(No. RR-2). Available suppress tuberculin reactivity temporarily. Measles-containing vaccine may be administered on the same day as tuberculin skin testing. If testing cannot be performed until after the day of MMR vaccination, the test should be postponed for at least 4 weeks after the vaccination. If an urgent need exists to skin test, do so with the understanding that reactivity might be reduced by the vaccine. CS260933-D* Adapted from CDC. Table 6.

Regarding latex allergy, consult the package insert for any vaccine administered.GENERAL RECOMMENDTIONS APPLYING TO SPACING AND ADMINISTRATION OF ROUTINELY RECOMMENDED CHILDHOOD VACCINES 1) Simultaneous administration. This recommendation states that there are no contraindications to the simultaneous administration of any of the routinely recommended vaccines included on the current ACIP schedule. The only exception to this rule is that PCV and PPV should be separated by 8 weeks. 2) No minimum time intervals between the administration of 2 different inactivated vaccines. For example, you could give a DTaP one day and a HIB the next, or 2 weeks later. Again, the one exception is for doses of PCV and PPV. 3) If 2 different live virus vaccines are not administered on the same day, they must be separated by at least 4 weeks. This would apply specifically to doses of MMR and varicella, if not administered on the same day. 4) If 2 different live injectable vaccines are given <28 days apart, the one given second should be repeated 28 days after the second or invalid dose. 5) This recommendation states that vaccine doses should not be given at intervals less than the minimum intervals or earlier than the minimum age. Table 1 of the General Recommendations gives all the minimum intervals and ages for each dose of the recommended childhood vaccines. 6) The 4 day grace period In 2002 the ACIP instituted what is referred to as the grace period, for use in evaluating immunization records. Basically, it states that doses given 4 days before the minimum age or interval may be counted as valid doses. The exception to this is in regard to the spacing of doses of MMR and varicella. This rule should be used primarily for evaluating records, NOT for scheduling visits. In Georgia, this rule does not conflict with the requirements for school and day care. This is not true in some states. 7) If vaccines are administered later than the recommended schedule : Do not start over Do not repeat doses Continue with the rest of the series according to recommended intervals and ages. 8) The importance of administering vaccines by the recommended routes and sites. It does, however, state that in evaluating records, all doses given by nonstandard routes and sites may be accepted except: Rabies and hepatitis B given in the gluteus Hepatitis B not given IM Continue to discard and repeat vaccines given in \"divided doses\" Do not mix vaccines unless they are licensed to be mixed. 9) Combination vaccines may be used whenever any components of the combination are indicated AND its other components are not contraindicated. The manufacturers' package insert should be consulted for further information. 10 Contraindications and precautions are circumstances that dictate when vaccines should not be administered. A contraindication is a condition in the recipient that increases the risk for a serious adverse reaction. A precaution is a condition in the recipient that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction. In some circumstances it may be necessary to weigh benefits vs. risks, as in an outbreak. The majority of both are temporary and vaccines can be administered later. Screening Checklist for Contraindications to Vaccines for Children and Teens For parents/guardians: The following questions will help us determine which vaccines your child may be given today. If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. 1. Is the child sick today? 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? 5. If the child to be vaccinated is 2 through 4 years of age, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems? 8. Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had radiation treatments? 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? No YesDon't KnowPatient name: Date of birth: (mo.) (day) (yr.) Did you bring your child's immunization record card with you? yes no It is important to have a personal record of your child's vaccinations. If you don't have one, ask the child's healthcare provider to give you one with all your child's vaccinations on it. Keep it in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical care for your child. Your child will need this document to enter day care or school, for employment, or for international travel. Form completed by: (1/15)Technical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Immunization Action Coalition Saint Paul, Minnesota 651-647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.org1. Is the child sick today? [all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1, 2). However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute ill - ness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] If a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer MMR, MMRV, or varicella vaccine. A local reaction following a prior vaccine dose is not a contraindica - tion to a subsequent dose. For a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/ latex-table.pdf. For an extensive list of vaccine components, see reference 3. An egg- free recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) may be used in people age 18 years and older with egg allergy of any severity who have no other contraindications. Children and teens younger than age 18 years who have experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory dis - tress, or collapse) after eating eggs can usually be vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); consult ACIP recommendations (see reference 4). 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). His - tory of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vac - cines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kid- ney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [LAIV] The safety of LAIV in children and te ens with lung, heart, kidney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), or a blood disorder has not been established. These conditions, in-cluding asthma in children ages 5 years and older, should be considered precautions for the use of LAIV. Children on long-term aspirin therapy should not be given LAIV; instead, they should be given IIV. 5. If the child to be vaccinated is 2 through 4 years of age, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children ages 2 through 4 years who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given LAIV. Instead, these children should be given IIV. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neuro - logic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual (exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines). A history of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to con - tinue vaccination, give age-appropriate Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap, to improve pertussis protection; 2) Influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccination, vaccinate with IIV if at high risk for se - vere influenza complications.8. Does the child have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, rotavirus, and the intranasal live, at influenza vaccine [LAIV]) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recommended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immunosup- pression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater and may be con-sidered for children age 8 years and older with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed children should not receive LAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. Other forms of immunosuppression are a precaution, not a contraindication, to rotavirus vaccine. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (1, 5, 6). 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that weaken their immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer varicella, LAIV) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant individuals age 2 through 49 years. 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, MMR, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the cur - rent Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines (1, 2). 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? [LAIV, MMR, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus (1, 3). Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month following receipt of the vaccine (6, 8). On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of exposure is imminent (e.g., travel to endemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not contraindicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be admin - istered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester (9). 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever] Children who were given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, yellow fever) should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccina - tion of this type. Inactivated vaccines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval. References: 1. CDC. General recommendations on immunization, at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. 2. AAP.

LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant people younger than age 50 years. 7. Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? [influenza, Td/Tdap] Tdap is contraindicated in people who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP given before age 7 years. An unstable progressive neurologic problem is a precaution to the use of Tdap. For people with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for people with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual. A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap; 2) Influenza vaccine (IIV/LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine, vaccinate with IIV if at high risk for severe influenza complica - tions. 8. During the past year, have you received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, VAR] Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations for current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines. (1) 9. For women: Are you pregnant or is there a chance you could become pregnant during the next month? [MMR, LAIV, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. Sexually active women in their childbearing years who receive live virus vaccines should be instructed to practice careful con-traception for one month following receipt of the vaccine. On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent and immediate protec - tion is needed (e.g., travel to endemic areas). Use of Td or Tdap is not con-traindicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be administered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester. (1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) 10. Have you received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, yellow fever] If the person to be vaccinated was given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccina - tion of this type. Inactivated vaccines may be given at any spacing interval if they are not administered simultaneously. References: 1. CDC.

For an extensive list of vaccine components, see reference 2. An egg-free recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) may be used in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any severity who have no other con - traindications. People who do not meet the age criteria for RIV who have experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eating eggs should consult a specialist for appropriate evaluation to help determine if vac - cine should be administered. Protocols have been published for safely admin - istering influenza vaccine to people with egg allergies (see reference 3). People who report a reaction of only hives after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, can receive either inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or, if age-eligible, RIV (not LAIV). If IIV is to be administered, CDC recommends 1) the vaccine be ad-ministered by a healthcare provider familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy and 2) the vaccine recipient be observed for at least 30 minutes. 3. Have you ever had a serious reaction after receiving a vaccination? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). Under normal circumstances, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Do you have a long-term health problem with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, kidney disease, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), anemia, or other blood disorder? [LAIV] People with any of these health conditions should not be given the intra- nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Instead, they should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other im - mune system problem? [LAIV, people.

LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant people younger than age 50 years. 7. Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? [influenza, Td/Tdap] Tdap is contraindicated in people who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP given before age 7 years. An unstable progressive neurologic problem is a precaution to the use of Tdap. For people with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for people with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual. A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap; 2) Influenza vaccine (IIV/LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine, vaccinate with IIV if at high risk for severe influenza complica - tions. 8. During the past year, have you received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, VAR] Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations for current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines. (1) 9. For women: Are you pregnant or is there a chance you could become pregnant during the next month? [MMR, LAIV, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. Sexually active women in their childbearing years who receive live virus vaccines should be instructed to practice careful con-traception for one month following receipt of the vaccine. On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of disease is imminent and immediate protec - tion is needed (e.g., travel to endemic areas). Use of Td or Tdap is not con-traindicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion, either vaccine may be administered during the 2nd or 3rd trimester. (1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) 10. Have you received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, yellow fever] If the person to be vaccinated was given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, they should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccina - tion of this type. Inactivated vaccines may be given at any spacing interval if they are not administered simultaneously. References: 1. CDC.

[all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events (1). However, as a precaution with moderate or se - vere acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as upper respiratory infections or diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Do you have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] If a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer MMR or vari - cella vaccine. Local reactions are not contraindications. For a table of vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain latex, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/latex-table.pdf. For an extensive list of vaccine components, see reference 2. An egg-free recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) may be used in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any severity who have no other con - traindications. People who do not meet the age criteria for RIV who have experienced a serious systemic or anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the lips or tongue, acute respiratory distress, or collapse) after eating eggs should consult a specialist for appropriate evaluation to help determine if vac - cine should be administered. Protocols have been published for safely admin - istering influenza vaccine to people with egg allergies (see reference 3). People who report a reaction of only hives after eating eggs or egg-containing foods, can receive either inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or, if age-eligible, RIV (not LAIV). If IIV is to be administered, CDC recommends 1) the vaccine be ad-ministered by a healthcare provider familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy and 2) the vaccine recipient be observed for at least 30 minutes. 3. Have you ever had a serious reaction after receiving a vaccination? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for subsequent doses (1). Under normal circumstances, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Do you have a long-term health problem with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, kidney disease, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), anemia, or other blood disorder? [LAIV] People with any of these health conditions should not be given the intra- nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Instead, they should be vaccinated with the injectable influenza vaccine. 5. Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other im - mune system problem? [LAIV, people. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR vaccine is recommended and varicella vaccine should be considered for adults with CD4+ T-lympho- cyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed people should not receive LAIV. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations (4, 5, 6). 6. In the past 3 months, have you taken medications that weak - en your immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or have you had radiation treat- ments? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement (1, 6).

In 1992, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), in collaboration with the Ad Hoc Work- ing Group for the Development of Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices, a working grouprepresenting public and private agencies with inputfrom state and local health departments, physicianand nursing organizations, and public and privateproviders, developed a set of standards as to whatconstitutes the most essential and desirable immuni-zation policies and practices. These standards wereendorsed by a variety of medical and public healthorganizations and represented an important elementin our national strategy to protect America's childrenagainst vaccine-preventable diseases. Since that time, vaccine delivery in the United States has changed in several important ways. First,vaccination coverage rates among preschool childrenhave increased substantially and are now monitoredby the National Immunization Survey. 1,2Second, vaccination of children has shifted markedly fromthe public to the private sector, 3-5with an emphasis on vaccination in the context of primary care and themedical home. 6The Vaccines for Children Program has provided critical support to this shift by coveringthe cost of vaccines for the most economically disad-vantaged children and adolescents. Third, the devel-opment and introduction of performance measures,such as the National Committee for Quality Assur-ance's Health Plan Employer Data and InformationSet, 7have focused national attention on the quality of preventive care, including vaccination. Finally, high-quality research in health services has helped to re-fine strategies for raising and sustaining vaccinationcoverage levels among children, adolescents, andadults. 8 Health care professionals who vaccinate children and adolescents continue to face important chal-lenges. These challenges include a diminishing level of experience\u2014among patients, parents, and physi-cians\u2014with the diseases that vaccines prevent, theready availability of vaccine-related information thatmay be inaccurate or misleading, the increasing com-plexity of the vaccination schedule, and the failure ofmany health plans to pay for the costs associatedwith vaccination. In addition, recommendationsfrom the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediat-rics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physi-cians (AAFP), and the American Medical Associationin 1996 underscored the need to focus on adolescentvaccination. 9 In this context, NVAC, along with partners repre- senting the federal agencies, state and local healthdepartments, and professional organizations, revisedand updated the standards during 2001-2002 to re-flect these changes and challenges in vaccine deliv-ery. The revision was approved by NVAC on Febru-ary 8, 2002 (Table 1), and distributed widely amonga variety of medical and public health organizationsfor review and endorsement. Table 2 lists those or-ganizations that have formally endorsed the Stan-dards for Child and Adolescent Immunization Prac-tices. The standards are directed toward \"health care professionals,\" an inclusive term for the many peo-ple in clinical settings who share in the responsibilityfor vaccination of children and adolescents: physi-cians, nurses, midlevel practitioners (eg, nurse prac- titioners, physician assistants), medical assistants,and clerical staff. In addition to this primary audi-ence, the standards are intended to be useful to pub-lic health professionals, policy makers, health planadministrators, employers who purchase health carecoverage, and others whose efforts shape and sup-port the delivery of vaccination services. Of note, the use of the term \"standards\" should not be confused with a minimum standard of care.Rather, these standards represent the most desirableimmunization practices, which health care profes-sionals should strive to achieve. Given current re-source limitations, some health care professionalsmay find it difficult to implement all of the stan-dards, because of circumstances over which theyhave little control. The expectation is that, by sum-marizing best immunization practices in a clear andconcise format, the standards will assist these pro-viders in securing the resources necessary to imple-ment this set of recommendations.

Achieving these objectives will improve thehealth and welfare of all children and adolescents aswell as the communities in which they live. THE STANDARDS Availability of Vaccines 1. Vaccination Services Are Readily Available All health care professionals who provide primary care to children and adolescents should always in- clude routinely recommended vaccines as a part ofthe care that they deliver in the medical home. 6For some children and adolescents, the main contactwith the health care system is not in a primary careprovider's office; therefore, opportunities for vacci- nation may be missed. Thus, specialists and healthcare professionals in settings such as schools andschool health clinics, sports physical clinics, familyplanning clinics, sexually transmitted disease clinics,and substance abuse treatment centers should assesseach patient's vaccination status and either offer in-dicated vaccines or refer for vaccination if necessary.Information on vaccines administered outside theprimary care setting should be communicated to theprimary care provider.2. Vaccinations Are Coordinated With Other Health Care Services and Provided in a Medical Home When Possible Ideally, vaccines should be given as part of com- prehensive health care. In primary care settings, vac- cination services should be coordinated with routinewell-care visits and other visits. 6Patients who are vaccinated in other settings should be encouraged toreceive subsequent vaccines in their primary caresetting. Patients without a primary care providershould be assisted with identifying one. 3. Barriers to Vaccination Are Identified and Minimized Barriers to receiving vaccines include delays in scheduling appointments, requiring a well-care visit,long waiting periods in the office, and lack of cultur-ally and age-appropriate educational materials. Aphysical examination, although an important part ofwell care, should not be required before administer-ing vaccines: simply observing the patient and ques-tioning about the patient 's health status, immuniza- tion history, and vaccine contraindications aresufficient. In addition, vaccination-only visits shouldbe available. Health care professionals should seekadvice from parents/guardians and patients to iden-tify ways to make vaccination services easier to use. 4. Patient Costs Are Minimized Out-of-pocket costs \u2014including vaccine, adminis- tration, and office visit fees \u2014should be as low as possible for all patients, and no child or adolescentshould be denied vaccination because of inability topay. Resources should be identified to keep patientvaccination costs as low as possible. Free vaccine isTABLE 1. Standards for Child and Adolescent Immunization Practices Availability of vaccines 1.

ARTICLES 959 at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from available through some public programs, although health care professionals who offer these vaccinesmay charge a reasonable administration fee. Sourcesof publicly funded vaccines include the Vaccines forChildren Program (VFC), Public Health Service Sec-tion 317 grants to states, and state or local programs.Children and adolescents should be screened fortheir eligibility to receive vaccines through these pro-grams. Vaccinations provided through VFC or Sec-tion 317 grants may not be denied because of aninability to pay the administration fee, and healthcare professionals should ensure that parents/guardians and patients are aware of this requirement(applies to all vaccines purchased using Centers forDisease Control and Prevention [CDC] contracts, re-gardless of the setting\u2014private or public\u2014in which the vaccines are administered). To minimize costs for patients, health plans and insurance plans should include the provision andadministration of all routinely recommended vac-cines as a covered benefit for all children and ado-lescents. Furthermore, to minimize costs for healthcare professionals, purchasers and health plansshould reimburse health care professionals ade-quately for delivering vaccines, including the timerequired for vaccine administration and for commu-nication about vaccine benefits and risks. The CDCmaintains a web page about VFC at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vfc. Assessment of Vaccination Status 5. Health Care Professionals Review the Vaccination and Health Status of Patients at Every Encounter to DetermineWhich Vaccines Are Indicated Health care professionals should review the vacci- nation status of all patients at all health care visits to minimize the number of missed opportunities to vac-cinate. This review should determine whether thepatient has received any vaccinations elsewhere or isat high risk for disease or undervaccination. Thisinformation should be documented in the patient 's chart and preventive health summary. Health careprofessionals who do not offer vaccinations shouldrefer patients to a primary care provider for neededvaccinations. 6. Health Care Professionals Assess for and Follow Only Medically Accepted Contraindications Withholding vaccinations because of medical con- cerns that are not contraindications results in missed opportunities for prevention. Health care profession-als should ask about any condition or circumstancethat might indicate that a vaccination should bewithheld or delayed and about previous adverseevents temporally associated with any vaccination.Health care professionals should support their deci-sions about what constitutes a contraindication ordeferral for each vaccine by consulting the Guideto Contraindications published bythe the AAFP(available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nip/recs/child-schedule.htm#Printable); the AAP 'sRed Book and other Informa-tion Statements; and manufacturers 'package inserts. Contraindications and deferrals should be docu-mented in the medical record. Effective Communication About Vaccine Benefits and Risks 7. Parents/Guardians and Patients Are Educated About the Benefits and Risks of Vaccination in a Culturally AppropriateManner and in Easy-to-Understand Language Health care professionals should allow sufficient time with parents/guardians and adolescent patients to discuss the benefits of vaccines, the diseases thatthey prevent, any known risks from vaccines, theimmunization schedule and the need to receive vac-cines at the recommended ages, and the importanceof bringing the patient 's hand-held vaccination record to each health care visit. Health care profes-sionals should encourage parents/guardians and ad-olescent patients to take responsibility for ensuringthat the patient is fully vaccinated.

A VIS is a vaccine-specific, 2-page informationsheet, produced by the CDC, that describes the ben-efits and risks of a vaccine. If necessary, health careprofessionals should supplement the VIS with oralexplanations or other written materials that are cul-turally and linguistically appropriate. Health careprofessionals should review written materials withpatients and their parents/guardians and addressquestions and concerns. Health care professionals should encourage par- ents/guardians and adolescent patients to inform thehealth care professional of adverse events after thevaccine to be administered and explain how to ob-tain medical care, if necessary. (See Standard 13 for adescription of the Vaccine Adverse Events ReportingSystem [VAERS]). General vaccination information for health care professionals, parents, and members of the publicmay be obtained by calling the CDC National Immu-nization Information Hotline at 1-800-232-2522 (En-glish) or 1-800-232-0233 (Spanish).

Proper Storage and Administration of Vaccines and Documentation of Vaccinations 8. Health Care Professionals Follow Appropriate Procedures for Vaccine Storage and Handling Vaccines should be handled and stored as recom- mended in the manufacturers 'package inserts; the expiration date for each vaccine should be noted. Temperatures at which vaccines are stored andtransported should be monitored and recorded twicedaily. Summary information about vaccine storageand handling procedures are also available fromstate and local health departments and the CDC.Health care professionals should monitor vaccineinventory and undertake efforts to reduce wastageand loss. CDC-recommended storage and handlingprocedures are available from the CDC by calling404-639-8222. 9. Up-to-Date, Written Vaccination Protocols Are Accessible at All Locations Where Vaccines Are Administered To promote the safe and effective use of vaccines, health care professionals should maintain written protocols that detail the following: vaccine storageand handling; the recommended vaccination sched-ule, vaccine contraindications, and administrationtechniques; treatment and reporting of adverseevents; vaccine benefit and risk communication; andvaccination record maintenance and accessibility.These protocols should be consistent with estab-lished guidelines, reviewed frequently, and revisedas needed to ensure that they remain up-to-date. 10. People Who Administer Vaccines and Staff Who Manage or Support Vaccine Administration Are Knowledgeable andReceive Ongoing Education Health care professionals or others who adminis- ter vaccinations should be knowledgeable and re- ceive continuing education in vaccine storage andhandling; the recommended vaccine schedule, con-traindications, and administration techniques; treat-ment and reporting of adverse events; vaccine ben-efit and risk communication; and vaccination recordmaintenance and accessibility. With appropriatetraining and in accordance with state law/regula-tion/policy, people other than physicians and nursesmay administer vaccines. In addition, other staffshould receive training and continuing educationrelated to their specific roles and responsibilities thataffect vaccination services. The CDC sponsors distance-based training oppor- satellite broadcasts, web-based care professionals. Information about trainingis available at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/ed. 11. Health Care Professionals Simultaneously Administer as Many Indicated Vaccine Doses as Possible Administering vaccines simultaneously (at the same visit), in accordance with recommendations from the ACIP, the AAP, and the AAFP, is safe,effective and indicated. Although the immunizationschedule provides age flexibility for administeringcertain vaccine doses, simultaneous administrationdecreases the number of visits needed and the potentialfor missed doses and enables earlier protection. Whenindicated vaccines are not simultaneously adminis-tered, arrangements should be made for the patient 's earliest return to receive the needed vaccination(s). Ad-ditional information on the safety of simultaneous vac-cination may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/research/simultaneous.htm. 12. Vaccination Records for Patients Are Accurate, Complete, and Easily Accessible Vaccination records for patients should be re- corded on a standard form in an easily accessible location in the medical record to facilitate rapid re-view of vaccination status. Accurate record keepinghelps to ensure that only needed vaccinations aregiven. As required by federal law (42 US Code 300aa-25), health care professionals should ensure thatrecords contain the following information for eachvaccination: the date of administration, the vaccinemanufacturer and lot number, the signature and titleof the person administering the vaccine, and theaddress where the vaccine was given. Vaccine re-fusal should also be documented. The medical record maintained by the primary care provider should document all vaccines received,including those received at a specialist 's office or in another health care setting. When a health care pro- ARTICLES 961 at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from fessional who does not routinely care for a patient vaccinates that patient, the patient 's primary care provider should be informed. All vaccinations administered should be reported to state or local immunization registries, where avail-able, to ensure that each patient 's vaccination history remains accurate and complete. Registries also maybe useful for verifying the vaccination status of newpatients, determining which vaccines are needed at avisit, printing official records, and providing remind-ers and recalls to parents, guardians, and patients. Health care professionals should ensure that each patient has a hand-held vaccination record that doc-uments each vaccine received, including the date andthe name of the health care professional who admin-istered the vaccine. Health care professionals shouldencourage parents/guardians and adolescent pa-tients to bring the patient 's hand-held record to each health care visit so that it can be updated. The CDC maintains an Immunization Registry Clearinghouse. Information about this clearinghouseis available at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/registry/. 13. Health Care Professionals Report Adverse Events After Vaccination Promptly and Accurately to the Vaccine AdverseEvents Reporting System (VAERS) and Are Aware of aSeparate Program, the National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram (VICP) Health care professionals should promptly report all clinically significant adverse events after vaccina- tion to the VAERS even if the health care professionalis not certain that the vaccine caused the event.Health care professionals should document in detailthe adverse event in the patient 's medical record as soon as possible. Providers should be aware thatparents/guardians and patients may report toVAERS and that if they choose to do so, they areencouraged to seek the help of their health care pro-vider. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Pro- gram (VICP) is a no-fault system that compensatespeople of any age for injuries or conditions that mayhave been caused by a vaccine recommended by theCDC for routine use in children. Health care profes-sionals should be aware of the VICP to address ques-tions raised by parents/guardians and patients. Because VAERS and VICP are separate programs, a report of an event to VAERS does not result in thesubmission of a compensation claim to VICP. A briefdescription and contact information for both pro-grams is provided on each VIS for those vaccinescovered by the National Childhood Vaccine InjuryAct. Information about VAERS, as well as guidance about how to obtain and complete a VAERS form,can be found at http://www.vaers.org or by calling1-800-822-7967. Information about the VICP is avail-able at http://www.hrsa.gov/osp/vicp or by calling1-800-338-2382. 14. All Personnel Who Have Contact With Patients Are Appropriately Vaccinated Health care professionals and other personnel who have contact with patients should be appropriatelyvaccinated. Offices and clinics should have policies to review and maintain the vaccination status of staffand trainees. ACIP recommendations for vaccinatinghealth care workers are available at ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/publications/mmwr/rr/rr4618.pdf. Implementation of Strategies to Improve Vaccination Coverage 15. Systems Are Used to Remind Parents/Guardians, Patients, and Health Care Professionals When Vaccinations Are Dueand to Recall Those Who Are Overdue Evidence demonstrates that reminder/recall sys- tems improve vaccination coverage.11Patient re - minder/recall interventions inform individuals that they are due (reminder) or overdue (recall) for spe-cific vaccinations. Patient reminders/recalls can bemailed or communicated by telephone; an autodialersystem can be used to expedite telephone reminders.Patients who might be at high risk for not complyingwith medical recommendations, for example, thosewho have missed previous appointments, should re-ceive more intensive follow-up. Similarly, providerreminder/recall systems alert health care profession-als when vaccines are due or overdue. Noticesshould be placed in patient charts or communicatedto health care professionals by computer or othermeans. Immunization registries can facilitate auto-matic generation of reminder/recall notices. 16. Office- or Clinic-Based Patient Record Reviews and Vaccination Coverage Assessments Are Performed Annually Evidence shows that assessments are most effec- tive in improving vaccination coverage in a practice when they combine chart reviews to determine cov-erage with the provision of results to health careprofessionals and staff. 11Effective interventions also may incorporate incentives or compare performancewith a goal or a standard. Coverage should be as-sessed regularly so that reasons for low coverage inthe practice or in a subgroup of patients are iden-tified and addressed. For assistance in conductingvaccination coverage assessments, health care pro-fessionals should contact their state or local immu-nization program. 17. Health Care Professionals Practice Community-Based Approaches All health care professionals share in the respon- sibility to achieve the highest possible degree of com- munity protection against vaccine-preventable dis-eases. Immunization protects the entire communityas well as the individual. No community is optimallyprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases with-out high vaccination coverage. Therefore, health careprofessionals should consider the needs of the com-munity (especially underserved populations) as wellas those of their patients. Community-based ap-proaches may involve working with partners in thecommunity, including public health departments,managed care organizations, other service providerssuch as the US Department of Agriculture 's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, In-fants, and Children (WIC), advocacy groups, schools, 962 STANDARDS FOR IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from and service organizations to determine community needs and develop vaccination services that addressthese needs. NATIONAL VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (NVAC) The NVAC was chartered in 1988 to advise and make recom- mendations to the director of the National Vaccine Program and the assistant secretary for health, Department of Health and Hu-man Services, on matters related to the prevention of infectiousdiseases through immunization and the prevention of adversereactions to vaccines. The NVAC is composed of 15 members frompublic and private organizations representing vaccine manufac-turers, physicians, parents, and state and local health agencies. Inaddition, representatives from governmental agencies involved inhealth care or allied services serve as ex-officio members of theNVAC.

A monthly at Georgia Dept Of Med Asst on February 3, 2012 pediatrics.aappublications.org Downloaded from Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129 115Recommendations from the National Vaccine Advisory Committee: Standards for Adult Immunization Practice National Vaccine Advisory CommitteeThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) makes recom - mendations for routine vaccination of adults in the United States.1 Standards for implementing the ACIP recommendations for adults were published by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) in 20032 and by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 2009.3 In addition, NVAC published a report in 2012 outlining a pathway for improving adult immunization rates.4 While most of these documents included guidelines for immunization practice, recent changes in the practice climate for adult immunization necessitated an update of exist - ing adult immunization standards. Some of these changes include expansion of vaccination services offered by pharmacists and other community immunization providers both during and since the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic; vaccina - tion at the workplace; increased vaccination by providers who care for pregnant women; and changes in the health-care system, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires first-dollar coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines for people with certain private insurance plans, or those who are beneficiaries of expanded Medicaid plans.5 The ACA first-dollar provision is expected to increase the number of adults who will be insured for vaccines. Other changes include expanding the inclusion of adults in state immunization information systems (IISs) (i.e., registries) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirements, which mandate provider reporting of immunizations to registries, including reporting of adult vaccination in states where such reporting is allowed.6 For the purposes of this report, provider refers to any individual who provides health-care services to adult patients, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health-care professionals. While previous versions of the adult immunization standards have been published, recommendations for adult vaccination are published annually, and many health-care organizations have endorsed routine assessment and vaccina - tion of adults, vaccination among adults continues to be low.7-15 Several barriers to adult vaccination include: Lack of health-care provider and patient knowledge about the need for vaccinating both healthy and high-risk adults. Medical management of acute and chronic illnesses, which usually receives priority over preventive services. Some providers not offering vaccines or offering only a subset of vaccines recommended for adults, and many adult patients unaware of their rec - ommended vaccines.116 Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129 Private and public payer payment for vaccines complicated for providers, and not all those who vaccinate adults are recognized as providers by third-party payers. Medicare setting limits on coverage for vaccines based on the type of plan. For example: \u00b0 Fully reimbursed vaccines through Medi - care Part B are limited to vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus-diphtheria (Td) (as part of wound management but not routine booster doses), and hepatitis B (for certain intermediate and high-risk groups such as patients with end-stage renal failure or diabetes).16 \u00b0 Medicare Part D provides limited coverage for the remainder of vaccines recommended for adults, often requiring significant out-of- pocket costs to patients (e.g., zoster vaccine; tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine; and routine booster doses of Td vaccines).16 \u00b0 Vaccines included in Medicare Part D plans are pharmacy or drug benefits rather than medical benefits. Because most medical pro - viders are not enrolled as pharmacy providers, receiving reimbursement for these vaccines is a challenge. Many providers, both medical and nonmedical, experience complexities in dealing with billing processes and the level of payment for Part D claims. Pharmacist vac - cinators are established providers for Part D vaccines but are still challenged by coverage variability in insurance plans. Medicaid vaccination coverage and authorized vaccines vary by state, with some states cover - ing only a subset of vaccines recommended for adults by ACIP. Medicaid coverage of ACIP- recommended vaccines is further complicated by the Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of increased Medicaid coverage.17 Out-of-pocket costs to patients are a known bar- rier. For example: \u00b0 While the ACA removed out-of-pocket costs for many privately insured people, not all provid - ers and patients are likely to be aware of this provision. \u00b0 Some providers may not be eligible for reim - bursement under some health insurance plans because they are not authorized as in-network providers for vaccination services. \u00b0 Many adults remain uninsured.

The presence of multiple providers of health services may complicate coordination of care and reduce the likelihood that patients' vaccination needs are routinely assessed and needed vaccines are offered. Despite these barriers, a number of strategies have been shown to improve receipt of adult immunizations. One of the most important predictors of vaccination receipt among adults is a health-care provider's recom - mendation and offer of vaccine during the same visit. The importance of a provider recommendation for vac - cination has been demonstrated repeatedly.18-22 Other approaches shown to increase vaccination coverage include patient and provider reminder/recall systems; provider assessment and feedback about vaccination practices; use of standing orders or protocols; reduc - ing patient out-of-pocket costs; worksite interventions with promoted vaccination services; other community-based and health-care system-based interventions implemented in combination.21 The need to review and revise earlier standards is based on several factors: Emphasis on the role of all providers, even non- vaccinating providers, to assess immunization status and recommend needed vaccines was not included in earlier adult immunization standards documents and is generally not included in clini - cal training programs. Community vaccinators and pharmacists are increasingly recognized as integral to achieving higher adult vaccination rates. Reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) is increasing and there are meaningful use incen - tives for eligible medical providers to enter patient immunization information into IISs for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments. A change in communication strategies for educat - ing and contacting patients, with the availability of the Internet and social media, is underway. New opportunities are afforded by the ACA to provide vaccination within the shifting landscape of vaccine financing. There is also a shift in pay - ment models away from fee-for-service toward payment for better outcomes of care. Federal funds for immunization programs that had been used for underinsured children may become available for purchasing vaccines for uninsured adults as the number of children insured for vaccines increases due to implemen - tation of the ACA. As such, the NVAC recommends that the Assistant Secretary for Health promote the use of the 2013 updated NVAC Standards for Adult Immunization Prac - tice by all health-care professionals and payers in the public and private sectors who provide care for adults. STANDARDS FOR ADULT IMMUNIZATION PRACTICE Every health-care provider, in all settings, has a funda - mental responsibility to ensure that all patients are up- to-date with respect to recommended immunizations. The purpose of the Standards for Adult Immunization Practice, which are summarized in the Figure, is to provide guidance to adult health-care providers across the spectrum of health care.

ACIP 5 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices roles of all providers with regard to immunizations, including the role of all providers to conduct routine assessment of vaccination needs for their patients, recommend needed vaccines, and either administer needed vaccines or, for providers who currently do not stock all recommended vaccines, refer patients to places where they can get recommended vaccines. NVAC Update on Standards for Adult Immunization Practice 119 Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 1291. Standards for all providers, including those who do and do not provide immunization services Part of routine clinical care for all providers should include an assessment of their patients' immunization status and a recommendation to the patient and/or the patient's caregiver for needed vaccines. Assessment and recommendation can be accomplished through the following practices: a. Emphasize the importance of immunizations during patient encounters, incorporate patient assessment of vaccine needs into routine clini - cal practice, and document vaccination status in patient medical records. IISs and EHRs should be referenced as sources of data about a patient's vaccine history. b. Strongly recommend all immunizations that patients need. c. Provide all recommended vaccines to patients who need them at the time of the visit. If the vaccines are not given or, if the provider does not have the vaccines in stock, refer the patient to a vaccine provider known to be able to provide the recommended vaccinations. Because vaccine uptake is much higher among patients when the vaccine is recommended and offered at the same visit, providers who are able to stock vaccines for their patients are strongly encouraged to do so.18 d. Ensure that they, and their practice staff, are up-to-date on their own vaccinations per ACIP health-care personnel vaccine recommendations23 and consistent with professional guidelines. Examples of current professional association guidelines include the following: i. The American Nurses Association (ANA) has a longstanding policy supporting immu - nizations for nurses and all people across the life span. ANA believes that nurses have a professional and ethical obligation to be immunized because it protects both the health of the nurse and the health of his/ her patients and community.8 ii. The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) urges health-care employers and local health departments to require influenza vaccina - tion for all staff members as a condition of employment.9 iii. The American Pharmacists Association rec - ommends that its members be up-to-date on immunizations as a professional standard.10 iv. The American Medical Association's policy supports the vaccination of health-care pro - fessionals against communicable diseases to prevent transmission to their patients.11 v. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that all health-care workers be fully immunized according to ACIP recommendations.12 vi. The American Academy of Physicians Assistants recommends that physician assis - tants (PAs) should be immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases for which health providers are at high risk. Doing so not only protects PAs, but also protects patients by preventing provider-to-patient transmission.13 vii. The American College of Physicians rec - ommends that all health-care providers be College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that College Fellows have an ethical obligation to follow recommendations for vaccination themselves and other safety policies put into place by their local or national public health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACOG.15 e. Implement systems to: i. Incorporate vaccination assessment into routine care for outpatients. ii. Identify patients for needed vaccines based on age, risk factor indications for vaccina - tion, and prior vaccination history. iii. Incorporate vaccination assessment and appropriate vaccination of hospitalized patients and those in long-term care facili - ties with recommended vaccines, especially influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. iv. Ensure follow-up for needed vaccinations after hospital discharge. f. Educate patients about vaccines they need using understandable language, including the vaccine information statements for those vaccines covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.120 Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129g. For providers in states that include adult immu - nization records in their state IIS or registry, understand how to access the IIS as a source to check for vaccines that a patient has already received or should have received. Checking the IIS at each patient encounter reduces the likeli - hood of unnecessary vaccinations and provides information about receipt of other vaccines and whether the patient has appropriately completed the vaccination series as recommended. 2. Standards for non-immunizing providers Because data show that ( 1) patients are more likely to get vaccinated when vaccines are recommended by trusted health-care professionals and ( 2) vaccine uptake is higher when vaccine is provided at the same time, primary care providers are strongly urged to stock and provide all recommended adult vaccines. Providers whose facilities are unable to provide certain immunizations (e.g., medical specialists' offices, which do not routinely provide vaccines for adults) still have a significant role in ensuring that their patients receive needed vaccines. Non-vaccinating providers should: a. Routinely assess whether their patients are up- to-date on recommended vaccinations, strongly recommend said vaccines, and refer patients to vaccine providers for needed vaccines. b. Establish patient referral relationships with vac - cine providers in their area. i. Ensure that referral location does not create other barriers for the patient. 1. Ensure that the vaccine provider offers the recommended vaccines, and that the provider is eligible for payment by patient's insurer to minimize out-of- pocket costs for the patient and any delay in vaccination. 2. Provide information to the patient dur - ing the visit about which vaccines are needed, including a prescription when necessary and the contact information for the vaccination referral location. ii. Ensure appropriate follow-up of vaccine receipt by the patient at the patient's next visit, and encourage the vaccine provider to document vaccination (e.g., in the IIS and/or the patient's medical record) and with the patient's primary care provider, if known.3. Standards for immunizing providers All providers who have a role as a primary source of health care for patients should stock all ACIP-recom - mended vaccines for adults. Standards for all providers who immunize adults include ensuring professional competencies in knowledge of vaccine recommenda - tions, vaccine needs assessment, vaccine administra - tion, vaccine storage and handling, documentation of vaccination, and communicating information about vaccination to the patient's medical home. a. Observe professional competencies regard - ing immunizations by ensuring that vaccine providers: i. Are up-to-date on current ACIP vaccine recommendations, appropriate vaccine administration techniques, and vaccine storage and handling guidelines. ii. Have up-to-date, culturally competent materials for patient counseling about the benefits and risks of vaccinations. iii. Are knowledgeable regarding valid contra - indications, adverse events, and reporting of adverse events. iv . Use correct vaccine administration techniques. v. Are knowledgeable about which vaccines may be administered at the same visit to reduce missed opportunities for vaccination. vi. Have systems in place and training for appropriate response to adverse event(s) that may occur after vaccination, including severe allergic reactions. vii. Have staff who are educated in appropriate vaccine storage and handling systems and vaccine monitoring in their practice. b. Assess and strongly recommend vaccinations dur - ing every patient care and counseling encounter. i. Written vaccination assessment protocols are available and implemented after appro - priate staff training. ii. Protocols or standing orders are used (when appropriate for the setting and patient type) to administer routinely recommended vac - cines, and protocols are kept up-to-date. iii. Staff competencies in vaccine needs assess - ment, counseling, and vaccine administra - tion as part of standing orders or protocols are periodically assessed. iv. Reminder recall systems are in place to remind providers and patients about NVAC Update on Standards for Adult Immunization Practice 121 Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129needed vaccines and to ensure that vaccine series are completed to optimize vaccination benefits. c. Ensure receipt of vaccination is documented. i. Record receipt of vaccination in the patient's EHR. ii. Provide a record of vaccines administered to patients, either written or electronic. iii. Use the IIS to record administered vaccines in states that allow adult vaccination infor - mation to be entered into the registry. iv. If the vaccinator is not the patient's primary care provider, then communicate vaccine receipt with the patient's primary care provider, if known. 4. Standards for professional health-care-related organizations, associations, and health-care systems Standards with respect to immunizations include: a. Integrate educational information on immuniza - tions into professional training, including training of students in undergraduate and postgraduate training programs. This training includes support for incorporating modules on immunization into medical, nursing, and pharmacy schools, as well as allied health profession curricula. b. Provide resources and assistance for providers to implement protocols or standing orders, where feasible, and other systems changes to improve routine assessment of vaccine needs and vaccination. c. Encourage their members, trainees, and students to ensure that their own vaccinations are up-to- date as a standard of the profession. d. Assist their members, employees, trainees, and students in remaining current regarding ACIP immunization recommendations by providing updates through routine communications and continuing education. e. Make educational materials for patients regard - ing vaccine recommendations available to their memberships. f. Partner with community organizations, such as immunization coalitions or vaccine advocacy groups, to improve public awareness of adult immunizations. g. Participate in collaboration opportunities with other members of the immunization community (including public health, public and private medical, nursing and pharmacy services provid -ers, patient advocacy, health systems, and other entities). h. Offer modules to help providers assess and improve adult vaccination coverage of their patients as a measure of quality improvement within clinical practices. i. Provide resources to assist providers in imple - menting and operationalizing immunization services within their practices, including helping providers understand the payment for vaccines based on insurance type and benefit design (e.g., private insurance, Medicare Part B, or Medicare Part D). j. Provide resources (i.e., forms and other tools) for collecting and sharing best practices among adult immunization stakeholders. k. Advocate public policies that support these adult immunization standards. l. Insurers/payers/entities that cover adult immuni - zation services should ensure that their networks are adequate to provide timely immunization access and augment with additional vaccine providers, if necessary (e.g., public health depart - ments, pharmacists, and worksites). 5. Standards for public health departments Public health departments may provide vaccination services and, in that role, public health professionals should adhere to the standards of their profession. Additionally, the professional associations that rep - resent public health professionals and public health departments (e.g., Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, NACCHO, Association of Immuniza - tion Managers, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists) should promote adherence to the standards of the public health profession, particularly as they relate to adult immunizations. Public health has additional roles in assessing immunization program needs and the impact of vaccination programs, includ - ing educating the public and providers about immuni - zations. These additional roles include the following: a. Determine community needs and capacity for adult immunization administration and barriers for patient access. i. Work toward decreasing disparities in immunization access based on factors such as race/ethnicity, insurance status, poverty, and location (e.g., rural areas or medically underserved areas). b. Develop policies and/or regulations (legislation) that promote high vaccination rates and reduce 122 Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129immunization barriers for adult patients and their providers. c. Immunization programs should collaborate with existing public health programs that provide clini - cal services, such as sexually transmitted disease control programs, substance abuse treatment ser - vices, and tuberculosis control programs to incor - porate vaccine administration and recordkeeping. d. Ensure professional competency by providing or supporting education to adult health-care provid - ers on routine adult immunizations. e. Maintain surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases to recognize potential disease outbreaks or problems with vaccines and to assist in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the event of outbreaks. f. Collect, analyze, and disseminate available data on vaccine coverage to the public and health-care providers in their jurisdiction to identify and address gaps in coverage. g. Provide resources and assistance for vaccine providers to implement protocols or standing orders, where feasible, and other systems changes to improve routine assessment of vaccine needs and vaccination. h. Provide best practice examples to health-care providers and collaborate with providers in implementing these best practices. i. Provide subject-matter expertise to train and edu- cate vaccine providers and their staff on vaccine recommendations, proper storage and handling, and proper vaccine administration. j. Collaborate with providers to assist in implement - ing and operationalizing immunization services within their practices. k. Partner with professional medical, pharmacy, nursing, and other provider organizations; health- care networks; community organizations; and advocacy groups (e.g., mental health services, dia - betes educators, asthma educators, correctional facilities, and substance abuse providers) to: i. Increase awareness and knowledge of adult immunizations and methods to reach rec - ommended target populations for immuni - zation; and ii. Educate their members and trainees regard - ing immunizations. l. Provide outreach and education to the public and providers about vaccines. i. Collaborate with professional medical, pharmacy, nursing, and other provider organizations; health-care networks; com - munity organizations; business and civic groups; and advocacy groups (e.g., mental health services, diabetes educators, asthma educators, correctional facilities, and sub - stance abuse providers) to: 1. Increase public awareness and knowl - edge of adult immunizations and reach recommended target populations for immunization. 2. Provide culturally competent public education through appropriate venues, including the use of social media and ethnic media. m. Work toward including adults in all state IISs, reduce barriers to including adult vaccination records in IISs, and ensure that IISs meet new standards of EHR interoperability to track and maintain adult vaccination records. n. Expand access to and provide training for IISs to all adult health-care providers. o. Provide access to all ACIP-recommended vaccinations. i. Ensure capacity to provide all ACIP-recom - mended vaccines and immunization services for insured and uninsured adults. ii. Work toward becoming an in-network pro - vider for immunization services for insured adults. p. Ensure preparedness for, and investigate and work to control, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases when they occur. Managing these out - breaks should include activities such as creating, maintaining, and practicing emergency prepared - ness plans for vaccine responses to outbreaks such as pandemic influenza. q. Demonstrate accountability and good stewardship of public financing for vaccines. r. Communicate information about vaccine short - ages, when they occur, to providers and the public. s. Communicate information on vaccine recalls and vaccine safety issues to providers and the public. t. Promote adherence to applicable laws, regula - tions, and standards among adult immunization stakeholders.NVAC Update on Standards for Adult Immunization Practice 123 Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129CONCLUSION The environment surrounding adult immunizations has changed dramatically since the last Standards for Adult Immunization Practices were issued by NVAC in 2003.2 These updated and revised Standards for Adult Immunization Practice represent a continued effort by NVAC to advance action to improve adult immuniza - tion coverage rates in the U.S. aligned with its 2011 report, \"A Pathway to Leadership for Adult Immu - nization: Recommendations of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee.\"4 With these Standards, NVAC provides a concise description of desirable immuniza - tion practices that will improve the provision of adult immunizations in the U.S. As an evolution of the work from the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit established by CDC, the Immunization Action Coalition, and the National Vaccine Program Office, these revised standards have been widely reviewed by major professional organizations and other partners in adult immunization. NVAC recommends that the Assistant Secretary for Health promote the use of these updated Standards for Adult Immunization Practices by all health-care professionals and health-care systems in the public and private sectors who provide and pay for care for adults. NVAC firmly advocates that all providers follow these Standards and believes that these Standards will be useful to inform immunization practice and immunization policy development. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) voted in favor of this report at the September 10, 2013, NVAC meeting. Initial drafts of this document were developed by a National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit writing commit - tee including Anu Bhatt, Carolyn Bridges, Karen Donoghue, Columba Fernandez, Rebecca Gehring, Hall, and LaDora Woods.

Informed Request Policy - 10/2015 Informed Request Policy 1 INFORMED REQUEST POLICY As providers of immunizations, it is important to furnish the vaccinee (or the parents/legal guardians of minors) with objective information on vaccine safety and the disease that the vaccine protects against, thereby making them active participants in decisions affecting their health or the health of their children. Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) are standardized to provide objective information about vaccine benefits and adverse events. What are VISs? VISs are developed by the staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and undergo intense scrutiny by panels of experts for accuracy. Each VIS provides information to properly inform the adult vaccinee or, in the case of a minor, the child's parent or legal representative about the risks and benefits of each vaccine. VISs are not meant to replace interactions with health care providers who should attempt to answer questions and address concerns that the vaccinee or the parent/guardian may have. VIS use is mandatory! Before a health care provider (public or private) vaccinates a child or adult with a dose of any recommended childhood vaccine (DTaP, DT, Td, Tdap, MMR, MMRV , and influenza both Inactivated and Live, Intranasal vaccines ), the provider is required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to provide the most current copy of the VIS to either the adult vaccinee or the child's parent/legal guardian. If there is not a single VIS for a combination vaccine (e.g., Hib/hepatitis B), use the VISs for all the component vaccines. A VIS is also available for the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Its use is not required by the National Childhood Injury Act, but is strongly encouraged-------and it must be used when giving vaccines purchased through a CDC contract (i.e. VFC vaccines). State or local health departments or individual providers may place identifiers (such as form numbers) on the VISs but any other changes must be approved by CDC's National Immunization Program. What to do with the VISs: Some of the legal requirements concerning the use of VISs are as follows: 1) Before a routine vaccine is administered to anyone (including adults), you must give the patient or the parent/guardian a copy of the most current VIS available for that vaccine. Make sure you give your patient time to read the VIS prior to the administration of the vaccine and review the VIS with them. 2) Record on your patient's chart which VIS was given and the date that it was given. 3) Record on the patient's chart the publication date of the VIS (a date which appears on the lower right hand corner of the VIS). How to get VISs: VISs are available upon request from the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) and CDC websites. English and translated statements may also be downloaded from the following websites: Centers for Disease Control (CDC)....... http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/current-vis.html Immunization Action Coalition ................ www.immunize.org/vis GA Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 3. Informed Request Policy - 10/2015 Informed Request Policy 2 INFORMED REQUEST POLICY Required Documentation : Georgia law requires that vaccines administered to individuals of all ages must be documented in the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS). This legal requirement is referenced in the \"Requirements of Law\" section of the Immunization Program Manual under the Official Code of Georgia. Written documentation is required in the vaccine recipient's medical record (or in a permanent office file or log) of each immunization and the receipt by vaccine recipients (or their parents or legal representatives) of the appropriate VIS. The documentation shall consist of the following: vaccine administration date vaccine manufacturer and lot number name, title, and address of the person administering the vaccine (i.e., address where the medical record will be maintained) which VIS is given date printed on the appropriate VIS date the VIS was given to the vaccine recipient (or the parent/legal guardian) date vaccine was given, appropriate notation of the preparation given and date of administration should be provided on either an existing or newly issued Personal Immunization Record It is recommended that Form 3199/3196, \"After the Shots\", or an equivalent description of common side effects be given to the patient or parent/guardian, along with a telephone number that may be called in the case of adverse events. A copy of form 3199/3196 is included in this section of the manual or can be downloaded at http://www.immunize.org/handouts/discussing-vaccines-parents.asp It is also recommended that each vaccine be recorded on a client's personal immunization record. Personal Immunization Records may be ordered from the GA Immunization Program utilizing form 3184, the Request for Immunization Forms (see section 1). In addition, GRITS may be utilized to document an immunization record and can print out the clients' immunization history. In Georgia, (in public health clinics) a parent or legal representative must sign an informed consent for vaccinations. VISs are not consent forms. In Georgia, the legal definition of a person authorized to make a request for immunization is very broad. Pertinent excerpts from the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Title 31, Chapter 9, 12/2001 cited as the Georgia Medical Consent Law are reproduced below: Official Code of Georgia, Annotated 2002 31-9-2 (a) In addition to such other persons as may be authorized and empowered, any one of the following persons is authorized and empowered to consent, either orally or otherwise, to any surgical or medical treatment or procedures not prohibited by law which may be suggested, recommended, prescribed, or directed by a duly licensed physician: (1) Any adult, for himself, whether by living will or otherwise (1.1) Any person authorized to give such consent for the adult under a health care GA Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 3.

Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) are information sheets produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that expl ain to vaccine recipients, their parents, or their legal representatives both the benef its and risks of a vaccine. Federal Law requires that VISs be handed out whenever (before each dose) certain vaccinations are given. Please access links below for all current VI Ss.

Your child may need extra love and care after getting vaccinated. Some vaccinations that protect children from serious diseases also can cause discomfort for a while. Here are answers to questions many parents have after their children have been vac\u00ad cinated. If this sheet doesn't answer your questions, call your healthcare provider. Vaccinations may hurt a littl e... but disease can hurt a lot!What to do if your child has discomfort I think my child has a fever. What should I do? Check your child's temperature to find out if there is a fever. An easy way to do this is by taking a temperature in the armpit using an electronic ther - mometer (or by using the method of temperature-taking your healthcare provider recommends). If your child has a temperature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Here are some things you can do to help reduce fever: n Give your child plenty to drink. n Dress your child lightly. Do not cover or wrap your child tightly. n Give your child a fever- or pain-reducing medicine such as acetamino - phen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin). The dose you give your child should be based on your child's weight and your heathcare provider's instructions. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. Recheck your child's temperature after 1 hour. Call your healthcare provider if you have questions. My child has been fussy since getting vaccinated. What should I do? After vaccination, children may be fussy because of pain or fever. To reduce discomfort, you may want to give your child a medicine such as acetami n- ophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. If your child is fussy for more than 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child's leg or arm is swollen, hot, and red. What should I do? n Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the sore area for comfort. n For pain, give a medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. n If the redness or tenderness increases after 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child seems really sick. Should I call my healthcare provider? If you are worried at all about how your child looks or feels, call your health - care provider! healthcare provider: please fill in the information below. If your child's temperature is \u00b0F or \u00b0C or higher, or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Healthcare provider phone number:[ ]Call your healthcare provider right away if you answer \"yes\" to any of the following questions: Does your child have a temper- ature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about? Is your child pale or limp? Has your child been crying for more than 3 hours and just won't quit? Is your child's body shaking, twitching, or jerking? Is your child very noticeably less active or responsive? Please see page 2 for information on the proper amount of medicine to give your child to reduce pain or fever. s Technical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Saint Paul, Minnesota or children's liquid children's junior age 80 mg in each 0.8 mL 160 mg in each 5 mL ( 1 tsp) chewables strength Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. 80 mg in each tab 160 mg in each tab 6-11 lbs (2 .7-5 kg) 0-3 mos Advised dose* 12-17 lbs (5.5- 7.7 kg) 4-11 mos 12 teaspoon or 2.5 mL 18-23 lbs (8.2-10.5 kg) 12-23 mos 34 teaspoon or 3.75 mL 24-35 lbs (10.9- 15.9 kg) 2-3 yrs 1 teaspoon or 5 mL 2 tablets 36-47 lbs (16.4- 21.4 kg) 4-5 yrs 112 teaspoon or 7.5 mL 3 tablets 48-59 lbs (2 1.8-26.8 kg) 6-8 yrs 2 teaspoons or 10 mL 4 tablets 2 tablets 60-71 lbs (2 7.3-32.3 kg) 9-10 yrs 212 teaspoons or 12.5 mL 5 tablets 212 tablets 72-95 lbs (32 .7-43.2 kg) 11 yrs 3 teaspoons or 15 mL 6 tablets 3 tablets child's weight child's infants' drops children's liquid children's age 50 mg in each 1.25 mL 100 mg in each 5 mL (1 tsp) chewables Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. 50 mg in each tab 100 mg in each tab less than 11 lbs (5 kg) 0-5 mos 12-17 lbs (5.5- 7.7 kg) 6-11 mos 1.25 mL Advised dose* 18-23 lbs (8.2-10.5 kg) 12-23 mos 1.875 mL Advised dose* 24-35 lbs (10.9- 15.9 kg) 2-3 yrs 1 teaspoon or 5 mL 1 tablet 36-47 lbs (16.4-2 1.4 kg) 4-5 yrs 112 teaspoon or 7.5 mL 112 tablets 48-59 lbs (2 1.8-26.8 kg) 6-8 yrs 2 teaspoons or 10 mL 2 tablets 60-71 lbs (2 7.3-32.3 kg) 9-10 yrs 212 teaspoons or 12.5 mL 212 tablets 72-95 lbs (32.7-43.2 kg) 11 yrs 3 teaspoons or 15 mL 3 tabletsChoose the proper medicine, and measure the dose accurately. 1. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist which medicine is best for your child. 2. Give the dose based on your child's weight. If you don't know your child's weight, give the dose based on your child's age. Do not give more medicine than is recommended. 3. If you have questions about dosage amounts or any other concerns, call your healthcare provider. 4. Always use a proper measuring device. For example: When giving acetaminophen liquid (e.g., Tylenol), use the device enclosed in the package. If you misplace the device, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice. Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. When giving ibuprofen liquid (e.g., Advil, Motrin), use the device enclosed in the package. Never use a kitchen spoon! Take these two steps to avoid causing a serious medication overdose in your child. 1. Don't give your child a larger amount of acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) than is shown in the table below. Too much of any of these medicines can be extremely dangerous. 2. When you give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, don't also give them over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. This can cause a medication overdose because cough and cold medicines often contain acetamino- phen or ibuprofen. In fact, to be safe, don't ever give over-the-counter cough and cold medicines to your child unless you talk to your child's healthcare provider first. Acetaminophen ( Tylenol or another brand): How much to give? Give every 4 to 6 hours, as needed, no more than 5 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider). Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or another brand): How much to give? Give every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, no more than 4 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider).

In an attempt to reduce the confu - sion over different strengths that have been blamed for past overdoses, some manufacturers are voluntarily offer - ing only the less concentrated version for all children. Until now, liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants has only been available in a stronger concentration that doesn't require giving the infants as much liquid with each dose. But right now both concentrations of liquid acetaminophen are in cir - culation. Before giving the medica - tion, parents and caregivers need to know whether they have the less con - centrated version or the older, more concentrated medication. FDA is con - cerned that infants could be given too much or too little of the medicine if the different concentrations of acet - aminophen are confused. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen\" says Carol Holquist, director of FDA's Division of Medical Error Prevention and Analysis. Here's what the agency wants par - ents and caregivers to do: Read the Drug Facts label on the package very carefully to identify the concentration of the liquid acetaminophen, the correct dosage, and the directions for use. Do not depend on a banner proclaiming that the product is \"new.\" Some medicines with the old concentration also have this headline on their packaging. Use only the dosing device provided with the purchased product in order to correctly measure the right amount of liquid acetaminophen. Consult your pediatrician before giving this medication and make sure you're both talking about the same concentration. Overdosing Has Been a Risk An April 2011 report from FDA's Cen - ter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) found that confusion caused by the different concentrations of liq - uid acetaminophen for infants and children was leading to overdoses that made infants seriously ill, with some dying from liver failure. So to avoid dosing errors, some manufacturers voluntarily changed the liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants from 80 mg per 0.8mL or 80 mg per 1 mL to be the same con - centration as the liquid acetamino - phen marketed for children\u2014160 mg per 5mL. This less concentrated liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants now has new dosing directions and 2 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration DECEMBER 2 011 Consumer Health Information www.fda.gov/consumer Find this and other Consumer Updates at www.fda.gov/ ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates Sign up for free e-mail subscriptions at www.fda.gov/ consumer/consumerenews.htmlmay have a new dosing device in the box, such as an oral syringe. But this is a voluntary change and some of the older, stronger concen - trations of acetaminophen marketed for infants are still available and may remain available. \"There is still some on store shelves; there is still some in homes; and there is still some in distribution,\" says Holquist. Why does this pose a danger? If a pediatrician prescribes a 5 mL dose of the less concentrated liq - uid acetaminophen, but the parents administer a 5 mL dose of the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen, the child can receive a potentially fatal overdose during the course of therapy, Holquist explains. Conversely, if a physician pre - scribes a dose based on the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen and the less concentrated medication is used, the child might not receive enough medication to fight a fever, she says. FDA has issued a Drug Safety Communication ( www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DrugSafety/ucm284741.htm ) with more information for consumers about how to avoid confusion and potential dosing errors with the different con - centrations of liquid acetaminophen. What Should You Do? Adding to the confusion is the fact that that the box and the bottle may look much the same for both old and new versions of the medication, Holquist says. Read the Drug Facts label to tell the difference between the two liquid acetaminophen products: Look for the \"Active ingredient\" section of the Drug Facts label usually printed on the back of an over-the-counter medication package. If the package says \"160 mg per 5 mL\" or \"160 mg (in each 5 mL)\", then this is the less concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This medication should come with an oral syringe to help you measure the dose. If the package says \"80 mg per 0.8 mL\" or \"80 mg per 1 mL,\" then this is the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This product may come with a dropper. If the dosing instructions provided by your healthcare provider differ from what is on the label, check with a healthcare professional before admin - istering the medication. Do not rely on dosing information provided from other sources such as the Internet, old dosing charts, or family members.It is important to understand that there is no dosing amount specified for children younger than 2 years of age. If you have an infant or child younger than 2 years old, always check with your healthcare provider for dosing instructions. Acetaminophen is marketed for infants under brand names such as Little Fevers Infant Fever/Pain Reliever, Pedia Care Fever Reducer Pain Reliever and Triaminic Infants' Syrup Fever Reducer Pain Reliever. There are also store brands on the shelves. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen.\" Despu\u00e9s de las vacunas... la Si hijo tiene temperatura su profesional o envuelva manera n Dele a su el ni\u00f1o su No casillero abajo).

Y ou should report any adverse event that happens after getting a vaccine, even if you are not sure that the vaccine caused the adverse event. It is especially important to report any adverse event that resulted in hospitalization, disability, or death. If you are not sure that a certain type of adverse event should be reported to VAERS, talk with your healthcare provider. Healthcare providers are required by law to report certain adverse events.

V AERS 1-800-822-7967 Fax: 1-877-721-0366 info@vaers.or g U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Food and Drug AdministrationWhat is V AERS? The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) is a national program that monitors the safety of vaccines after they are licensed. V AERS is managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vaccines prevent serious illnesses and even death in persons who receive them. Before a vaccine is licensed, FDA takes steps to make sure the vaccine is safe. FDA requires that a vaccine goes through extensive safety testing. After a vaccine is licensed, V AERS is one of the mechanisms used to monitor for any problems, or \"adverse events,\" that happen after vaccination. Not all events reported to V AERS are caused by the vaccine. Even though careful studies are done before a vaccine is licensed, rare adverse effects may not be found until a vaccine is given to millions of people with different backgrounds and medical histories. By continued monitoring , V AERS helps to make sure that the benefits of vaccines are far greater than the risks. Anyone who receives a vaccine should be informed about both the benefits and risks of vaccination. Any questions or concerns should be discussed with a healthcare provider. Limitation and Usefulness of V AERS V AERS is unable to determine that a vaccine caused or did not cause an adverse event. Sometimes people who are vaccinated get sick from another cause unrelated to the vaccine. Even though V AERS cannot determine that a vaccine caused an adverse event, it can give FDA and CDC important information that might signal a problem. If it looks as though a vaccine might be causing an adverse event, FDA and CDC will investigate further. Does V AERS Provide Medical Advice? No, VAERS does not provide medical advice. For medical advice, please contact your healthcare provider or state health department.Who Can Report to V AERS? Parents Patients Healthcare Providers Others FDA and CDC encourage anybody who experiences any problems after vaccination to report to VAERS. Healthcare providers are required by law to report certain problems. Why Should I Report to V AERS? Reporting gives valuable information that helps CDC and FDA make sure that vaccines are safe. Reporting strengthens VAERS so it can be used to assess public health response to vaccines. Reporting allows for evaluating public health prevention and control measures. Remember, no vaccine (or any medicine) is completely free of risk and adverse events are possible. If you have an adverse event after a vaccine, please report to V AERS. Each report is important!

Most cases resolve without sequelae. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other sign ificant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: larynx with stridor and dyspnea. Autopsy findings may include acute emphysema which results from lower respiratory tract obstruction, edema of the hypopha rynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trachea and minimal findings of eosinophilia in the liver, spleen and lungs. When deat h occurs within minutes of exposure and without signs ofrespiratory distress, there may not be significant pathologic findings. (2) Encephalopathy. For purposes of the Vaccine Inju ry Table, a vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy only if such recipient manifests, within the applicable period, an injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy, and then a chronic encephalopathy pers ists in such person for more than 6 months beyond the date of vaccination. (i) An acute encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as to require hospitalization (whether or not hospitalization occurred). (A) For children less than 18 months of age who present without an associat ed seizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a \"sig nificantly decreased level of consciousness\" (see \"D\" below) lasting for at least 24 hours. Those children less than 18 months of age who present following a seizure shall be viewed as having an acute encephalopathy if their significantly decreased level of consciousness persists beyond 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state (seizure) or medication. (B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older , an acute encephalopathy is one that persists for at least 24 hours and characterized by at least two of the following: (1) A significant change in mental status that is not me dication related; specifically a confusional state, or a delirium, or a psychosis; (2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness, which is independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and (3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness. (C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of acute encephalopathy in any age group. (D) A \"significantly decreased level of consciousness\" is indicated by the presence of at least one of the following clinical signs for at least 24 hours or greater (see paragraphs (2)(I)(A) and (2)(I)(B) of this section for applicable timeframes): (1) Decreased or absent response to envi ronment (responds, if at all, only to loud voice or painful stimuli); (2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not fix gaze upon family memb ers or other individuals); or (3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognize familiar people or things). (E) The following clinical features alon e, or in combination, do not demo nstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or level of consciousness as described above: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual scream ing, persistent inconsolable crying, and bulging fontanelle. Seizures in themselves are not sufficient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy. In the absence of other evidence of an acut e encephalopathy, seizures shall not be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of the onset of an acute encephalopathy. (ii) Chronic encephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or neur ologic status, first manifested during the applicable time period, persists for a period of at leas t 6 months from the date of vaccination. Individuals who return to a normal neurologic state after the acute encephalopathy shall not be presumed to have suffered residual neurologic damage from that event; any subseque nt chronic encephalopathy shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acute encephalopathy. If a preponde rance of the evidence indicates that a child's chronic encephalopathy is secondary to genetic, prenatal or peri natal factors, that chronic encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. (iii) An encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if in a proceeding on a petition, it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the encephalopathy was caused by an infection, a toxin, a metabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a genetic disorder or trauma (without regard to whether the cause of the infection, toxin, trauma, metabolic disturbance, structural lesion or genetic disorder is known). If at the time a decision is made on a petition filed under section 2111(b) of the Act for a vaccine- related injury or death, it is not possible to determin e the cause by a preponderan ce of the evidence of an encephalopathy, the encephalopathy shall be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. (iv) In determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition set forth in the Table, the Court shall consider the entire medical record. (3) Seizure and convulsion. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, the terms, \"seizure\" and \"convulsion\" include myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal), and simple and complex partial seizures. Absence (petit mal) seizures shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. Jerking movements or staring episodes alone are not necessarily an indication of seizure activity. (4) Sequela. The term \"sequela\" means a condition or event which was actually caused by a condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table. (5) Chronic Arthritis . For purposes of the V accine Injury Table, chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no history in the 3 years prior to vaccination of ar thropathy (joint disease) on the basis of: A) Medical documentation, recorded within 30 days af ter the onset, of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred between 7 and 42 days after a rubella vaccination; (B) Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years afte r the onset of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuous arthritis for more than 6 months following vaccination: (C) Medical documentation of an antibody response to the rubella virus. For purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, the following shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuse connective tissue diseases (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic otizing vasculitis and vasculopathies and Sjogren 's Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents other than rubella (whether by direct invasion or as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders and arthritis associated with ankylosi ng spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, or blood disorders. Arthralgia (joint pain) or stiffness without joint swelling shall not be viewed as chroni c arthritis for purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table. (6) Brachial neuritis is defined as dysfunction limited to the upper extremity nerve plexus (i.e., its trunks, divisions, or cords) without involvement of other peripheral (e.g., nerve roots or a single peripheral nerve) or central (e.g., spinal cord) nervous system structures . A deep, steady, often severe aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm usually heralds onset of the condition. The pain is follo wed in days or weeks by weakness and atrophy in upper extremity muscle groups. Sensory loss may accompany the motor deficits, but is generally a less notable clinical feature. The neuritis, or plexopathy, may be present on the sa me side as or the opposite side of the injection; it is sometimes bilateral, affecting both upp er extremities. Weakness is required before the diagnosis can be made. Motor, sensory, and reflex findings on physical examination and the results of nerve conduction and electromyographic studies must be consistent in confirming that dysfunction is attributable to the brachial plexus. The condition should thereby be distinguishable from conditions that may give rise to dysfunction of nerve roots (i.e., radiculopathies) an d peripheral nerves (i.e., including mu ltiple mononeuropathies), as well as other peripheral and central nervous system structures (e.g., cranial neuropathies and myelopathies). (7) Thrombocytopenic purpura is platelet count less than 50,000/mm3. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia a ssociated with other causes such as hypersplenism, autoimmune disorders (including alloantibodies from previous transfusions) myelodysplasias, lymphoproliferative disorders, congenital thrombocytopenia or hemolytic uremic syndrome. This does not include cases of immune (formerly called idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that are mediated, for example, by viral or fungal infections, toxins or drugs. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, as observed with bacterial and viral infections. Viral infections includ e, for example, those infections secondary to Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and B, rhinovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, and dengue virus. An antecedent viral infection may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing. Bone marrow examination, if performed, must reveal a normal or an increased number of megakaryocytes in an otherwise normal marrow. (8) Vaccine-strain measles viral infection is defined as a disease caused by the vaccine-strain that should be determined by vaccine-specific monoclonal antib ody or polymerase chain reaction tests. (9)Vaccine-strain polio viral infection is defined as a disease caused by poliovi rus that is isolated from the affected tissue and should be determined to be the vaccine-strain by oligonucleotide or polymeras e chain reaction. Isolation of poliovirus from the stool is not suffi cient to establish a tissue specific in fection or disease caused by vaccine- strain poliovirus.

Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 9/2015 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 1 Copies of the pertinent immunization sections of the Georgia law and Rules of the Department of Public Health are included in this section along with copies of the Immunization Certificate and accompanying Policy Guides. Copies are also posted on the Immunization Program web site under the school resources section. The following is a summary of policies that relate to the law and rules. For more detailed information, please refer to the copies of the law and rules. I. Georgia Law and DPH Rules A. Georgia Law (Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 20-2-771, Section 49-4-182 and Section 49-4-183) defines the target population for which immunity to specified diseases is required and sets standards for the use of immunization certificates. B. The law also charges the Department of Public Health (DPH) with responsibility for specifying which immunizations are required and the standards for the same. These are defined in the immunization section (Chapter 511-2-2) of the Rules of the Department of Public Health. C. The DPH Rules define terms such as \"Immunization,\" \"Physician,\" and \"Health Authority,\" list the diseases for which immunity is required, and state the standards for issuing certificates of immunization based on the current ACIP Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule. D. Standards for the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) Certificates of Immunization are also defined on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) and the accompanying Policy Guide 3231REQ and Policy Guide 3231INS. E. Georgia law requires immunization of a preschool age child as a condition of receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. The implementation of the law is the responsibility of the Department of Human Services (DHS) and it is administered by DHS Division of Family and Children Services. Proof of compliance will be provided on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231). F. Any county school superintendent, school principal, or a chief operating officer of a school or public or private daycare center or nursery who does not enforce the requirements or any parent or guardian who intentionally does not comply with the immunization requirements is subject to penalties as outlined in Subsection (h) of the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 20-2-771. G. When persons in charge of child care facilities fail to improve unacceptable levels of compliance with the law, despite repeated requests by public health officials, Bright from the Start, Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) should be notified. H. Any infant/child who is under the age of four and is attending child care must be age appropriately immunized with the required vaccines during the time of attendance . This means that the certificate for every child under four years of age must be marked with an expiration date that indicates the date the next immunization is due. Once a child is four years of age or older and has met the entry requirements for school, [kindergarten (5 year)], a copy of the Immunization Certificate which has been marked as \"Complete for 6th grade with an expiration date\" and includes the vaccine administration dates, or dates of immunity through disease history or serology, may be utilized as documentation for both school and GA Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health SUMMARY OF IMMUNIZATION POLICIES RELATIVE TO GEORGIA LAW 5. Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 9/2015 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 2child care facilities. I. Children attending school (kindergarten through twelfth grade, or children ages five through nineteen if grade divisions are not used) or a childcare facility must be age appropriately immunized with all the required vaccines at the time of first entry into a school or facility in Georgia. \"New entrant\" is defined as any child entering a Georgia school or facility for the first time, or entering after having been absent for 12 months or 1 school year. This means that if a child is not \"up-to-date\" at the time of entry, he/she may attend school provided the certificate is marked with a current expiration date indicating that the child is in the process of receiving the required vaccines and doses. Once all grade level entry requirements have been met, the certificate must be replaced with a certificate marked \"Complete for School Entry.\" (DPH Rules Chapter 511-2-2) J. Children, who are entering a school or child care facility, may be granted a 30 day waiver of the certification requirement for a justified reason to accommodate the obtaining of immunization records. If necessary, this waiver may be extended from the date of first admittance or first attendance whichever is earlier for up to 90 calendar days for children transferring into the school system from out-of-state or entering kindergarten or the school system from out-of-state, provided the parent/guardian can show documentation from their provider or public health clinic that the child is in the process of receiving the required immunizations. A school or child care facility should maintain a file of those children who have been granted a 30 day waiver, and any extension of that waiver and should keep the file current. Children who have not submitted an Immunization Certificate by the end of the 30 day grace period should be excluded from further attendance until the appropriate Immunization Certificate is submitted. II. Immunization Certificates A. Physicians, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants [as authorized by O.C.G.A \u00a7\u00a7 \u00a7\u00a7 43-34-23 (b)] and qualified employees of a local health department or the State Immunization Program are responsible for certifying that a child has met all the immunization requirements for attendance to school/day care as stipulated by the DPH rules. This certification is documented by their signature. B. Schools and child care facilities are responsible for filing and maintaining current certificates. C. A Certificate of Immunization must be on file for each child attending any child care facility or school in Georgia, whether public or private. The certificates must be on site and available for inspection by health officials. D. If a child attends more than one school/facility, a photocopy of the form must be submitted to the second school/facility. E. When a provider utilizes computerized versions of the Immunization Certificate (Form 3231), it is the responsibility of that provider to have these versions approved by the Georgia Immunization Program. The certificates must include all of the information that is illustrated on the hard copy of these forms. In addition, when the Georgia Immunization Program makes updates to these certificates, it is the responsibility of the provider to update their computerized versions to reflect these changes and have them approved by GA Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health SUMMARY OF IMMUNIZATION POLICIES RELATIVE TO GEORGIA LAW 5. Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 9/2015 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 3the state office. F. Certificates should be marked with either a \"Complete for K through 6th Grade\" with a \"Date of Expiration\" or as \"Complete for K through 6th Grade\" and \"Complete for 7th Grade or higher.\" G. A certificate marked as \"Complete for 7th Grade or higher\" does not expire. H. A certificate marked with a \"Date of Expiration\" expires on the date indicated. A current certificate must be submitted within 30 days after the expiration date or the child must be excluded from attendance until a current certificate is submitted. III. Immunization Reports By law, an annual report is required for each facility. This report indicates the percentage of adequately immunized children attending that facility. A. For child care facilities, district or local health personnel must conduct inventories (audits) at least once per year. Licensed child care facilities should maintain at least a 100% compliance level. Health Districts are responsible for working with facilities to obtain and maintain this compliance level. The State Immunization Program will provide district health personnel with a listing of all child care facilities known to Bright from the Start, Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL). Completed Child Care Facilities Status Review forms should be submitted to the State Immunization Program according to the time frame assigned to each district. State Immunization Program Consultants will annually validate the results of the audits. B. For schools, inventories (audits) of immunization records of all kindergarten and seventh grade students must be conducted at least once per year by health departments. Schools should maintain at least a 100% compliance level. Health Districts are responsible for working with schools to obtain and maintain this compliance level. Health Districts may establish their own methodologies for collection of information, utilizing school or other designated personnel, but they are ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the reports. If a health district collaborates with schools or other agencies to conduct the inventory, they are responsible for the training of the individuals who perform and complete the forms. The information must be summarized on the Immunization Inventory for Georgia Schools form and must be submitted to the State Immunization Program. Inventories must be completed so that reports will be received at the State Program office by the date specified by Program. State Immunization Program Consultants will annually validate the results of the audits.

Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 9/2015 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgia Law 4IV. Exemptions Exemptions: Georgia Law (Section 20-2-771) provides for two (2) types of exemptions from immunization requirements. A. Medical: A medical exemption for a vaccine should be completed on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) only when there is a physical disability or condition that contraindicates immunization for that particular vaccine. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 20-2-771 (d) There must be an annual review of the medical exemption and certificates must be reissued with or without indication of the medical exemption. B. Religious: For a child to be exempt from immunizations on religious grounds, the parent or legal guardian must furnish the school/facility with Affidavit of Religious Objection to Immunization (DPH Form 2208). The affidavit must be signed by the parent/legal guardian, notarized, dated, and signed by a Notary Public, kept on file in lieu of GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) and does not expire.

Immunization of students (a) As used in this Code section, the term: (1) \"Certificate of immunization\" means certification by a physician licensed under the laws of this state or by an a ppropriate official of a local boar d of health, on a form provided by the Department of Public Health, that a named person has been immunized in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Department of Public Health. (2) \"Facility\" means any public or private ch ild care learning center or nursery intended for the care, supervision, or instruction of children. (3) \"Responsible official\" means a county school superintendent, a school principal, or a chief operating officer of a school or facility. (4) \"School\" means any public or private educational program or institution instructing children at any level or levels, kindergarten through twelfth grade, or children of ages five through 19 if grade divisions are not used. (b) No child shall be admitted to or attend any school or facility in this state unless the child shall first have submitted a certificate of immu nization to the responsible official of the school or facility. The responsible official of any school or facility may grant a 30 calendar day waiver of the certification requirement for a justified reason. The waiver may be extended from the date of first admittance or of first attendance, whichever is earlier, for up to 90 calendar days provided documentation is on file at the school or facility from the local health department or a physician specifying that an immunization sequence has been started and that this immunization time schedule can be completed within the 90 day waiver period, provided confirmation is received during the waiver period from the health department or physician that immunizations ar e being received as scheduled, and provided the student under waiver is a transfer student, who is defined as a student who moves from an out-of-state school system to a Georg ia school system, or a student entering kindergarten or first grade from out of state. The waiver may not be extended beyond 90 calendar days; and upon expiration of the waiv er, the child shall not be admitted to or be permitted to attend the school or facility unless the child subm its a certificate of immunization. (c) The Department of Public Health shall promulgate rules and regulations specifying those diseases against which immunization is requir ed and the standards for such immunizations. The school or facility shall maintain on file the certificates of immunization for all children attending the school or facility. All facilities shall file a report annually with the Department of Public Health. The report shall be filed on forms prepared by the Department of Public Health and shall state the number of children attending the school or facility, the number of children who did not submit certificates of immunization within the waiver period, and the number of children who are exempted from th e certification requirement for medical or religious reasons. (d) If, after examination by the local board of health or any physician licensed under the laws of this state or of any other state having comparable laws governing the licensure of physicians, any child to whom this Code section applies is found to have any physical disability which may make vaccination undesirable, a certificate to that effect issued by the local board of health or such physician licensed under the laws of this or such other state may be accepted in lieu of a certificate of immunization and shall exempt the child from the requirement of obtaining a certificate of immunization until the disability is relieved. (e) This Code section shall not apply to a child whose parent or legal guardian objects to immunization of the child on the grounds that the immunization conflicts with the religious beliefs of the parent or guar dian; however, the immunization may be required in cases when such disease is in epidemic stages. For a child to be exempt from immunization on religious grounds, the parent or guardian must first furnish the responsible official of the school or facility an affidavit in which the parent or guardian swears or affirms that the immunization required conflicts with the religious beliefs of the parent or guardian. (f) During an epidemic or a threatened ep idemic of any disease preventable by an immunization required by the Department of Public Health, children who have not been immunized may be excluded from the school or facility until (1) they are immunized against the disease, unless they present valid evidence of prior disease, or (2) the epidemic or threat no longer constitutes a significant public health danger. (g) The requirement of a certificate of immunization shall become effective for all children entering or attending facilities on or after April 7, 1981. The certification requirement shall apply to all children entering or attending schools: (1) On September 1, 1981, for all such child ren entering or attendin g kindergarten or the first, ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grades, or of the equi valent ages if grade divisions are not used; (2) On September 1, 1982, for all such childre n entering or attending all grades, or of all ages if grade divisions are not used. (h) Any responsible official permitting any child to remain in a school or facility in violation of this Code section, and any parent or guardian who intentionally does not comply with this Code section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $100.00 or by imprisonment for not more than 12 months. The Department of Public Health may adopt rules and regulations for the enforcement of this Code section. The Department of Public Health and the local board of health, or either of them, may institute a civil action in the superior court of the county in which the defendant resides for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened or continuing violation of any provision of this Code section.

Filling in a 4-dig it year for the year of infection is required. 10. In the interest of having a more complete record, providers are requested to fill in dates of Recommended Vaccines the child has received, but are not required to do so. 11. The certificate is not valid without a printed, typed or stam ped name, address, and phone number of the certifying authority in the certification section in the lower right corner. There must be a written or stamped licensed physician's signature, APRN, PA or a signature of a qualified employee of a local Board of Health or State Immunization Office on the \"Certified by\" signature line. A stamp of a physician, APRN, or PA's signature with official title is permissi ble when cosigned by an office staff. 12. The \"Date of Issue\" is the date a child's immunization status was reviewed and the certificate was issued. It must be filled in. 13. During times when vaccine shortages may necessitate deferral of doses of specific vaccines, the GA Immunization Program will follow the recommendations made by the ACIP and will send providers the interim plans for issuing certificates based on these temporary recommendations. Exemptions: The Official Code of Georgia provides for only two types of exemptions from immunization requirements: 1. Medical: Medical exemption for a vaccine should be filled in only when there is a physical disability or condition that contraindicates immunization for that partic ular vaccine. There must be an annual review of medical exemptions, and certificates must be reissu ed with or without indication of exemption. O.C.G.A. \u00a720-2-771(d) 2. Religious: For a child to be exempt from immunizations on religious grounds, the parent or guardian must furnish the school/facility with a notarized Affidavit of Religious Objection to Immunization (DPH Form 2208) . The school/facility must keep the affidavit on file and available for inspection by health officials in lieu of the Georgia Immunization Certificate (Form 3231). The affidavit does not expire.

CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER (This information is required) Name: _____/_____/_______________ Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health Procedure for the Investigation and Reporting of Vaccine Preventable Diseases 6. Surveillance and Reporting---06/2015 Surveillance Each District (or local) Health office must maintain a surveillance system to monitor the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) in their community, especially as immunization rates increase. In most areas of the state, a passive disease surveillance system is used to collect information on vaccine preventable disease. This type of surveillance system is simpler and less burdensome than active surveillance, but is limited by incompleteness of data and a lack of timeliness. Even after efforts are made to publicize the importance of reporting, passive surveillance systems may still not be representative of the disease burden in the community and may fail to identify outbreaks. The quality of surveillance data can be improved through active surveillance, in which public health officials contact providers and/or laboratories regularly to identify cases of reportable disease. This type of surveillance system yields more complete data, and validates the representativeness of the data for vaccine preventable diseases and other notifiable conditions. Active systems require more resources and therefore are generally used for brief periods or discrete purposes (e.g., CDC projects such as the Emerging Infections Program, disease elimination projects, etc.) Procedure for Reporting Each and every case of a vaccine-preventable disease (confirmed or suspect) must be investigated promptly and thoroughly. All positive and \"suspect\" cases of vaccine- preventable disease should be reported immediately to the local or district public health office or the Acute Disease Epidemiology Section. District Epidemiologists and Communicable Disease Coordinators will have primary responsibility for VPD case investigations in partnership with the VPD Epidemiologists at GDPH. The District Immunization Coordinators and Immunization Field staff will initiate case follow up if the epidemiologist is unavailable.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 1 Agent: The bacterium, Corynebacterium diphtheriae . Brief Description: In the United States, diphtheria is an uncommon inf ection of the upper respiratory tract. Respiratory diphtheria is insidi ous and initial symptoms include a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise, and low-grade fever . The hallmark of respiratory diphtheria is the presence of an exudate that organizes into a tough, grayish-white pseudo-membrane over the tonsils, the pharynx or larynx. The pseudo-membrane is strongly adherent to the underlying tissue, and attempts to dislodge it usually results in bleeding. Inflammation of cervical lymph nodes and surrounding soft-tissue swelling of the n eck result in a \"bull-neck\" appearance and are a sign of moderate to severe disease. The membr ane may progressively extend into the larynx and trachea and cause airway obstruction, wh ich, if left untreated, can be fatal. Absorption of diphtheria toxin from the site of inf ection can cause systemic complications, including damage to the myocardium, nervous system and kidneys . Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal infection (carriage) occurs in the g eneral population despite vaccination. In the United States, severe diphtheria infection has been documented to occur more frequently in American Indian and homeless populations. Areas with Endemic Diphtheria*: REGION COUNTRIES Africa Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Azmbia, and other sub-Saharan countries Americas Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecua dor, Haiti, and Paraguay Asia/South Pacific Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Chin a, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua Ne w Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam Middle East Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turke y, and Yemen Eastern Europe Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Geo rgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Taj ikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan *Although diphtheria disease is rare in the United States, it appears that C. diphtheria continues to circulate in areas of the country with previously endemic diphtheria. In 1996, 10 iso lates of C. diptheriae were obtained from persons i n a Native American community in South Dakota. Eight of these isolates were toxigenic. The last case of diphtheria in the U.S. occurred in New York State in 2012. The last case prior to t hat was in 2003 in a traveler returned to Pennsylvania from Haiti. Reservoir: Human carriers are the reservoir for C. diphtheri a and are usually asymptomatic. Mode of Transmission: Transmission is most often person-to-person via re spiratory tract droplets from an infected patient or carrier. Rarel y, transmission may occur from skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of inf ected persons (fomites). Incubation Period: 2 to 5 days (range, 1 - 10 days). Period of Communicability: Transmission may occur as long as virulent bacilli are present in discharges and lesions. The time is variable, but w ithout antibiotics, organisms usually persist 2 weeks or less and seldom more than 4 weeks. Chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy prompt ly terminates shedding. Chronic carriers are rare but may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 2 Temporal Pattern: In temperate areas, diphtheria most frequently occ urs during winter and spring. Case Classification: Probable: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, an uppe r respiratory tract illness with an adherent membrane of the nose, phar ynx, tonsils, or larynx; and absence of laboratory confirmation; and lack of epi demiologic linkage to a laboratory- confirmed case of diphtheria. Confirmed : An upper respiratory tract illness with an adhere nt membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx; and any of the f ollowing: isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheria from the nose or throat; or histopathologic diagno of diphtheria; or y-confirmed case of diphtheria. Carrier: An asymptomatic person with laboratory confirmed C. diphtheria isolated from the nasopharynx. Comment: Cutaneous diphtheria should not be reported. Respir atory disease caused by nontoxigenic C. diphtheria should be reported as diphtheria. All diphtheria is olates, regardless of association with disease, should be sent to the Dip theria Laboratory, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), CDC. Laboratory Testing: Diagnostic tests used to confirm infection include isolation of C. diphtheriae by culture and toxigenicity testing. Although no other tests for d iagnosing diphtheria are commercially available, CDC can perform a polymerase chain react ion (PCR) test on clinical specimens to confirm infection with a toxigenic strain. PCR is p articularly useful if nonviable C. diphtheriae organisms are present in clinical speci mens that are obtained from a patient after antibiotic therapy has been initiated. Isolation of C. diphtheriae by culture Isolation of C. diphtheriae by culture is essential for confirming diphtheria. However, even if the patient's culture is negative, isolatio n of C. diphtheriae from close contacts may help confirm the diagnosis of the case. Clinica l specimens for culture should be taken from the nose or nasopharynx, and throat from all persons with suspected diphtheria and their close contacts. If possible, s wabs also should be taken from beneath the membrane, or a piece of the membrane should be removed. Specimens for culture should be obtained as soon as diphtheria (involving any site) is suspected, even if treatment with antibiotics has already begun. After C. diphtheriae has been isolated toxigenicity testing should be d one to determine whether the organisms produce diphtheria toxin. Dem onstration of toxin production confirms a case of diphtheria. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 3 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing Isolation of C.diphtheriae may not always be possible because many patients w ill have received antibiotics before diagnosis of diphtheria is considered. PCR allows for detection of the regulatory gene for toxin producti on and the diphtheria toxin gene on nonviable organisms. Additional clinical specimens (nasophyrangeal and throat swabs, pieces of membrane, biopsy tissue) for PCR testing should be collected when specimens are being collected for culture. NOTE: PCR does not demonstrate production of diphtheria toxin but only detection of the diphtheria toxin gene. A positive PCR test in t he absence of a positive culture does not meet the laboratory criteria for classifying a case as confirmed diphtheria. Diagnostic Testing: *Diphtheria culture and PCR testing at the Georgia P ublic Health Laboratory and/or CDC is available by special arrangement only. To receiv e pre-approval and make arrangements for either diphtheria culture or PCR t esting, the District Health office or Georgia Department of Public Health must be contact ed at 404-657-2588 or 1-866-PUB- HLTH after business hours. A. Culture NOTE: The laboratory must be informed that you susp ect diphtheria. A special medium containing tellurite is required for isolati on of this organism. 1. Specimen: Throat, nasopharyngeal and/or pseudo-m embrane swab and/or a piece of the pseudo-membrane. /square4 Polyester, rayon or nylon swabs should be used ( Cotton-tipped or calcium alignate swabs are not acceptable ) 2.

Pure isolates should be cultured on tryptic soy agar slants (TSA), blood agar slants, or other common agar slants. Iso lates should be sent overnight at ambient temperature. For more specific laboratory testing information, p lease see: http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/dip-collect ion.pdf Vaccination: Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria-tet anus toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all per sons at least 6 weeks old but less than7 years of age and without a history of contraindicat ions. DTaP is the preferred vaccine for all doses in the infant and childhood vaccination serie s (including completion of the series in children who have received one or more doses of who le-cell DTP). The primary vaccination with DTaP series consists of a three-dose series, a dministered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the first thr ee doses. The fourth dose (first booster) is recommended at 15-18 months of age to maintain adeq uate immunity during preschool years. The fifth dose (second booster) is recommended for children aged 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years o f schooling. Adolescents 11-18 years of age should receive a sin gle dose of Tdap instead of Td for booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertu ssis if they have completed the recommended childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series. Thereafter, routine booster doses of Td vaccine should be given at 10-year intervals. Adole scents and adults who have never been vaccinated against diphtheria should receive a prim ary series of three doses of Td. The first dose should be administered at least 4 weeks apart, and the third dose 6-12 months after the second dose. For added protection against pertussis , Tdap can substitute for any one dose in the 3-dose primary series. For added protection against pertussis, adults 19 y ears and older should receive a single dose of Tdap (ADACEL\u00ae, BOOSTRIX\u00ae) to replace a single ro utine booster dose of Td, if they received their last dose of Td 10 or more years ear lier and have not previously received a dose of Tdap. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 5 Treatment of infected people: Diphtheria antitoxin (of equine origin) should be given when diphtheria is suspected, without waiting for laboratory confirmation . The recommended dosage and route of administration depend on the ex tent and duration of disease. Detailed recommendations can be obtained from the Georgia De partment of Public Health and CDC. Antitoxin is only available for treatment of clinic al cases through CDC. The responsible health- care provider should contact the State Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588, or if after hours 1-800 PUB-HLTH, to request antitoxin, obtain author ization for its release and make arrangements for transport. Antimicrobial therapy is also required to eradicate carriage of C. diphtheria, to limit transmission, and to halt further production of diphtheria toxin. However, it is not a substitute for antitoxin in clinical cases of diphtheria . Treatment with erythromycin or penicillin is admi nistered as a 14- day course. Care of Close Contacts: Close contacts of a persons suspected to have respi ratory diphtheria should be identified promptly. CDC's \"Information for Close Contacts\" fo und at http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/close-conta cts.pdf can be used to identify and interview close contacts. Contact tracing should be gin in the household and can usually be limited to household members and other people with a history of direct, habitual close contact (including kissing or sexual contacts, healthcare w orkers exposed to nasopharyngeal secretions, people sharing utensils or kitchen faci lities, and people taking care of children. For close contacts (regardless of their immunizatio n status) the following measures should be taken: 1. Surveillance for 10 days for evidence of disease ; antitoxin should be given at the first sign(s) of illness. 2. Perform nose and throat cultures for C. diphther ia to identify carriers 3. Oral erythromycin* (40-50 mg/kg/day) for 10 days (maximum 2g/day) or a single IM injection of benzathine penicillin G (600,000 U for children <30 kg and 1.2 million U for children >30 kg and adults). 4. Immunization, as appropriate (complete primary s eries if <3 doses and give booster if last dose >5 years ago). *Persons who cannot be relied upon to complete the oral course of erythromycin or who cannot be kept u nder surveillance should receive benzathine penicillin G and a dose of DTaP or Tdap dependin on their age. Treatment of carriers: Close contacts found by culturing to be carriers sh ould have received antibiotics and vaccine as per the recommendations for close contacts above. Those who need to complete the vaccine series should receive follo w-up to ensure completion of the series. Follow-up cultures should be performed as per the C DC recommendations. Investigation: Additional guidelines for investigating a suspecte d case and for managing contacts are published and are referenced below. M anagement of close contacts of suspected cases should include screening for possible respira tory or cutaneous diphtheria, obtaining nasopharyngeal cultures for C. diphtheriae , administering prophylactic antibiotics, treatment and follow-up of carriers, assessing diphtheria vaccina tion status, and administering any necessary vaccinations.

Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) Brief Description: An acute infectious disease with onset of any sign or symptom consistent with viral hepatitis, such as fever, fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). The disease varies widely in severity ranging from asymptomatic to a mild illness without jaundice lasting one to two weeks in children, to severe debilitating illness and lasting several weeks with prolonged convalescence in adults. Recovery is generally complete and without complication. Reservoir: Humans are the only natural reservoir. Mode of Transmission: The primary mode of transmission is by the fecal-oral route. This includes ingestion of fecally contaminated water or ice; raw or undercooked shellfish; fruits, vegetables, and other foods eaten uncooked that may have become contaminated during handling. Contact with stool from infected infants and toddlers during diaper changes that is not immediately followed by thorough hand washing is a common means of spread to day care and household contacts. Waterborne transmission of hepatitis A is more common in places with inadequate sewage disposal and water treatment, such as can be found in developing nations. Sexual contact can spread the virus. In rare cases bloodborne transmission occurs. Incubation Period: Average 28-30 days; Range 15-50 days. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness with Discrete onset of symptoms, and Jaundice, dark urine or elevated serum aminotransferase levels (ALT >200 IU/L) Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) positive. Note that a person may remain IgM positive for six months or longer after infection, which makes it difficult to determine the timing of infection in a person who has been asymptomatic. Diagnostic Testing: Serology 1. Outfit 0500 Lab: State Immunology (GPHL) 6. Transport requirements: All specimens should be centrifuged and transported as soon as possible. Refrigerate if specimen must be held overnight. In extremely hot weather, transport on ice packs. Specimens >14 days old or hemolyzed will be rejected. Case Classification : Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and is laboratory confirmed -or- a case that meets the clinical case definition and occurs in a person who has an epidemiologic link with a person who has laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A (i.e., household or sexual contact with an infected person during the 15-50 days before the onset of symptoms). Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 2 Period of Communicability: Hepatitis A virus is highly infective, requiring only a few virus particles to cause infection. The virus is present in the highest quantity in stool during the latter half of the incubation period (7-14 days prior to onset of illness). Most cases are not infectious after the first week of jaundice. Vaccine: Three inactivated vaccines are currently available to protect against infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV). Protection begins two to four weeks after the first dose of hepatitis A vaccine. A second dose is considered necessary for long-term protection. Two vaccines, HAVRIX and VAQTA, are currently licensed for persons 12 months of age and older and are available in two formulations based on the recipient's age. The third vaccine, TWINRIX, is a hepatitis A and hepatitis B combination vaccine licensed for persons 18 years of age or older. Pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at 12 months of age, persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate rates of hepatitis A, close contacts of newly arriving international adoptees, persons with chronic liver disease or clotting factor disorders, men who have sex with men, users of injection and noninjection drugs, persons who work with HAV infected primates or with HAV in laboratory settings, and any person who wishes to be immune to hepatitis A. Post-exposure vaccine use is listed below. For more detailed vaccination information, see Hepatitis A Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: No specific therapy for HAV infection is available, other than supportive care. Hepatitis A is usually self-limiting. Post-exposure Prophylaxis of Contacts: Depending on age of contact, immune globulin (IG) or hepatitis A vaccine should be offered after exposure to hepatitis A, if it can be given within 14 days of last exposure to the case as indicated below: Unvaccinated persons who live in the same household, or who are intimate and/or sex partners of a diagnosed case Day care center associated cases as follows: Unvaccinated children who attend the same room as a diagnosed case Susceptible workers who change diapers in a day care center with a diagnosed case Inmates in the same cell in a detention center Foodhandlers who work with the acute case When a food worker has acute infection, consideration may be given to prophylaxis of patrons if prophylaxis can be given within 14 days of last exposure and the case worked while having diarrhea and/or having questionable hygienic practices, combined with having contact with ready-to-eat foods. Consult the Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588 promptly in these instances. For contacts younger than 12 months of age, older than 40 years of age, those who are immunocompromised, and persons with chronic liver disease, give IG as a single dose of 0.02 ml per kilogram of body weight within 14 days after exposure to hepatitis A. Immune globulin is NOT recommended for hepatitis A exposure for business, office or school contacts, or household visitors (e.g., neighbors and relatives) who do not meet the above criteria. When IG is not readily available, hepatitis A vaccine can be given to contacts older than 40 years of age. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 3 Investigation: Complete the hepatitis case report in SendSS (State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System) at https://sendss.state.ga.us to aid in the investigation. Conduct an assessment of the patient for high-risk activities (food handler, day care attendee/provider, health care provider) and hygienic practices such as hand washing. Determine whether the case worked while experiencing diarrhea. Assess the need for immune globulin (IG) or vaccine as indicated above for contacts of the case patient, and educate case contacts regarding the risk of hepatitis A virus transmission. Investigate the source of the infection. Attention should be paid to sanitation and potential fecal contamination via food or water. Advise hepatitis A vaccine for international travelers, men who have sex with men, persons with chronic liver disease, and others who will be at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A in the future. Special evaluation is indicated for outbreaks in institutional settings and hepatitis in food handlers. Consult the Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588 promptly in these instances. Reporting: Report acute, laboratory-confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588. If calling after regular business hours, reports can be made to 1-866-PUB-HLTH (782-4584). After a verbal report has been made, please transmit the case information electronically through the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SendSS) at https://sendss.state.ga.us.

Links: CDC Hepatitis A Fact Sheet - http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis HEPATITIS A Q&A What is hepatitis A? Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by a specific virus. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of several viruses known to cause hepatitis (liver inflammation) in humans. Prior to 2006, several hundred cases were reported in Georgia each year, with the last large outbreak occurring in 2003. Who gets hepatitis A? Anyone who has not previously been infected with or vaccinated against hepatitis A can become infected. Certain persons at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A include: Children and employees of child care centers where a child or employee has hepatitis A Persons who share a household or have sexual contact with someone with hepatitis A Travelers to developing countries where hepatitis A is common and where clean water and proper sewage disposal are not readily available; and Residents and staff of institutions for disabled children where a resident or an employee has hepatitis A. How is the hepatitis A virus spread? The hepatitis A virus enters through the mouth, multiplies in the body and is passed in the feces. The virus is fairly hardy and can be carried on an infected person's hands and can be spread by direct contact, or by consuming food or drink that has been handled by the individual. In some cases, consuming untreated or inadequately treated water contaminated with improperly treated sewage can spread it. Eating raw or undercooked shellfish (e.g., mussels, oysters, and clams) is another way one can become infected. What are the symptoms of hepatitis A? In outbreak settings, three of every four persons infected with hepatitis A virus have symptoms. When the symptoms are present, they usually develop suddenly and may include fatigue, poor appetite, fever and vomiting. Urine may become darker in color, and then jaundice (a yellowing Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 5 of the skin and whites of the eyes) may appear. The disease is rarely fatal and most people recover in a few weeks without any complications. Infants and young children tend to be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and are less likely to develop jaundice than are older children and adults. Not everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms, but adults are more likely to have symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms usually begin to appear three to four weeks after exposure, but the onset of symptoms may range from two to seven weeks after exposure. When and for how long is an infected person able to spread the virus? The contagious period begins one to two weeks before the symptoms appear and may extend up to a week after illness or jaundice (a yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes) begins. Does past infection with hepatitis A make a person immune? Yes. Once an individual recovers from hepatitis A, he or she is immune for life and does not continue to carry the virus. Additionally, vaccination against hepatitis A is thought to provide lifelong protection against infection. What is the treatment for hepatitis A? There are no special medicines to treat a person once the symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest is all that is needed. Occasionally an ill person with severe vomiting and/or diarrhea is hospitalized for rehydration. How can hepatitis A be prevented? An important way to prevent spread of hepatitis A is careful handwashing after using the toilet. Infected people should not handle foods served to others during the contagious period. Household members or others who have not been immunized, but are in close contact with an infected person, should promptly call a doctor or the health department to determine whether a shot of immune globulin or hepatitis A vaccine can decrease their chances of becoming ill. There are three effective vaccines that protect against infection with hepatitis A virus. Persons in higher risk groups (e.g. travelers to developing countries) may wish to consider being vaccinated. All children should be vaccinated at 12 months of age. Adults ages 18 years and older who are susceptible to both hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the combination vaccine, Twinrix\u00ae. Please contact the Georgia Immunization Program at (404) 657-3158 for current vaccine recommendations. Where can I get additional information on hepatitis A?

Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Brief Description: Exposure to HBV may result in transient or chronic infections, either of which can be asymptomatic. Hepatitis B can present as an acute infectious disease with fever, malaise, loss of appetite, vague abdominal discomfo rt, nausea and vomiting, sometimes arthralgia and rash, often progressing to jaundice. Liver enzyme levels are markedly elevated. Fever may be absent or mild. Severity ranges from asymptomatic cases detectable only by liver function tests, to fatal cases of acute hepatic nec rosis. The likelihood of becoming a chronic carrier is aff ected by age at time of infection. Fewer than 5% of acutely infected adults in the U.S. become ch ronic carriers, compared with 25% (with HBeAg-negative mothers) to 90% (HBeAg-positive moth ers) of perinatally infected infants. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for developing cirrhosis and/or primary hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to end-stage live r disease later in life. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: HBV is usually transmitted by contact with the blo od, semen, or vaginal secretions of an infected person. HBV may also be found in saliva and other body fluids. The virus must be introduced through brok en skin or come into contact with mucous membranes for infection to occur. In addition, per cutaneous transmission of HBV can occur through blood or blood product transfusion, needle sharing, hemodialysis, acupuncture, tattooing, and needlesticks. Indirect inoculation of HBV can also occur via inanimate objects, as the virus can remain viable outside the body for at least 7 days. Incubation Period: Varies from 45-180 days - usually between 60 and 9 0 days. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness with: Discrete onset of symptoms, and Jaundice or elevated serum aminotransferase levels (ALT >200 IU/L). Lab Criteria for Diagnosis : 1. IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-H Bc) positive and/or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and 2.

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 3 Case Classification Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition is laboratory confirmed, and is not known to have chronic hepatitis B. Pers ons who have chronic hepatitis or persons identified as HBsAg positive should not be reported as having acute viral hepatitis unless they have evidence of an acute ill ness compatible with viral hepatitis or documented seroconversion. Comment: Also reportable (in addition to acute hepatitis B): (1) all newly identified HBsAg- positive carriers, (2) all HBsAg-positive pregnant women. Period of Communicability: All persons who are HBsAg positive are potentially infectious. Blood can be infective many weeks before the first onset of symptoms and remain infective through the acute clinical course of the disease. For chronically infected people, the infectivity varies from highly infectious (HBeAg positive) to p otentially infectious (anti-HBe positive). Vaccination: Vaccination is recommended for all infants as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Three doses comprise the se ries: Dose one: at birth Dose two: between 1 month and 4 months (minimum 1 m onth after 1 st dose) Dose three: between 6 months and 18 months (minimum 4 months after 1 st dose, and 2 months after 2 nd dose, but no earlier than 24 weeks of age). For m ore detailed vaccination information, see Hepatitis B Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. All children should be vaccinated by 11-12 years of age. Risk of hepatitis B infection increases in the adolescent years, so catch-up vaccination is recommended for children, adolescents and young adults, especially in certain sub-populations , such as Alaska Natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and immigrants from countries with high HBV prevalence. In addition, the following categories of high-risk adults should be immunized: 1. Heterosexuals with >1 sex partner in the last 6 months, or who have a sexually transmitted disease 2. Men who have sex with men (MSM) 3. Household contacts and sex partners of HBsAg-pos itive people 4. Injection drug users (IDU) 5. Healthcare personnel, and others with occupation al risk of infection through exposure to blood (including but not limited to public safety w orkers, trainees in medicine, dentistry, nursing, and laboratory technology) 6. Residents and staff of facilities for developmen tally disabled persons. 7. Staff of non-residential child care and school p rograms attending to HBsAg-positive developmentally disabled children. 8. Hemodialysis patients 9. Patients with bleeding disorders. 10. Household members of adoptees who are HBsAg pos itive 11. International travelers to areas with high or i ntermediate rates of HBV infection 12. Inmates of juvenile detention centers or long-t erm correctional facilities 13. Persons with HIV infection 14. Persons with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) Note: See Chapter 2 of this Manual for list of persons eligible for state-supplied vaccine in Public Health clinics. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 4 Although recommended in infancy, the vaccine series can be given at any time. A lapse in immunization does not require restarting the series . Studies have demonstrated vaccine efficacy with one-year intervals between doses. Va ccine should be given intramuscularly. The deltoid (arm) is recommended in persons >18 months old, and anterolateral thigh for infants and children 18 months or younger. Administration in th e buttocks or by the intradermal route is not recommended at any age. Treatment: No specific therapy for acute HBV infection is av ailable, other than supportive care. Several drugs are licensed for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the USA. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Passive immunization with hepatitis B immune globul in (HBIG) and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine ar e both used to prevent infection. To be effective, HBIG must be given as soon as possible a fter exposure (within 7 days after blood exposure and 14 days after sexual exposure). HBIG is available commercially and may be provided by the Georgia Immunization Program under certain specific conditions. (See Chapter 2 for table entitled, \"Eligibility Criteria for Vac cines Supplied by the GA Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults.\") Consult wi th the Hepatitis Program in the Epidemiology Section to verify whether HBIG is warranted. Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in the following situations: 1. Perinatal exposure to HBsAg-positive mother 2. Percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood 3. Sexual exposure to a HBsAg-positive individual 4. Known exposure to an acute hepatitis B case Investigation: Collect information about possible exposures, inc luding high-risk behavior during the period 45-180 days before the onset of i llness. Particular emphasis should be placed on 60-90 days before symptom onset. Investigators should identify contacts that could benefit from hepatitis B vaccination or HBIG. Special atte ntion should be paid to the presence of hepatitis B among women of childbearing age, since post-exposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG soon after birth is 90-95% effecti ve in preventing infection in the infant with attendant likelihood of chronic disease (see Perina tal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines section for complete details). Follow-up: All new cases of hepatitis B should be re-tested fo r HBsAg after six months to determine whether infection has cleared or a chroni c infection is present. Those persons still HBsAg-positive are considered confirmed chronic car riers, and should be counseled accordingly and referred for maintenance care. Refer to the Per inatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines for detailed follow-up recommendations of HBsAg-positiv e women, their infants, and sexual and household contacts.

Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by a specific virus. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of several viruses known to cause hepatitis (liver inf lammation) in humans. HBV is completely unrelated to the viruses that cause hepatitis A, C, or other non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis. The HBV may cause mild illness or result in no symptoms , but can also cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure , and death. Who gets hepatitis B? All people, regardless of age or residence, may be at risk for hepatitis B. Those at greatest risk include: Healthcare and public safety workers with risk for contact with blood and blood- contaminated body fluids Current or recent injecting drug users (IDU) Men who have sex with men (MSM) Sexually active persons not in a long-term, mutual ly monogamous relationship (more than one partner in past 6 months) Patients seeking evaluation or treatment for STDs Sex partners and household contacts of people infe cted with HBV Residents and staff of facilities for the developm entally disabled Persons with HIV infection Persons with end-stage renal disease Persons with diabetes mellitus Infants born to mothers who are infected with HBV Children of individuals born in Southeast Asia, Af rica, the Amazon Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, and the Middle East International travelers to endemic regions Persons who have spent time in correctional facili ties If you are at risk for HBV infection, ask your heal th care provider about hepatitis B vaccine. How is hepatitis B virus spread? Hepatitis B virus can be found in the blood, semen and, to a lesser extent, saliva and other body fluids of an infected person. It is spread by dire ct contact with infected body fluids, usually by needlestick injury or sexual contact. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to baby at birth. HBV is not spread by casual contact. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 8/2015 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 7 What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? The symptoms of hepatitis B include fatigue, poor a ppetite, fever, vomiting, and occasionally joint pain, hives or rash. Urine may become darker in color, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) may appear. Some individua ls may experience few or no symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms may appear two to six months after exp osure, but usually within three months. When and for how long is a person able to spread th e virus? The virus can be found in blood and other body flui ds several weeks before symptoms appear, and it generally persists for several months afterw ards. Some people with HBV infection may become long-term carriers of the virus, and may be able to spread the virus over many years. What is the hepatitis B carrier state? Some persons infected with HBV never fully recover and carry the virus for the rest of their lives. These persons have chronic infection and are someti mes referred to as carriers. They can infect other household and sexual contacts througho ut their lives. Among adolescents and adults who get hepatitis B, 5%-10% develop a lifelo ng infection. When young children are infected, the risk of lifelong infection is much hi gher (up to 90%). An estimated one million people have lifelong hepatitis B virus infections i n the United States today. Why is hepatitis B a problem for pregnant women and their babies? Pregnant women may have HBV in their blood without knowing it and can pass it on to their babies at birth, if their infants are not vaccinate d at birth. If unvaccinated, many of these babies develop lifelong HBV infections and can pass the vi rus on to others throughout their lives. At first, babies may not look or feel sick, but as the y grow up, they may have liver damage. About 25% of babies who develop lifelong HBV infections d ie prematurely of liver disease or liver cancer. What is the treatment for acute hepatitis B infecti on? There are no special medicines that can be used to treat a person once the symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest as needed is recommended for ac ute hepatitis B infection. What precautions should hepatitis B carriers take? Hepatitis B carriers should follow standard hygieni c practices to ensure that their blood and other body fluids do not directly contaminate close contacts. Carriers must not share razors, toothbrushes, glucose monitors, insulin needles, or any other object that may become contaminated with blood. Susceptible household mem bers, particularly sex partners, should be immunized with hepatitis B vaccine. It is importan t for carriers to inform their dentists and health care providers. Medications are available to treat persons with chronic hepatitis B, but they don't work for everyone. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be monitored and referred to a specialist for management of the disease, if i ndicated. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Preventing hepatitis B is important because of the risk of lifelong infection leading to serious liver problems. A vaccine has been used since 1982 to prevent hepatitis B. The vaccine is given in a series of three shots. Hepatitis B vacc ine is safe, effective, and is recommended for All babies, beginning at birth Everyone 18 years of age and younger Adults over 18 years of age who are at risk for HB V infection Persons whose jobs expose them to human blood Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6.

Surveillance and Reporting - 6/2015 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium often found in the upper respirator y tract of humans. H. influenzae is divided into several strains based on the prese nce of a polysaccharide capsule virulence factor. Encapsula ted strains are considered \"typable\" (types A, B, C, D, E, and F), while non-encapsulated strai ns are non-typable. Brief Description: H. influenzae causes a variety of illnesses. Typable strains, e specially type B (\"Hib\") and type F, have been commonly associated with invasive disease, including meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, septic arthrit is, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pericarditis, and Historically, type B was a common, dev astating pathogen, especially in children; however, since the widespread use in the U.S. of co njugate vaccines against Hib, cases caused by Hib have decreased drastically. Non-typable H. influenzae is occasionally associated with otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, aggravation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neonatal and maternal sepsis, and bacterem ia. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Spread occurs through airborne droplets or by dire ct contact with infectious secretions. Between 30% and 80% of peop le are carriers of non-typable H. influenzae , while approximately 2% are carriers of types A, C , D, E, and F and less than 1% carry type B (in a vaccinated population). Illness may occur in carriers when host immunity is compromised for some reason. Incubation Period: Unknown, possibly 2-4 days. Period of Communicability: As long as organisms are present, which may be for a prolonged period even without nasal discharge. Cases are con sidered non-infectious 24-48 hours after starting effective antibiotic therapy. Temporal Pattern: Several studies in the prevaccine era described a bimodal seasonal pattern in the United States, with one peak during Septembe r through December and a second peak during March through May. Case Classification: Probable : Meningitis WITH detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b antigen in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Confirmed : Isolation of Haemophilus influenzae from a normally sterile body site (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], blood, joint flui d, pleural OR Detection of Haemophilus influenzae -specific nucleic acid in a specimen obtained from a normally sterile body site (e.g., cerebrospi nal fluid [CSF], blood, joint fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid), using a validate d polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INVASIVE DISEASE FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 6/2015 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 2Comment : Positive antigen detection test results from urin e or serum samples are unreliable for diagnosis of H. influenza disease. Laboratory Testing: Isolation of H. influenzae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid or, less commonly, joint, pleur al, or pericardial fluid); or detection of Haemophilus influenzae -specific nucleic acid in a specimen obtained from a normally sterile body site (e.g., blood or CSF), using a validated p olymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay; or . Detection of Haemophilus type in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Diagnostic Testing: 1. Specimen: Blood, CSF, or other sterile site for culture; pure specimen for serotyping. 2. Outfits: Sterile vial for isolation and identifi cation; culture referral order #0505 for serotyping. 3. Lab Form: Form 3583. 4. Lab Performed: Bacterial isolation and iden tification; H. influenzae serotyping. 5. Lab Performing Test: Isolation and identificatio n is usually performed at hospital or private labs; serotyping is performed at the GPHL B acteriology Section in Decatur. Vaccination: A conjugate vaccine for Hib has been licensed for use in the U.S. since the mid- 1980s. Children should get Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age (if PRP-OMP vaccine is used, the dose at 6 months is not requir ed). Children over 5 years of age usually do not need Hib vaccine. Older children or adults wit h sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow transplant, or undergoing c hemotherapy should also receive Hib vaccine. For more detailed vaccination information, see Haemophilus Influenzae Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment : The 2015 Red Book recommends a third-generation c ephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for initial treatment. T he patient should be given rifampin before discharge from the hospital to ensure elimination o f the organism if a regimen other than ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was used to treat illness . Prophylaxis and Follow-Up of Contacts [disease caus ed by type B (Hib) only]: Observe contacts under 4 years old (especially inf ants) for indications of illness and provide prompt medical attention should signs and s ymptoms appear. Rifampin prophylaxis is warranted for all househol d contacts, including adults, in households with: a. One or more infants <12 months of age who has no t received the primary series b. A child 1-3 years of age who is unimmunized or i ncompletely immunized c. An immunocompromised child. When two or more cases of invasive disease have oc curred within 60 days at a day care facility or school which un-immunized or under -immunized children attend, administration of rifampin to all attendees and sup ervisory personnel is controversial. Efforts should be made to ensure that all day care attendees under 5 years of age are fully vaccinated. Dosage of rifampin for prophylaxis: a. Age <1 month: 10 mg/kg once daily for 4 days; b. Age 1 month: 20 mg/kg once daily for 4 days, maximum da ily dose 600 mg. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INVASIVE DISEASE FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 6/2015 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 3c. For adults, each dose is 600 mg. d. Rifampin can be administered to infants and chil dren suspended in simple syrup or as a dry powder mixed with applesauce. Investigation: Identification of young children who are close con tacts of cases and assessment of their vaccination status may help identify perso ns who should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis and who need to be immunized. In parti cular, household and day care classroom contacts should be immediately identified. Reporting: Report all confirmed cases of invasive H. influen zae IMMEDIATELY electronically though the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surv eillance System (SENDSS) at http://sendss.state.ga.us .

Surveillance and Reporting - 6/2015 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Questions & Answers 5 What is invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease is a serious disease caused by bacteria. Before Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years old in the United States. Today invasive disease is less common, and is more often caused by serotypes that are not prevented by the Hib vaccine (types A, C, D, E, F, and non-typable). Who gets invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Before the introduction of the Hib vaccine, almost all invasive infections were among children under 5 years of age and were caused by serotype B. Two-thirds of cases were among children less than 18 months of age. Due to high vaccinatio n rates, Hib invasive disease is now less common among children, although invasive disease du e to all serotypes continues to occur at low levels in children and adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions. How is Haemophilus influenzae spread? The bacteria spread from person to person via airbo rne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions. If the bacteria stay in th e person's nose and throat, the person probably will not get sick. Sometimes the bacteria spread i nto the lungs or the bloodstream, and then Haemophilus influenzae can cause serious problems. What are the symptoms of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease can affect different organ systems of the body. The most common types of disease include meningitis (in fection of the brain and spinal cord coverings, which can lead to lasting brain damage a nd deafness); pneumonia; severe swelling in the throat, which makes it difficult to breathe; infections of the blood, joints, bones, and covering of the heart; and death. How soon after contact could illness develop? This is uncertain. The period is probably short, fr om 2-4 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread Haemophilus influenzae ? As long as the bacteria are present, which could be for a prolonged period of time. Within 24-48 hours after beginning treatment with appropriate an tibiotics, a person should no longer be able to spread the infection. How can a person find out if he or she has invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? A doctor may take a sample of blood or spinal fluid from an ill person to conduct laboratory tests. What is the treatment for invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Hospitalization is generally necessary. A doctor w ill prescribe antibiotics for treatment.

Children sho uld get Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age (if the PRP-OMP vaccine is used, the dose at 6 months is not required). If a dose is missed, the next dose should be given as soon as possible; there is no need to start over. Hib vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children over 5 years old usually do not need Hib v accine. Older children or adults with sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow transplant, or undergoing chemotherapy should get the Hib vaccine. Vaccines have not yet been developed to prevent disease caused by other serotypes of H. influenzae. Other ways to prevent invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease include regular handwashing, good hygiene, and disposal of soiled tissues after use.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Fact Sheet 1 Prior to the introduction of vaccine in 1963 measle s was a common childhood illness in the U.S., and most people developed natural immunity before a dulthood. As a result, persons born in the U.S. prior to 1957 are considered to have presumpti ve immunity to measles. Following the adoption of a two dose immunization schedule with M MR vaccine in 1989, measles incidence declined to record low levels, and in 2000 measles was declared no longer endemic in the U.S. Cases of measles continue to occur in the U.S. as a result of importation of the virus from other countries, with occasional secondary spread most of ten among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated persons. Immunity must remain high in a population if an absence of endemic transmission of measles is to be sustained. However , in addition to maintaining high vaccination rates, prompt recognition, reporting, and investiga tion of cases and contacts is essential to halt the spread of imported disease. Agent: Measles virus (paramyxovirus) Brief Description: Measles begins with a prodrome which lasts 2-4 days and is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, coryza (runny nose and wa tery eyes), and conjunctivitis (eye inflammation and redness). Small spots with white or bluish white centers on an erythematous (red) base in the mouth (buccal mucosa or soft pala te) called Koplik spots are specific for measles and may be seen on oral exam between day 2 and 6. A characteristic red, blotchy, palpable (maculopapular) rash appears on the third to the seventh day and typically begins on the face (at the hairline) and spreads over the bod y (may include the palms and soles), becoming generalized, and may coalesce in areas. T he rash lasts 4 to 7 days and is typically not itchy. Complications that may result include di arrhea, otitis media (middle ear infection), pneumonia, and encephalitis (inflammation of the br ain and/or spinal cord). Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Measles is transmitted person to person by respira tory droplets and through direct contact with nasal and throat secret ions or items freshly soiled with these secretions. Airborne transmission via aerosolized d roplet nuclei can also occur in enclosed areas up to two hours after an infected person has occupied the area. Measles is one of the most communicable infectious diseases. Incubation Period: Commonly10 to 12 days from exposure to prodrome (r ange, 7 to 21 days). The rash usually appears approximately 14 days afte r exposure. Period of Communicability: Measles is highly infectious, with greater than 90 % secondary attack rates among persons who are susceptible. Mea sles can be transmitted from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Temporal Pattern: In temperate areas, measles disease occurs primari ly in late winter or spring. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness characterized by: generalized, maculopapular rash lasting 3 days; and temperature 101.0 o F (38.3 o C); and Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Fact Sheet 2 cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis. Case Classification: Probable: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, an illn ess that meets the clinical description with o no epidemiologic linkage to a laboratory-confirmed measles case; and o no measles laboratory testing. Confirmed: An acute febrile rash illness with: o isolation of measles virus from clinical specimen; or o detection of measles virus-specific nucleic acid f rom a clinical specimen using polymerase chain reaction; or o IgG seroconversion or a significant rise in measle s immunoglobulin M antibody; or o direct epidemiologic linkage to a case confirmed b y one of the methods above. *Comment: Two probable cases that are epidemiologi cally linked would be considered confirmed cases, even in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Epidemiologic classification of internationally-imp orted and U.S.-acquired Internationally imported case: An internationally imported case is defined as a case in which measles results from exposure to meas les virus outside the United States as evidenced by at least some of the exposur e period (7-21 days before rash onset) occurring outside the United States and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering the United States and there is no known ex posure to measles in the U.S. during that time. All other cases are considered U.S.-acquired U.S.-acquired case: An U.S.-acquired case is defined as a case in whic h the patient had not been outside the United States during the 2 1 days before rash onset or was known to have been exposed to measles within the Un ited States. Genotype identification by a WHO reference laborato ry (CDC or a public health laboratory that has vali dated their measles virus sequence analysis) is required to dis tinguish wild type from vaccine strain if vaccinate d within 18 days of rash onset. U.S.-acquired cases are sub-classified into four mu tually exclusive groups: o Import-linked case: Any case in a chain of transmission that is epidemiologically linked to an internationally impo rted case. o Imported-virus case: a case for which an epidemiologic link to an internationally imported case was not identified, b ut for which viral genetic evidence indicates an imported measles genotype, i. e., a genotype that is not Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Fact Sheet 3occurring within the United States in a pattern ind icative of endemic transmission. An endemic genotype is the genotype of any measles virus that occurs in an endemic chain of transmission (i.e., lasting 12 months). Any genotype that is found repeatedly in U.S.-acquired cases should be t horoughly investigated as a potential endemic genotype, especially if the cas es are closely related in time or location. o Endemic case: a case for which epidemiological or virological ev idence indicates an endemic chain of transmission. Endemic transmission is defined as a chain of measles virus transmission that is co ntinuous for 12 months within the United States. o Unknown source case: a case for which an epidemiological or virological link to importation or to endemic transmission with in the United States cannot be established after a thorough investigation. Thes e cases must be carefully assessed epidemiologically to assure that they do n ot represent a sustained U.S.-acquired chain of transmission or an endemic c hain of transmission within the United States. Note: Internationally imported, import-linked, and imported-virus cases are considered collectively to be import-associated cas es. Note: U.S.-acquired cases may be classified further into two mutually exclusive groups: o Out-of-state importation: an out-of-state imported case is defined as a case in which measles resulted from exposure to measles virus outside of the state of Georgia, as evidenced by at least some of the ex posure period (at least 7- 21 days before rash onset) occurring outside of Geo rgia and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering Georgia, and t here is no known exposure to measles in Georgia. . o In-state acquired: an in-state case is defined as a case in which mea sles resulted from exposure to measles virus within the state of Georgia, as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period ( at least 7-21 days before rash onset) occurring in Georgia. Laboratory testing: Laboratory confirmation is essential for all outbre aks and all sporadic measles cases. Diagnostic tests used to confirm infection include isolation o f the measles virus by culture; polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and serologic testing. Detect ion of measles-specific IgM antibody and measles RNA by real-time RT-PCR are the most common methods for confirmation of measles infection. Efforts should be made to obtain a serum sample and throat swab (or nasopharyngeal swab) from suspected cases at first contact. Urine samples may also contain virus and when feasible to do so, collection of both respiratory a nd urine samples can increase the likelihood of Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Fact Sheet 4detecting virus. DPH staff is available for consult ation and can assist with confirmatory testing as needed for measles. Because measles is a rare disease in the United Sta tes, even with the excellent laboratory tests available, false positive results for measles IgM w ill occur. To minimize the problem of false positive laboratory results, it is important to res trict case investigation and laboratory tests to patients most likely to have measles (i.e., those w ho meet the clinical case definition, especially if they have risk factors for measles, such as bein g unvaccinated, recent history of travel abroad, without an alternative explanation for symp toms, for example epi-linked to known parvovirus case) or those with fever and generalize d maculopapular rash with strong suspicion of measles. During a measles investigation when community aware ness is increased, many cases of febrile rash illness may be reported as suspected measles, and the magnitude of the situation may be exaggerated if these cases are included in the abse nce of laboratory confirmation. This is particularly important as the investigation is endi ng; at that point, laboratory confirmation should be sought for all suspected cases. Rarely, suspecte d cases may include vaccinated individuals. For these cases, laboratory confirmation may be cha llenging. An overview of diagnostic tools is described below. Virus isolation and measles RNA detection (RT-PCR) Clinical specimens for real-time polymerase chain r eaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation should be collected at the same time as s amples taken for serologic testing. The preferred specimens for virus isolation or RT-P CR are throat or nasopharyngeal swabs, but urine may also contain virus. Virus isol ation and RNA detection are more likely to be successful when the specimens are coll ected early (ideally within three days of rash onset, but up to ten days post rash ma y be successful). Isolation of measles virus in culture or detection of measles RN A by RT-PCR in clinical specimens confirms the diagnosis of measles. Howeve r, a negative culture or negative RT-PCR results do not rule out measles bec ause both methods are much affected by the timing of specimen collection and t he quality and handling of the clinical specimens. Successful isolation of measles virus in culture or direct detection of measles RNA by RT-PCR in the clinical sample is particularly he lpful for case confirmation when serology results are inconclusive Serologic testing The GDPH can provide guidance regarding available l aboratory services. At the direction of the GDPH, health care providers and st ate and local health departments may send serum specimens from suspected measles cas es to the CDC measles laboratory.

Immunity: Acceptable presumptive evidence of measles immunity includes at least one of the following: 1. Written documentation of adequate vaccination: r eceipt of one or more doses of a measles-containing vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool- age children and adults not at high risk, and two d oses of measles-containing vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk for exposure transmission (i.e., health care personnel, international travele rs, and students at post-high school educational institutions); or Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Fact Sheet 62. Laboratory evidence of immunity; or 3. Birth before 1957 (for healthcare providers this does not suffice as evidence of immunity) 4. Laboratory confirmation of disease Vaccination: The current recommendation is a two-dose schedule. The first dose should be given at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at four through six years (school entry). Both doses can be given as MMR or MMRV vacc ine. For any child older than six who has not received one or both doses, any opportunity to immunize should be utilized. Travel Recommendations: Children aged 6-11 months who travel international ly should receive one dose of MMR vaccine optimally at least two weeks prior to travel. Because serologic response to the measles component of the vaccine varies among infants aged 6-11 months, children vaccinated before age 12 months sh ould receive two additional doses of MMR or MMRV vaccine on or after the first birthday acco rding to the routine recommended schedule. Children aged 12 months and adults who plan to travel outside the United States should receive two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at l east 28 days. Other presumptive evidence of immunity includes laboratory evidence, or birth before 1957, or laboratory confirmation of disease. Treatment: Supportive care only. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Measles vaccine is effective in preventing infecti on or modifying the severity of illness if given within 72 hours of exposure. Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modify disease and provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of exposure. Transmission is likely in households, schools, and other institutions. Immune globulin (IG) may be especially indicated for susceptible contacts in these settings, particularly contacts younger than 1 year of age and immunocompromised contacts. Investigation: Measles and rubella must be ruled out whenever illn ess involving fever and rash are reported. The investigation must be started immediately when a potential case is identified. Essential components of the case investigation incl ude the following: a. Obtain a detailed history of illness progression and a rash description b. Obtain a detailed travel history c. Establish a diagnosis by obtaining laboratory sp ecimens for serology, viral isolation and PCR as early as possible (consult with GDPH regarding the case before collecting and submitting specimens) d. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization his tory. e. Identify the source of infection and transmissio n setting. f. Assess potential transmission and identify conta cts. g. For symptomatic contacts, obtain specimens for s erology, virus isolation and PCR if measles is suspected. h.

Call the State Epidemiology Section (404) 657-25 88 IMMEDIATELY . If after business hours, report suspect case to 1-866- PUB-H LTH. 2. Contact the parent(s) or guardian and reporting physician immediately to obtain a detailed clinical and exposure history of the patie nt. Ask parent(s) about any out-of-town travel or visi tors during the 7-21 days prior to rash onset. Identify any person(s) or group(s) exposed by the patient 4 days before to 4 days after rash onset. 3. Complete the Measles Case Report Form (https://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files /ADES_Measles_Case_Report_F orm_2015_1.pdf ). Read the instructions carefully and complete as much of the form as possible. Do not leave any item blank. If info rmation is not available, enter \"none\" or \"NA\".

Do not wait for laboratory confirmation to fax the report. Outbreak Control Strategy: All reports of suspected measles cases should be investigated rapidly. Control activities should not be delayed until la boratory results on suspected cases are received. A measles outbreak exists in a community whenever there is one confirmed case of measles. Once this occurs, preventing disseminatio n of measles depends on promptly vaccinating susceptible persons and limiting the nu mber of exposures to infectious cases. All persons who cannot readily provide documentation of measles immunity (see ACIP Statement on Measles Prevention, dated 5/22/98) should be vac cinated or excluded from the setting (e.g. school). Documentation of vaccination is adequate only if the date of vaccination is provided. Persons who have been exempted from measles vaccina tion for medical or religious reasons should be excluded from the outbreak area for at le ast 21 days after the onset of rash in the last case of measles. Institution-based outbreaks During outbreaks in day care centers, elementary, m iddle, junior and senior high schools, colleges and other institutions of higher education, a program of mandatory revaccination with MMR vaccine should be conducted in the affected schools. Revaccination should include all students and their siblings and all school personnel born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentat ion of receipt of two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of measles immunity. Students and personnel receiving their first dose as part of an outbreak control program may be immediately readmit ted to school. A second dose should be given in 28 days. If there is an unconfi rmed but clinically compatible case in a school, the response should be phased in. Rei mmunization should be recommended but not mandatory until the case is con firmed. Proceed with the epidemiologic work on the case. Search for a sourc e, immunize siblings and close contacts when appropriate, ensure an adequate suppl y of vaccine and begin to prepare for a school-based clinic. At this point, i t is very important to implement daily active surveillance of absenteeism of two or more d ays and any rashes should be followed up on immediately. New cases signal the i mmediate need for school-based clinics and the exclusion of children and staff who do not have two documented doses of measles vaccine. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Fact Sheet 9 Outbreaks among preschool-age children The risk of complications from measles is high amon g infants less than one (1) year of age. Therefore, considering the benefits and ri sks, vaccination with measles vaccine is recommended for infants as young as six (6) months of age when exposure to measles is considered likely. MMR may be used in children before the first birthday if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available. Infants vaccinated before the first birthday should be reva ccinated when they are 12 months old and at school entry to ensure adequate protecti on. Exposed children less than six months of age should receive measles IG. Individual s who receive MMR vaccine or IG as PEP should be monitored for signs and symptom s consistent with measles for at least one incubation period. Please consult GDPH prior to making post- exposure prophylaxis recommendations. Medical Settings If an outbreak occurs in a healthcare facility, all employees (including volunteers, trainees, nurses, physicians, technicians, receptio nists, and other clerical and support staff) are at an increased risk of exposure to measles, and all persons who work in such facilities in any capacity should be i mmune to measles to prevent any potential outbreak. All employees who were born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation of receipt of two doses of measles va ccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity to measles s hould receive a dose of measles vaccine. Personnel born before 1957 without docume ntation of measles immunity should receive one dose of MMR. Serologic screening of healthcare workers during an outbreak to determine measles immunity is not re commended, because stopping measles transmission requires the rapid vaccination of susceptible healthcare workers, which can be impeded by the need to screen and wait for results. Susceptible personnel who have been exposed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the 5th to the 21st day after the expo sure, regardless of whether they received vaccine or immunoglobulin after the exposu re. Those who become ill should be relieved from patient contact for seven d ays after they develop a rash. Reporting: Report all suspected, probable, or confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the State Epidemiology Section at 404-657- 2588.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Questions & Answers 11 What is measles? Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagi ous viral infection. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles typically begins with a fever, followed by cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or red, watery eyes. Two or three days after symptoms begin , tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin a ra sh appears. The rash begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and s pread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. The spots may become joined together as they spread from the head to the rest of the body. When the rash appears, a person's fever may spike to more than 10 4 oF. After a few days, the fever subsides and the rash fades. Is measles still common in the U.S.? Measles was declared eliminated from the United Sta tes in 2000. This was possible thanks to a highly effective vaccination program and better mea sles control in the Americas. However, measles is still common in many other countries and may be brought into the U.S. by unvaccinated travelers. Keeping U.S. measles immuni zation levels high is critical to preventing measles outbreaks. Who gets measles? People who have never received a measles-mumps-rube lla (MMR) vaccine or who are not up- to-date on their MMR have the highest risk of acqui ring measles. Particularly, children less than 12 months of age, who are not old enough to receive MMR, and immunocompromised persons have an increased risk. What complications are associated with measles? Complications from measles are more common among ch ildren less than 5 yrs. of age and adults 20 yrs. of age and older and are highest in infants, unimmunized pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons. Diarrhea, mid dle ear infection, and pneumonia are the most commonly reported complications. More seve re, but less common complications include inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), s eizures and death. How is measles spread? Measles is spread by air-borne droplets when an inf ected person coughs or sneezes, and through direct contact with respiratory secretions or items freshly soiled with these secretions. Airborne spread can also occur up to two hours afte r an infected person has occupied an enclosed area. Can a person who had measles get measles again? Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Questions & Answers 12 No. Permanent immunity is acquired after getting th e disease. How long is a person with measles contagious? A person with measles can spread it to others from four days before their rash appears to four days after it appears. How long can a person have measles? Generally, the fever resolves after 2 to 4 days, an d the rash resolves in 5 to 6 days. The length of recovery depends on whether other com plications are associated with the illness. How is measles treated? There is no specific treatment for measles. Treatme nt for measles is mainly supportive. People with measles need bed rest, fluids, and control of fever. Children with complications need specific treatment and should be under the care of a physician. What tests are available to diagnose measles? A diagnosis of measles should be confirmed through laboratory testing by your physician, and reported to the health department right away. This requires the collection and testing of blood, urine and/or throat samples. Results are most accur ate if testing occurs during the beginning stages of the disease. Is there a vaccine for measles? Yes. The measles vaccination is usually combined wi or mumps, rubella, should receive two doses of MMR vaccine: the first at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4 to 6 years of age. (During a me asles outbreak, children may receive the second dose as soon as four weeks after the fir st dose, no matter how old they are.) All adults who have not had measles or a measles s hot should receive MMR vaccine, particularly if they were born in 1957 or later. Certain adults (such as healthcare workers) should receive two doses of measles/MMR vaccine to make sure they're protected. My child has been exposed to measles, what should I do? If you think your child has been exposed to measles contact your doctor immediately. If your child has not been vaccinated, measles vaccine may prevent disease if given within 3 days after exposure. Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modif y disease and provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of exposure in pe rsons who cannot have the vaccine. Is it okay to take my child to public places (i.e. grocery store, daycare, playground)? Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Questions & Answers 13 If your child has been diagnosed with measles you s hould keep your child at home and away from public places until the disease has resolved (approximately 4 days after rash onset). All contact with persons who lack measles immunity, ar e immunocompromised, or pregnant should be avoided. Note: Call your physician's offi ce ahead of time to inform them that you are bringing in a child that has possibly been exposed to measles or has measles. This will allow the office to take precautions to assure no other c hildren are exposed. How can measles be prevented? Routine vaccination is the best way to prevent meas les. However, additional steps to prevent the spread of disease may include: Avoiding close contact with others who are coughin g or ill Washing hands often Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or cough and sneeze into your sleeve Stay home if ill Seek medical attention if measles-like symptoms de velop GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6.

To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory submission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgi a Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions Serologic Testing: Collect as soon as possible when measles infection is suspected, preferably at the onset of rash. Collect 7-10 ml of blood in a red top or serum sep arator tube (SST) Acute must be centrifuged and the serum transf erred into a transport tube for shipment. Keep specimens cold (4 o C or 39 o F) and ship overnight service. Do not freeze serum samples. Viral Testing: Collect a urine and throat swab at t he same time as serology. Virus is most frequently recovered within the first 3 days follow ing rash onset, but up to 7 days after rash onset is acceptable. If a few days have passed sinc e resolution of the rash collect only a urine specimen. Throat Swabs Use a viral transport kit if possible (such as that used to isolate influenz a or herpes simplex virus) Collect a throat swab by rubbing the posterior oro pharynx with a dry sterile cotton swab Place swab in a tube containing 2-3 mls of viral t ransport medium or other sterile isotonic solution (phosphate buffered saline or cell culture medium). Keep samples cold (4 o C or 39 o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ic e*. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Urine Specimens Collect 10-15 ml of urine in a screw top sterile c ontainer Keep samples cold (4 o C or 39 o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ic e*. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. *If shipment contains both serum and viral specimen s, ship together by overnight service on cold packs (do not freeze serum) GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Measles Specimen Collection and Submission Guidelin es 16 Interpretation of Measles Laboratory Test Results Serology o IgM: Measles infection is confirmed using measles IgM antibody testing of serum samples collected as soon as possible after symptom onset. A positive IgM test result indicates current/very recent infection or r einfection. As with any lab test, there can be false positive test results. o IgG: IgG alone is not diagnostic unless you obtain both an acute (can be done as soon after onset as the patient is seen, but ideall y four to five days after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (from two to four weeks after onset) blood specimen for serologic tests to determine if a four -fold rise in IgG antibody titer has occurred (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:320). In vaccina ted persons it may not be possible to detect a four-fold rise in measles IgG antibody titer in paired serum samples (acute and convalescent). In such persons, the existing IgG will begin to rise soon after exposure and infection. At the time of onset of symptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, and obviate the 4fold rise observed in the convalescent serum s pecimen. PCR o Sequence analysis of an RT-PCR product derived fro m a virus isolate or from clinical material confirms a presumptive positive P CR result and provides epidemiologically important information Viral Culture o Isolation of measles virus from any clinical speci men constitutes laboratory confirmation of measles Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Mumps virus. Brief Description: An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilat eral swelling of the parotid gland or other salivary gland(s) (parotitis), and w ithout other apparent cause. Symptoms such as myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-gr ade fever may precede parotitis by several days. Asymptomatic infections also occur; parotiti s is present in only 30-40% of infected persons. Not all cases of parotitis - especially s poradic ones - are due to mumps infection; however, mumps is the only known cause of epidemic parotitis. Complications can include meningitis, arthritis, inflammation of the testicle s or ovaries, inflammation of the pancreas and deafness. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Airborne, by droplet spread, or by direct contact with saliva of an infected person. Incubation Period: 14 to 18 days (range, 14-25 days) Period of Communicability: Persons with mumps are usually considered infectio us from 2 days before until 4 days after onset of parotitis. Virus has been isolated from saliva from 7 days before parotitis and 9 days after onset of illness. Temporal Pattern: Mumps incidence peaks predominantly in late winter and spring, but the disease has been reported throughout the year. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilate ral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary gland(s), lasting greater than or equal to 2 days, and without other apparent cause. Case Classification: Suspected: o parotitis, acute salivary gland swelling, orchitis , or oophoritis unexplained by another more likely diagnosis, OR o a positive lab result with no mumps clinical sympt oms (with or without epidemiological linkage to a confirmed or probable case). Probable: o Acute parotitis or other salivary gland swelling l asting at least 2 days, or orchitis or oophoritis unexplained by another more likely di agnosis, in: /square4 a person with a positive test for serum anti-mumps IgM antibody, or /square4 a person with epidemiologic linkage to another pro bable or confirmed case or linkage to a group/community defined by pub lic health during an outbreak of mumps.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Fact Sheet 2 Confirmed : o A positive mumps laboratory confirmation for mumps virus with RT-PCR or culture in a patient with an acute illness characte rized by any of the following: /square4 Acute parotitis or other salivary gland import status Internationally imported case: An internationally imported case is defined as a c ase in which mumps results from exposure to mumps virus ou tside the United States as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period ( 12-25 days before onset of parotitis or other mumps-associated complications) occurring outside the United States and the onset of parotitis or other mumpsassociated complic ations within 25 days of entering the United States and no known exposure to mumps in the U.S. during that time. All other cases are considered U.S.-acquired cases. U.S.-acquired case : A U.S.-acquired case is defined as a case in which the patient had not been outside the United States during the 25 da ys before onset of parotitis or other mumps-associated complications or was known to have been exposed to mumps within the United States. U.S.-acquired cases are sub-classified into four mu tually exclusive groups: o Import-linked case : Any case in a chain of transmission that is epide miologically linked to an internationally imported case. o Imported-virus case: A case for which an epidemiologic link to an inter nationally imported case was not identified but for which vira l genetic evidence indicates an imported mumps genotype (i.e., a genotype that is n ot occurring within the United States in a pattern indicative of endemic transmiss ion). An endemic genotype is the genotype of any mumps virus that occurs in an e ndemic chain of transmission (i.e., lasting 12 months). Any genotype that is found repeatedly i n U.S.-acquired cases should be thoroughly investigat ed as a potential endemic genotype, especially if the cases are closely relat ed in time or location. o Endemic case : A case for which epidemiological or virological e vidence indicates an endemic chain of transmission. Endemic transmission is defined as a chain of mumps virus transmission continuous for 12 months within the United States. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Fact Sheet 3o Unknown source case: A case for which an epidemiological or virological link to importation or to endemic transmission within the U .S. cannot be established after a thorough investigation. These cases must be carefully assessed epidemiologically to assure that they do not repres ent a sustained U.S.-acquired chain of transmission or an endemic chain of transm ission within the U.S. Laboratory Testing: If mumps is suspected, laboratory testing should be performed. Acute mumps infection can be detected by the presence of serum mumps IgM, a sign ificant rise in IgG in acute and convalescent-phase serum specimens, IgG serocon version, positive mumps virus culture, or detection of virus by real-time reverse transcri ptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). However, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated person s, false positive results can occur because assays may be affected by other diagnostic entities that cause parotitis. In addition, laboratory confirming the diagnosis of mumps in hig hly vaccinated populations may be challenging, and serologic tests should be interpre ted with caution because false negative results in vaccinated persons (i.e., a negative ser ologic test in a person with true mumps) are common. With previous contact with mumps virus eith er through vaccination (particularly with two doses) or natural infection, serum mumps IgM te st results may be negative; IgG test results may be positive at the initial blood draw; and vira l detection in RT-PCR or culture may have low yield if the buccal swab is collected more than thr ee days after parotitis onset. Therefore, mumps cases should not be ruled out by negative lab oratory results. These challenges are discussed in more detail below. Virus detection (real-time RT-PCR and culture) Mumps virus can be detected from fluid collected fr om the parotid duct, other affected salivary gland ducts, the throat, from uri ne, and from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Parotid duct swabs yield the best viral samp le. This is particularly true when the salivary gland area is massaged approximately 3 0 seconds prior to swabbing the buccal/parotid duct, so that the specimen contains the secretions from the parotid or other salivary duct glands. Efforts should be made to obtain the specimen as soon as possible after onset of parotitis or meningitis. Cl inical specimens should ideally be obtained within three days and not more than eight days after parotitis onset. Urine samples are less likely than oral specimens t o contain sufficient virus copies or virus infected cells for culture or detection by mo lecular methods, and therefore are not preferred. o Unvaccinated persons: Virus may be isolated from t he buccal mucosa until 11-14 days after salivary enlargement; however, viral iso lation is most likely to be successful just prior to and within the first three days of parotitis onset. o Vaccinated persons: In order to optimize virus yie ld, emphasis should be placed on obtaining mumps clinical specimens from buccal m ucosa within 1 to 3 days after onset of symptoms (usually parotitis). Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Fact Sheet 4In the case of specimens for virus culture or PCR a ssay, immediately place specimens in a cold storage container and transport to the laboratory. Serologic testing The serologic tests available for laboratory confir mation of mumps acute infection and confirmation of previous exposure to mumps vary among laboratories. At the initial visit, a serum specimen should be ob tained to test for mumps IgM antibodies. o If the acute-phase specimen is positive for IgM, a second specimen is not necessary. o A second negative IgM does not rule out mumps unle ss the IgG result is also negative. Paired serum specimens may also be used to demonstr ate seroconversion from negative to positive from acute to convalescent, wh ich is considered a positive diagnostic result for mumps. In unvaccinated indivi duals, a four-fold increase in IgG titers is also considered a positive diagnostic res ult for mumps, but these are rarely done. Tests for IgM antibody Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): a highly specific test fo r diagnosing acute mumps infection. The use of the IgM capture EIA is prefer red over the Immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Immunofluorescence assay (IFA): a test that is rela tively inexpensive and simple, but the IFA format is particularly susceptible to inter ference by high levels of mumps- specific IgG. Reading the test requires considerabl e skill and experience since this nonspecific staining may cause false positive readi ngs if the serum is not treated with an agent to remove human IgG antibody. Note: Commercially available EIA kits and IFA antibody as says for detection of mumps IgM are not currently FDA-approved. Therefore , each laboratory must validate these tests independently. Serum collection and timing of the mumps IgM respon se Unvaccinated persons: IgM antibody is detectable wi thin 5 days after onset of symptoms, reaches a maximum level about a week afte r onset, and remains elevated for several weeks or months. If an acute-phase serum sample collected 3 days after parotitis onset is negative for IgM, tes ting a second sample collected 5-7 days after symptom onset is recommended since the I gM response may require more time to develop. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Fact Sheet 5Vaccinated persons: Patients that mount a secondary immune response to mumps, as seen in most previously vaccinated persons, may not have an IgM response or it may be transient and not detected depending on the timing of specimen collection.Because of this, a high number of false negative results may occur in previously vaccinated individuals. False positive I gM results may also occur and appear to be more prevalent with certain IgM test f ormats, such as the IFA. There is some evidence that serum collected 10 days after parotitis onset may improve the ability to detect IgM among persons who have receiv ed one or two doses of MMR vaccine. However, persons with a history of mumps v accination may not have detectable mumps IgM antibody regardless of the tim ing of specimen collection. Tests for IgG antibody Tests for IgG antibody may be used for mumps diagno sis or for testing mumps immunity. A variety of tests for IgG antibodies to mumps are available and include EIA, IFA, and plaque reduction neutralization. The specific criteria for documenting an increase in titer depend on the test. Diagnosis of Mumps with IgG IgG testing for laboratory confirmation of mumps re quires the demonstration of seroconversion from negative to positive by EIA or a four-fold rise in the titer of antibody against mumps as measured in plaque-reduct ion neutralization assays or similar quantitative assays. The tests for IgG anti body should be conducted on both acute- and convalescent-phase specimens at the same time. The same type of test should be used on both specimens. EIA values are no t titers, and increases in EIA values do not directly correspond to titer rises. Unvaccinated persons: In unvaccinated persons, IgG antibody increases rapidly after onset of symptoms and is long lasting. Vaccinated persons: In vaccinated persons, the IgG may already be quite elevated in the acute-phase blood sample which frequently preve nts detection of a four-fold rise in IgG titer in the convalescent serum specimen. Testing Mumps Immunity IgG A single serum sample tested for mumps-specific IgG is not useful for diagnosing acute mumps infections. The presence of mumps-speci fic IgG, as detected using a serologic assay (EIA or IFA), is considered evidenc e of mumps immunity but does not necessarily predict the presence of neutralizin g antibodies or protection from mumps disease.

Vaccination: Live attenuated mumps virus vaccine is recommende d for persons > 12 months of age unless medically contraindicated or unless a person is immune as defined by documentation of 1) immunization with at least one dose of live mumps vaccine on or after the first birthday, 2) serological evidence of mumps im munity, 3) physician diagnosis of mumps, or 4) birth before 1957. Under the current 2-dose sch edule, most children and adolescents receive two doses of mumps-containing vaccine. Mumps vacci ne, as MMR or MMRV, is recommended at 12-15 months of age and 4-6 years of age. For mo re detailed vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in C hapter 2 of this manual. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: There is no evidence that giving mumps vaccine pro vides protection to those already exposed. However, in t hose susceptible persons who were exposed but not infected, the vaccine will provide future i mmunity, and its use in these situations is not contraindicated.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Questions & Answers 10 What is mumps? Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects t he saliva glands located between the ear and the jaw. What are the symptoms of mumps? Low-grade fever Headache Muscle aches Tiredness Loss of appetite Swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears or jaw on one or both sides of the face (parotitis) What are the complications associated with mumps? Up to 30 percent of all people infected with the mu mps virus do not have symptoms. Orchitis (swelling of the testicles) is a common symptom in males after puberty. Rarely, swelling of the spinal cord and brain (encephalitis) occurs. How is mumps diagnosed? Suspected mumps cases may be diagnosed by a health care provider by looking at symptoms and laboratory test results. Health care providers may collect samples from the nose and throat, as well as urine and blood samples to test for the virus. There are other illnesses that can cause similar symptoms, so it is important that the corre ct laboratory testing is done. How is mumps spread? The virus is found in fluids from the mouth and nos e of someone with mumps. The virus is spread when fluid containing the virus gets in your nose, mouth, or eyes. This can happen when a person with mumps coughs or sneezes near you, or by touching the fluid and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Sharing beverage contain ers, eating utensils, cigarettes, and kissing are other examples of how the virus can be spread i n fluids between individuals. How long is a person able to spread mumps? Mumps can normally be spread three days before symp toms appear through about four days after. Mumps is most contagious 48 hours before the illness begins. Is there a vaccine for mumps? Mumps vaccine is contained in the MMR vaccine (Meas les, Mumps, Rubella). Two doses of the vaccine are needed for long-term protection. Georgi a state law requires that all children in child care settings or schools, be vaccinated against mum ps or have a legal exemption. Learn more about MMR vaccine at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/v isstatements/mmr.html. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Questions & Answers 11 What can be done to prevent the spread of mumps? The best way to prevent mumps is to be fully immuni zed. Persons who have mumps should stay at home for five days after swelling starts so that they do not spread it to others. Is there a treatment for mumps? There is no treatment for mumps, only symptom care. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Mumps Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 12 MUMPS: SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES Mumps should be considered in the differential diag nosis of patients presenting with parotitis or swel ling of the salivary glands, regardless of vaccination h istory. Serologic testing (including mumps IgM and acute and convalescent mumps IgG), viral culture, a nd polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) are strongly recommended to support the clinical diagno sis. The Georgia Department of Public Health strongly re commends the collection of serum for mumps IgM/IgG antibody testing and collection of a buccal swab for viral isolation/PCR testing to confirm a mumps case . To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory submission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgi a Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Preve ntion (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions: Serologic Testing : Collect as soon as possible when mumps infection is suspected, preferably at the onset of parotid swelling. Collect 7-10 ml of blood in a red top or serum separator tube (SST). -Acute serum (IgM and first days after symptom onset -Convalescent serum (second IgG ): collect within 2-5 weeks after symptom onset SST tubes must be centrifuged and the serum poured into a transport tube for shipment. Store specimens cold (using ice packs or dry ice) and ship by overnight service. Do not freeze serum samples. Viral Testing : Collect a buccal swab* at the same time as serolo gy. Virus is most frequently recovered within the first 3 days following the onset of symp toms. Samples may be positive in unvaccinated perso ns up to 10 days post onset, however among suspected c ases that have received 1 or more doses of MMR, virus may clear much earlier. * The buccal cavity is the space near the upper rea r molars between the cheek and the teeth. PCR Testing: Collect a buccal swab by asking the patient to mas sage the parotid gland area (buccal cavity) for about 30 seconds Use a synthetic swab from a viral transport kit (such as influenza or herpes simplex viral transport) to collect buccal secretions. Place swab in the tube containing 2-3 mls of viral transport medium (e.g., MEM or Hanks Balanced Salt Solution) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ic e*. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles If there is more than 1 day delay in shipping the samples to the state lab or CDC for testing, the buccal swab or throat swab is best preserved at -70 degrees Celsius or -94 degrees Fahrenheit GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6.

A positive IgM test result indicates current/very recent infection or r einfection. As with any lab test, there can be false positive test results. If the suspecte d case has received one or more doses of MMR, the IgM response may be missing, dela yed, or transient. o IgG: IgG alone is not diagnostic unless you obtai n both an acute (can be done as soon after onset as the patient is seen, but ideall y four to five days after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (from two to four weeks after onset) blood specimen for serologic tests to determine if a four-fold ris e in IgG antibody titer has occurred (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:320). In vaccinated persons it may not be possible to detect a four-fold rise in mumps IgG antibody titer in paire d serum samples (acute and convalescent). In such persons, the existing IgG w ill begin to rise soon after exposure and infection. At the time of onset of sym ptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, and o bviate the four-fold rise observed in convalescent serum specimen. PCR o Mumps viral RNA may be detected from viral samples prior to onset of parotitis until 5-9 days after parotitis (1-4 days is optimal for v irus collection). Among previously immunized suspected cases, mumps virus detection is an important method of confirming the case. o However, the interpretation of a positive RT- PCR result without demonstration of mumps growth in tissue culture must be interpreted carefully, particularly among persons whose symptoms do not meet the clinical def inition of mumps o Sequence analysis of a RT-PCR product derived from a virus isolate or from clinical material confirms the presumptive positive PCR resu lts and provides epidemiologically important information.

Surveillance And is a that can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, but is most often as sociated with meningitis. Meningococcal serogrouping is based on the antigenic structure of the polysaccharide capsule, with five serogroups causing the majority of disease: A, B, C , Y, and W-135. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Spread through respiratory droplets, normally requi ring direct contact with saliva and respiratory secretions. Up to 5%-10% of people may be asymptomatic carriers with nasopharyngeal colonizat ion. Incubation Period: 2 to 10 days, commonly 3-4 days Period of Communicability: As long as organisms are present in discharge from the nose and mouth. Cases are considered non-infectious 24 h ours after starting effective antibiotic therapy. Temporal Pattern: Meningococcal disease occurs throughout the year, however, the incidence is highest in the late winter and early s pring. Class Classification: Suspected : clinical purpura fulminans in the absence of a po sitive blood culture or gram-negative diplococci (not yet identified) is olated from a normally sterile body site Probable : Detection of N. meningitidis in formalin-fixed ti ssue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in CSF by latex agglu tination Confirmed : Isolation of N. meningitidis from a normally ste rile site or from purpuric lesions Laboratory Testing: Isolation of N. meningitidis from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or less commonly, joint fluid). Invasive disease may take a variety of forms, including septicemia, meningitis, pneumon ia, or septic arthritis. Gram stain of CSF showing gram-negative diplococci suggests meningoco ccus, and rt-PCR is Neisseria meningitidis DNA. Diagnostic testing-Serotype Testing: 1.

Surveillance And Reporting Neisseria Meningitidis Fact Sheet 2 Vaccination: A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) was licensed in 1981 to protect against serogroups A, C, Y and W-135, for p ersons ages 2 years and older. In 2005, a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was licens ed for use in persons ages 11 to 55, which protects against the same four serogroups. M CV4 is the preferred product for individuals aged 2 through 55, and MPSV4 should be used for adults 56 and older. As of January 2015, two vaccines are licensed by the FDA that cover serogroup B for specified risk groups. Persons ages 2 through 55 with persistent complement component deficiency or asplenia should receive an initial series of 2 dose s of MCV4, 2 months apart, with a booster every 5 years. Persons with complement component de ficiencies or asplenia age 56 and older should receive one dose of MPSV4 and a booste r every 5 years. A bivalent vaccine that provides protection against meningococcal sero groups C and Y along with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Hib-MenCY-TT is licensed fo r use in children aged 6 weeks through 18 months with persistent complement component defi ciency. As of January 2015, two vaccines are licensed by th e FDA that cover serogroup B. MenB vaccine should be administered as either a 2-dose s eries of MenB-4C or a 3-dose series of MenB-FHbp. The same vaccine product should be used for all doses. They are recommended for certain persons aged 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease should receive MenB vaccine. These persons include: Persons with persistent complement component defici encies.\u00b6 Persons with anatomic or functional asplenia.** Microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis . Persons identified as at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak. MenB vaccines are not licensed for children aged <1 0 years and are not currently recommended for children aged 2 months-9 years or o ther groups. For more information on vaccines against serotype B and appropriate adminis tration of the vaccine, reference http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6422a3.h tm . For full information on ACIP recommendations for th e various meningococcal vaccines, refer to the ACIP guideline document: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.h tm . Investigation: The Bacterial Meningitis and Sepsis Investigation a nd Control Manual (found at http://dph.georgia.gov/neisseria-meningitidis ) should be used to investigate suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of Neisseria meningitidis. Household members and close contacts in the 7 days before illness onset should be given prophylactic antibiotics; close contact is defined as having direct contact with sa liva and respiratory secretions, such as kissing, sharing utensils or beverages, etc. Indiv iduals who frequently slept or ate in the same dwelling as the ill person during the 7 days b efore illness onset should receive chemoprophylaxis. Also at risk are healthcare work ers who performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or unprotected intubation up to 7 day s before illness onset. The risk of secondary cases is highest within a few days after the index case occurs, but after 14 days, risk of secondary disease returns to baseline and p rophylaxis is of little value. Prophylaxis and Follow-Up of Contacts: Prophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible after exposure to a meningococcal disease case, and must occur within 14 days.

Surveillance And Reporting -06/2015 Neisseria Meningitidis Questions & Answers 1 What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. These bacteria are found only in humans. These are multiple meningococ cal serogroups (types), but the most important of these are A, B, C, Y, & W-135. The two most common forms of meningococcal disease are: meningitis, a bacterial infection of t he fluid and covering of the spinal cord and brain; and septicemia (meningococcemia), an infecti on of the bloodstream. Who is at risk? Household and other close contacts exposed to a per son with meningococcal disease within 7 days before onset of illness are at high risk and should receive antibiotic prophylaxis (see \"Investigation\" below). Outbreaks have occurred amo ng college students and in daycares, however only 5% of cases are associated with outbre ak with the rest being sporadic cases. In addition to routine vaccination of adolescents, ACIP also recommends vaccination for people who have complement component deficiencies, people without a functioning spleen, microbiologists who routinely are exposed to isolat es of N. meningitidis, military recruits, and people who travel to or reside in areas in which me ningococcal disease is epidemic. Rates of meningococcal disease are highest during infancy, t hen fall during childhood, rising again during adolescence. How are meningococcal bacteria spread? The bacteria are transmitted from person-to-person in secretions from the nose and throat. Exposure to oral secretions may occur during close social contact such as kissing or sharing utensils, or to medical personnel through unprotect ed contact during intubation or mouth-to- mouth resuscitation. They are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air near an infected person, but require close contact. The bacteria can live outside the body for only a few minutes; so, if the germs contaminate a desk or book, they soon die and won't infect a person who touches it later. As many as 2 in 10 people carry the bacteria in the back of the nose and throat at any given time, especiall y in winter. Why only a very small number of those who have the bacteria in their nose and th roat develop disease while others remain healthy is not understood. What are the symptoms? Meningitis is characterized by high fever, headache , and stiff neck. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, confusion, sleepiness, an d sensitivity to light. Sepsis causes high fever, low blood pressure, and severe malaise and s hock. Meningococcal sepsis is sometimes associated with a characteristic petechia l or purpuric rash. Petechiae are pinpoint spots that do not blanch with pressure, and purpura are patches of discoloration similar to bruises. Both are caused by bleeding into the skin. How can meningococcal disease be prevented? Besides vaccination according to established guidel ines, general meningococcal prevention measures include avoiding first and second-hand tob acco smoke, using cough etiquette, and minimizing shared saliva. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Departmen t of Public Health NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS (MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance And Reporting -06/2015 Neisseria Meningitidis Questions & Answers 2 Who should be vaccinated? ACIP recommends routine vaccination with a quadriva lent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) for adolescents aged 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. College freshmen living in dormitories are at incre ased risk for disease and should be vaccinated with MCV4 before college entry if they h ave not been vaccinated previously. ACIP also recommends that persons age 2 to 55 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease be vaccinated with MCV4; MPSV 4 is recommended for adults 56 years and older who are at increased risk. This inc ludes travelers to or residents of countries in which the disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, a nd individuals who have terminal complement component deficiencies or asplenia. Vac cination recommendations for children with asplenia, sickle cell, or complement deficienc y are complex. Refer to the footnotes of the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons a ged 0 through 18 years - United States, 2015. For guidelines on booster doses amon g persons with high-risk conditions, refer to MMWR 2013 / 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.h tm . For other catch-up recommendations for these persons, and complete inf ormation on use of meningococcal vaccines, including guidance related to vaccination of persons at increased risk of infection, see MMWR March 22, 2013 / 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf . Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Bordetella pertussis bacterium Brief Description: Pertussis is an endemic disease worldwide that is m ost common in children and can be especially severe in infants le ss than 6 months of age. Children usually contract pertussis from a symptomatic household mem ber (e.g. older sibling, parent). Outbreaks occur periodically. Incidence and mortal ity rates declined markedly in the four decades following the introduction of the vaccine i n the 1940s. The disease shows cyclical peaks every 3-5 years with recent occurrences in 20 05 and 2010. National surveillance has shown an upward trend in disease incidence among 7 and 10 year olds, despite vaccination. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Transmitted person- to-person by droplets produce d from a cough or sneeze or by direct contact with secretion s from the respiratory tract. Pertussis is highly contagious, with 80% secondary attack rates among susceptible household contacts. Incubation Period: Typically 7-10 days (range 5-21 days) following e xposure. Signs and Symptoms: Pertussis typically begins with mild upper respir atory tract symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, and a mild cough (catarrhal stage). The cough becomes more severe over the next 1-2 weeks and dev elops into paroxysmal episodes (paroxysmal stage), often with a characteristic ins piratory whoop and commonly followed by vomiting (post-tussive vomiting). Fever is abse nt or minimal. Apnea and/or difficulty feeding frequently occurs in young infants, and may be the sole manifestation of early stage pertussis in this age group. Symptoms wane g radually over weeks to months (convalescent stage). Infants less than six months of age, adolescents, and adults often will not have the typical whoop. In mild cases adol escents and adults may have prolonged cough without paroxysms. The duration of classic pe rtussis is 6 to 10 weeks. Antimicrobial agents may alleviate the disease but only if given during the catarrhal stage. After the cough is established, antimicrobial agents are reco mmended primarily to limit the spread of B. pertussis organisms to others. Illness Progression : Stages: Catarrhal Paroxysmal Convalescent 1-2 weeks 1-6 weeks Weeks - Months Period of Communicability: Pertussis is highly communicable in the early cat arrhal stage before the paroxysmal cough stage. Thereafter, com municability decreases becoming negligible in about 3 weeks. Pertussis is most tra nsmissible during the catarrhal period and the first 2 weeks after cough onset (approximately 21 days). Temporal Pattern: Pertussis has no distinct seasonal pattern, but it may increase in the summer and fall. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 2 Susceptibility and Resistance: Susceptibility of nonimmunized individuals is uni versal. Cases can occur in previously immunized children, a dolescents and adults. Infection with pertussis confers prolonged immunity, but re-infect ion can occur. Protection of Contacts : Generally, post exposure antimicrobial prophylax is is recommended for all household contacts. Other cont acts are evaluated and managed on a case-by-case basis. Pertussis immunizations should be reviewed and updated, although vaccination may not prevent infection if given afte r exposure. Close contacts younger than 7 years of age who have not received 5 doses of Dip htheria, Tetanus toxoid, and acellular Pertussis vaccine (DTaP) or have not received a DT aP dose within 3 years should be given a dose as soon after exposure as possible. Ch ildren as young as 7 can be given a single dose of Tdap if they have missed one or more doses of DTaP. See below or Public Health Nursing Protocol for post exposure chemoprop hylaxis options . Isolation/Quarantine: Droplet precautions should be used for known cases. Cases should be removed from the presence of young childr en and infants, especially nonimmunized infants, until the case has received a t least 5 days of an appropriate antibiotic. Cases who do not receive antibiotics s hould be isolated for 3 weeks. Inadequately immunized close contacts less than 7 y ears of age should be excluded from school, day care, and public gatherings for 21 days after last exposure or until the cases and contacts have received at least 5 days of an ap propriate antibiotic.

Case Classification Comments: *Note: An illness meeting the clinical case definit ion should be classified as \"probable\" rather than \"confirmed\" if it occurs in a patient who has contact with an infant aged <1 year who is Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for pertus sis and has 1 sign or symptom and cough duration< 14 days (classified as \"probable\" case). Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 4 Laboratory testing: Pertussis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with prolonged cough with cyanosis, vomi ting or apnea, regardless of vaccination history. Nasopharyngeal secretions are the optimal specimens for isolating the pertussis bacterium and obtaining a lab confirmed diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal swabs for culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms and prior to antibiotic treatment. The tim e of collection will greatly impact the ability to detect B. pertussis. There is a greater likelihood of positive cultures and/or PCR in the first two weeks of symptomatic infection than during later we eks of illness. However, PCR may detect organisms for a prolonged period of time regardless of viability. Confirmatory laboratory testing should be performed on all suspect or probable case s. Isolation of B. pertussis by culture Isolation of B. pertussis by bacterial culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing pertussis. A positive culture for B. pertussis confirms the diagnosis of pertussis. Culture of the organism is also necessar y for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular typing. Although bacterial culture is specific for diagnosi s, it is relatively insensitive. Fastidious growth requirements make B. pertussis difficult to isolate. Isolation of the organism using direct plating is most successful du ring the catarrhal stage (i.e., first 1-2 weeks of cough). Success in isolating the organ ism declines if the patient has received prior antibiotic therapy effective against B. pertussis , if specimen collection has been delayed beyond the first 2 weeks of illnes s, and if the patient has been vaccinated. All persons with suspected cases of pertussis shoul d have a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab obtained from the posterior nasoph arynx for culture. For B. pertussis , nasopharyngeal aspirates will yield similar or hi gher rates of recovery than nasopharyngeal swabs; throat and anterior nasa l swabs yield unacceptably low rates of recovery. Therefore, specimens should be obtained from the posterior nasopharynx, not the throat. Specimens should be ob tained using polyester, rayon, nylon, or calcium alginate (not cotton) swabs and s hould be plated directly onto selective culture medium or placed in transport med ium. Regan-Lowe agar is generally used for culture; half-strength Regan-Low e should be used as the transport medium. Specimens should be transported o n cold packs and plated at the laboratory within 24 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an important too l for timely diagnosis of pertussis and is increasingly available to clinicia ns. PCR is a molecular technique used to detect DNA sequences of the Bordetella pert ussis bacterium, and unlike culture, does not require viable (live) bacteria pr esent in the specimen. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 5Despite these advantages, PCR can give results that are falsely-negative or falsely- positive. PCR results can be optimized by avoiding some of the more common pitfalls leading to inaccurate results. Although ea rly signs and symptoms of pertussis are often non-specific, only patients wit h signs and symptoms consistent with pertussis should be tested. Asymptomatic conta cts of confirmed cases should not be tested and testing of contacts should not be used for post-exposure prophylaxis decisions. Falsely-positive results may also occur as a result of specimen contamination, which can occur during spec imen collection and testing. The timing of PCR testing for pertussis can signifi cantly affect its ability to accurately diagnose the disease. PCR has optimal se nsitivity during the first 3 weeks of cough when bacterial DNA is still present in the nasopharynx. After the fourth week of cough, the amount of bacterial DNA r apidly diminishes, which increases the risk of obtaining falsely-negative re sults. Since its inclusion in the case definition in 1997, the proportion of cases confirmed by PCR has increased substantially, and many labora tories now use only PCR to confirm pertussis. However, as of March 2014, there are no standardized PCR assays for pertussis, and assay procedures, as well as sensitivity and specificity, can vary greatly between laboratories. Thus, interp retation criteria for diagnosis vary. Interpretation of PCR results, especially tho se with high cycle threshold (Ct) values should be done in conjunction with an evalua tion of signs and symptoms and available epidemiological information. While PCR is increasingly used as the sole diagnost ic test for pertussis, CDC recommends that PCR be used in conjunction with cul ture when feasible, rather than as an alternative test. Even when a laboratory has validated its PCR method, culturing for B. pertussis should continue; this is especially important to confirm the circulation of B. pertussis when an outbreak is sus pected. State laboratories should retain the capability to culture pertussis. Collection methods for PCR are similar to those for culture, and often the same sample can be used for both tests. However, calcium alginate swabs cannot be used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens for PCR. S wabs used solely for PCR (and not culture) testing may be placed in a steril e tube for transport to the laboratory. Use of liquid transport media is discou raged due to the risk of specimen contamination. Serologic Testing Commercial serologic tests for pertussis infection can be helpful for diagnosis, especially later in illness. However, there is no c ommercial kit approved by the FDA for diagnostic use. Cutoff points for diagnostic va lues of immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody to pertussis toxin (PT) have not been esta blished, and current IgA and IgM assays lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. I n the absence of recent immunization, an elevated serum IgG antibody to PT after 2 weeks of onset of cough is suggestive of recent B. pertussis infection. An increasing titer or a single Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 6IgG anti-PT value of approximately 100 IU/mL or gre ater (using standard reference sera as a comparator) can be used for diagnosis. As of December 2014, positive serology results from commercial laboratories are n ot confirmatory for the purpose of reporting. A single-point serologic assay has be en validated at the Massachusetts state public health laboratory for pe rsons aged 11 years or older and is used for clinical diagnosis and reporting in that state only. A serologic test performed at CDC or at the Massachusetts state labo ratory might be used to help investigate outbreaks. In states other than Massach usetts, cases meeting the clinical case definition that are serologically pos itive but not culture or PCR positive should be reported as probable cases. Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) Testing Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of nasoph aryngeal secretions is sometimes used to screen for pertussis; however, CD C no longer recommends DFA for diagnosing pertussis. Cases meeting the cli nical case definition that are DFA positive but not culture or PCR positive should be reported as probable cases.

Transport requirements: The swabs should be plac ed in a sterile container and shipped overnight with ice packs. Vaccination: Beginning in 1996 acellular pertussis vaccines wer e recommended for all doses in the pertussis vaccine series, replacing the whole-c ell vaccines which previously had been used. All acellular vaccines are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTaP vaccine). Children should receive four doses of vaccine, with the firs t three doses administered at 4- to 8-week intervals, beginning at 6 weeks to 2 months of age. The fourth dose should be given 6-12 months after the third dose (17-20 months for Dapta cel). Children who receive four doses of DTaP before their fourth birthday should receive a booster dose of DTaP at 4 to 6 years of age. In children younger than seven years old, DTaP vacc ines efficacy ranges from 71% to 84%. Tdap vaccine is a formulation licensed for use in p ersons ages 10-64, and should be given as a one-time dose in lieu of a booster dose of Td. For more detailed vaccination information for either Tdap or DTaP, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and P ertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Investigation: Once notified of a suspect pertussis case: 1. Contact case/guardian AND health care provider I MMEDIATELY to obtain a detailed description of the clinical presentation. a. Use the Pertussis Case Report Form to assist in interviewing the case/guardian 2. Determine whether the case has clinically compat ible signs and symptoms 3. If the case-patient has clinically compatible si gns and symptoms, employ the control guidelines detailed below 4. Assist with the coordination of specimen collect ion (See Appendix B) if necessary a. If the case-patient has been coughing for 1-2 we eks, collect a specimen for culture and/or PCR testing at the Georgia Public He atlh Laboratory (GPHL). b. If the case-patient has been coughing for 3 week s collect a specimen for PCR (NOTE: State Epi approval must be obtained before a ny pertussis specimen is submitted to GPHL for testing) 5. Report/ensure reporting of case in SendSS 6. Update the SendSS record in a timely manner with new or additional information as it becomes available. Finalize SendSS record when case investigation is complete. NOTE: The final interview should be completed 14 days af ter the cough onset. If you are notified of a suspect pertussis case-patient wi th a recent cough onset (< 14 days) investigate the case IMMEDIATELY and follow-up 14 d ays after the cough onset Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 8date to assess whether the case-patient coughed for 14 days. This is required for case definition/reporting criteria. 7. In the event of death, obtain and send copies of hospital discharge summary, death certificate and autopsy report Control Guidelines 1. Investigate reports of suspect pertussis IMMEDIA TELY 2. If the clinical case definition is met (probable or confirmed), regard as true pertussis. 3. Ensure cases have received antimicrobial treatme nt to help limit spread of the disease to others and that they are excluded and is olated from group activity settings (e.g. schools, day-care centers, work plac e, camps, etc.) until they have received at least 5 days of an appropriate course o f antibiotics for pertussis a. In health care settings, use of droplet precaut ions is recommended. 4. Determine period of communicability (one week be fore to two weeks after cough onset) using the Period of Communicability Timeline 5. Identify exposed close contacts, including house hold contacts, child care contacts, etc. Note: Patients with pertussis are highly infec tious; attack rates among exposed, nonimmune household contacts are as high as 80%--90 %. 6. Identify high risk exposed close contacts. a. High risk contact definition (contacts at highes t risk of severe disease or transmitting disease to others at high risk) Infants <1 year of age Pregnant women Caregivers and household contacts of infants (e.g. , family members, friends, or babysitters who spend time car ing for an infant) All those attending or working in a childcare sett ing (i.e. same room) Healthcare workers who care for infants <1 year of age or pregnant/postpartum women Unimmunized/underimmunized children and Immunocompromised persons 7. Administer or coordinate the administration of a ntibiotics to close contacts within three weeks (21 days) of exposure, regardless of va ccination history Georgia Immunization Program Manual Dep artment of Public Health PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Fact Sheet 9a. Refer contacts for prophylaxis to their primary care physician, the health department, or follow DPH Nursing Protocol for obta ining prophylaxis from the contact's pharmacy. 8. Household and other close contacts should be tre ated prophylactically with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The recommended antimicrobial agents and dosing regimens for postexposure prophylaxis are th e same as those for treatment of pertussis a. Defining \"close contacts\" outside the household is especially challenging. Therefore, outside household environments, the risk for secondary transmission of pertussis should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and decisions to recommend prophylaxis should be based on infectiousness of the case, transmission setting, risk for transmissi on to others, and risk status of the contacts. b. Specific definitions of a contact for purposes o f pertussis control are problematic and will vary according to the situatio n. Transmission can be expected with the following situations: Direct face-to-face contact for a period (not defi ned) with a case- patient who is symptomatic (e.g., in the catarrhal or paroxysmal period of illness); Shared confined space in close proximity for a pro longed period of time, such as >1 hour, with a symptomatic case-pati ent; or Direct contact with respiratory, oral, or nasal se cretions from a symptomatic case-patient (e.g., an explosive cough or sneeze in the face, sharing food, sharing eating utensils during a meal, kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or performing a full medical exam including examination of the nose and throat). 9. If period of prophylaxis has passed (three weeks , except in high risk cases), counsel contacts to call their health provider if they deve lop respiratory symptoms and/or cough so antimicrobial treatment/exclusion can be i mplemented immediately. 10. Vaccinination is not post-exposure prophylaxis, but encourage all household and close contacts to be up-to-date on their pertussis vaccinations. a. If possible, coordinate vaccination at the local health department. 11. Conduct surveillance for secondary cases and co ntacts. a. If necessary, a letter may be sent out to notify close contacts/guardians of possible exposure (Appendix E). * Note that the steps are not ordered by priority s ince several of these steps are conducted simultaneously.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 06/2015 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 12 Pertussis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with prolonged cou gh with cyanosis, vomiting or apnea, regardless of vac cination history. Nasopharyngeal secretions are the optimal specimens for isolating the pertussis bacte rium and obtaining a lab confirmed diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal swabs for culture and polymerase cha in reaction (PCR) should be collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms and prior to antib iotic treatment. The time of collection will greatl y impact the ability to detect B. pertussis . There is a greater likelihood of positive culture s and/or PCR in the first two weeks of symptomatic infection than durin g later weeks of illness. However, PCR may detect organisms for a prolonged period of time regardless of viability. Confirmatory laboratory testing shou ld be performed on all suspect or probable cases. The Georgia Department of Public Health strongly re commends the collection of a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab to confirm a pertussis case . The preferred methods for laboratory diagnosis of p ertussis are culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and it is recom mended that BOTH tests be performed. *Pertussis culture and PCR testing at the Georgia Pu blic Health Laboratory is available by special arrangement only. To receive p re-approval and make arrangements for either pertussis culture or PCR te sting, the District Health office or Georgia Department of Public Health must be cont acted at 404-657-2588. A.

Nasopharyngeal swabs received i n transport medium tubes are inoculated immediately o nto Regan-Lowe plates and incubated. After the final day of incubation, if no colonies typical of B. pertussis or B parapertussis are present, the culture is reported as negative for these organisms. A positi ve culture report is based upon typical colony morphology, biochemicals and direct fluorescent ant ibody testing (DFA) Positive cultures or cultures overgrown with mold or normal flora are reported im mediately upon detection, and results are telephone d to the submitter. Both culture and PCR are recommended for diagnosis of B. pertussis whenever possible. A positive culture is considered confirmatory and is the most reliable. \" False negative\" culture results may fol low from any procedures that render the organisms nonvi able, such as improper handling of plates and transport medium after collection or prolonged anti biotic treatment. PCR The GPHL currently offers a multitarget PCR assay v alidated by the CDC, for qualitative detection of Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. holm esii DNA extracted from clinical specimens or cultu re isolates by real-time PCR. Most commercial laborato ries use a single target PCR for IS481, which is present in multiple copies in B. pertussis and in l esser quantities in B. holmesii and B. bronchisepti ca. Because this DNA sequence is present in multiple co pies, IS481 is especially susceptible to falsely- positive results. Use of the GPHL multiple target a ssay improves specificity of PCR assays for pertuss is. When requesting commercial PCR testing, clinicians are encouraged to inquire about which PCR target or targets are used by their laboratories. Interpre tation of commercial PCR results, should be done in conjunction with an evaluation of signs and symptom s and available epidemiological information, as the ir specificity can vary greatly.

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3. Brief Description: A highly contagious viral infection with manifestations ranging from inapparent infection to non-specific febrile ill ness, aseptic meningitis, paralytic disease and death. Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, gastrointestinal upset, malaise, and stiffness of neck and back. In approximately 0.1% to 2% of cases, symptoms include a flaccid paralysis typified by absent deep tendon reflexes; in approximately 1 out of 250 cases, residual neurologic symptoms occur, including paralysis. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Primarily person-to-person spread, principally through the fecal-oral route but also by the respiratory route; fecal-oral transmission occurs in situations where sanitation is poor. However, where sanitation is good, pharyngeal spread may be more apparent. In rare instances, milk, foodstuffs and other materials contaminated with feces have been incriminated as vehicles. There is no reliab le evidence of spread by insects; sewage and water are rarely implicated. Incubation Period: Usually 6 to 20 days, with a range of 3 to 35 days. Clinical Case Definition: Acute onset of a flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs, without other apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Case confirmation is based on a clinical definition. However, a probable case can be supported by l aboratory information. Diagnosis is made by isolation of the organism from throat, stool, rectum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood. The highest probability of isolation is achieved when two stool and throat specimens are obtained twenty-four hours apart. These should be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory for primary isolation. The state laboratory will forward isolates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for Polymerase Chain R eaction (PCR) and antibody blocking testing to determine intratypic variation. This will determine whether a paralytic polio case is derived from wild-type or vaccine related virus. Diagnostic Testing: A. Culture 1. Specimen Needed: Stool, throat swab, rectal swab, CSF, or blood. 2. Outfit: Viral culture outfit, order #575. 3. Form: 3595. 4. Lab Test Performed: Isolation and identification of poliovirus. 5. Lab Performing Test: State Virology Laboratory, Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) in Decatur, followed by intratypic differentiation performed at the CDC. 6. Transport Requirements: Collect within 72 hours of onset of symptoms; specimens should be frozen immediately and shipped on dry ice. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Fact Sheet 2 Comment: Isolation of wild-type virus constitutes a public health emergency and appropriate control measures must be initiated immediately (in consultation between health care providers, state and local health departments, and CDC). B. Serology 1. Specimen Needed: Acute and convalescent sera, or whole blood. a. Acute sera: 2-3 cc collected as soon as possible after onset of illness. b. Convalescent sera: 2-3 cc whole blood collected 14-21 days after acute phase of illness. 2. Outfit: Serology, order #504. 3. Form: antibody titers to poliovirus serotype 1, 2, and 3. 5. Lab Performing Test: CDC with prior arrangement by the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Do not submit specimens directly to CDC. All specimens must be submitted to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Case Classification: Probable: A case that meets the clinical case definition. Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition and in which the patient has a neurologic deficit 60 days after onset of initial symptoms, has died, or has unknown follow-up status. Vaccination: There are two types of polio vaccine: the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). The IPV is given intr amuscularly or subcutaneously, and OPV, a live attenuated virus, is given orally. The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a four-dose schedule of IPV for routine immunization of infants and children. The first three are given at two-month intervals begi nning at 2 months of age (the third dose can be given between 6 and 18 months.) The fourth dose is given at age 4 to 6 years, before entering school. For more detailed vaccination information see Polio Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is no longer routinely recommended in the United States because of the continued risk for vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), the absence of indigenous disease, and the low risk for wild poliovirus importation into the United States. OPV is no longer available for routine vaccination in the U.S. Most adults in the United States are at low risk for polio due to immunizations received in childhood. Certain adults are at high risk however, and should be vaccinated. These adults are: 1. Travelers to areas or countries where polio may be epidemic or endemic. 2. Members of communities with disease caused by wild-type polio. 3. Laboratory workers handling specimens that may contain wild-type polio. 4. Health-care personnel in close contact with patients who may be excreting wild-type polio. 5. Unvaccinated adults whose children will be receiving oral poliovirus vaccine. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Fact Sheet 3 Period of Communicability: Not accurately known, but transmission is possible as long as virus is excreted. Virus is demonstrable in the throat as early as 36 hours after exposure and in the feces 72 hours after exposure to infection in both clinical and inapparent cases. Virus persists in the throat for approximately 1 week and in the feces for 3 to 6 weeks or longer. Cases are most infectious during the first few days before and after onset of symptoms. Treatment: None except attention during the acute illness to the complications of paralysis. Investigation: The State Epidemiology Section will give instructions regarding investigation when a case is reported by phone. The following information should be collected as part of the investigation: 1. Demographic Information : The name, age, sex, race, occupation, and address (county, city and zip code) of the patient. 2. Immunization History : The number, dates and lot numbers of previous doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and the number, dates, type (monovalent versus trivalent) and lot numbers of previous doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Information on the number, site and types of injections given at either the time of vaccination or within 30 days after vaccination should also be collected. 3. Clinical Information : A brief description of the patient's illness including the date of onset of paralysis. Information should include the course of the illness and the sites of paralysis or other complications. 4. Immunologic Status : Since persons with some immune deficiency diseases are at increased risk of paralytic poliomyelitis, known immune deficiency either in the patient or patient's family should be documented. If any doubt exists, an immunologic evaluation (quantitative immunoglobulins, T and B cell quantitation, lymphocyte transformation, etc.) should be considered. 5. Exposure History : a. History of recent travel of the patient or a close contact outside of the United States to an endemic or epidemic area for poliomyelitis. b. History of contact with any known cases of poliomyelitis and the date of contact, if applicable. c. History of receipt of OPV by the patient within 30 days prior to onset, including the date of receipt and the lot number of the vaccine. d. History of contact within 30 days prior to onset of symptoms with any person who received OPV within the last 60 days prior to onset, including the date of contact, the nature of the contact, the date the contact received OPV, the lot number of the vaccine, the age of the contact, and the relationship to the patient. Information regarding the contact's prior history of immunization with IPV should also be collected.

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 Polio Questions And Answer 5 POLIOMYELITIS Q&A (Infantile paralysis, Polio) What is polio? Polio is a viral disease that may affect the central nervous system. Complications include paralysis (most commonly of the legs). Paralysis of the muscles of respiration and swallowing can be fatal. Since polio immunization has become widespread, cases of polio are very rare. Who gets polio? Polio is more common in infants and young children and occurs under conditions of poor hygiene. However, paralysis is more common and more severe when infection occurs in older individuals. In exceedingly rare cases, oral polio vaccine can cause paralytic polio in a person who receives the vaccine (one in every 2.4 million doses). How is polio spread? Polio is predominately spread from person to person through the fecal-oral route when community or personal hygiene is imperfect. What are the symptoms of polio? Infection with poliovirus can range from inapparent to a severe paralytic disease that may result in death. Symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, nausea and vomiting, excruciating muscle pain and stiffness in the neck and back. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? The incubation period is usually 6 to 20 days, with a range of 3 to 35 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread the poliovirus? Patients are most infectious from 7 to 10 days before and after the onset of symptoms. However, patients are potentially contagious as long as the virus is present in the throat and feces. The virus persists in the throat for approximately one week after onset of illness and is excreted in feces for several weeks or, occasionally, months. Does past infection with polio make a person immune? There are three types of poliovirus. Lifelong immunity usually depends on which type of virus one is infected with. Second attacks are rare and result from infection with a poliovirus of a different type than the first attack. What is the treatment for polio? There is presently no cure for polio. Treatment involves supportive care. How can polio be prevented? Maintaining high levels of polio immunization in the community is the single most effective preventive measure. Two types of polio vaccine are available: trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). However, in the United States IPV is the vaccine of choice and OPV is not readily available. Contact the Georgia Immunization Program at 404-657-3158 for current vaccine recommendations.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Rubella virus. Brief Description: A mild febrile viral disease with a diffuse punctate (pinpoint) and maculopapular rash sometimes resembling that of measles or scarlet fever. Children usually present few or no constitutional symptoms, but adults may experience a 1 to 5 day prodrome of low grade fever, headache, malaise, mild coryza, and conjunctivitis. Rubella is important because of its ability to produce anomalies in the developing fetus. These abnormalities are termed Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). Congenital rubella syndrome occurs when a pregnant mother becomes infected and passes the virus to her fetus. The primary congenital defects are ophthalmologic (cataracts, glaucoma, retinopathy), disorders, meningoencephalitis, mental retardation). Other congenital defects include radiolucent bone disease and growth retardation. The occurrence of these defects is 50% if the mother is infected in the first month of pregnancy, 20% to 30% if infected in the second month and 5% if infected in the third to fourth month. Defects are rare when maternal infection occurs after the 20 th week. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Contact with nasopharyngeal secretions of infected persons. Infection is transmitted by droplet spread or direct contact with patients. Infants with congenital rubella syndrome shed large quantities of virus from body secretions for up to one year, and can therefore serve as a source of infection for susceptible persons caring for them. Rubella may also be transmitted by sub-clinical cases (approximately 30% to 50% of all rubella infections). Incubation Period: 14 days, with a range of 12 to 23 days. Period of Communicability: Rubella is moderately contagious. The disease is most contagious as the rash is erupting, but can be transmitted about 1 week before to 5-7 days after onset of rash. Infected children should be excluded from school until 7 days after rash onset. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with ALL of the following characteristics: Acute onset of generalized maculopapular rash, and Temperature > 37.2 C ( 99 F), if measured, and Arthralgia, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, or conjunctivitis. Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of rubella virus, or Positive serologic test for rubella IgM antibody, or Significant rise in rubella IgG antibody level by any standard serologic assay, or PCR positive for rubella virus Diagnostic Testing: A. Serology 1. Specimen: Blood - acute sera (at least 5cc whole blood) for IgM and IgG titers collected at the onset of illness and convalescent sera (IgG) collected 14-21 days later. Please note that a single IgM test will confirm the diagnosis. False-positive Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6.

Outfit: Viral transport media. 3. Form: #3595. 4. Lab Test Performed: Culture or PCR. 5. Lab Performing Test: Virology Laboratory, GPHL in Decatur. 6. Transport Requirements: Specimen shoul d be kept in viral transport medium. Case Classification: Suspect : any generalized rash illness of acute onset. Probable: a case that fits the clinical case definition, has no or noncontributory serologic or virologic testing, and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. Confirmed : a case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case. Note : Cases meeting the measles case definition are excluded. Also excluded are cases with serology that is compatible with recent measles virus infection. All rubella cases should be confirmed by a laboratory test (serology). Vaccination: Children should receive rubella vaccine at 12-15 months of age, and 4-6 years of age. It is usually given combined with measles and mumps vaccine as MMR or MMRV. Adults born in 1957 or later should receive at least one dose of MMR vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one MMR, or other acceptable evidence (laboratory results) of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. Efforts should be made to identify and vaccinate susceptible adolescents and adults, particularly women of childbearing age who are not pregnant. Women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant within one month should not receive the vaccine, due to the theoretical risk for causing birth defects in the developing fetus. Emphasize vaccinating susceptible males and females in colleges, employment and health care settings. For more detailed vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 3 Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Live attenuated vaccine given after exposure has not been demonstrated to prevent illness. However, non-pregnant people exposed to rubella may still theoretically benefit from the vaccine if given up to three days after exposure. Immunization of a person who is incubating natural rubella or who already is immune is not associated with increased risk of adverse effects. The risk of congenital rubella when a pregnant woman is exposed is significant. Exposed pregnant women should not be given live virus vaccine. An intramuscular dose of 20 ml of immune globulin (IG) may decrease clinically apparent infection, but no studies show that such a dose protects the fetus. It should only be used in cases where therapeutic abortion is not an option. Treatment: None. Investigation: Case Investigation: 1. Establish a diagnosis : Because the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable, cases must be confirmed by a laboratory test. 2. For adult women, obtain accurate pregnancy status : All women of childbearing age should be evaluated for pregnancy status. If a pregnant woman is infected, immediate referral to her medical care provider is necessary. 3. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization history . 4. Identify the source of infection : Case-patients and their caregivers should be asked about contact with other known cases. Since 20%-50% of cases are asymptomatic, identification of a source will not always be possible. 5. Assess potential for transmission and identify contacts : Contacts of case-patients during the infectious period (7 days before to 7 days after rash onset) should be identified. Transmission can occur in households, communities, workplaces, and prisons. 6. Obtain specimens for virus isolation : Nasopharyngeal swabs and urine should be collected within 4 days after rash onset and submitted for virus isolation. Isolates are essential to identify virus types and track the epidemiology of rubella in the United States, especially as we progress towards elimination of the virus in geographical regions. 7. Laboratory evaluation of exposed pregnant women: Pregnant women who have been exposed should have serologic testing (an IgG and IgM test) at the time of exposure, an IgG titer 2 to 3 weeks later, and another IgG titer 6 weeks after exposure. If the first IgG test is positive, the woman is immune. If the first test is negative, the second and third test will determine whether infection has occurred in the absence of an IgM test. A positive IgM indicates a recent or acute infection. 8. Pregnancy Outcome Registry for women diagnosed with rubella during pregnancy : All pregnant women infected with rubella during pregnancy should be monitored to document the pregnancy outcome (e.g., termination, CRS, or normal infant) on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Form 71.17, \"Congenital Rubella Case Report Form,\" and forward to the State Epidemiology Section. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Fact Sheet 4Outbreak Investigation: Strategies to control rubella outbreaks include defining at-risk populations, ensuring susceptibles are rapidly vaccinated, and maintaining active surveillance for new cases.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Questions & Answers 5 RUBELLA Q&A (German measles) What is rubella? Rubella is a viral disease characterized by slight fever, rash and swollen glands. Very few to no cases are reported in Georgia each year. Who gets rubella? In unvaccinated populations, rubella is primarily a childhood disease. Where children are well immunized, adolescent and adult infections become more evident. Rubella occurs more frequently in winter and spring. How is rubella spread? Rubella is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected individuals. What are the symptoms of rubella? Rubella is a mild illness that may present with few or no symptoms. Symptoms may include a rash, slight fever, joint aches, headache, discomfort, runny nose and reddened eyes. The lymph nodes just behind the ears and at the back of the neck may swell causing some soreness and/or pain. The rash, which may be itchy, first appears on the face and progresses from head to foot, lasting about three days. As many as half of all rubella cases occur without a rash. How soon do symptoms appear? The incubation period for rubella ranges from 12 to 23 days. However, in most cases symptoms appear within 14 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread rubella? Rubella may be transmitted from seven days before to four days after the onset of rash. Does past infection with rubella make a person immune? Yes. Immunity acquired after contracting the disease is usually permanent. When is the vaccine for rubella needed? Rubella vaccine is given on or after a child's first birthday, but is recommended at 12 months of age when given in combination with measles vaccine. The vaccine can be given alone or in a one-shot combination vaccine that protects against measles, A second dose of MMR is recommended at age 4 to 6 years, to produce immunity in those who failed to respond to the first dose. What can be the effect of not being immunized against rubella? Rubella infection is serious due to its potential to cause birth defects. Infection in a pregnant woman may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the birth of an infant with abnormalities that may include deafness, cataracts, heart defects, liver and spleen damage, and mental retardation. These abnormalities are defined as \"congenital rubella syndrome\" (CRS) and occur in at least 25 percent of infants born to women who have had rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health RUBELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Rubella Questions & Answers 6 What can be done to prevent the spread of rubella? Maintaining high levels of rubella immunization in the community is critical to controlling transmission of the virus when sporadic cases or outbreaks occur. Prevention of rubella is especially important in susceptible pregnant women to prevent the birth defects caused by CRS. Therefore, women of childbearing age who have not been vaccinated should receive one rubella vaccine. Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should not receive rubella vaccine. Although there is no evidence that rubella vaccine causes birth defects, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after rubella or MMR vaccine. Infected children should not attend school when they are infectious; infected children may return to school 7 days after rash onset. Where can I get additional information on rubella?

Surveillance and Reporting - pneumoniae causes many clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection (e.g., acute otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia, or meningitis). Pneumococci are increasingly likely to be resistant to one or several antibiotics, including penicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cephalosporins. Invasive disease caused is notifiable with microbial susceptibility information requested. pneumococcus asymptomatically colonizes the nasopharynx of 5-40% of healthy people. Mode of Transmission : By droplet spread, direct oral contact, or through contact with articles freshly soiled with respiratory discharges. Person-to-person transmission of the organism is common, but illness among casual contacts and attendants is infrequent. Disease results when the organism multiplies locally (e.g., otitis media), multiplies after aspiration (pneumonia) or invades a sterile site (e.g., centra l nervous system or bloodstream). Incubation Period: Variable. For pneumococcal pneumonia, approximately 1 to 3 days. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: For invasive disease: Isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid) Case Classification: Probable: a clinically compatible case without laboratory confirmation or with isolation of S. pneumoniae from a non-sterile site. Confirmed: a clinically compatible case with a laboratory confirmed isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site. Period of Communicability: Presumably until discharges of mouth and nose no longer contain virulent pneumococci in significant numbers. This can be a prolonged period among immunocompromised persons. Vaccine: The polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) is recommended for all adults over age 65 and any individuals 2 years of age or older with chronic medical conditions that place them at high risk for pneumococcal di sease. PPSV is not effective in children under age 2. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed for use in February 2010 and is recommended for infants and young children up to five years of age. Children who have begun their immunization series with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) should complete the series with PCV13 when available. PPV23, PCV7, and PCV13 provide protection against commonly resistant pneumococcal strains. For more detailed vaccination information, see Pneumococcal Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: Sensitivities of strains isolated from normally sterile sites should be determined because of increasing prevalence of drug-resistant pneumococci. Where diagnostic facilities are limited and delay in treatment could prove fatal, antibiotic treatment should be started presumptively based on clinical signs.

Surveillance and Reporting - Fact Sheet 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) is a bacterium that frequently causes pneumonia (lung infection), otitis media (ear infection), bloodstream infection, and meningitis. Invasive S. pneumoniae infections affect body sites that normally contain no bacteria at all, such as blood, spinal fluid, joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid. Who gets pneumococcal infections? Pneumococcal disease is most common at the extremes of age. Infections are also more common and severe in people with weakened immune systems such as persons undergoing chemotherapy or with HIV infection, or people with chronic diseases such as sickle cell disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, or congestive heart failure. Blacks, American Indians and Alaska Natives are also at higher risk. What are the symptoms of a pneumococcal infection? Symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia include abrupt onset of fever, shaking chills, chest pain, productive cough, shortness of breath, and weakness. Signs of pneumococcal meningitis include headache, drowsiness, vomiting, irritability, fever, stiff neck, and seizures. Ear infection can cause fever and ear pain or discharge. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms of infections caused by pneumococcus take a minimum of 1 to 3 days to develop after exposure. When and for how long is a person able to spread S. pneumoniae? A person can spread the organism as long as th e pneumococci are present in the discharges from the nose and mouth. Illness among casual contacts of a person with pneumococcal disease is infrequent. How can pneumococcal disease be prevented? Three pneumococcal vaccines are available. PPV23 protects against infections caused by common strains of S. pneumoniae . It is recommended for everyone age 65 and older, and for people age 2 years and older with underlying health conditions making them more susceptible to S. pneumoniae infections. The other two pneumococcal vaccines, PCV7 and PCV13, prevent disease in infants and young children. PCV13 is newly licensed and is effective against more strains of S. pneumoniae than PCV7. PCV7 and PCV13 are recommended for use in children under 5 years old. What is drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae ? Drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) are the common bacterium S. pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) that have become resistant to a variety of antibiotics. Some strains are resistant to only one antibiotic, while other strains are resistant to many antibiotics, making infection with these strains more difficult to treat. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE FACT SHEET (Invasive Disease, Repor ted Syndrome and Suscep tiblility Information) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 Streptococcus Pneumoniae Fact Sheet 4 How common is DRSP? Surveillance studies by the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention have shown that in the U.S., DRSP strains have been increasing in frequency since 1987. In some communities, 40% of S. pneumoniae isolates are resistant to at least one drug, and strains causing infections may be resistant to several antibiotics. DRSP strains in Georgia are more common than in many other parts of the U.S. What caused these strains of bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics? Many experts believe that overuse of antib iotics contributes to the development of DRSP strains. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat infections caused by viruses (such as colds and bronchitis), which are not killed by antibiotics. Once DRSP is in the community, use of antibiotics may \"select\" the resistant strains for survival. Where can I get additional information on pneumococcal disease?

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 1 Tetanus Fact Sheet Agent: The bacterium, Clostridium tetani . Brief Description: Tetanus is an acute, often fatal disease caused by an exotoxin produced by the anaerobic organism C. tetani in a contaminated wound. Increased muscle rigidity and severe muscle spasms characterize tetanus. The muscle stiffness usually first involves the jaw (lockjaw) and neck, and later becomes generalized. Muscle spasms may continue for 3-4 weeks or more. Other symptoms include fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and rapid heart rate. Reservoir: Intestines of humans, as well as the intestines of horses and other animals, in which the organism is a normal inhabitant. Tetanus spores are ubiquitous in the environment and can contaminate wounds of all types. Soil or fo mites contaminated with animal and human feces can also be reservoirs. Mode of Transmission: Tetanus spores are introduced into the body through: (1) puncture wounds; (2) lacerations, burns, trivial or unnotic ed wounds in which fecally-contaminated soil containing C. tetani spores penetrates body tissues; or (3) by injected contaminated street drugs. Incubation Period: Usually 3 to 21 days, although it may range from 1 day to several months, depending on the wound. The average is 8 days, and most cases occur within 14 days. Shorter incubation periods have been associated with more heavily contaminated wounds, more severe disease, and a worse prognosis. Period of Communicability: Not transmitted from person-to-person. Clinical Case Definition: Acute onset of hypertonia and/or painful muscular contractions (usually of the muscles of the jaw and neck) and generalized muscle spasms without other apparent medical cause. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Attempts at laboratory confirmation are of little help. The organism is rarely recovered from the site of infection, and there is usually no detectable antibody response. The diagnosis is entirely clinical and does not depend upon bacteriologic confirmation. Diagnostic Testing: Not indicated. Case Classification: Confirmed: A clinically compatible case, as reported by a health-care professional. Vaccination: Primary tetanus immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all persons at least 6 weeks old, but < 7 years of age, for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. For those with allergies to pertussis vaccine, a diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine is available (DT). The primary vaccination consists of a three-dose series, administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. The fourth dose (first booster) is recommended at 15-18 months of age to maintain adequate immunity during preschool years. The fifth dose (second booster) is recommended for children aged 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early y ears of schooling. Routine tetanus booster immunization, with tetanus toxoid usually combined with adult-diphtheria toxoid (Td), is recommended for all persons > 7 years of age every 10 years. Persons aged 10-64 years may get a one-time dose of Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health TETANUS FACT SHEET (LockJaw) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2012 2 Tetanus Fact Sheet in lieu of one booster dose of Td. For more detailed vaccination information, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG) IM, in doses of 3,000-6,000 IU. The wound should be properly cleaned, debrided, and excised if necessary. Metronidazole (30 mg/kg per day, given at 6-hour intervals) is the antibiotic of choice and should be given for 7-14 days. Active immunization should be initiated concurrently wi th therapy. Tetanus clinical disease does not confer immunity because of the small amount of toxin required to produce illness. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: For routine wound management, wounds that are \"dirty\" should be treated with TIG IM unless the patient has had three or more doses of the tetanus vaccine. \"Dirty\" wounds include those contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, or saliva, puncture wounds, avulsions, and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, or frostbite. For all wounds, clean or dirty, a dose of Td should be given if the patient has had less than three doses of the vaccine. If patients have had three or more doses, the decision to give Td should be based on the amount of time since the last vaccine was given. If the wound is clean, the patient should receive Td unless he or she has had the vaccine within the last ten years. If the wound is dirty, give Td unless he or she has had the vaccine within the last five years. The wound should be cleaned and debrided as described under \"Treatment.\" Investigation: The Tetanus Surveillance Worksheet may be used as a guideline. The investigation should include identification of age at onset, the circumstances of any previous injury, tetanus toxoid vaccination history, and determination of the patient's status (alive, dead) at one-month after onset of disease.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Fact Sheet VARICELLA FACT (VZV) Brief Description: varicella infection is characterized by a generalized, pruritic, vesicular rash typically consisting of 250 to 500 lesions in varying stages of development and resolution (crusting). In some infected individuals a low-grade fever may precede the rash. Varicella severity and complications ar e increased among immunocompromised persons, children younger than 1 year of age, and adults . Adults and immunocompromised persons are most at risk for developing serious complications. Complications can include bacterial superinfection of skin lesions, pneumonia, encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, Reye syndrome, and death. Breakthrough varicella is a case of wild-type varicella infection that occurs more than 42 days after an individual is vaccinated with varicella vacci ne. This disease is usually mild with a shorter duration of illness, absence of fever, and fewer than 50 skin lesions. The rash may not become vesicular (fluid-filled blister) or itchy. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Airborne, by droplet spread, or by direct contact with secretions from the nose, throat or vesicular lesions of an infected person. Spread may also occur by contact with articles that have been soiled by fluid from lesions. Incubation Period: Commonly 14 to 16 days, range 10 to 21 days Period of Communicability: Persons with varicella are considered infectious from 1 to 2 days before rash onset until all lesions are crusted (usually about 5 days). Varicella is one of the most readily communicable diseases, especially just before and in the early stages of eruption. Breakthrough cases may sometimes be as infectious as natural varicella, particularly if the rash is extensive and contains vesicles. Exposure : In general, exposure to varicella is defined as contact with nasopharyngeal secretions or vesicular lesions, face-to-face interaction, or sharing indoor airspace with an infectious person. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with acute onset of diffuse (generalized) maculopapulovesicular rash without other apparent cause. Note: In vaccinated persons who develop breakthrough varicella more than 42 days after vaccination, the disease is almost always mild with fewer than 50 skin lesions and shorter duration of illness. The rash may also be atypical in appearance (maculopapular with few or no vesicles). Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 2 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Fact Sheet VARICELLA FACT SHEET Case Classification: Probable : A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, and is not epidemiologically linked to another probable or confirmed case. Confirmed : A case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed or probable case. Note: Two probable cases that are epidemiologically linked are considered confirmed cases Lab Criteria for Diagnosis: Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV Note: Routine laboratory testing to diagnose varicella in each case is not generally recommended, but testing may be useful in special circumstances to confirm the diagnosis or to determine varicella susceptibility. Diagnostic Testing: P A. Polymerase Chain Reaction a. Specimen needed: crusts (scab), vesicular fluid or cells from the base of a lesion (See Appendix 1 for specimen collection and submission details ) b. Outfit: n/a c. Form: #3409 VZV (rt-PCR) e. Lab Performing Test: State Molecular Biology Laboratory, Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL), in Decatur f. Transport Requirements: The specimen can be submitted dry, preferably in a sterile container. Please notify the Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588 before sending the specimen, as PCR testing is available by request only from the state office. Immunity : Evidence of immunity to varicella includes: 1. Documentation of age-appropriate vaccination 2. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease 3. Born in the United States before 1980 (for healthcare providers and pregnant women, this does not suffice as evidence of immunity) 4. A healthcare provider diagnosis of varicella or verification of history of varicella disease 5. History of herpes zoster based on healthcare provider diagnosis Vaccination: A vaccine for varicella was licensed in 1995. It is recommended that all children without contraindications be vaccinated between 12 and 15 months of age and receive a second dose between 4 and 6 years of age. The second dose may be administered earlier than 4 through 6 years of age if at least 3 months have elapsed following the first dose. However, if the second dose is administered at least 28 days following the first dose, the second dose does Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 3 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Fact Sheet VARICELLA FACT SHEET not need to be repeated. Healthy people over the age of 13 who have no history of chickenpox and have never been vaccinated against the disease should get two doses of the vaccine four to eight weeks apart. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Varicella vaccine is effective in preventing infection or modifying the severity of illness if given within 72 hours and possibly up to 120 hours after varicella exposure. Antiviral drugs are not typically recommended for prophylaxis. Varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is no longer available. An investigational product (VariZIG) can be given under an investigational new drug protocol within 96 hours of exposure to susceptible persons at high risk for developing severe varicella. The patient groups recommended by the ACIP to receive Vari ZIG include immunocompromised persons, pregnant women, and neonates whose mothers have varicella 5 days before to 2 days after delivery, and certain preterm infants. Treatment: Supportive. Note: Acyclovir and similar agents can reduce the duration and severity of illness if given within 24 hours of rash onset. These drugs should be considered for treatment of immunocompromised persons and other persons at high risk for severe varicella. (See 2009 AAP Red Book) Investigation: 1.

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Questions & Answers VARICELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS What is varicella (chickenpox)? Varicella (chickenpox) is a contagious, vaccine-preventable disease the varicella zoster virus (VZ). Who gets varicella? Before the vaccine became available, almost everyone got varicella. Anyone who has not had the disease and has not received the varicella vaccine can get varicella. However, no vaccine is 100% effective and some individuals who have been vaccinated can still get varicella, although it is usually much milder. How is varicella spread? Varicella is spread through the respiratory tract. The most common mode of transmission is by person to person from infected respiratory tract secretions. Transmission may also occur by respiratory contact with airborne droplets or by di rect contact or inhalation of aerosols from skin lesions of acute disease. What are the symptoms of varicella? In children, the first sign of varicella is often a rash, though adults may have 1-2 days of fever and fatigue before the rash begins. The rash is itchy, and usually appears first on the head, followed by the trunk and then the limbs. Initially maculopapular, it evolves into fluid-filled vesicles which last 3-4 days before crusting. There may be 2-4 successive crops of lesions. Children often also develop fever and fatigue, which last 2-3 days. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms usually appear in 14 to 16 days, although they may occur as early as 10 or as late as 21 days after exposure. How long is a person with varicella contagious? Varicella is most contagious two days before the rash appears until all blisters are crusted over (typically 5 days). What complications are associated with getting varicella? Varicella is usually mild and self-limited, but it may be associated with complications. Secondary bacterial infections of skin lesions with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus and pneumonia are the most common causes of hospitalization. Complications from varicella are higher in infants, persons older than 15 years of age, unvaccinated pregnant women and in immunocompromised persons such as those wi th HIV infection, leukemia and lymphoma. Does past infection make a person immune? No. The varicella vaccine is 70 to 90% effective in preventing disease and being vaccinated with 2 doses can prevent severe disease in 95% of persons. There is still a small chance of getting the disease even after vaccination, but it is infrequent and usually a much milder illness. Is there treatment for varicella? The treatment for varicella is primarily supportive. Treatment depends on a person's age, health and severity of illness. A primary care physician should be seen to discuss treatment options. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 6 6. Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Questions & Answers VARICELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS Is there a vaccine for varicella? A vaccine for varicella is available. It is recommended that all children be routinely vaccinated between 12 and 18 months of age and receive a second dose between 4 and 6 yrs. of age. Healthy people over the age of 13 who have no history of varicella and have never been vaccinated against the disease should get two doses of the vaccine four to eight weeks apart. Since varicella is usually not serious, why not let people get the disease? It is never possible to predict who will have a m ild case of varicella and who will have a serious or even deadly case of the disease. Now that a safe and effective vaccine is available, it is not worth taking a chance. Where can I get additional information on varicella?

Surveillance and Reporting 09/2012 Varicella Specimen Collection and Submission VARICELLA SPECIMEN COLL ECTION AND SUBMISSION APPENDIX 1: VARICELLA SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND SUBMISSION Routine laboratory testing to diagnose varicella in each case is not generally recommended, but testing may be useful in special circumstances to confirm t he diagnosis or to determine varicella susceptibility. To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory subm ission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions: Viral Testing : To make a laboratory diagnosis of VZV in fection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, the presence of viral DNA should be demo nstrated in tissues, vesicular fluid or crusts from lesions. We recommend the following methods for th e collection of specimens for PCR testing. As noted below, scabs generally contain sufficient viral DNA for amplification and as such are also useful specimens. Polyester Swab Method Use a sterile needle to unroof the top of the vesicle Use a synthetic, sterile swab to vigorously swab the base of the lesion, applying enough pressure to collect epithelial cells without causing bleeding, and collect vesicular fluid (collection of infected epithelial cells at the base of the le sion is important because they usually contain a significant amount of virus). Place swab into empty tube, breakage -resistant snap-cap, or screw top tube DO NOT PLACE TRANSPORT MEDIUM INTO THE TUBE; THE SPEC IMEN MUST BE KEPT DRY Specimen can remain at room temperature Glass Slide Method Rake the edge of the glass slide over the selected lesion to disrupt it Press the flat surface of the slide against t he opened lesion, rocking it back and forth several times (with young children it may be less stre ssful if you ask them to help with this) Air-dry the specimen Place glass slide in a container that protects against breakage. Cardboard mailers work well Specimen can remain at room temperature Crusts (Scabs) Remove a scab from the patient Place specimen into empty tube, breakage- resistant snap cap, or screw top tube Specimen can remain at room temperature Laboratory Submission Instructions Notify County or District Public Health Office immediately for coordination.

Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 1 RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL PREVENTING INFLUENZA Vaccination remains the primary method of preventing influenza infection or lessening the severity of influenza. Because circulating in fluenza strains change from year to year, a new vaccine is manufactured each year. For complete protection individuals must receive a new influenza vaccine annually. October to November is the ideal time for influenza vaccination, especially for persons at higher risk of developi ng complications from influenza, such as residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) . Persons who did not receive an influenza vaccine during the ideal time should still be immunized throughout the influenza season to achieve some protection. Employees of LTCF are also strongly advised to be vaccinated to reduce the chance of thei r spreading influenza to residents. LTCF visitors should be encouraged to receive influenza vaccine. In fact, given that influenza vaccine is more effective at preventing di sease among young, healthy adults than among the elderly, vaccination of workers and visitors may be more effective in preventing disease among LTCF residents than vaccinati on of the residents themselves. Listed below are the three manufacturers of influenza vaccine with contact information for ordering. The ideal time to order influenza vaccine for the upcoming flu season is in the spring, as most manufacturers' stocks are agents cause flu-like sympt oms, making influenza diagnosis difficult on clinical grounds. A verified diagnosis of in fluenza requires a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which may take up to 4 hours. Several rapid tests for influenza have been developed with variable sensitiv ities and specificities. Some of these rapid tests can provide results as fast as 10 minutes and may be useful in a LTCF setting to attempt to quickly document the cause of an outbreak of influenza-like illness. While negative rapid test results do not rule out influenza virus as the causative agent, a single positive test result in a LTCF setting strongly indicates an outbreak is due to influenza. If rapid tests are being used, PCR tests should still be done for confirmation and to identify the strain and antigenic characte ristics of the virus. Public health officials can provide molecular specimen submission kits to an LTCF during an outbreak and arrange for viral testing at the Georgia Public Health Laborat ory. Call your local health department immediately if an influenza outbreak is suspected in a LTCF. Public health does not supply rapid tests for influenza.

TREATING INFLUENZA Two antiviral drugs are cu rrently approved approved for prophylaxis against influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir ma y be used for influenza A or B. Influenza A virus resistance to amantadine and rimantadi ne can emerge rapidly during treatment. On the basis of antiviral testing results conduct ed at CDC and in Canada indicating high levels of resistance, CDC and ACIP recommend that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoprophy laxis of influenza A in the Un ited States until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been re -established among circ ulating influenza A viruses. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically rela ted antiviral drugs k nown as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infections. Zanamivir, an inhaled drug, may aggravate existing chronic respiratory illnesses. Table 2 describes medication dosage and duration fo r all age groups with normal renal function2. Each medication should be administer ed within 48 hours of symptom onset. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Resources 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 4 INFLUENZA PROPHYLAXIS In 2000, oseltamivir was approved for chemopr ophylaxis of influenza among persons aged >13 years and was approved for chemoprophylaxis of children aged >1 year in 2005. In 2006, zanamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxi s of children aged >5 years. Once a cluster of influenza-like illness has been identified in a long-term care facility, chemoprophylaxis of all resident s should begin immediately, regardless of whether they received vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis of staff should also be considered. Table 2 describes dosage and duration for pe rsons 65 years and older with normal renal function 2. Table 2.

Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 5 Abbreviation: NA = not approved * Zanamivir is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (Relenza --- inhaled powder). Zanamivir is approved for treatment of persons aged 7 years and approved for chemoprophylaxis of persons aged 5 years. Zanamivir is administered through oral inhalation by using a plastic device included in the medication package. Patients will benefit from instruction and demonstration of the correct use of the device. Zanamivir is not recommended for those persons with underlying airway disease. Oseltamivir is manufactured by Roche Pharmaceuticals (Tamiflu --- tablet). Oseltamivir is approved for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of persons aged 1 year. Oseltamivir is available for oral administration in 30 mg, 45 mg, and 75 mg capsules and liquid suspension. No antiviral medications are approved for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza among children aged <1 year. This information is based on data published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days. Longer treatment courses can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment. \u00a7 Recommended duration is 10 days when administered after a household exposure and 7 days after the most recent known exposure in other situations. For control of outbreaks in long-term care facilities and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis for a minimum of 2 weeks and up to 1 week after the most recent known case was identified \u00b6 See Table 4 for information about use of oseltamivir for infants aged <1 year. A reduction in the dose of oseltamivir is recommended for persons with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. ** The treatment dosing recommendation for oseltamivir for children aged 1 year who weigh 15 kg is 30 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >15 kg and up to 23 kg, the dose is 45 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >23 kg and up to 40 kg, the dose is 60 mg twice a day. For children who weigh >40 kg, the dose is 75 mg twice a day. The chemoprophylaxis dosing recommendation for oseltamivir for children aged 1 year who weigh 15 kg is 30 mg once a day. For children who weigh >15 kg and up to 23 kg, the dose is 45 mg once a day. For children who weigh >23 kg and up to 40 kg, the dose is 60 mg once a day. For children who weigh >40 kg, the dose is 75 mg once a day. REIMBURSEMENT FOR INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are a Medicare benefit, so long-term care facilities can bill Medicare for these immunizations. Frequently, nursing homes in Georgia are not billing Medicare and are losing this revenue. One of the most effectiv e strategies for increasing influenza and pneumococcal immunizations involves the health care provi der. Medicare beneficiaries are more likely to get immunized when their physician specifically recommends vaccination. Medicare Part B began paying for influenza vaccine on May 1, 1993. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Resources 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 10/2012 Influenza Resources 6 Medicare Part B began paying for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) on July 1, 1981. Coverage of the vaccines and their administrat ion is available under Medicare Part B regardless of the setting in which they are administered. If a beneficiary at high risk of pneumococcal disease (i.e., aged 65 or older) is unsure about his or her PPV vaccination status, Medicare will cover re-vaccination. Roster bills can be submitted so that only one bill is needed per facility (although influenza and pneumococcal vaccines must be on s eparate roster claim forms).

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 1 Influenza vaccination remains the primary method of preventing illness and death associated with influenza. Among elderly persons residing in nursing homes, influenza vaccine can be 50-60% effective in preventing hospitalization or pneumonia and 80% effective in preventing death. However, the vaccine may be less effective in preventing milder illness. If an outbreak of influenza-like illness (defined as fever > 100 F oral (> 101 F rectal) AND cough and/or sore throat) occurs in a long-term care facility, please immediately contact the local county health department or the Georgia Department of Public Health Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588 for assistance in outbreak investigation and control. Public health can help you confirm the diagnosis and prevent spread. A. Confirmation of Influenza and Determination of the Outbreak Strain Early in the outbreak, obtain viral throat swab specimens from up to 10 patients with symptoms suggestive of influenza for viral culture and antigen detection. Viral specimen kits can be obtained through the health department, which can also arrange testing at the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Because viral culture results may not be available for up to 10 days, facilities may also consider using rapid flu tests. While a negative rapid test result does not rule out influenza, a single positive result strongly indicates that influenza is causing the outbreak. Please see RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for more information about rapid flu tests. Rapid flu tests are not available through public health. B. Vaccination of Patients and Personnel Even during an outbreak, administer current influenza vaccine to unvaccinated patients and staff, especially if the outbreak occurs early in the influenza season. The local county health department may have vaccine available during flu season. See RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for information on how to order influenza vaccine prior to flu season. For more detailed vaccination information, see Influenza Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. C. Treatment and Prophylaxis Certain rapid tests are able to differentiate between influenza A and B which can help guide which antiviral medication can be used. Even in the absence of viral strain confirmation, the Georgia Department of Public Health advises long-term care facilities to begin treatment and prophylaxis of residents and staff with antiviral medications. If influenza is suspected, treatment and prophylaxis should not be delayed until viral culture results are available. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Outbreak Control In A Long-Term Care Facility 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 2 Two antiviral drugs are currently approved for influenza treatment: oseltamivir and zanamivir. Oseltamivir and zanamivir have also been approved for prophylaxis against influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir may be used for influenza A or B. Influenza A virus resistance to amantadine and rimantadine can emerge rapidly during treatment. On the basis of antiviral testing results conducted at CDC and in Canada indicating high levels of resistance, CDC and ACIP recommend that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in the United States until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses . Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related antiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infections. In 2000, oseltamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxis of in fluenza among persons aged >13 years and was approved for chemoprophylaxis of children aged >1 year in 2005. In 2006, zanamivir was approved for chemoprophylaxis of children aged >5 years. Please see RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for information regarding medication dosage and therapy duration. D. Interruption of Person-to-Person Transmission Keep residents known or suspected to have influenza in a private room or in a room with other residents with documented influenza unless there are medical contraindications. If feasible, place persons with influenza-like illness together in an area with an independent air supply and exhaust system. Implement respiratory droplet precautions, including requiring all staff that have contact with ill residents to wear masks and gloves, and to wash hands frequently and thoroughly. Consider using hand sanitizers in areas where hand washing is difficult. Restrict visitors who have a febrile respiratory illness. Do not allow staff to work while ill. Consider temporarily closing the facility to new admissions while the outbreak continues. Preventing Influenza Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Facilities Morbidity and mortality from influenza can be greatly reduced if long-term care facilities follow these guidelines for influenza prevention: Develop an influenza control plan incorporating vaccination, surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis activities. Ensure all staff are familiar with the plan's components. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Outbreak Control In A Long-Term Care Facility 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2012 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 3 Plan an annual vaccination campaign targeting all residents, staff, volunteers, and visitors for flu vaccination. Ideally, vaccination should occur in October or early November, but the facility should also have methods in place to ensure that all staff and residents who enter the facility after the mass vaccination campaign are also vaccinated. Standing orders by the facility medical director may make this process more convenient. Review residents' immunization histories and administer pneumococcal vaccine to those who are eligible. This should be done on a regular basis, and especially during the annual flu vaccine campaign. If a pneumococcal vaccination history is unknown, it is safe and preferable to give another dose. During flu season, post signs asking visitors with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, or muscle aches, to refrain from visiting. Train staff at the beginning of each flu season on the proper respiratory secretion precautions, hand-washing procedures, and surveillance activities. Have a mechanism to ensure all new employees who are hired during flu season receive the training as well. Establish and post a definition of flu-like illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines flu-like illness as fever > 100F oral or > 101F rectal and at least one of the following: cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, or sore throat. Be aware that influenza symptoms are sometimes different in elderly persons or persons with chronic medical conditions. Staff should be alert for residents who have fever with lethargy or delirium, or changes in their functional status. Monitor influenza activity in the communi ty. The Georgia Department of Public Health posts influenza information at http://health.state.ga.us/epi/flu . You may also receive periodic influenza activities during flu season by subscribing to the public health flu email list (sign up by sending an email to flu@dhr.state.ga.us with the word \"subscribe\" in the subject line). Knowledge of influenza activity in the community can assist in making a clinical diagnosis. Consider stocking rapid flu tests and antiviral medications for immediate detection and response to outbreaks. If you do not stock rapid tests, have a plan in place for quickly obtaining laboratory confirmation of influenza. There should also be a method to quickly obtain physician orders for antiviral medication. Post the county, district, or state health department phone number for reporting a cluster of influenza-like illness. A cluster is defined as 3 or more cases of illness among residents and/or staff within a 72-hour period. By law, any cluster of illness must be reported to Georgia public health authorities immediately .

Aside from antiv iral treatment, there is currently no cure for hepatitis B infection; however, there are methods to prevent perinatal exposure. Administering hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine to an exposed infant within 24 hours of birth is 85-95 percent effective in preventing both acute HBV infection and chronic infection. The purpose of the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Pr evention Program (PHBPP) is to ensure that infants born to hepatitis B surface ant igen (HBsAg)-positive women are given the opportunity to live their lives free of h epatitis B disease. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women are exposed to the virus throu gh contact with their mother's blood during delivery. Infants and children who be come infected with the hepatitis B virus have a 90 percent chance of becoming chronic carriers. These children are more likely to die prematurely from end-stage liver dise ase (hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis) as adults. Immunizing infants born to HB sAg-positive women with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine series can help prevent this tragic outcome. Identification of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in pr egnant women occurs through prenatal screening and reporting of positive HBsAg results f rom the laboratory and/or physician to the state or local health department. To prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B, district perinatal hepatitis B case managers and st aff identify HBsAg-positive pregnant women during gestation and track their infants thro ugh completion of the post- vaccination serologic testing. Infants born to HBsA g-positive women should be administered HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, followed by hepatitis B vaccine at 1-2 months and 6 months of a ge. Testing and immunizing sexual and household contacts of HBsAg-positive pregnant w omen also prevents transmission to susceptible individuals who are at high risk for the disease. Infected women should be informed by their medical care providers that an tiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B does exist and they should be encouraged to follo w up with a medical specialist after delivery. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Progra m is funded through the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Di sease, Immunization Services Division, with technical support from CDC's Nationa l Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Since 1991, ever y state has received federal funding to support the Perinatal Hepatitis B Preven tion Program. Separate funding from the state has been allocated to each district to as sist with perinatal hepatitis B case management. These guidelines are to be used as a reference for the case management of HBsAg- positive pregnant women, their infants, and sexual/ household contacts. Emphasis is placed upon infant prophylaxis and post-vaccination serologic testing. The appendix contains several forms and tools that can be used d uring the case management process. Please adapt these materials to suit the needs of your health district's perinatal hepatitis B prevention program.

Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 3 B. Program Goals The goals of the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prev ention Program are to: Ensure that all pregnant women are screened for HB sAg as part of the initial prenatal screening panel Identify HBsAg-positive pregnant women and enroll them and their infants into the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Progra m (PHBPP) Assure that local health departments perform case investigations on all HBsAg- positive pregnant women reported to their jurisdict ion Identify and refer household/sexual contacts of HB sAg-positive pregnant women for HBV testing and vaccination (HBsAg and an ti-HBs) Confirm that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive HBIG and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within twelve (12) hour s of birth Ensure that infants born to HBsAg-positive women r eceive the second dose of hepatitis B vaccine at 1-2 months of age, and the t hird dose of hepatitis B vaccine at six (6) months of age Ensure that infants born to HBsAg-positive women ar e tested at nine (9) months to twelve (12) months of age for hepatitis B surfac e antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) after compl eting the hepatitis B vaccination series C. Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Program Eligibility R equirements Eligibility requirements for enrollment into Georgi a's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program include: Any pregnant women who tests HBsAg-positive (must reside in GA) Infants born to HBsAg-positive women (infant must be U.S. born & reside in GA) Sexual and household contacts of HBsAg-positive pr egnant women D. Universal Prenatal Screening for Hepatitis B The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (A CIP), The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), and The Americ an Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all pregnant women be routinely tested for HBsAg at an early prenatal visit in each pregnancy. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program encourages all prenatal health p roviders to follow this recommendation. An additional test for HBsAg can be ordered later i n the pregnancy (approximately 34 weeks gestation) if the mother is at high risk for acquiring HBV infection (e.g., more than one sex partner during t he past six (6) months, recent history of STD, intravenous drug use, household con tact of a chronically HBV infected person). Pregnant women susceptible to hepatitis B virus (i. e., have never been infected) can and should be vaccinated a gainst the disease during pregnancy, especially if they are at high risk for infection ( see CDC \"Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women\" at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/downloads/b_preg_g uide.pdf). Chapter 2 in this manual also addresses the hepatitis B vaccine sched ule and age appropriate dosage information. Appendix H-1, \"Hepatitis B Facts: Tes ting and Vaccination,\" will provide a concise interpretation of the hepatitis B serolog y profile.

Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 4 E. General Management of HBsAg-Positive Pregnant Women The following guidelines are recommended by the Geo rgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program and follow the recommendations o f the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the ACIP for manag ing an HBsAg-positive pregnant woman. 1. The client's physician should draw a prenatal se rologic panel at the time pregnancy is confirmed. While there is no law in Ge orgia mandating prenatal HBsAg testing, it is considered a standard of care for prenatal screening panels to include HBsAg serology. One of the following two scenarios may occur after the laboratory performs t he test: a. If the HBsAg test is NEGATIVE, the laboratory will report the results to the physician. The physician files the results i n the client's records and sends the information with the rest of her pren atal records to the hospital before delivery. b. If the HBsAg test is POSITIVE , the laboratory reports the results to the physician AND the Epidemiology Section at the Georgia Department of Health. The physician should inform the pregnant woman of her HBsAg-positive status, file the result s in the client's record, and forward an original copy of the patient 's HBsAg lab report with the rest of her prenatal records to the hospital prior to delivery. 2. The Epidemiology Section sends HBsAg-positive la boratory reports on all females between 10 and 50 years of age to the Georg ia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program for investigation. 3. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Pro gram reviews the laboratory reports for females 10 to 50 years of ag e that are HBsAg-positive. The program contacts the ordering physician to det ermine the client's pregnancy status, estimated date of confinement (ED C) and delivery hospital for pregnant cases. 4. All pregnant HBsAg-positive women are entered in to the web-based tracking system (Perinatal SendSS), where it is available to the district perinatal hepatitis B case manager for case management. 5. All PREGNANT clients are contacted by the health district for co unseling about their infection and interviewed for sexual an d household contacts. Clients are reminded to alert medical personnel of their HBsAg status at the time of delivery. NOTE: All HBsAg-positive test results for pregnant women must be reported to either the local health department or the Georgi a Department of Public Health Epidemiology Section by the laboratory and health c are provider within seven (7) days of receiving positive results. Reporting is re quired by authority of the Official Code of Georgia Section 31-12-2, Official Code of G eorgia Section 31-22-7, Rules of the Department of Human Resources, chapter 290-5-3- 02. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 5 NOTE : Communicating the woman's HBsAg status to the deliv ery hospital's department of labor and delivery should be the resp onsibility of her healthcare provider . It is strongly recommended that the health distr ict make efforts to remind the healthcare provider and the h ospital of the woman's impending delivery at least four weeks before her EDC. An al ert letter should be sent to the hospital's labor & delivery unit and/or provider. S ee Appendix B-2 for a sample fax to use when notifying the hospital for this purpose. 6. The hepatitis B counseling interview should be p erformed in the client's native language. Each district has a Limited Englis h Proficient/Sensory Impaired (LEP/SI) Program Coordinator. This coordin ator can assist the district with the utilization of the language line. It is critical that she is aware of self-care and disease transmission in order to p rotect her own health and that of others. See the Example Interviewing/Counse ling Format for assistance (Appendix D-1). 7. Any client who is chronically infected with hepa titis B should be encouraged to seek care with her physician so that her conditi on can be monitored routinely. Advise the client to discuss possible t reatment options with her physician that may improve her health outcome and o verall quality of life. F. General Management of Infants Born to HBsAg-Positiv e Women 1. Infants born to women who are HBsAg positive mus t receive HBIG and the appropriate dose of hepatitis B vaccine (see Sectio n 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") within twelv e (12) hours of birth. NOTE : There is a seven (7) day window period to administer HBIG if an infant born to an HBsAg-positive woman did not receive HBIG wit hin twelve (12) hours of delivery. Every effort should be made to locate the infant an d administer HBIG within seven (7) days, if the infant was released from the hospital before receiving this important prophylactic component. 2. The health district should contact either the cl ient or the delivery hospital close to the date of delivery to obtain: a. Infant's name, birth date, gender and birth weig ht, and b. If the infant received HBIG and hepatitis B vacc ine within twelve (12) hours of birth. c. Obtain the HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine administ ration dates and times After obtaining this information, the health distri ct should update the Perinatal SendSS case management tracking record, w here it will be available to the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prev ention Program. 3. The health district will notify the pediatric ca re provider and/or mother that the infant should receive the second dose of vaccin e, consult GRITS for verification that the vaccine was administered, and update Perinatal SendSS. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 6 REMINDER: Preterm infants with low birthweight (i.e. less tha n 2,000 grams or 4.4 pounds) have a decreased response to hepatitis B vaccine administered before 1 month of age. Infants born to HBsAg-posit ive women and who weigh less than 2,000 grams at birth should receive 4 dos es of vaccine using the following schedule: dose #1 at birth, dose #2 at on e month of age, dose #3 at 2 months of age and dose #4 at 6 months of age). 4. The health district will notify the mother to ta ke the infant for the third dose of vaccine, verify that vaccine was given, and upda te Perinatal SendSS for further tracking. 5. District perinatal hepatitis B case managers wil l document updated infant information in Perinatal SendSS for each subsequent dose of vaccine and monitor for when any dose of hepatitis B vaccine is overdue. 6. The hepatitis B post-vaccination serologic testi ng (PVT) should be obtained when the child is 9-12 months old. If the third dos e of hepatitis B vaccine is given late, the child must have received the third dose a minimum of 30 days before obtaining the PVT. When the test resul ts (HBsAg and anti- HBs) are known, the health district will update Per inatal SendSS and document the case as complete. Note : The health district has the discretion to send th e parent/guardian and infant to a local public health clinic for the PVT (HBsAg and a nti-HBs), if testing is not otherwise affordable to the family. The local healt h department, health district or private physician can send the blood sample to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory where specimen processing will be perfor med at no charge to the infant's parents/guardians. 7. If the test is NEGATIVE for HBsAg and POSITIVE for anti-HBs , the infant is considered IMMUNE to hepatitis B and the perinatal case is closed. 8. If the test is NEGATIVE for BOTH HBsAg and Anti-HBS, the infant is considered SUSCEPTIBLE to hepatitis B infection, and should be immunized again with the complete 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine. The infant should be retested 30 days after the fin al dose of hepatitis B vaccine. In the rare instance the infant tests neg ative for HBsAg and anti- HBs after completion of the second series, no addit ional hepatitis B vaccine is to be given. The parents/guardian should be coun seled regarding the infant's negative results and susceptible status. T he perinatal hepatitis B case is closed for the infant after the second PVT is completed. 9. If the test is POSITIVE for HBsAg and NEGATIVE for anti-HBs , the infant is INFECTED and should be referred to the pediatrician for sub sequent follow-up and specialist referrals . This infection is a notifiable disease that should be reported as a hepatitis B infection throu gh SendSS and will be reported to the CDC by the Epidemiology Section. The perinatal hepatitis B case is then considered closed. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 7 G. Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HB sAg Status 1. Infants born to women whose HBsAg status is unknown at the time of delivery should receive hepatitis B vaccine at the appropriate dosage per manufacturer (see Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") within twelve (12) hours of delivery. The woman should be tested in the hospital at the time of delivery and an expedited HBsAg test should be run to determine her status. If the mothe r's test is positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible, pre ferably before hospital discharge. REMINDER: There is a seven (7) day window period to administer HBIG if an infant born to an HBsAg-positive woman did not rece ive HBIG within twelve (12) hours of delivery. Every effort should be made to l ocate the infant and administer HBIG within seven (7) days, if the infant was relea sed from the hospital prior to administration. 2. The hospital laboratory and physician are requir ed by law (see Note under Section E, 1-b) to report a positive HBsAg test wit hin seven (7) days to the Georgia Department of Public Health, Epidemiology S ection. 3. Upon receipt of a maternal HBsAg-positive serolo gy report from the hospital, the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Progra m (GA PHBPP Coordinator or health district) will obtain the inf ant's vaccination history and enter the infant into the Perinatal SendSS tracking system to be followed as indicated in Section F, \"General Management of Infa nts Born to HBsAg- positive Women.\" If the mother is determined to be HBsAg-negative, the infant should receive the hepatitis B vaccine accor ding to the schedule recommended by the ACIP for infants born to HBsAg-n egative women, that is, first dose at birth, second dose at 1 to 2 mont hs and third dose at 6 to18 months of age. NOTE: When the mother is HBsAg-negative but is at high ri sk for hepatitis B infection, she should be vaccinated as soon as poss ible. Hepatitis B vaccine is not contraindicated during pregnancy. 4. Upon completion of the three-dose vaccination se ries, infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers need to undergo post-vaccina tion serologic testing (PVT), in order to document immunity or infection s tatus. If the infant does not have insurance to cover the PVT expense or the pediatric provider refuses to collect the PVT, the district case manag er should assist with arrangements to refer the infant to a nearby public health clinic for the blood test. (See Appendix K-2 for GPHL sample submission form.) H. Management of Sexual/Household Contacts of HBsAg-Po sitive Pregnant Women 1. When health districts receive Perinatal Hepatiti s B Prevention Program referrals of HBsAg-positive pregnant women, appropriate distr ict personnel should make every effort to interview these women for household and sexual contacts. The contact interview should take place during the init ial counseling session with the woman. It is imperative to identify younger contact s of the HBsAg-positive client Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 8due to the high risk for chronic infection in child ren aged five (5) years and younger. (See Section III, \"Example Interviewing/Co unseling Format\", Appendix D-1, for further information.) 2. Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg-positive women are at increased risk of infection; therefore, it is important to test conta cts for HBsAg and anti-HBs (See Appendix H-1, \"Hepatitis B Facts: Testing and Vacc ination\"). Order these tests at the same visit when the contact receives the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine, but draw the blood for serology before administering va ccine . The test can be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory using Form 3583: http://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files/ related_files/site_page/LSM201 3_June.docx%207.3.13.pdf 3. Sexual and household contacts should be vaccinat ed during their first visit to a medical provider with the age-appropriate dose of h epatitis B vaccine. Vaccine must be given according to the ACIP recommended sch edule. See Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\" of this manual for information on the hepatitis B vaccine dosage and s cheduling for infants, children and adults. 4. HBIG can be given to sexual contacts of pregnant women diagnosed with acute hepatitis B infection (e.g., HBV infection of less than six (6) months duration with or without symptoms of hepatitis and/or positive an ti-HBc IgM), when the last sexual exposure occurred within fourteen (14) days of administration. Administer HBIG and vaccine during the same visit, in two diff erent body sites. HBIG can also be given to those household contacts that have not had sexual exposure, but have had known blood exposure to an acute case of h epatitis B within the past seven (7) days. 5. To calculate HBIG dosage for persons one (1) yea r of age through adulthood, use 0.06 mL per kilogram of body weight or 0.06 mL per 2.2 pounds of body weight. For example, for an adult weighing 140 poun ds, the weight would be divided by 2.2 to obtain the equivalent in kilogram s, then multiplied by 0.06 to obtain the HBIG dosage. Example: 140 lbs. \u00f7 2.2 = 63.636 kg, rounded up to 64 kg 64 kg x 0.06 mL = 3.84 mL of HBI G 6. If it is determined that the contact is infected (HBsAg positive) or has immunity (HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive) to infection , no further doses of vaccine are to be given. Report the infected case using Se ndSS. If the contact is susceptible to infection, that is, HBsAg and anti-H Bs negative, then complete the vaccine series. (See Appendix H-4 for hepatitis B s erology interpretations.) 7. Each susceptible contact should be followed and reminded to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series at the appropriate inter vals (See Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") . The district case manager is responsible for documenting tests and va ccinations in Perinatal SendSS for sexual and household contacts of a HBsAg -infected woman. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Office 7. Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 98. Contacts that are infected with hepatitis B shou ld be counseled about the disease and its transmission and reported in SendSS. The \"E xample Interviewing/Counseling Format\" is a useful guide f or this situation. (See Appendix D-1) I. Finding Clients That are Lost to Follow Up Ask if provider received request to transfer recor ds to another provider (there may be contact information available for the new pr ovider). Request LexisNexis search (contact GA PHBPP Coordi nator) Call telephone information 411 to see if you can lo cate the lost contact. Use Internet search engines (e.g. Google), white pa ges (whitepages.com), and United States Postal Service online (USPS.com) to search for contact information. Try old telephone numbers. Relatives/friends with i nformation on the patient might still be reached at those numbers. Look in directories that list occupants of each hou sehold in the city. Most sexually transmitted disease (STD) programs have su ch directories. Transpose digits in telephone numbers and addresses . Try \"Street\" instead of \"Avenue\" and vise versa. Ask neighbors, landlords, and apartment rental off ices. Ask mail carriers; they cannot give you addresses, by law, but might confirm whether or not the patient lives at the address. Ask the post office for the forwarding address. You may have to complete a justification form provided by the postal service a nd show your health department identification. The STD case manager may have local procedures. Search health department records. Ask other state and local agencies and programs (e. g. Medicaid, WIC programs, Department of Family and Child Services, parole and probation offices) for contact information. J. Required Reports and Case Updates for Perinatal Hep atitis B Prevention in Georgia Each month, the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Preve ntion Program will review case information about any cases that are due for activi ty during that month, such as vaccination, blood tests, deliveries, etc. The dis trict case manager is expected to update Perinatal SendSS at least weekly and alert t he Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program to any questionable or concernin g information about a case. Prompt documentation of case information in Perinat al SendSS allows for efficient maintenance of the tracking system and thus timely disease prevention. The updates will be used to complete state and federal annual r eports including the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Report requested annually by the CDC. If timely case management is not being performed over a period of several months, a letter of concern may be sent to the District Clinical Coordi nator and District Health Director requesting assistance with problem solving future P erinatal Hepatitis B case management within that district.

Glossary of Terms EDC Estimated date of confinement or the approximate da y that a woman's infant is expected to be born (aka: due date). Viral Hepatitis Inflammation of the liver as a result of viral infe ction. HBV Hepatitis B virus, the agent that causes hepatitis B virus infection . HBsAg HBsAg is the most commonly used test for diagnosing acute HBV infections or detecting chronic infections (carrier s). HBsAg can be detected as early as 1 or 2 weeks and as late as 11 or 12 weeks after exposure to HBV when sensitive assays are use d. The presence of HBsAg indicates that a person is infect ious, regardless of whether the infection is acute or chronic. HBeAg Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen is associated with active H BV replication, high concentrations of HBV in serum, and high infectivit y (increased risk of transmission); appears in early infection and pe rsists for variable length of time (from weeks to years). Anti-HBs Antibody to HBsAg is associated with long-term prot ection against reinfection and, in most persons, persists for many years after natural infection. Anti-HBs is also produced as an immune response to hepatitis B vaccine or is passively transferred when HBIG is administered. Anti-HBs is currently measured by ra dioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-HBc Anti-HBc (core antibody) develops in all HBV infect ions, appears shortly after HBsAg in acute disease, and indicates HBV infection at some undefined time in the past. Anti-HBc only occu rs after HBV infection and does not develop in persons whose imm unity to HBV is from vaccine. Anti-HBc generally persists for life and is not a serologic marker for acute infection. IgM Anti-HBc IgM anti-HBc appears in persons with acute disease about the time of illness onset and indicates recent infection wit h HBV. IgM anti- HBc is generally detectable for 4 to 6 months after onset of illness and is the best serologic marker of acute HBV infec tion. A negative test for IgM-anti-HBc together with a positive test for HBsAg in a single blood sample identifies a chronic HBV infect ion. HBsAg Chronic Carriage Through serologic testing, a person is confirmed as an HBsAg carrier (chronic infection) when: 1) HBsAg is detec ted on at least two tests, spaced a minimum of six (6) months apart; or 2) the results of a single serum specimen are HBsAg positive and IgM anti-HBc negative. Carriers may be asymptomatic and unaware that they are infected with HBV. Because they carry HBsAg in the ir blood, they are capable of infecting others.

Hepatitis B can be a serious disease. Not only does this virus affect your liver, but also it can be passed to your baby at the time of birth. To be protected from this disease, your baby will need to get several shots. The first two (2) shots are given within a few hours after birth. They are hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and dose 1 of hepatitis B vaccine. Your baby will later need dose 2 of hepatitis B vaccine at one or two months of age and dose 3 at six months of age. After completing these shots, your baby's doctor will do some blood tests to see if your baby is protected. The blood test should be done when the baby is between 9 and 12 months of age. In some cases, the baby may need more shots to prevent infection. It is possible that your sexual partner and other people living in your household could get infected. We recommend that they be tested and vaccinated for hepatitis B also, if they haven't been already. It is important that you discuss with your doctor whether you need further follow up for your infection. Your doctor may refer you to a gastroenterologist (GI doctor) who specializes in liver diseases. We encourage you to show this letter to your doctor and later to your baby's doctor. If you have any questions, please call me at (###) ###-####. Protecting your child from hepatitis B is our number one priority!

The Jade Ribbon is folded like the Chinese character for people \" \" to symbolize the united voices of those /f_ighting hepatitis B and liver cancer worldwide. Protect yourself and your baby with the rst \"anti-cancer vaccine\" If you have not been infected, get vaccinated Hepatitis B can still be transmitted through unprotected sex and contaminated blood (sharing toothbrushes, razors, or needles for tattoos/piercings). The 3 shots given over 6 months are safe, even during pregnancy. The hepatitis B vaccine is so eective in preventing HBV and liver cancer that it is known as the /f_irst \"anti-cancer vaccine. \" Make sure your baby is vaccinated at birth Since 1991, U.S. national guidelines have recommended that all newborns be vaccinated against HBV. The 3 shots can protect your baby for life against hepatitis B, reducing the risk of liver cancer and liver damage in the future. Time Infant should receive At birth birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine 1-2 months 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 6 months 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine The vaccine is safe, even for premature babies. ) +,HBV and Moms-to-Be Hepatitis B (HBV) is the most common serious viral infection of the liver, and can lead to premature death from liver cancer or liver failure. In the U.S., approximately 10-15 people die every day as a result of HBV infection. Hepatitis B can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during the birthing process. Newborns who become infected with HBV have a 90% chance of developing chronic (lifelong) infection. Fortunately, HBV can be prevented with a very safe and effective vaccine. Ask your doctor for the results of your HBV test Most people with chronic HBV infection have no symptoms. As an expecting mother, you should have already been tested for HBV with the following blood test: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Tells if you have chronic hepatitis B (also known as being a hepatitis B carrier).7 7 7 7 7 ET ake extra precautions if you are a mom with HBV During pregnancy: Currently, antiviral HBV treatments are not recommended during pregnancy. If you are already on treatment, talk to your doctor. At time of birth: In addition to the /f_irst shot of the hepatitis B vaccine, make sure your newborn receives the hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) shot. Time Infant born to mother with HBV should receive At birth birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) 1-2 months 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 6 months 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 9-18 months HBsAg and anti-HBs* tests to con/f_irm that your child is protected * The hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) blood test checks for protection against HBV. Cesarean sections (C-sections) have not been found to prevent HBV transmission from mother to child. Hepatitis B vaccination along with the HBIG shot is the best way to protect your newborn against HBV infection. In the rst 6 months: It is critical for your child to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series on time. This will be more than 95% effective in protecting your newborn against HBV infection. Breastfeeding is safe for your baby. HBV is not transmitted through breast milk.Moms with HBV You're important too! Remember to get screened for liver disease You probably have no symptoms and feel healthy, but are still at increased risk for liver damage or liver cancer. However, regular screening and appropriate treatment can reduce this risk and help you lead a normal, healthy life. Ask your doctor for the following tests: Every Test Screens for 6 months ALT blood test liver damage AFP blood test liver cancer 1 year ultrasound liver cancer Don't rush into treatment Not every person with chronic HBV infection needs treatment. But if your ALT level is elevated, treatment with antiviral medication may be appropriate. Be sure to review all medications with your doctor. Even some over-the-counter or herbal medications can injure your liver. Get the hepatitis A vaccine Avoid drinking alcohol Protect your loved ones Make sure your family and partner are tested for HBV, and vaccinated if they are not already protected.

Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 1Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B I. Introduction, professional role, and purpose Purpose: To let the patient know what is going to take place is to his/her benefit, that he /she is going to be dealing with a competent person, and that there should be no fears about discussing otherwise personal information. A. Introduce yourself and anyone else present to the patient. B. Tell the patient that you have been trained and have experience in helping people who have hepatitis B to understand and manage their disease. C. Inform the patient that part of your job is to ensure that no one else find out about the patient's infection and that problems are minimized for everyone who may be involved. II. Patient Assessment Purpose: To establish rapport, get the patient accustomed to talking, reduce the possibility of patient concerns interfering with the rest of the process, gather information that can be used in later sections, and give the patient sufficient information to be able to understand and support disease intervention behaviors. Targeted medical information can preempt inappropriate strategies that the patient may be developing to take care of the problem. By getting the patient to talk during this section, issues may arise that can be used as motivations or as benchmarks against inconsistencies later on in the interview/counseling session. A. Patient Concerns 1. Ask the patient about problems or questions regarding the disease and how it has been handled thus far. 2. Address concerns even if they are involved in other elements of the format. B. Socio-sexual Information 1. Question patient conversationally about where he/she lives, telephone number, alternate locating information, who living with, employment, travel, recreation social groups. 2. Question the patient about current employment and/or past jobs where they may have had to handle blood or other body fluids. 3. Explain reasons for questions if patient shows signs of concern. C. Medical History and Disease Comprehension 1. Ask what patient knows about the disease. 2. Compliment correct responses, tactfully correct any misconceptions, and add any information that directly supports disease intervention behaviors. 3. Ask about past hepatitis/liver problems. 4. Impress upon the patient that the disease is serious, people usually don't know that they have it until it is too late, that routine tests may not discover the disease, and that it is often passed unintentionally.

Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 2Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Appendix D-1 III. Disease Intervention Behaviors A. Assure examination of household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts 1. Explain that the medical facts just discussed clearly show that the patient's household contacts, sexual contacts, and needle-sharing contacts are in need of an exam as soon as possible. 2. Ask for the names and birthdays of all the children in the home. 3. Explain that other adults in the household need to be notified that they have been exposed to someone with a serious disease. This has to be done so that they can be tested for the infection and given vaccine as necessary. 4. Ask for the names and birthdays of all the adults in the house besides the husband/boyfriend. 5. Explain that the sex partners and needle-sharing partners (sex/NS partners) need to be notified privately that they have been exposed to someone with a serious disease. This has to be done in a way that doesn't embarrass them or the patient, but ensures that the examination takes place immediately by someone who knows enough about the circumstances to do the right things medically. 6. Tell the patient that you can work together to come up with the plan for notifying the sex/NS partners, and that you have to know about each of the sex/NS partners since a certain date in order to do that. 7. If the patient seems hesitant about talking about sex/NS partners, problem solve and explain the different plans and give different examples of how you would handle referrals. 8. Ask for the names of each of the sex/NS partners since the significant date you have established for the interview period. Do not be concerned if the patient doesn't supply the whole name, but emphasize that you want to discuss every partner during that period, regardless of how much they know about them. Continue to probe for partners even after the patient has indicated there are no more. Use some other identifier for sex/NS partners if the patient can't remember a name or nickname. 9. When further probing fails to produce other sex/NS partners, ask and record the last date of exposure beside each person's name. 10. Confront problems indicated by exposure gaps and conflicts with previously gathered information. 11. If you have not already done so, explain referral methods. 12. Gather locating information including full name, nicknames, address, telephone numbers, living-with status, employment, age, race, sex, marital status, physical descriptions, directions to home, description of home, etc. 13. Determine methods of sex/NS partner referral for each partner and agree to best approaches. 14. Coach patient on any contact referrals (referrals they prefer to make, themselves) and give guidelines and deadlines. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 5/2015 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 3Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Appendix D-1 B. Reduce Risk Purpose: This section is important for all patients to hear, but is especially important for those who appear to have contracted the infection sexually. The information should be tailored to each patient. 1. The patient should be instructed that it is possible for her to spread the hepatitis B virus to others. She should be told of ways to prevent this spread: a. Household articles that could become contaminated with blood (such as toothbrushes, nail clippers and razors) should not be shared. b. Cuts or skin lesions should be covered to prevent the spread of infectious secretions or blood. c. When seeking medical or dental care, those responsible for care should be informed of HBsAg status. d. If sexual partner(s) are not immune to hepatitis B, the partner should be advised to take precautions, including \"safer sex\" and vaccination, if warranted. e. \"Safer sex\" should be practiced for the prevention of many sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia infection, and HIV/AIDS. f. Blood, plasma, body organs, other tissue or sperm should not be donated. g. Enroll or stay in a drug treatment program if using illicit drugs. 2. Medical follow-up is needed for evaluation of chronic hepatitis B. Patients with progressive liver disease may need to be referred to a liver specialist for consideration of interferon therapy. 3. Other recommendations include: a. Limiting the number of sex partners. b. Limiting anonymous sex. c. Routine checkups for STDs and liver function. C. Respond to Disease Suspicion Purpose: In spite of current status, the patient should understand how to respond to signs that the infection has worsened. 1. Discuss clinical symptoms of hepatitis B. 2. Tell patient to return to provider immediately if symptoms appear. D. Complete Vaccine Series for All Exposed Purpose: The understanding of the multi-dose regimen is particularly important and these messages should be delivered in concert with individualized pamphlets. The case manager should be reinforcing messages expressed by the provider and verifying that the patient understands and intends to comply with the plan. 1. Emphasize the need for all exposed to complete the series, especially the baby and children of the household. Remind the patient that she is directly responsible for her baby's and other children's health. She should remind the nurses and her baby's doctor that she is a carrier of hepatitis B virus and her baby needs to complete the high- risk vaccine series. 2. Establish a specific schedule so that the patient is aware when the vaccine is due to be given to her baby. 3. Discuss contraindications and potential side effects.

Admission Orders for Labor & Delivery and Newborn Units to Prevent Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Transmission The guidelines in this 2-page document were developed to help hospitals establish policies and standing orders in their labor and delivery and newborn units. During 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in children which includes the recommendation to administer hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns before hospital discharge. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have all endorsed the birth dose recommendation. To obtain a copy, go to www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5416.pdf. To protect infants from HBV infection, CDC recommends that all delivery hospitals institute standing orders or admission orders, and protocols to ensure healthcare professionals do the following: Administer hepatitis B vaccine to 1. all newborns before they are discharged from the hospital. Identify all infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface 2. antigen (HBsAg) positive or to mothers with unknown HBsAg sta - tus. Administer appropriate immunoprophylaxis to these infants. Admission orders / procedures for birthing mothers For pregnant women who have a HBsAg lab report included in their prenatal records, do the following: Examine a copy of the 1. original laboratory report of the pregnant woman's HBsAg1 test result to verify that the correct test (i.e., HB - sAg) was performed and to verify that the testing date was during this pregnancy not a previous one. Do not rely on a handwritten or transcribed HBsAg test result! Place a copy of the original HBsAg lab report into (1) the pregnant 2. woman's L&D record and (2) the infant's hospital record. If the pregnant woman is HBsAg positive, alert the nursery staff that 3. the newborn is high risk and will need postexposure prophylaxis \u2014both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine\u2014within 12 hours of birth. Perform a repeat blood test for HBsAg4. 1 if the pregnant woman was HBsAg negative during a prenatal visit but was at risk for acquiring HBV infection during this pregnancy (e.g., not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship; had an HBsAg-positive sex partner; had evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease; currently uses or recently used in - jection drugs). Instruct the laboratory to call L&D and the nursery with the HBsAg 5. test result ASAP. For pregnant women who do not have an HBsAg lab report on their prenatal record, do the following: Perform HBsAg1. 1 testing ASAP on women who do not have a copy of an original HBsAg laboratory report from the current pregnancy included in their prenatal record. Instruct the lab to call L&D and the nursery units with the newly 2. obtained HBsAg test result ASAP. Admission orders / procedures for newborns Hospital procedures to follow for ALL newborns 1. Review a copy of the mother's original HBsAg1 lab report to ensure that the correct serologic test was ordered and that it was ordered during this pregnancy. 2. Determine if the newborn needs immediate postexposure pro - phylaxis within 12 hours of birth. To do this you must know the mother's HBsAg status and the newborn's birth weight. If the newborn weighs less than 2kg, see the descriptions below and footnotes 2, 5, 6. For newborns of HBsAg-negative mothers Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (0.5 mL, IM) be - 1. fore hospital discharge to all newborns weighing 2 kg or more at birth.2, 3, 4 Document the hepatitis B vaccine dose in the newborn's medi - 2. cal record, including date, time, site of administration, and lot number. Give the mother an immunization record card that includes the 3. hepatitis B vaccination date. Explain the need for the complete hepatitis B vaccine series to protect her baby. Remind her to bring the card with her each time her baby sees a provider. For newborns of mothers with unknown HBsAg status, do the following: Administer single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (0.5 mL, IM) within 1. 12 hours of birth.3, 5 Do not wait for test results to return before giving this dose of vaccine. Document the hepatitis B vaccine dose in the newborn's medical 2. record, including date, time, site of administration, and lot number. Give the mother an immunization record card that includes the 3. hepatitis B vaccination date. Explain the need for the complete hepatitis B vaccine series to protect her baby. Remind her to bring the card with her each time her baby sees a provider. Confirm that the laboratory has received blood for the mother's 4. HBsAg1 test. Verify when the mother's HBsAg result will be available and that 5. it will be reported to L&D and the newborn unit ASAP. If the nursery does not receive the report of the mother's HBsAg 6. test at the expected time, call the laboratory for the result. If the laboratory test indicates the mother's HBsAg7. 1 test result is positive, do the following: a. Administer hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG 0.5 mL, IM) to the newborn ASAP. (Hepatitis B vaccine should have been given within 12 hours of birth.) www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2130.pdf Item #p2130 (5/09) Immunization Action Coalition on next page)b. Document the HBIG dose appropriately in the newborn's medi - cal record. There is little benefit in giving HBIG if more than 7 days have elapsed since birth. c. Alert the mother's and newborn's physician(s) of the test result. d. Follow the instructions below \"For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers,\" steps 3-7. If the newborn must be discharged before the mother's HBsAg result 8. is known: a. Document contact information for the parents (e.g., addresses, telephone numbers, emergency contacts) in case further treatment is needed. b. Obtain the name, address, and phone number of the mother's and the newborn's healthcare providers. c. Notify the mother's and newborn's healthcare providers that the mother's HBsAg test result is pending. For newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers Administer HBIG (0.5 mL, IM) and single-antigen hepatitis B 1. vaccine3, 6 (0.5 mL, IM) at separate injection sites within 12 hours of birth. Document the hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG dose in the newborn's 2. medical record, including date, time, site of administration, and lot number. Give the mother an immunization record card that includes the 3. hepatitis B vaccination and HBIG dates. Explain the need for the complete hepatitis B vaccine series to protect her baby. Remind her to bring the card with her each time her baby sees a provider. Notify the local or state health department of the infant's birth 4. and the date and time of administration of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine doses. Obtain the name, address, and phone number of the newborn's 5. primary care provider. Notify the provider of the newborn's birth, the date and time of 6. HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine doses administered, and the impor - tance of additional on-time vaccination and postvaccination testing of the infant for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion of the hepatitis B vaccine series. Provide advice to the mother. Tell her the following: 7. a. That she may breast-feed her infant upon delivery, even before hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG are given; b. That it is critical for her infant to complete the full hepatitis B vaccine series on the recommended schedule; c. That blood will need to be drawn from the infant after completion of at least 3 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine series at age 9-18 months (usually done at a well-child visit) to determine if the infant developed a protective immune response to vaccination or needs additional management; d. About modes of HBV transmission and the need for testing and vacci - nation of susceptible household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts; e. That she needs to have a medical evaluation for chronic hepatitis B, including an assessment of whether she is eligible for antiviral treatment. Footnotes 1. Be sure the correct test for HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) was/is ordered. The HBsAg test should not be confused with other hepatitis B serologic tests, including antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs or HBsAb) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc or HBcAb). 2. Infants weighing less than 2 kg at birth and whose mothers are documented to be HBsAg negative should receive the first dose of vaccine 1 month after birth or at hospital discharge, whichever comes first. The mother's HBsAg test result must be part of the infant's medical record. 3. Federal law requires that you give parents a Hepatitis B Vaccine Infor - mation Statement (VIS) before vaccine administration. To obtain a VIS, download it from the IAC website at www.immunize.org/vis or call your state health department. 4. According to the CDC recommendations, exceptions to administering the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine are allowed on a case-by-case basis and only in rare circumstances. If a birth dose is not administered, a copy of the mother's negative HBsAg test result from the current pregnancy must be placed in the infant's medical record and the attending physician must write a specific order directing staff not to administer the birth dose in the hospital. Infants who do not receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine before hospital discharge should receive the first dose no later than age 2 months. 5. An infant weighing less than 2 kg whose mother's HBsAg status is un - known should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Do not count the hepatitis B vaccine dose as the first dose in the vaccine series. Reinitiate the full hepatitis B vaccine series at age 1-2 months. 6. An infant weighing less than 2 kg whose mother is HBsAg positive should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours of birth. Do not count the hepatitis B vaccine dose as the first dose in the vaccine series. Reinitiate the full hepatitis B vaccine series at age 1-2 months. SAMPLE TEXT Admission Order for Routine Newborn Hepatitis B Vaccination (to include in the standard admission orders) Hepatitis B Vaccine (RECOMBIV AX HB or Engerix-B) IM ONE TIME, Intramuscular, Dose: 0.5 mL.

Give the hepatitis B Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) to the parent and document the vaccine's administration in the hospital medical record. If the parent is unwilling to give verbal consent, notify physician by morning rounds or prior to 12 hours of age. Admission Orders for Labor & Delivery and Newborn Units to Prevent HBV Transmission continued from page 1 page 2Hepatitis B vaccine at birth saves lives! By Deborah L. Wexler, MD, Executive Director, Immunization Action Coalition In December 2005, CDC issued updated recommendations on hepatitis B vaccination (HepB) for infants. The recommendations strongly support (1) giving the HepB birth dose to every newborn prior to hospital discharge and (2) using standardized admission orders for administering the birth dose. In addition, it is recommended that a copy of the original maternal hepatitis B lab report be sent to the hospital\u2014 not a transcribed result. The recommendations also state that the HepB birth dose may be delayed until after hospital discharge only \"in rare circumstances.\" When doing so, a physician's order to withhold the birth dose and a copy of the original lab report indicating that the mother was HBsAg negative during this pregnancy should be placed in the infant's medical record. The latest CDC estimates indicate only 55% of newborns receive the HepB birth dose by 3 days of age. Clearly, there is much work left to do to fully protect newborns. Leading health organizations\u2014CDC, AAP, AAFP, and ACOG \u2014recommend that all hospitals and healthcare professionals protect newborns from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by administering the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) to every baby at birth, no later than hospital discharge. Approximately 24,000 women with chronic HBV infection give birth in the U.S. each year, and many do not know they are infected. Up to 95% of perinatal infections can be prevented by postexposure prophylaxis given within 12 hours of birth. Tragically, many babies are exposed to HBV at birth and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. Infants infected at birth have a greater than 90% chance of becoming chronically infected with HBV. Chronic HBV infection in infants leads to liver cancer, cirrhosis, and liver failure in 25% of these infants when they become adults. Why is a universal birth dose policy necessary in hospitals? Following are some of the ways newborns can be infected if they do not receive a dose of hepatitis B vaccine, ideally within 12 hours of birth: The pregnant woman is tested and found to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, but her \"infected\" status is not communicated to the newborn nursery. The infant receives neither HepB nor HBIG protection at birth. A chronically infected pregnant woman receives the wrong test. For example, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) is ordered in error, instead of HBsAg. This can happen because some labs use the confusing abbreviation HBsAb in - stead of anti-HBs. This misordering of a test is relatively common since the two abbreviations (HBsAg and HBsAb) differ by only one letter. However, when her incorrectly ordered test comes back \"negative,\" the woman may actu - ally be HBsAg positive and her infant would not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. The pregnant woman is HBsAg positive, but her test results are misinterpreted or mistranscribed into her prenatal record or her infant's chart. As a result, her infant does not receive HBIG or HepB. The pregnant woman is not tested for HBsAg either prenatally or in the hospital at the time of delivery. In one study, women who didn't receive prenatal care were eight times more likely to be HBsAg positive than women who received prena - tal care. When a woman does not receive prenatal care and is not tested at the time of delivery, her infant is in danger of being infected with HBV at birth\u2014unless he or she is born in a hospital that adheres to a policy of administering HepB within 12-24 hours of birth to every newborn without fail. This provides the greatest effectiveness in preventing HBV infection. She develops HBV infection later in pregnancy, but it is not clinically detected. Because her initial HBsAg test result is negative, she is not retested later in pregnancy as CDC recommends for high- risk women, and her infant does not receive HepB or HBIG at birth. The mother is HBsAg negative, but the infant is exposed to HBV postnatally from another family member or caregiver. This occurs in two-thirds of the cases of childhood transmission. State perinatal hepatitis B coordinators provided hundreds of reports of newborns who were unprotected or inadequately protected because of medical errors. In 2001, 2002, and 2008, the Immunization Ac - tion Coalition surveyed perinatal hepatitis B coor - dinators at every state health department, as well as at city and county CDC projects to assess their views about providing hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital. Their responses contained hundreds of reports of newborns who were unprotected or inad - equately protected because healthcare profession - als failed to order or misordered hepatitis B blood tests or misinterpreted, mistranscribed, or miscom - municated the test results of the children's mothers (see www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2062.pdf). These state coordinators' reports tell us that no matter how well healthcare providers think they are doing in screening all pregnant women for HBsAg, mistakes continue to occur. Newborns are are unnecessarily being exposed without the benefit of postexposure prophylaxis. At least one baby has died of fulminant hepatitis B; hundreds have become chronically infected and are doomed to preventable hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis later in life. To overcome these failures, perinatal hepatitis B coordinators overwhelmingly endorse providing a HepB birth dose as the first step in de - veloping a safety net to protect all infants from HBV infection, regardless of the circumstances. To maximally protect every newborn, CDC, AAP, AAFP, and ACOG recommend all infants be vac - cinated with a HepB birth dose prior to hospital discharge. Delaying hepatitis B vaccination until a follow-up office visit will be too late to prevent perinatal HBV transmission.* State perinatal hepatitis B coordinators surveyed overwhelmingly endorsed providing the birth dose. HepB is a highly effective vaccine. Studies have shown that infants of the most highly infectious mothers (women who are both HBsAg and HBeAg positive) who receive postexposure prophylaxis with HepB alone (without HBIG) at birth are pro - tected in 70%-95% of cases. Please read the hepa - titis coordinators' survey results (www.immunize. org/birthdose), including descriptions of their ex - periences with failures of the system \u2014failures that largely will be prevented by administering HepB to infants before they go home from the hospital, ideally within 12 hours of birth. Your support for providing a birth dose to new - borns while they are still in the hospital will protect and save lives that are now being put at risk. *For subsequent doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) in infants, use monovalent HepB or hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines. If using hepatitis B-containing combination vaccines, you will be giving 3 more doses of HepB. Giving a total of 4 doses of HepB to infants is acceptable practice to CDC, AAP, and AAFP. These vaccine doses are covered under the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program for VFC- eligible children.

CDC states it is not necessary for the patient to disclose a risk factor to receive hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who are at risk for sexual exposure: Sexually active persons who are not in long-term, mutually monogamous relationships Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons Persons seeking evaluation or treatment for an STD Men who have sex with men Persons at risk for infection by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood: Injection-drug users, current or past Household contacts of HBsAg-positive persons Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally challenged persons Healthcare and public safety workers with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids Persons with end-stage renal disease and those receiving dialysis Others: Travelers to areas with moderate or high rates of HBV infection Persons with chronic (life-long) liver disease Persons with HIV infection Refugees, immigrants, and adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic should have hepatitis B testing. Adults should discuss their need or desire for hepatitis B vaccination with their healthcare providers. For certain people at risk, p ostvaccination testing is recommended. Consult ACIP recommendations for details (see references). www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2110.pdf Item #P2110 (6/10) Who should be vaccinated? Hepatitis B lab nomenclature HBsAg: Hepatitis B surface antigen is a marker of infectivity. Its presence indicates either acute or chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBs: Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen is a marker of immunity. Its presence indicates an immune response to HBV infection, an immune response to vaccination, or the presence of passively acquired antibody. (It is also known as HBsAb, but this abbreviation is best avoided since it is often confused with abbreviations such as HBsAg.) Anti-HBc (total): Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen is a nonspecific marker of acute, chronic, or resolved HBV infection. It is not a marker of vaccine- induced immunity. It may be used in prevaccination testing to determine previous exposure to HBV infection. (It is also known as HBcAb, but this abbre - viation is best avoided since it is often confused with other abbreviations.) IgM anti-HBc: IgM antibody subclass of anti-HBc. Positivity indicates recent infection with HBV (within the past 6 mos). Its presence indicates acute infection. HBeAg: Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen is a marker of a high degree of HBV infectivity, and it correlates with a high level of HBV replication. It is primarily used to help determine the clinical management of patients with chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBe: Antibody to hepatitis B \"e\" antigen may be present in an infected or immune person. In persons with chronic HBV infection, its presence suggests a low viral titer and a low degree of infectivity. HBV-DNA: HBV Deoxyribonucleic acid is a marker of viral replication. It correlates well with infectivity. It is used to assess and monitor the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.Managing chronic HBV infection When you identify a patient who is chronically infected with HBV, make sure you consult a specialist knowledgeable in the treatment of liver disease so your patient's care is optimized. Chronically infected persons need medi - cal evaluation every 6-12 months to assess the status of their liver health and their need for antiviral therapy, as well as to screen for liver cancer. In addition, persons with chronic HBV infection should be educated about their disease and how to protect others. Household members and sex partners should be tested for HBV infection (HBsAg and antiHBs) and given the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at the same visit. (Vaccinating a person who has already been infected will do no harm). If testing indicates HBV susceptibility, complete the hepatitis B vaccination series. If testing indicates the presence of HBV infection, consultation and further care with a physician knowledgeable about chronic hepatitis B is needed. Serologic testing prior to vaccination may be undertaken based on your as - sessment of your patient's level of risk and your or your patient's need for definitive information (see information in the left column). If you decide to test, draw the blood first, and then give the first dose of vaccine at the same office visit. Vaccination can then be continued, if needed, based on the results of the tests. If you are not sure who needs hepatitis B testing, consult your state or local health department.About hepatitis B serologic testing Immunization Action Coalition 1573 St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.org 1.

Sincerely, ____________________________________ ____________________________________ Clinician's signature Clinician's name (print or type)What the Physician Can Do to Help the Child with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Sarah Jane Schwarzenberg, M.D. Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition University of Minnesota Although children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may follow many different clinical courses, these recommendations will help all of them maintain good health. 1. A yearly physical Every child with hepatitis B needs a yearly check-up with his/her primary physician to make sure the child is healthy and growing normally. 2. Laboratory studies to monitor liver health At the first clinical visit, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), INR, a complete blood count, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound are usually obtained. Thereafter, liver enzymes should be checked yearly in the healthy child with HBV . 3. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma There are no definitive guidelines for screening children with HBV for hepatocellular carcinoma. AFP is a tumor marker and is increased in 85% of individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma, often before clinical evidence of cancer is present. It may be elevated at a time when the tumor can be resected completely. We recommend yearly AFP in the child with HBV , and twice yearly testing with hepatic ultrasound in the child with cirrhosis and HBV . It should be noted that even close monitoring of these tests does not guarantee early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 4. Hepatitis B testing every 3-5 years Few children convert from HBsAg to anti-HBs (HBsAb), especially if they acquired the disease in the perinatal period. It is important to occasionally check to see if the patient is still infected. 5. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist Any child with an AST >2 times the upper limit of normal, evidence of hepatic dysfunction, failure to thrive, an elevated AFP, a need for family counseling, or abnormalities on hepatic ultrasound should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation. 6. Treatment Although medications are available to treat hepatitis B, they are generally useful only in patients with on-going hepatic injury (active hepatitis). Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist will help identify those patients who would benefit from medical therapy. 7. Vaccination of household members All members of the child's household and caregivers who have close contact with the child should be vaccinated against hepatitis B, even if pregnant. 8. Hepatitis B education Each child with hepatitis B and his/her parents should receive age-appropriate hepatitis B education. This should include methods for prevention of transmission of the virus and assistance for the child in dealing with his/her positivity throughout the school years and as a teenager. Older children should receive counseling on the use of condoms to prevent viral transmission to their sexual partners. 9. Maintaining personal health Immunization against hepatitis A is recommended to prevent a second injury to the liver. Ethanol should be avoided. When prescribing other medications, care must be taken to avoid or monitor those with known hepatotox - icity.

Different serologic \"markers\" or combinations of markers are used to identify different phases of HBV infection and to determine whether a patient has acute or chronic HBV infection, is immune to HBV as a result of prior infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection.Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): A protein on the surface of hepatitis B virus; it can be detected in high levels in serum during acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The presence of HBsAg indicates that the person is infectious. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs): The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating recovery and immunity from hepatitis B virus infection. Anti-HBs also develops in a person who has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B. Total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc): Appears at the onset of symptoms in acute hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with hepatitis B virus in an unde ned time frame. IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc): Positivity indicates recent infection with hepatitis B virus ( <6 mos). Its presence indicates acute infection.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Viral Hepatitis www.cdc.gov/hepatitisDivision of Viral Hepatitis www.cdc.gov/hepatitis1573 Selby Avenue, Suite 234 St. #P4090 (8/07) (continued on next page )QUESTIONS FREQUENTLY ASKED ABOUT HEPATITIS B What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem that affects people of all ages in the U.S. and around the world. In 2006, an estimated 46,000 people contracted hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. Hepatitis B is caused by a highly infectious virus that attacks the liver and can lead to severe illness, liver damage, and in some cases, death. The best way to be protected from hepa - titis B is to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, a vaccine used in the U.S. for more than two decades and proved safe and effective. Who is at risk for HBV infection? About 5% of people in the U.S. will get infected with HBV sometime during their lives if they are not vaccinated. You might be infected with HBV and not even know it. If you engage in certain activities, your risk might be much higher. You might be at risk if you have a job that exposes you to human blood share a household with someone who has chronic (lifelong) HBV infection inject drugs have sex with a person infected with HBV are sexually active but not in a long- term, mutually monogamous relation - ship are a man who has sex with men received a blood transfusion before 1975, when excellent blood testing became available are a person who was born, or who has a parent born, in Asia, Africa, the Amazon River Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East were adopted from Asia, Africa, the Amazon River Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East have hemophilia are a patient or worker in an institution for developmentally challenged people are an inmate of a correctional facility travel internationally to areas with mod- erate or high rates of HBV infection How is HBV spread? HBV is found in the blood of people infected with the virus and certain of their body fluids, such as serum, semen, and vaginal secretions. HBV is not found in sweat, tears, urine, or respiratory secre - tions. Contact with microscopic amounts of infected blood can cause infection. Hepatitis B virus can be spread by unprotected sex injection drug use an HBV-infected mother to her child during birth contact with blood or open sores of an HBV-infected person human bites from an HBV-infected person sharing a household with a person with chronic (lifelong) HBV infection sharing items such as razors, tooth - brushes, or washcloths pre-chewing food for babies or sharing chewing gum using unsterilized needles in ear- or body-piercing, tattooing, or acupuncture using the same immunization needle on more than one personHepatitis B virus IS NOT spread by casual contact, like holding hands eating food prepared by an infected person kissing or hugging sharing silverware, plates, or cups visiting an infected person's home sneezing or coughing breastfeeding What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? Most babies and young children who get HBV infection don't look or feel sick at all. About half of adults who get infected don't have any symptoms or signs of the disease. If people do have signs or symp - toms, they might experience any or all of the following: loss of appetite nausea, vomiting fever weakness, fatigue, inability to work for weeks or months abdominal pain yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) joint pain cola-colored urine clay-colored stools I'm not in a risk group. How did I get HBV infection? Many people don't know when or how they got the infection. When they get the results of a blood test indicating they've been infected with HBV , they are taken by surprise. Studies have demonstrated that about 15% of people who acquire hepatitis B are unable to identify a risk factor that explains why they have the disease. T echnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Aug. 2007.Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018(continued on next page )Do people usually recover from HBV infection? About 95% of adults recover after several months. They clear the infection from their bodies and become immune. This means they won't get infected with HBV again. They are no longer contagious and cannot pass HBV to others. Unfortunately, about 5% of adults and up to 90% of children under age 5 years are unable to clear the infection from their bodies and develop chronic HBV infection. How do I know if I have or have had HBV infection? The only way to know if you are current - ly infected with HBV , have recovered, are chronically infected, or could become in - fected, is by having blood tests. The three standard blood tests are the following: HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"reactive,\" it means the person is currently infected with HBV and is able to pass the infec - tion on to others. Anti-HBs [sometimes written as HBs-Ab] (antibody to hepatitis B sur - face antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"reactive,\" it means the person is immune to HBV infection, either from vaccination or from past infection. (This test is not done routinely by most blood banks on donated blood.) Anti-HBc [sometimes written as HBc-Ab] (antibody to hepatitis B core antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"re - active,\" it might mean the person has had contact with HBV . This is a very compli - cated test to explain because the \"anti- HBc\" can possibly be a \"false-positive\" test result. Blood banks routinely run an \"anti-HBc\" on donated blood. The inter - pretation of this test result, if it is posi - tive, depends on the results of the other two blood tests previously described. A fourth blood test that is sometimes done is IgM anti-HBc (IgM class anti - body to hepatitis B core antigen). When this is positive or \"reactive,\" it means that the person has had HBV infection in the past six months, indicating acute (recent - ly acquired) HBV infection. Interpretation of the hepatitis B blood test results *Postvaccination blood testing, when it is recommended, should be done 1-2 months after the final vaccine dose. 1. May be recovering from acute HBV infection. 2. May be distantly immune, and the test is not sensitive enough to detect a very low level of antiHBs in serum. 3. May be susceptible with a \"false posi tive\" antiHBc. 4. May be chronically infected and have an undetectable level of HBsAg present in the serum.susceptible immune due to vaccination immune due to natural infection newly infected chronically infected four interpretations negative negative negative positive with >10mIU/mL* negative positive positive positive positive positive negative positive positive negative negative negative positive negativeTests Results Interpretation Vaccination Needed Yes, for all people who want protection no no no no (may need treatment) possibly What does it mean if my blood bank said I tested positive for hepatitis B and can no longer donate blood? If the blood bank told you your test was \"positive,\" it is important to find out which test was positive. If the \"HBsAg\" was positive, this means that you are either chronically infected with HBV or were recently infected. If only the \"anti-HBc\" was positive, it is most likely that you either had a \"false-positive\" test or are immune to HBV infection (had HBV infection sometime in the past). It is important that you understand the full meaning of your test results. If you are not sure how to interpret these test results, call your blood bank for an explanation or have the blood bank send the test results to your healthcare provider. You may need to provide written permission for the blood bank to release these results to your healthcare pro - vider. Your healthcare provider may want to repeat the blood tests or perform additional tests such as an \"anti-HBs.\" Bring this information sheet along with you on your visit to your healthcare provider. The blood bank does not usually test for anti-HBs or IgM anti-HBc. And remember, you cannot get HBV from donating blood because the equipment used during blood donation is sterile. CHRONIC HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION What does it mean to be chronically infected with HBV? People who do not recover from HBV infection are chronically infected, usually for life. There are over one million chron - ically infected people in the U.S. today. A chronically infected person is someone who has had HBV in her/his blood for more than 6 months. While approxi - mately 5% of adults who acquire HBV infection become chronically infected, children younger than age 5 years have a greater risk (up to 90%). The younger the child is at the time of infection, the greater the risk that the child will develop chronic infection. Many babies born to chronically infected mothers will also become chronically infected with HBV unless the babies are given two shots in the hospital immediately after birth\u2014the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG])\u2014and at least two doses of hepa - titis B vaccine during the 6 months after Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018(continued on next page )birth to protect them from the infection. The final dose should not be given before 24 weeks of age. A chronically infected person might have no signs or symptoms of HBV infection but usually remains infected for years or for a lifetime and is capable of passing HBV on to others. Some - times chronically infected people will spontaneously clear the infection from their bodies, but most will not. Although most chronically infected people have no serious problems with hepatitis B and lead normal, healthy lives, some develop liver problems later. Chronically infected people are at significantly higher risk than the general population for liver fail - ure or liver cancer. How can I take care of myself if I am chronically infected with HBV? A person with HBV infection should see a physician knowledgeable about the management of liver disease every 6-12 months. The physician will do blood tests to check the health of the liver, as well as test for evidence of liver cancer. It is best for chronically infected people to avoid alcohol because alcohol can injure the liver. Additionally, your physician should know about all the medicines you are tak - ing, even over-the-counter drugs, because some medicines can hurt the liver. If the result of any liver test is abnormal, it's important that you consult a liver specialist. If your liver disease has progressed... If your physician tells you your liver dis - ease has progressed, read the following for some extra precautions you should take. Avoid alcohol and medicine that has not been prescribed by your doctor\u2014even over-the-counter medicines. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A virus infection can further damage your liver. Get a yearly influenza (flu) vaccination. Patients with severe liver disease (cir - rhosis) should also receive pneumococ - cal vaccine. Don't eat raw oysters. They may carry the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, which can cause serious blood infections in people with liver disease. Approximately 50% of people with this blood infection die from it. What can I do to protect others from HBV infection? People with HBV infection might feel healthy but are still capable of passing the infection on to other people. To protect others from getting HBV infection, it is important to protect them from contact with your infected blood and other infec - tious body fluids, including semen and vaginal secretions. Sweat, tears, urine, and respiratory secretions do not contain HBV . Transmission of HBV by saliva has only been documented through biting. Important DOs and DON'Ts for people with chronic HBV infection DO: Cover all cuts and open sores with a bandage. Discard used items such as bandaids and menstrual pads carefully so no one is accidentally exposed to your blood. Wash your hands well after touching your blood or infectious body fluids. Clean up blood spills. Then reclean the area with a bleach solution (one part household chlorine bleach to 10 parts water). Tell your sex partner(s) you have hepatitis B so they can be tested and vaccinated (if not already infected). Sex partners should be tested for anti- HBs 1-2 months after the three doses are completed to be sure the vaccine worked. Use condoms (rubbers) during sex un - less your sex partner has had hepatitis B or has been vaccinated and has had the anti-HBs blood test demonstrating immunity. (Condoms may also protect you from other sexually transmitted diseases.) Tell household members to see their healthcare providers for testing and vaccination for hepatitis B. Tell your healthcare providers that you are chronically infected with HBV . See your healthcare provider every 6-12 months to check the health of your liver with blood tests and liver scanning. If you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider that you have HBV infection. It is critical that your baby is started on the hepatitis B shots (both vaccine and HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. DON'T: Don't share chewing gum, toothbrush - es, razors, washcloths, needles for ear or body piercing, or anything that might have come in contact with your blood or infectious body fluids Don't pre-chew food for babies. Don't share syringes and needles. Don't donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, or sperm. Don't take any medicines not pre - scribed by your doctor, even over-the- counter medicines. What are the long-term effects of HBV infection? Each year, approximately 3,000-5,000 people in the U.S. die of HBV-related chronic liver disease. HBV infection is the most common cause of liver cancer worldwide and ranks second only to tobacco as the world's leading cause of cancer. Is there a cure for hepatitis B? As of this writing, there are several drugs used for the treatment of people with chronic hepatitis B. These drugs usually don't get rid of the virus completely, but may reduce your risk for serious liver disease such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Check with your doctor to find out if treatment with medication is the right choice for you. Researchers continue to find additional treatments and look for cures for hepatitis B.Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018Why is hepatitis B so serious in pregnant women? Pregnant women who are infected with HBV can transmit the disease to their babies. If babies aren't protected with vaccinations, many of them develop life - long HBV infections, and up to 25% of those who become infected will develop liver failure or liver cancer later in life. All pregnant women should be tested early in every pregnancy to determine if they are infected with HBV . If the blood test is positive, the baby should be vaccinated within 12 hours of birth with two shots, one of HBIG and the other the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine. The in - fant will need at least two more doses of hepatitis B vaccine by age 6 months. The final dose should not be given before age 24 weeks. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Hepatitis B vaccine can provide pro - tection in 90%-95% of healthy young adults. The vaccine can safely be given to infants, children, and adults, including pregnant women. Usually, three doses of vaccine are given over a 6-month period. Hepatitis B vaccine is very safe, and side effects are rare. Since 1982, more than 100 million children, teens, and adults in the U.S. have been vaccinated. Hepa - titis B vaccine is our first vaccine that prevents cancer\u2014liver cancer. At what age are hepatitis B vaccines given routinely? The hepatitis B vaccine series can begin at any age. For newborns, it's recom - mended that the first dose be given in the hospital at birth. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 0-18 years living in the U.S. Older children and teens should be vaccinated at the earliest opportunity. Any adult who is at risk for HBV infection or who simply wants to be protected from HBV infection should start the vaccine series right away.Where can I get hepatitis B vaccine? Check with your healthcare provider's office first. Children's health insurance usually covers the cost of this vaccine since it is routinely recommended for all children in the U.S. If your child is unin - sured, ask your local health department for assistance. The federal Vaccines For Children (VFC) program helps families by providing free vaccines to healthcare providers who serve eligible children. VFC is administered at the national level by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which contracts with vaccine manufacturers to buy vaccines at reduced rates. For adults, contact your healthcare provider to find out if the vaccine is available and how much it costs. If you are uninsured or don't have a healthcare provider, call your local health department for advice. How many doses of vaccine are needed? Three doses are needed usually for the best protection against HBV infection, but protection is sometimes provided from receiving as little as one dose. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given on a schedule of 0, 1, and 6 months, but there is flexibility in the timing of these injections. As with all other vaccines, if you fall behind on the schedule, you just continue from where you left off. Hepatitis B vaccine will not help or cure a person who is already infected with HBV . What should I do if I'm in a risk group and am not infected with HBV? If you are in a risk group for hepatitis B, be sure to get vaccinated! All people in risk groups (risk groups are listed in the second question on this question-and- answer series) should protect themselves from HBV infection. You don't have to \"admit\" that you have a risk factor to be vaccinated. You simply need to ask to be vaccinated. Every day you delay getting vaccinated increases your chances of being in contact with this highly conta - gious liver disease. The problems caused by hepatitis B\u2014liver cancer and liver failure\u2014are too great to take a chance. See your healthcare provider or visit your health department. How does hepatitis B differ from hepatitis A and C? Hepatitis A, B, and C are all different viruses that attack and injure the liver, and all can cause similar symptoms. Usually, people get hepatitis A virus (HA V) infection from household or sexual contact with a person who has the infection. Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is spread through HCV-infected blood. Both HCV- and HBV- infections are spread by blood through some of the same activi - ties (e.g., injection drug use). Both HBV- and HCV- infections can cause lifelong liver problems. HA V infection does not. Vaccines to prevent HA V infection are also available. Hepatitis A vaccine won't protect you from HBV or HCV infection, nor will hepatitis B vaccine protect you from HA V or HCV infec - tion. There is no vaccine yet for hepatitis C. If you've been infected with HA V or HCV in the past, it is still possible to get infected with HBV . Where can I receive more information about hepatitis B?

Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby Ave., Suite admin@immunize.org www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.org (HBV) infection . . . If you have chronic hepatitis B virus infec - tion (HBV), you are not alone. Today, approximately one million people in the United States are chronically infected with HBV. The majority of infected people feel healthy for their entire lives and do not demonstrate any evidence of ongoing liver damage. Other people progress to levels of more severe disease. Some people ultimately develop liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, or liver cancer. It is important that you take care of yourself. And because it is possible to spread HBV to others, you have to know how to protect your family, friends, and others from this disease. How you can take care of yourself People who have chronic HBV infection need regular monitoring of their liver condition to determine whether their disease is progressing, whether treatment is needed, or whether a liver cancer is developing. Make sure you do the following: See your doctor for evaluation of your liver's condition once or twice a year. Certain blood tests need to be performed periodically to monitor your liver's health. Discuss with your doctor if you are a candidate for antiviral medication. These medicines are given to certain people with chronic liver disease. Discuss with your doctor about getting periodic ultrasounds, alpha-fetoprotein blood tests, or other studies to make sure there is no evidence of a developing liver cancer. Physicians may recommend different schedules for ultrasounds and blood tests depending on the patient's age, sex, ethnicity, age at which the infection was initially acquired, family history, HBeAg status, and liver enzymes. Usually, ultrasounds and blood tests are recommended every six to 12 months. Review with your physician all medica - tions you take. Even some \"over-the- counter\" medications can injure your liver. If you are pregnant, tell your physician that you have chronic HBV infection. It is essential that your baby be given an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and started on the hepatitis B vaccine series within 12 hours of birth. Avoid alcoholic beverages. Alcohol can damage your liver.If your doctor tells you your liver disease has progressed... If your liver disease progresses, here are some extra precautions you should take: Get your yearly influenza vaccine. Patients with severe liver disease should also receive pneumococcal poly - saccharide vaccine. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A can further damage your liver. Don't eat raw oysters. Raw oysters may carry the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus which can cause a serious blood infection in individuals with liver disease. Approxi - mately 40% of these cases are fatal. How to protect others from HBV infection People can get HBV infection from you by coming in contact with your blood, serum, semen, or vaginal fluids. HBV has also been transmitted by human bites. Although HBV has been detected in low concentrations in other body fluids, including tears, sweat, urine, feces, and breast milk, these fluids have not been associated with any docu - mented transmission. Fortunately, HBV is not transmitted by sneezing or coughing, or from casual contact such as holding hands. Here are some important guidelines for you to follow so that others are protected: Tell your sex partner(s) that you are infected with HBV. Your sex partner(s) must see a physician for hepatitis B blood testing and should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at this same visit. If, according to the blood tests, your partner has never had hepatitis B, he or she should complete the vaccination se - ries. One to two months after the series of three shots is completed, your partner needs to return to the doctor for blood testing to make sure the vaccine protected him or her. Use condoms until your part - ner is proven to be protected from HBV. Make sure all your household members see their physicians for hepatitis B testing and vaccination. Tell your healthcare providers that you are infected with HBV. Cover all cuts and open sores with a bandage. Throw away used personal items such as tissues or menstrual pads in a bag that does not leak so others will not be ex - posed to your blood. Wash your hands well after touching your blood or body fluids. More resources...

Then reclean the area with bleach solution (one part regular household bleach to 10 parts water). Do not share toothbrushes, razors, needles for ear piercing, nail files, clippers, nail scissors, washcloths, or anything that may have come in contact with your blood or body fluids. Do not share food that has been in your mouth (e.g., chewing gum) and do not pre-chew food for babies. Do not share syringes, needles, or drugs. Do not donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, or sperm. Know that if someone is exposed to your blood\u2014be it a family member, a friend, or even a stranger\u2014 preventive treatment is available for that person. If the exposed person receives HBIG and starts the hepatitis B vaccine series right away, that person has an excellent chance of being protected from HBV!

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de informaci\u00f3n www.immunize.org/vis 1 What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious infection that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus. In 2009, about 38,000 people became infected with hepatitis B. Each year about 2,000 to 4,000 people die in the United States from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Hepatitis B can cause:Acute (short-term) illness. This can lead to: loss of appetite diarrhea and vomiting tiredness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Acute illness, with symptoms, is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not have symptoms. Chronic (long-term) infection . Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Most of them do not have symptoms, but the infection is still very serious, and can lead to: liver damage (cirrhosis) liver cancer death Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who are chronically infected can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they don't look or feel sick. Up to 1.4 million people in the United States may have chronic hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B virus is easily spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also be infected from contact with a contaminated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days. A baby whose mother is infected can be infected at birth; Children, adolescents, and adults can become infected by: - contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores; - contact with objects that have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes, razors, or monitoring and treatment devices for diabetes; - having unprotected sex with an infected person;- sharing needles when injecting drugs; - being stuck with a used needle. 2 Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated? Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of hepatitis B infection, including liver cancer and cirrhosis. Hepatitis B vaccine may be given by itself or in the same shot with other vaccines. Routine hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for some U.S. adults and children beginning in 1982, and for all children in 1991. Since 1990, new hepatitis B infections among children and adolescents have dropped by more than 95%\u2014and by 75% in other age groups. Vaccination gives long-term protection from hepatitis B infection, possibly lifelong. 3 Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when? Children and adolescents Babies normally get 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine: 1st Dose: Birth 2nd Dose: 1-2 months of age 3rd Dose: 6-18 months of age Some babies might get 4 doses, for example, if a combination vaccine containing hepatitis B is used. (This is a single shot containing several vaccines.) The extra dose is not harmful. Anyone through 18 years of age who didn't get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. Adults All unvaccinated adults at risk for hepatitis B infection should be vaccinated. This includes: - sex partners of people infected with hepatitis B,- men who have sex with men,- people who inject street drugs,- people with more than one sex partner, - people with chronic liver or kidney disease, - people under 60 years of age with diabetes, - people with jobs that expose them to human blood or other body fluids,- household contacts of people infected with hepatitis B, - residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled, - kidney dialysis patients, - people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common, - people with HIV infection. Other people may be encouraged by their doctor to get hepatitis B vaccine; for example, adults 60 and older with diabetes. Anyone else who wants to be protected from hepatitis B infection may get the vaccine. Pregnant women who are at risk for one of the reasons stated above should be vaccinated. Other pregnant women who want protection may be vaccinated. Adults getting hepatitis B vaccine should get 3 doses\u2014with the second dose given 4 weeks after the first and the third dose 5 months after the second. Your doctor can tell you about other dosing schedules that might be used in certain circumstances. 4 Who should not get hepatitis B vaccine? Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Your doctor can give you more information about these precautions. Note: You might be asked to wait 28 days before donating blood after getting hepatitis B vaccine. This is because the screening test could mistake vaccine in the bloodstream (which is not infectious) for hepatitis B infection. 5 What are the risks from hepatitis B vaccine? Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The vaccine contains non-infectious material, and cannot cause hepatitis B infection. Some mild problems have been reported: Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4). Temperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15). Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses.A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people in the United States have been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine. 6 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 8 How can I learn more?

Various serologic procedures are performed for a variety of bacterial, parasitic, and viral agents except for HIV. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is performed in the Virology Unit. Hepati tis serology is only performed for county health departments and Georgia Department of Public Health agencies. Tests not performed in the Public Health Laboratory can be forwarded to CDC, if the submitter requests the testing. SPECIMEN COLLECTION/LAB ELING/REQUISITION FORM Collection Using Universal Precautions, and standard venipuncture technique, collect approximately six milliliters of whole blood (for serum) in a red top tube (no additive), labeled with patient's identifier (name, first and last, or number), data, and name of the submitter. Use a marker that will not fade, smear, or run during transportation. Use proper size needle (large enough to prevent hemolysis of the red blood cells) for the vein location and age of the patient. Allow blo od specimen to clot, at least 30 minutes undisturbed, at room temperature, and transport, or place in the refrigerator for transporting. Collect blood specimens in, or transfer them to, non -breakable, leak resistant tubes. Specimens should be transported as soon as possible, do not hold over 7 days. Specimens over 14 days old are unacceptable. Many of the procedures we perform are not approved for use with plasma. Therefore, please submit only serum or whole blood without anticoagulants, not plasma. Collect cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) according to proper hospital procedure. CSF contaminated with blood or grossly contaminated with bacteria is unacceptable. Labeling All specimens must be labeled with patient identification (name or number), in acceptabl e testing condition, and accompanied by a completed requisition form. If the form is not specific for one test or a set of tests, the specific testing requested must be hand - written in the proper area, e.g., \"viral serology\" is not acceptable, the specific agent, e.g., \"CMV\", must be clearly requested. Failure to provide proper patient information may result in testing delays. Requisition Form : Use Form #3583 for all tests performed by the Microbial Immunology Unit. There is a single requisition form for all tests performed in the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Hepatitis B 38 testing is performed for the (Department of Public Health facilities and county health departments only). Completely fill out the form and include the following information: 1. Unique patient identifier (name or number). 2. TEST(S) REQUESTED (Please check only the corresponding box for test(s) requested). 3. Date specimen collected. 4. Submitter's name, address and code number, where applicable. 5. For hepatitis the reason for testing, e.g., routine, or prenatal. 6. Any information the submitter needs for patient identification, e.g., chart number, address. 7. The date of onset of illness, if applicable. 8. Race, sex, and age, where applicable, e.g., hepat itis testing. SHIPMENT OF SPECIMENS Use outfit #0500, available from Laboratory Services and Supply, 404 -327-7920, and follow the specific instructions below. For HCV Viral Load testing please use outfit 502. Routine specimens may be mailed at room temperatures overnight or delivered cold to the laboratory by courier. HCV Viral Load should be sent frozen by overnight courier. Shipp ing Instructions for USPS and Couriers: Place the tubes of blood in protective, leak resistant, doubled -walled containers, e.g., aluminum and cardboard box, for transport. Wrap the requisition form around the inner (aluminum) can, secure with a rubber ban d and place in the outer container. If a screw -cap outer container is used, the screw -cap must be secured with tape or the Postal Service will return it for taping. Up to 50 milliliters of blood may be transported in one package (U.S. postal regulations) . Therefore, an individual tube of blood may be placed in the metal can, with the requisition form secured to the outside by a rubber band, and several aluminum cans placed in one cardboard box for transporting. Shipping Instructions for Courier Services Only: Tubes of blood may be placed in leak proof biohazard bags. Wrap brown absorbent material around the tube, then secure with a rubber band. Place the requisition form in the sleeve located on the outside of the bag. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Table 1 summarizes the interpretation of results for all serological tests performed in the Microbial Immunology Unit. The turnaround time after receipt of the specimen depends on the testing methodology and the frequency of testing. The frequency of testing depe nds on the demand for a specific test. Several tests are performed daily, while others are performed weekly. The turn -around time for specimens referred to CDC depends on CDC's schedule, which varies from laboratory to laboratory. 39 UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN S 1. Spinal fluid obviously contaminated with bacteria or blood; 2. All specimens: Not approved for testing by the indicated method, e.g., plasma for RPR. Grossly hemolyzed, lipemic, turbid, or contaminated. Over 14 days old. Broken in transit. Insuf ficient quantity for testing. No identification on specimen. Name on the tube and form does not match.

Hepatitis - 8/2015 State Hepatitis Program 1 State Hepatitis Program Background: The State Hepatitis Program provides hepatitis B vaccine when indicated to eligible children and adults through the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, and the STD/HIV Program and Family Planning Program. Hepatitis A vaccine is provided to eligible children through the Vaccines for Children Program, high-risk adults, and to both children and adults in outbreak situations. Groups recommended for routine vaccination: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all persons aged zero through 18 years, and adults at highest risk for the hepatitis B virus. These high-risk groups are as follows: /square4 Persons with occupational risk of infection through exposure to blood /square4 Clients and staff of institutions for the developme ntally disabled /square4 Hemodialysis patients /square4 Patients with bleeding disorders who are recipients of certain blood products /square4 Household contacts and sexual partners of persons i nfected with HBV /square4 Household members of HBsAg-positive adoptees /square4 International travelers to areas with high or inter mediate rates of HBV infection /square4 Injecting drug users (IDU) /square4 Sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) /square4 Sexually active heterosexual men and women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually transmitted diseases, and for persons who have a history of sexual activity with more than one partner in the previous 6 months. NOTE: Persons seen for evaluation of sexually transmitted diseases should be considered candidates for vaccination /square4 Inmates of juvenile detention centers or long-term correctional facilities /square4 Persons with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) /square4 Persons with HIV infection Hepatitis A Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children 12 through 23 months of age. Also, older children and adolescents who are susceptible should be immunized, when seen by their providers. All persons aged > 12 months of age who are at increased risk for infection or severe outcomes from the disease should receive hepatitis A vaccine. These groups include the following: /square4 Travelers to countries where hepatitis A is endemic /square4 Close contacts of newly arriving international adop tees from countries of high or intermediate endemicity /square4 Men who have sex with men (MSM) Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 State Hepatitis Program 2 State Hepatitis Program /square4 Users of illegal injection and non-injection drugs /square4 Persons with clotting-factor disorders /square4 Persons with chronic liver disease /square4 Persons with occupational risk (e.g., working with nonhuman primates) Note: See Chapter 2 of this Manual for list of persons eligible for state-supplied vaccine in Public Health clinics. Provision of vaccine for routine vaccination by the State Hepatitis Program: The State Immunization Program provides hepatitis B vaccine to VFC and PeachCare eligible children ages birth through 18 years, household and sexual contacts to acute and chronic hepatitis B cases (which includes perinatal cases), and persons seeking evaluation for an STD at a public STD/HIV or Family Planning not indicated before rou tine vaccination of infants, children and adults. Prevaccination serology should be performed on persons who are at highest risk for infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Those clients at highest risk are defined as: /square4 Injection drug users (IDU) /square4 Sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) /square4 Sexually active heterosexual men and women with mor e than one sex partner within a 6-month period /square4 Certain persons receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppre ssive therapy /square4 All persons born in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islan ds, and other regions with HBsAg prevalence of 2% or higher /square4 Children of immigrants from endemic countries /square4 Household, sex, and needle-sharing contacts of hepa titis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive persons Persons being evaluated in STD/ HIV and Family Planning clinics should first be assessed for risk factors and serologic testing performed if indicated. The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at the same visit as serologic testing. Draw the blood before administering vaccine. After the results of the serologic tests are received and the client is found to be susceptible, the second and third doses should be administered according to the client's age as specified in the ACIP recommended schedule. Always check GRITS for patient's history of hepatitis B vaccination, especially for persons born on or after 1/1/1992. Prevaccination Serology for Hepatitis A: Prevaccination serology for hepatitis A is not indicated for routine vaccination of children and adults. Antibody production in response to HAV infection results in lifelong immunity to hepatitis A infection. Vaccination of persons who are immune because of prior Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 State Hepatitis Program 3 State Hepatitis Program infection does not increase the risk for adverse events. In populations that have expected high rates of prior HAV infection, prevaccination testing may be considered to reduce costs by not vaccinating persons who have prior immunity. Testing of children is not indicated because of their expected low prevalence of infection. For adults, the decision to test should be based upon the following information: a) the expected prevalence of immunity; b) the cost of vaccination compared with the cost of serologic testing (including the cost of an additional visit); and c) the likelihood that testing will not interfere with initiating vaccination. Persons for whom prevaccination testing will likely be most cost-effective include: /square4 Adults who were either born in or lived for extensi ve periods in geographic areas that have a high endemicity of HAV infection; /square4 Older adolescents and adults in certain populations (i.e., American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic); /square4 Adults in certain groups that have a high prevalenc e of infection (e.g., injecting drug users); /square4 Adults 40 years of age and older Post-vaccination serology for Hepatitis B Testing for immunity to hepatitis B following vaccination is not routinely recommended but should be considered for persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status. This would include: /square4 Infants born to HBsAg-positive women /square4 Dialysis patients, persons with weakened immune sys tems and health care workers who have direct contact with blood or body fluids When indicated, post-vaccination testing for children and adults should be done 1 to 2 months after completion of the vaccine series to provide definitive information on response to the vaccine. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs at 9 months of age or 30 to 60 days after the final dose of hepatitis B vaccine, if the infant/child is older than 9 months of age. Post-vaccination serology for Hepatitis A Post-vaccination serology is not indicated in persons receiving hepatitis A vaccine due to the high rate of response among children and adults. No test sensitive enough to detect low anti-HAV concentrations after vaccination is approved for routine diagnostic use in the United States.

Hepatitis - 8/2015 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 1Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Background The goal of hepatitis B immunization is to prevent transmission of chronic HBV infection, which in turn prevents chronic liver disease and liver cancer. While routine vaccination of infants in the United States will eventually produce a population highly immune to hepatitis B, further efforts must be extended to prevent transmission among groups at highest risk for infection (see list below). Healthy People 2020 goals state that \"viral hepatitis can be prevented, yet health care systems often do not make the best use of their available resources to support prevention efforts.\" To reach the Healthy People 2020 target for adults (1.5 cases per 100,000), hepatitis B vaccination programs must continue to focus on susceptible persons at the highest risk of infection. In 2010, there were 1.6 cases per 100,000 population reported in Georgia, with individual county rates ranging from 0.7 to 16.1 cases per 100,000. By 2014, the incidence rate in Georgia had declined to 1.0 case per 100,000; however, of the data collected on risk factors, the majority of newly acquired cases of hepatitis B are associated with high-risk sexual activity or injection-drug use. It is important to provide prevention and healthy lifestyles information. This includes advancing effective and evidence-based viral hepatitis prevention priorities and interventions. Vaccinating susceptible persons attending public Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD), HIV, and Family Planning clinics in Georgia will reduce the transmission of HBV to sexually active adolescents and adults. Measures should be taken at the district and county levels to avoid missed opportunities to vaccinate high-risk patients, especially those referred by Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Managers and other Public Health staff. High-risk Groups for whom Hepatitis B Vaccination is Recommended 1. Persons with occupational risk. Any healthcare or public-safety worker may be at risk for HBV exposure, depending on the tasks performed. Workers who perform tasks involving contact with blood or blood-contaminated body fluid should be vaccinated. For persons in health-care fields, vaccination should be completed during training in schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health professions, before trainees have their first contact with blood. 2. Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled. Susceptible clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled, as well as staff who work closely with clients, should be vaccinated. Susceptible clients and staff who live or work in smaller residential settings with known HBV carriers should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. Clients discharged from residential institutions into community programs should be screened for HBsAg so that appropriate measures can be taken to prevent HBV transmission. These measures should include both environmental controls and appropriate use of vaccine. Staff of nonresidential day-care programs for the developmentally disabled (e.g., schools, sheltered workshops) attended by known HBV chronic carriers have a risk of infection comparable with that of health-care workers and therefore should be vaccinated. The risk of infection for other clients appears to be lower than the risk for staff. Vaccination of clients in day care programs may be considered. Vaccination of classroom contacts is strongly encouraged if a classmate who is an HBV carrier behaves aggressively or has special medical problems (e.g., exudative dermatitis, open skin lesions) that increase the risk of exposure to his or her blood or serous secretions. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 2Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health 3. Hemodialysis patients. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible hemodialysis patients. Vaccinating patients early in the course of their renal disease is encouraged because patients with uremia who are vaccinated before they require dialysis are more likely to respond to the vaccine. Although their seroconversion rates and anti-HBs titers are lower than those of healthy persons, patients who respond to vaccination will be protected from infection, and the need for frequent serologic testing will be reduced. 4. Adults with diabetes mellitus . All previously unvaccinated adults aged 19 through 59 years with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) should be vaccinated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of diabetes is made. Unvaccinated adults aged >60 years with diabetes may be vaccinated at the discretion of the treating clinician, after assessing their risk and the likelihood of an adequate immune response to vaccination. 5. Recipients of certain blood products. Patients who receive clotting-factor concentrates have an increased risk of HBV infection and should be vaccinated as soon as their specific clotting disorder is identified. Prevaccination testing is recommended for patients who have already received multiple infusions of these products. 6. Household contacts and sex partners of HBV carriers. All household and sexual contacts of persons identified as HBsAg positive should be vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at the age-appropriate dose to those determined to be susceptible or judged likely to be susceptible to infection. 7. Adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic. Adopted or fostered orphans or unaccompanied minors from countries where HBV infection is endemic should be screened for HBsAg. If the children are HBsAg positive, other family members should be vaccinated. 8. International travelers. Vaccination should be considered for persons who plan to spend more than 6 months in areas with high rates of HBV infection and who will have close contact with the local population. Short-term travelers who are likely to have contact with blood (e.g., in a medical setting) or sexual contact with residents of areas with high or intermediate levels of endemic disease should be vaccinated. Vaccination should begin at least 6 months before travel to allow for completion of the full vaccine series, although a partial series will offer some protection. The alternate four-dose schedule should provide protection if the first three doses can be delivered before departure. 9. Injecting drug users (IDU). All injecting drug users who are susceptible to HBV should be vaccinated as soon as their drug use begins. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population, prevaccination screening should be considered. 10. Men who have sex with men (MSM). Susceptible MSM should be vaccinated. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this po pulation, prevaccination screening should be considered. Men known to have HIV infection should be tested for anti-HBs response after completion of the vaccine series. Check GRITS for patients born on or after 1/1/1992. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 3Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health 11. Sexually active heterosexual men and women. Vaccination is recommended for men and women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually transmitted diseases, for prostitutes, and for persons who have a history of sexual activity with more than one partner in the previous 6 months. Most patients seen in clinics for sexually transmitted diseases should be considered candidates for vaccination. Check GRITS for patients born on or after 1/1/1992. 12. Inmates of long-term correctional facilities . Prison officials should consider undertaking screening and vaccination programs directed at inmates with histories of high-risk behaviors. Eligibility for Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD/HIV and Family Planning Clinics in Georgia The following persons ARE ELIGIBLE to receive state-supplied hepatitis B vaccine if screened in any Public Health clinic and are Medicare covered, Medicaid covered, underinsured, or uninsured: 1. Men having sex with men (MSM) 2. Injecting drug users (IDU) 3. Individuals with multiple sex partners (more than 1 partner in the past six months) 4. Homeless Adults 5. Persons seeking STD/HIV screening services including HIV testing and counseling 6. Persons recently diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) 7. Persons seeking Family Planning clinic services 8. Sexual partners and household contacts of persons with acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection 9. Hemodialysis and transplant patients 10. Persons who began the series using state-supplied vaccine and still need to complete the series, regardless of insurance status 11. Diabetics (Type 1 or Type 2) 12. Any unvaccinated adult who wants to be protected against hepatitis B virus Note: See Chapter 2 of this manual for the Eligibility Criteria for Vaccine supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for children, adolescents and adults in Public Health clinics. Persons NOT ELIGIBLE to receive state-supplied hepatitis B vaccine for routine immunizations include: 1. Public safety workers 2. Health care workers 3. International travelers 4. Inmates 5. Staff of institutions for developmentally disabled 6. Insured clients with immunization coverage 7. Refugees > 19 years of age Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 4Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B with Vaccine and HBIG Recommendations on postexposure prophylaxis are based on available efficacy data and on the likelihood of future HBV exposure of the person requiring treatment. In all exposures, a regimen combining HBIG with hepatitis B vaccine will provide both short- and long-term protection and is the treatment of choice. Please refer to Chapter 2, \"Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Adult Populations (age 19 years)\" in this manual for the eligibility requirements for persons to receive state-supplied HBIG. Immunization Consent Requirements Vaccination against viral hepatitis for persons under the age of 18 years without parental/guardian consent can occur in conjunction with STD/HIV examinations due to already existing laws and legal precedent relating to STD/HIV examination and treatment of minors (O.C.G.A. 31-17-7). In these instances, a minor is considered to be receiving hepatitis B vaccine as prophylaxis for STD, and therefore is covered under the aforementioned section of the Official Code of Georgia. Conversely, persons less than 18 years of age cannot be vaccinated without parental/guardian consent in any other vaccination setting, including school vaccination programs, outbreak control settings where mass vaccinations are being given, and other clinic settings where STD/HIV evaluations and treatments are not conducted. Serology Testing Prevaccination serologic testing for susceptibility Prevaccination serology is cost effective and should be considered in persons who are at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Due to higher seroprevalence, the following high-risk groups should receive prevaccination testing: 1. Men having sex with men (MSM) 2. Injecting drug users (IDU) 3. Sexual/household/needle-sharing contacts of persons infected with HBV 4. Persons born in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and other high-prevalence regions Prevaccination testing should not interfere with administering vaccine during the visit for which immunization against hepatitis B is requested. To test high-risk patients for history of disease and the need for vaccine, order HBsAg and anti-HBs tests. Draw the blood before administering vaccine. The first dose of vaccine should be given at the same visit as the blood test. If the client is found susceptible to HBV (via negative serology), then doses 2 and 3 should be administered at the appropriate intervals. It is not cost-effective for groups with a low expected prevalence of HBV serologic markers, to receive prevaccination testing. Therefore, pre-vaccination serology is not indicated before routine vaccination of infants, children, or adolescents. The Georgia Public Health Laboratory hepatitis serology consists of HBsAg, total anti-HBc, HBeAg, and anti-HBs. Specific guidelines for ordering hepatitis B serologic testing can be found in the Georgia Public Health Laboratory Service Manual in the \"Microbiology Services- Immunology-Infectious Disease Serology\" section. https://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files/ related_files/site_page/LSM2013_June.docx %207.3.13.pdf For additional information regarding the interpretation of hepatitis B serology, please see Appendix H4 of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 5Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Postvaccination Testing Hepatitis B vaccine, when given at the correct anatomic site produces protective antibody (anti- HBs) in greater than 90% of healthy persons. Testing for immunity after vaccination is not recommended routinely but is advised for persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status (such as dialysis patients, other immunocompromised patients, and health care workers with direct contact to blood and body fluids). Testing for immunity is also advised for persons for whom a suboptimal response may be anticipated, such as those who had received vaccine in the buttock, persons aged 50 years or older, and persons known to have HIV infection. Postvaccination testing should also be considered for persons at occupational risk who may have needle-stick exposures necessitating postexposure prophylaxis. When indicated, postvaccination testing should be done between 1and 3 months after completion of the vaccine series to provide definitive information on response to the vaccine. Note: The postvaccination serology recommendation for infants born to HBsAg-positive women is 3 to 9 months after the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who do not respond to the first series of hepatitis B vaccine should complete a second three-dose series. Revaccination of persons who do not respond to the primary series produces adequate antibody in 15%-25% after one additional dose and in 30%-50% after three additional doses when the primary vaccination has been given in the deltoid. For persons who did not respond to a primary vaccine series given in the buttock, data suggest that revaccination in the arm induces adequate antibody in greater than 75%. Sexual Partners of Persons with Acute HBV Infection Sexual partners of HBsAg-positive persons are at increased risk of acquiring HBV infection, and post-exposure administration of HBIG has been shown to be 75% effective in preventing such infections. Data about the efficacy of HBIG beyond the 14-day cutoff is limited and the period after sexual exposure during which HBIG is effective is unknown; however, it is unlikely that this period would exceed 14 days. Testing of sexual partners for susceptibility is recommended at the same visit as the first dose of vaccine. Be sure to draw blood for the serology before administering the vaccine. If a sexual partner is found susceptible after serology, then administer doses 2 and 3 at the appropriate dosage and time intervals. Household Contacts of Persons with Acute HBV Infection Since infants have close contact with primary care givers and they have a higher risk of becoming HBV carriers after acute HBV infection, prophylaxis of an unvaccinated infant less than 12 months of age with HBIG (0.5 mL) and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated if the mother or primary care giver has acute HBV infection. Prophylaxis with HBIG for other household contacts of persons with acute HBV infection is not indicated unless they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes or razors, within the past 7 days. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for household contacts and the first dose should be administered at the same visit as the prevaccination serology. Be sure to draw blood for the serology before administering the vaccine. If the household contact is found susceptible after serology, then administer doses 2 and 3 at the appropriate dosage and time intervals. Such exposures should be treated similarly to sexual exposures. If the index patient becomes an HBV carrier, all household contacts should be given hepatitis B vaccine. NOTE : Administering even one dose of hepatitis B vaccine allows seroconversion for 40% to 50% of persons receiving vaccine. Always encourage clients to complete the Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 8/2015 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 6Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health series, but do not withhold vaccine if uncertain that the client will return for the subsequent doses. General Hepatitis B Vaccination Requirements Please see Chapter 2, \"Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis B\", for specific vaccine administration guidelines. Reporting Requirements All Georgia physicians, laboratories, and other health care providers are required by the authority of the Official Code of Georgia (Sections 31-12-2 and 31-22-7, Rules of the Department of Public Health) to report persons with acute hepatitis B disease or persons who are HBsAg positive within 7 days to their County Health Department or District Health Office. Hepatitis B cases may also be reported to the Epidemiology Section. The preferred method of reporting is through the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SendSS), available at http://sendss.state.ga.us/. In addition, positive serologic tests and acute cases received by the County Health Department or Health District are to be reported via SendSS. Hepatitis B Counseling Interview Each person infected with HBV should be counseled regarding the infection and interviewed for household and sexual contacts. For more specific information, please refer to \"Example Interviewing/Counseling Format (for) Hepatitis B,\" found in the Appendix section of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines in this chapter.

Recall Of Patients - 7/2015 Recall of Immunization Patients Policy Statement 1 One of the national objectives recommended in the Health and Human Services document, Healthy People 2020 , calls for the completion of primary immunizations for 90% of newborn children by the time they reach two years of age. This goal is endorsed by the Georgia Immunization Program and is one of the reasons that efforts to recall children for needed immunizations is so important. In late 1985 and early 1986, the Immunization Program reviewed the immunization status for 2,858 children whose records were found in health departments in five (5) districts. Only 32% of those children had completed primary immunizations before age two (2) years. That level increased to 55% statewide by the end of 1989 and to 93.82% by the end of 1999. Although the adequate rates for children receiving immunizations in public health clinics has steadily risen, the number of children receiving their immunizations in public health clinics has decreased. In 1998- 99, approximately 50% of immunizations were given by private providers, and in 2007, they gave more than 80% of the childhood immunizations. Therefore, the adequate rates for two year old children attending public health clinics is not indicative of the status for the majority of Georgia's two year old children. In order to attain and maintain 100% immunization levels for all two year olds in a community, each health unit should address five (5) issues: 1. Due to the increase in the administration of immunizations by private providers, it is important that public health ensure high levels of immunizations are maintained in each community regardless of who is providing immunization delivery services. Every effort should be made to educate and collaborate with other health providers in the community to assist them in their immunization service delivery. 2. Health districts are responsible for conducting an annual population based study to determine the immunization level of all two year old children born in Georgia. The State Immunization and Epidemiology Programs will provide annual training and instruction for conducting the population-based study. 3. All children brought to health department facilities for any reason should be screened for immunization history and served as necessary. Children attending specifically for immunizations should be screened for other health care needs and served as necessary. 4. Districts should utilize Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Software Application (CoCASA) which is provided free of charge by CDC/National Immunization Program to measure the progress of its patients toward completion of primary immunizations and to identify problems. The Georgia Immunization Program will conduct at least one annual CASA audit for each health district and will provide training in the use of this software application. As part of this application, categories for documenting that a child has moved or gone elsewhere for services (MOGE) were developed by the Immunization Coordinator's Advisory Committee. To provide consistency in measurement procedures, districts should utilize the categories for MOGE documentation. (See next page) 5. Each health department unit must devise and implement a system(s), which encourages compliance with the recommended schedules and allows for active recall of delinquent patients. RECALL OF IMMUNIZAT ION PATIENTS POLICY STATEMENT Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 8. Informed Request Policy - 7/2015 Immunization Documentation, \"Moved or Gone Elsewhere\" (MOGE) Categories 1 Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) Criteria Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) Criteria An annual assessment is conducted to determine the immunization coverage levels of children 19-35 months of age in public health departments. This assessment is also conducted in private provider sites bi-annually. The Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Software Application (CoCASA) is used to assist in conducting this assessment. Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) is a process that is used in CoCASA to filter out patients that are no longer associated with the facility being assessed. By removing these patients, immunization practices may be assessed more accurately. Clients should not be placed into a MOGE category only to improve immunization coverage rates. It is important that every effort is made to accurately identify the status of inactive children. Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) status is assigned when one of the following has occurred: a Patient has moved out of the immediate area a Patient has gone to another practice a Patient has moved with no forwarding address a Patient has died a Patient has a medical exemption issued by a physician a Patient has a signed and notarized religious exemption With the exception of patients that have died, or who have a medical or religious exemption, all patients assigned the status of MOGE must have documentation to show that at least 3 attempts were made to contact the patient. Once the status of the patient is identified, no further attempts are required. Acceptable documentation includes: 1. The family, a neighbor, the WIC Program, Post Office, DFACS, etc. has notified the clinic, either in writing or by phone, that the client has moved out of the area. 2. School, day care, Headstart, employer, etc., state that the family has moved out of the area. 3. Client reports that immunizations are being received from a private physician or other health care provider. Patient is identified in GRITS and is receiving immunizations from another provider. 4. The provider receives a request for client's records to be transferred out of state. 5. The provider receives a returned post card or letter, which has been stamped or documented as \"Moved, left no forwarding address.\" 6. A home visit was made and there is confirmation that the client no longer resides at that location. Confirmation means that someone else is now residing at that address, or the manager of the development confirms they have moved. A person refusing to answer the door on a visit does not confirm the client no longer lives at that address. 7. Historical data is recorded for WIC certification and the patient is receiving immunizations from another provider.

Vital records birth certificate data was uploaded to the VEIS (Vital Events Information System) and the child has not received immunization services within 6 months of birth. Prior to MOGEing the child, please look the child up in GRITS. If the child's medical home is identified in GRITS, no further documentation is needed to MOGE. If the child's medical home can't be identified in GRITS, please make two additional attempts to contact.

Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 08/2015 Distribution Of Vaccines 1 1. The State Immunization Office will utilize compr ehensive reports, submitted by individual clinics each month to evaluate current vaccine inventory an d historical usage. Shipments of vaccines, sufficient to bring vaccine inventories to the leve l of a three-month supply, will be made if vaccine is available. 2. Comprehensive reports are to be submitted monthly v ia GRITS. 3. All vaccine shipments will be sent directly to C linic/County offices. 4. Short dated vaccines MUST be reported a minimum of 90 days before the date of expiration to the State Immunization Office, via phone (404) 657- 5013 or e-mail: DPH-gavfc@dph.ga.gov . The GRITS pre-populated report form will not genera te this information for you. 5. State supplied vaccines lost due to expiration o r spoilage must be returned to McKesson. Vaccines wasted and/or expired will appear in the w astage section of the monthly comprehensive report and returns will be processed once your repo rt has been reviewed for approving your vaccine order. Wastage that occurs as part of an i ncident require a Vaccine Incident Report that can be obtained by contacting the Vaccine Logistics Associate, Christy Banks at 404-657-5013. 6. When vaccine shortages occur nationally, it may be necessary to move vaccine within the district. It also may be necessary to move vaccine from one d istrict to another. It is the responsibility of the Immunization Program to evaluate total state ne eds and authorize movement of vaccine when necessary. Requests for vaccine transfers must be reported to the state office via email at: DPH-gavfc@dph.ga.gov. Each facility that stores vaccine must have certifi ed thermometers in both the refrigerator section an d in the freezer section of the unit used for vaccine st orage. In addition to the primary thermometers, a secondary backup thermometer should be kept on hand as well. The backup will replace the main thermometer when it is out for re-calibration or se rvice. Temperature readings must be taken and recorded twi ce daily; once in the morning and once in the evening (see sample temperature log). This requirem ent also applies to sites currently utilizing conti nuous recording thermometer devices such as the digital d ata logger. If temperatures fall outside the accep table range, the cause must be determined and corrected immediately. Failure to have thermometers and to record temperatures will jeopardize your status to receive vaccine and may result in counties/district s having to purchase replacement vaccine. Each facility that stores vaccine must have adequat e storage to assure vaccine integrity. Dormitory ty pe refrigerators are not acceptable. Routinely placin g vaccine in portable coolers during the clinic day is also unacceptable. Refrigerators must have externally s eparate sealed doors for the refrigerator and freez er compartments. VFC strongly recommends that frozen vaccines be stored in a pharmaceutical grade, commercial grade, or stand-alone unit. GA VFC will require providers currently using combination units to store frozen vaccines to adhere to this guideline a s of January 1, 2016 . More information on recommended frozen vaccine storage can be found in the CDC's Storage and Handling Toolkit by clicking on the following link http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/r ecs/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf An emergency plan must be developed by each facilit y for handling vaccine storage in the event of a power outage. This plan must be reviewed and updat ed annually, at minimum, to determine if all partie s listed in the plan are aware of their responsibilit ies (see \"Routine and Emergency Vaccine Handling Pl ans\" form). DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES Georgia Immunization Program Centralized Distribution Information and Instructio ns for Public Health Providers Revised 09/03/2015 Troubleshooting Problems/Issues Instructions You have a change in your vaccine delivery address, days, and/or hours available for vaccine deliveries . Your office/clinic will be closed for an extended p eriod of time. Hours should be updated in GRITS prior to placing y our vaccine order each month. If your office moves, notify VFC prior to placing you vaccine order. Contact Information: Public Health Assigned VFC Customer Service Representative: Cheryl Paschal (404) 657-5013 DPH-gavfc@dph.ga.gov Be sure to include your VFC PIN# in the subject lin e You receive a partial vaccine shipment. (i.e.; miss ing doses, vaccine, or diluent - MMR/Varicella) You receive more vaccines than were ordered. You received vaccines that you did not order. Contact Cheryl Paschal within 24 hours of receiving the shipment. (Contact information above) Thermometer temperature is out of range, or you sus pect the vaccine shipment was compromised in any way. Follow the instructions for the interpretation of t he temperature monitors. The instructions will be att ached to the temperature monitors located in each vaccine shipment box. If there are any questions about how to interpret the temperature monitor readings or you suspect the shipment is compromised in any way: 1. Label the vaccines \"Do Not Use\" and continue to store them at recommended temperatures until a fina l determination is made. 2. Immediately contact the VFC Vaccine Logistics Associate, Christy Banks, for further instructions by calling 404-651-7305 or 404-657-5013. Please call within 2 hours of vaccine receipt. Your vaccine shipment is not available on the manag e transfer screen. Allow a few hours for the information to populate. If the doses are needed for administration right away then, 1. Manually add the doses to your inventory 2. When the doses finally appear on the manage transfers screen, accept the transfers, then error subtract the doses. 3. Remember to notify VFC of the use of the error subtract option when the doses appear as negatives on your monthly comprehensive report. You have nonviable vaccines that need to be returned. *viable vaccines cannot be returned to McKesson. 1. Returns are processed from the Monthly Comprehensive Report. Once processed, providers will receive an email copy of the vaccine return invoice directly from Christy Banks and a UPS return label from McKesson. 2. Include a copy of the return invoice in the carton to be returned to McKesson and keep a copy for your records. 3. Fax a copy of the completed McKesson Return of Federal Vaccine Form to VFC at (404) 657-5736 or outside Metro Atlanta at (800) 372-3627. 4. Returns can be sent in the McKesson shipping container or a container of your own. If you use your own container, ensure that vials are secure (s o that they don't break during transport). 5. You must include a copy of the completed McKesson Return of Federal Vaccine Form in the box with the non-viable vaccines that are to be returned to McKesson. UPS will pick up all boxes to return to McKesson, even when packages are shipped to you via FedEx. Once you have the label and affix it to the box, simply give to your UPS driver the next time s/he i s in your office. Scheduling a specific pickup is not necessary. Your UPS driver can pick up the return during their regular visit(s) to your practice. If you call UPS directly to schedule a pick up, you may be charged. Other Important Information /square4 McKesson is no longer accepting returns of vaccine shipping cartons. Providers are encouraged to keep one or two cartons on hand in the event an eme rgency occurs or vaccine needs to be transferred. Please check to see if there is a local recycling p rogram in your area. /square4 It is imperative that you continue to submit monthl y comprehensive reports. Make sure to notify VFC of any changes to hours, address, contact, etc. /square4 You must immediately open all vaccine packages, che ck the temperature monitor devices, inspect the vaccines and store them at the appropriate temperat ures once the package is delivered. Follow up with VFC within 24 hours to report any order discrepancies. /square4 Direct-ship vaccines, such as Varicella and Proquad , will continue to be shipped by the manufacturer, Merck, not McKesson. /square4 Influenza vaccine will arrive in separate shipments . /square4 During periods of vaccine shortage, vaccine may be shipped incrementally throughout the month and may arrive in separate shipments. Vaccine Shipping Timeframes Vaccine deliveries may take from one to two weeks t o arrive at your location. At the time your order is placed, please ensure that your available delivery times ar e up to date and that you have at least 2-3 month's supply of vaccine on hand to decrease the likelihood of runni ng out of vaccine in the event of a prolonged deliv ery time.

Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 08/2015 Handling Of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions Revised 08/19/2015 1Georgia Immunization Program Handling of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions To protect vaccine and to minimize the potential mo netary loss from inclement weather conditions such as tornadoes; hurricanes; and tropi cal, ice, snow, rain, lightening, or wind storms, etc., emergency procedures at the provider level should be implemented immediately. A part of this implementation should include communic ation to all providers who receive publicly purchased vaccines, or at least to those in the geo graphic areas of highest risk. When the state/local officials or a provider has re asonable cause to believe that weather conditions have the potential to disrupt power and/ or flood any office where vaccine is stored, emergency procedures should be implemented IN ADVAN CE OF THE EVENT by completing the \"Routine and Emergency Vaccine Storage and Hand ling Plan\" (A copy of this plan should be submitted to VFC or reviewed by Immunization Progra m Staff during site visits for approval). In advance of the emergency, all providers should e nsure the following: A. All staff have access to the \"Routine and Emerge ncy Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan\" B. Identification of an alternative storage facilit y (hospital, packing plant, state depot, etc.), with back-up power (generator), where the vaccine c an be properly stored and monitored for the duration of the storm (provider needs to en sure that the receiving site is able to store multiple sites, if they have signed agreement s with multiple sites). A written agreement (updated annually) is strongly advised; C. The availability of staff to pack and move the v accine; D. The use of appropriate packing containers, certi fied thermometers, and cold packs; and E. The transport of the vaccine to the secure stora ge facility. It is appropriate for providers to suspend vaccinat ions before weather conditions deteriorate. Sufficient time must be allowed for packing and tra nsporting vaccine BEFORE the storm can adversely affect local conditions. There are other precautions and appropriate measure s one can take to protect vaccine inventories using the emergency procedures describe d below. The following includes some HELPFUL HINTS AND REFERENCE INFORMATION. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES A. List emergency phone numbers, companies, and poi nts of contact for: 1. Electrical power company: 2.

Providers may contact the Georgia Immunization P rogram (GIP) for assistance in identifying hospitals, health departments or other facilities that could serve as emergency vaccine storage facilities and communicate this inf ormation. This might also be done at the district or county level and/or with assistance from the Office of Emergency Preparedness. The GIP will prioritize assistance a nd communication to target providers in areas at highest risk, e.g., low lying coastal o r floodplain areas. C. Entering vaccine storage spaces: Describe, when necessary, how to enter the building and vaccine storage spaces in an emergency if close d or after hours.

Identify what vaccines to pack first in an emerg ency and while the power is still working: 1. Pack the refrigerated vaccines first with an ade quate supply of cold packs and certified thermometer(s). 2. Remove and pack the varicella vaccines, using co ld packs and certified thermometer(s), immediately prior to transport F. Pack and transport all vaccine or if that is not possible, determine the types and amount to save; e.g., save only the most expensive vaccine s to minimize dollar loss or save some portion of all vaccines to ensure a short-term , complete supply for resuming the vaccination schedule. Priority should be given to t hose vaccines which would be the most expensive to replace (pneumococcal conjugate, varic ella, DTaP/HepB/IPV, Hep B/Hib, MMR). G. packing procedures for transport to backup storage facilities: 1. Open refrigerated units only when absolutely nec essary and only after you have made all preparations for packing and moving the va ccine to alternative storage sites. 2. Use properly insulated containers. 3. Do not place vaccines that cannot be frozen dire ctly against cold packs. (Note: MMR can be stored frozen or refrigerated.) 4. Follow vaccine handling guidelines. The followi ng are important tips to remember: --Varicella vaccine is fragile and should be used w ithin 72 hours of placing on wet ice or in a refrigerated environment. --MMR vaccine can be refrigerated or frozen, but sh ould be kept out of direct light. --All other vaccines should be maintained at refrig erator temperature. H. Move vaccine to backup storage according to pre- arranged plans. Pre-arranged plans should take into consideration the following: 1. How to load the transportation vehicle 2. Routes to take 3. Time enroute 4. Temperature monitoring (maintenance of temperatu re log with temperatures checked twice daily) while vaccine is in backup sto rage I. On returning inventory to the clinic/practice/pharm acy, vaccines should be checked carefully and placed in the appropriate refrigerato r or freezer compartments. If the provider is not able to assure viability, GIP shoul d be contacted before using any vaccines that may not be effective for protecting c hildren and/or adults against disease.

Printing this toolkit may not enable provider to have the most current information . Refer to online version for the most current information . Where to go for updated CDC information including webinars and other educational offerings Additional information is available on CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling webpage, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/storage/default.htm . There is a place on this page where you can sign up for notifications about updates to this page . Educational programs related to Vaccine Storage and Handling, e .g ., webinars or netconferences, can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/default.htm . Where to get questions answered If you have questions, contact your state/local immunization program, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/awardee-imz-websites.html You can also send questions to CDC at NIPInfo@cdc.gov Tips for the Using the ToolkitIntroduction9 Introduction Key Messages: This toolkit provides vaccine storage and handling best practices . CDC encourages providers to move toward implementing these recommendations as soon as possible . Refer to the manufacturer's product information/ package inserts for storage and handling guidance for individual vaccines . VFC providers or providers who have other vaccines purchased with public funds should consult their immunization program for specific recommendations and requirements . Vaccine Storage and Handling Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit provides best practices based on recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), vaccine manufacturers' product information, and studies conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) . CDC encourages immunization providers to move toward implementing these best practices and recommendations as soon as possible . If you are a Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider or if you have other vaccines purchased with public funds, you should consult your immunization program for recommendations and requirements specific to your area . Value of Vaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices Failure to store and handle vaccines properly can reduce vaccine potency, resulting in inadequate immune responses in patients and poor protection against disease . Patients lose confidence in vaccines and their providers when revaccination is necessary because the vaccine(s) they received may have been compromised (exposed to inappropriate conditions/temperatures or handled improperly) . Storage and handling errors can also result in significant financial loss if the vaccine(s) cannot be used . Vaccine Storage and Handling Protocols State/local health department immunization programs (herein referred to as \"immunization program[s]\") throughout the United States have been successful in preventing and eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases in part because of proper storage and handling practices . Immunization programs and practices should have written protocols for routine vaccine storage and handling, as well as for emergency procedures . This toolkit provides guidance for developing and updating those protocols . Storage and Handling Plans that include step- by-step protocols should be easily accessible in every facility that provides immunizations . Introduction10 Manufacturer Protocols Refer to the manufacturer's product information and package inserts for specific, detailed storage and handling protocols for individual vaccines . Avoiding Mistakes Adherence to best practices and guidance in this toolkit can assist providers in avoiding storage and handling mistakes that can be very costly . Notes:Vaccine Cold Chain11 Vaccine Cold Chain Key Messages: The vaccine cold chain is a temperature-controlled environment used to maintain and distribute vaccines in optimal condition . Monitor the temperature of your storage unit(s) regularly to assure that appropriate conditions are maintained . Take immediate corrective action when a storage unit temperature is outside the recommended range (Troubleshooting ) . Call the vaccine manufacturer for guidance . If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program . Vaccine appearance is NOT a reliable indicator that vaccines have been stored under appropriate conditions . Vaccine exposed to inappropriate temperatures that is inadvertently administered generally should be repeated . Contact your immunization program , vaccine manufacturer (s), or both for guidance . What is the Vaccine Cold Chain? The vaccine cold chain is a temperature-controlled environment used to maintain and distribute vaccines in optimal condition . The cold chain relies on three main elements: Well-trained personnel Reliable transportation and storage equipment Efficient management procedures The cold chain begins with the cold storage unit at the manufacturing plant, extends through transport of vaccine(s) to the distributor, then delivery and storage at the provider facility, and ends with administration of vaccine to the patient . Appropriate storage conditions must be maintained at every link in the cold chain . Manufacturer ResponsibilityVaccine Manufacturer Manufacturer/Distributor ResponsibilityVaccine Distribution Provider ResponsibilityVaccine Arrival at Provider Facility Vaccine Storage and Handling at Provider Facility Vaccine AdministrationCold Chain Flow ChartVaccine Cold Chain12 Importance of Maintaining the Vaccine Cold Chain Vaccine Potency Excessive heat, cold, or light exposure can damage vaccines, resulting in reduced potency . Once potency is lost, it cannot be restored . Each time vaccines are exposed to improper conditions, potency is reduced further . Eventually, if the cold chain is not properly maintained, potency will be lost, and the vaccines become useless . While exposure to any inappropriate conditions can affect potency of refrigerated vaccines, a single exposure to freezing temperatures will destroy some . Liquid vaccines that contain an aluminum adjuvant* can permanently lose potency when exposed to freezing temperatures . Monitor the temperature of your storage unit(s) regularly . Take immediate corrective action when a storage unit temperature reading is outside the recommended range (temperature excursion) . Call your immunization program and/ or the vaccine manufacturer for guidance (Troubleshooting ) . If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program .Vaccine Appearance after Exposure to Inappropriate Storage Conditions Some vaccines may show physical evidence that potency has been reduced when exposed to inappropriate storage conditions . This may appear as clumping in the solution that does not go away when the vial is shaken . Other vaccines may look normal when exposed to inappropriate storage conditions (see photos below) . For example, inactivated vaccines exposed to freezing temperatures (i .e ., 32\u00b0F [0\u00b0C] or colder) may not appear frozen and give no indication of reduced or lost potency . Vaccine appearance is NOT a reliable indicator that vaccines have been stored under appropriate conditions . Can you spot the difference? Properly stored vaccine Full PotencyImproperly stored vaccine Diminished Potency Vaccine appearance is NOT a reliable indicator that vaccines have been stored under appropriate conditions. contain an aluminum adjuvant, which boosts the immune response to the vaccine.Vaccine Cold Chain13 Store in Freezer Between or refrigerated.Vaccine Cold Chain14 Consequences of Vaccine Cold Chain Failure Reduced vaccine potency due to inappropriate storage conditions can be costly .1,2,3 Patients who receive vaccine with reduced potency caused by inappropriate storage conditions may not be fully protected against vaccine-preventable diseases . In General Recommendations on Immunization, ACIP recommends \"vaccine exposed to inappropriate temperatures that is inadvertently administered generally should be repeated .\"4 Contact your immunization program , vaccine manufacturer (s), or both for guidance about recalling patients for revaccination . Vaccine recalls due to inappropriate storage can mean extra doses for patients, increased costs for providers, and damage to public confidence in vaccines . They also can be a liability for a provider's practice . Patients who refuse revaccination can remain unprotected from serious, vaccine-preventable diseases . Vaccine inventories are very expensive . The costs associated with loss and replacement vaccines, and resources necessary to conduct a recall of patients, can be significant .5 References 1 .

If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for guidance regarding routine and emergency plans . Keep plans near storage unit(s) and make sure staff members know where to find them and are familiar with their contents . Ensure that custodial and security staff are aware of the emergency plan and know how to notify appropriate staff if there is a problem . If power is lost short-term (usually 2 hours or less), depending on room temperature, and if there are water bottles in the refrigerator and frozen coolant packs in the freezer, storage temperatures can probably be maintained if doors are kept closed . Do NOT allow vaccines to remain in a nonfunctioning unit for an extended period of time . Activate the emergency plan . Check vaccine temperatures upon arrival at the alternate storage facility and ensure immediate storage at manufacturer-recommended temperatures . Consult your agency or immunization program for any special emergency instructions . General Recommendations Develop and stick to a detailed written Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan that is updated annually . In this plan, include all aspects of routine vaccine management, from ordering and managing inventory to monitoring storage conditions . A well-written plan will help providers stay organized, serve as a reference and training tool, and provide quality assurance of proper vaccine management ( Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan Worksheet ) . In addition, develop a detailed written Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan in the event of refrigerator and/or freezer malfunctions, power failures, natural disasters, or other emergencies that might compromise appropriate storage conditions . Review and update the emergency plan annually ( Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan Worksheet ) . Include signature, name, and title of the person(s) who prepared the plans . Ensure that all staff members who administer or handle vaccines in any way are familiar with these plans . Keep plans near storage unit(s) and make sure staff members know where to find them .Storage and Handling Plans17 Many components of routine and emergency plans will be the same for every facility, but some details may vary depending on local policies . If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for guidance regarding routine and emergency plans . Each facility should have routine and emergency plans. Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan The information below is provided as a guideline for developing your routine plan . You may also use the Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan Worksheet . Each routine plan should include: Up-to-date contact information for the following: -Persons who are responsible for routine vaccine storage and handling, e .g ., primary and alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinators ( Staff ) -Immunization Program -Vaccine freezer maintenance and repair company(ies) -Utility/power company -Vaccine storage unit alarm company (if applicable) -Sources of qualified containers, packing materials, and calibrated temperature monitoring devices Descriptions of roles and responsibilities of primary and alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinators ( Staff ) . Policy on education and training for facility staff . Protocols for: -Ordering and accepting vaccine deliveries ( Vaccine Stock Calculations and Ordering and Receiving and Unpacking Deliveries ) -Storage unit temperature monitoring -Storage equipment maintenance -Correct placement of vaccines within storage units ( Vaccine and Diluent Placement within Storage Unit ) -Responding to storage and handling problems ( Troubleshooting ) -Inventory management (contact your immunization program for details and see Vaccine Inventory Management for general guidelines) -Receiving and unpacking deliveries (contact your immunization program for details and see Vaccine Deliveries ) -Transporting vaccines in an emergency or to off-site/satellite facilities (contact your immunization program for details and see Vaccine Transport for general guidelines) -Handling vaccines prior to administration ( Vaccine Preparation ) -Proper disposal of vaccines and supplies (contact your immunization program Storage and Handling Plans18 for details and see Vaccine Disposal for general guidelines) Storage requirements for each vaccine and diluent in your inventory ( package inserts ) . Samples of forms used in your facility (e .g ., ordering forms, temperature logs, stock records, etc .) . Additional resources are available in Resources and from the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC): Clinic Resources - Storage and Handling . Also establish a checklist of procedures and post it on all vaccine storage unit(s) (IAC's Checklist for Safe Vaccine Storage and Handling ) . Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan Advance Preparations Various situations may compromise vaccine storage conditions, such as equipment failures, power outages, or natural disasters . Ensure that the emergency plan includes up-to-date information regarding procedures to follow to protect and/or retrieve vaccines as quickly as possible when a potentially compromising situation occurs . In addition to facility staff, ensure that custodial and security staff are aware of the emergency plan and know procedures to follow to notify designated staff about any problems with vaccine storage equipment or power outages . What's in an Emergency Plan? The information below is provided as a guideline for developing an emergency plan . You may also use the Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan Worksheet and IAC's Emergency Response Worksheet to help organize your response . Consult your agency or immunization program for any special instructions or forms . Each emergency plan should include: -Role of vaccine coordinator and alternate (back-up) -Emergency contact list -Storage unit specifications -Alternate storage facilities -Written instructions for after hours -Adequate supplies for packing and transport -Protocol for packing -Protocol for transport Designated primary and alternate (back- up) vaccine coordinators with emergency contact information . In addition to routine vaccine storage and handling duties ( Staff ), primary and alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinators should: -Monitor operation of storage equipment and systems -Track inclement weather conditions -Set up and maintain monitoring/ Staff members should be familiar with the Routine and Emergency Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan. Storage and Handling Plans19 notification system during times of inclement weather or other conditions that might cause a power outage (a continuous-monitoring temperature alarm/notification system should be considered, especially for facilities with large inventories) -Post emergency contact information on circuit breaker(s) or electrical panel -Ensure appropriate handling of vaccine during a disaster or power outage -Ensure 24-hour access to building and vaccine storage unit(s) -Ensure that sufficient fuel is on hand to continuously run generator for at least 72 hours if facility has a back-up generator Emergency staff contact list in order of contact preference . Determine whether all or certain persons on the list should be contacted in the event of a vaccine storage emergency or if the first person reached is sufficient . Include primary and alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinators on the list . Record names (in order) and contact information . Assure that contact information is updated at least quarterly . Vaccine storage unit specifications . For each vaccine storage unit in your facility, identify type of unit (e .g ., stand-alone refrigerator), brand name, model number, and serial number . These specifications may be useful for the repair company . Alternate vaccine storage facility or facilities . Establish working agreements with at least one alternate storage facility with a back-up generator where vaccines can be appropriately stored and monitored for the interim (e .g ., hospital, long-term care facility, state depot, Red Cross, fire station, packing plant, commercial pharmacy) . Make advance arrangements with facility(ies) to store your vaccines when weather predictions call for inclement conditions (e .g ., tornadoes, hurricanes, ice, severe snowstorms), when your storage equipment cannot be repaired, or when power cannot be restored before the storage unit temperature rises above the recommended range . Record name of alternate facility(ies), name of contact Establish at least one alternate storage facility where vaccine can be appropriately stored and monitored. This facility should have a back-up generator.Storage and Handling Plans20 person(s), and telephone number(s) . Include instructions for 24-hour access . Written instructions for entering your facility and vaccine storage spaces in an emergency if building is closed . In these instructions, include the building security/after-hours access procedure, floor diagram, and locations of the following: -Alarms (including instructions for -Keys -Locks -Circuit breakers -Packing materials Adequate supply of qualified containers and packing materials for facility's largest annual inventory . Appropriate materials may include portable actively or passively cooled refrigerator/freezer units, hard-sided insulated containers, \"conditioned\" coolant packs that are cold or frozen (depending on type of vaccine), and a calibrated temperature monitoring device for each container ( Vaccine Transport ) . In situations where an alternate vaccine storage facility with a back-up generator cannot be identified within a reasonable distance, qualified containers and packing materials can be used to store vaccines temporarily and safely at your facility . This temporary storage should only be for as long as the container and pack out are qualified to maintain storage temperatures and the container remains closed . A temperature monitoring device should always be placed with the vaccines . Record names and contact information for sources of materials . Written protocol for vaccine packing . Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for packing vaccines . Make instructions readily available for staff . Key steps that should be reflected in all SOPs are: -Open refrigerator and freezer doors only when absolutely necessary and only after you have made all preparations for packing and moving vaccines to an alternate storage facility . -Use qualified containers and packing materials and procedures for refrigerated and frozen vaccines ( Vaccine Transport for general guidelines) . Written protocols, vehicles, and drivers for transporting vaccines to and from alternate vaccine storage facility . -Vaccines may be transported within non-commercial vehicles inside the passenger compartment (not in trunk because temperatures cannot be controlled inside trunk) . Make advance arrangements for primary and back- up vehicles and drivers and record the contact information . -If location is far away or if you have a large quantity of vaccines, consider renting a refrigerated truck . In this case, joining with other facilities to reduce costs may be advantageous . Make advance arrangements with a local refrigeration company and an alternate and record contact information . -Check with your immunization program for guidance and resources on emergency transport of vaccines . -Develop written protocols for transporting vaccines to and from alternate storage facility: Establish how to load vehicle .Storage and Handling Plans21 Have pre-selected routes to take (and alternate routes if necessary) . Determine estimated time en route . Improper packing of vaccines for transport is as risky as storage unit failure . Vaccine manufacturers do not support reuse of their containers and packing materials for vaccine transport . Improper repackaging using these materials and improper transportation could negatively impact vaccines . Emergency Procedures Equipment failure No piece of vaccine storage equipment is infallible, and there is always potential for vaccine storage equipment failure . At some point, equipment failure will occur related to a power failure, breakdown, or normal wear and tear . Part of a provider's responsibility for proper vaccine storage is preparing for equipment failure by having back-up equipment and back-up plans available . Impending emergency When state officials, local officials, or providers have reasonable cause to believe that weather conditions, natural disasters, or other emergencies might disrupt power in or flood any facility where vaccines are stored, implement emergency procedures in advance of event . Power outages If power is lost short-term (usually 2 hours or less) and depending on room temperature, storage temperatures can probably be maintained with water bottles in the refrigerator, frozen coolant packs in the freezer, and by taking the following steps: Do not open storage unit door until power is restored . Continue to monitor temperature inside each storage unit . -Some temperature monitoring devices allow temperature monitoring without opening storage unit door . In this case, record room temperature and temperature(s) inside unit(s) at time problem is discovered, as well as minimum and maximum temperature(s) reached inside unit(s) during power outage . -If this type of temperature monitoring device is not being used, do not open a storage unit door to check temperature during power outage . Document room temperature and temperature inside each storage unit as soon as possible after power has been restored . If you have a digital data logger, document length of time power has been off and minimum and maximum temperatures observed within storage unit(s) . When power is restored, if temperature inside refrigerator is not between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) or if temperature inside freezer is not between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C), document duration of inappropriate temperature exposure and follow procedures for Handling Inappropriate Vaccine Storage Conditions (Light and Temperature) . Do NOT allow vaccines to remain in a nonfunctioning unit for an extended period of time . If at any time you are unsure how long the power interruption will last, or you determine that power will not be restored in time to maintain internal temperatures within recommended ranges, activate your emergency Storage and Handling Plans22 plan . Suspend vaccination activities before onset of emergency conditions, if possible . This will allow sufficient time for packing and transporting vaccines . Notify staff at alternate vaccine storage facility . Before moving your vaccines, contact alternate storage facility to make them aware of the situation and to ensure that their back-up generator is working . Conduct an inventory of vaccines and record actions taken . Use the Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan Worksheet . Also note if frozen coolant packs were in freezer and water bottles were in refrigerator at time of event . Pack the affected vaccines ( Vaccine Transport ) . Follow established vaccine transport procedures ( Written Protocols, Vehicles, and Drivers for Transporting Vaccines to and from Alternate Vaccine Storage Facility ) . Check vaccine temperature upon arrival at alternate storage facility and ensure immediate storage at manufacturer- recommended temperatures . If you have no warning and an emergency event is already occurring or has already occurred, you should still follow these procedures if they can be done safely . Consult your agency or immunization program for special instructions . The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) offers general guidance concerning storage and use of temperature-sensitive biological products that have been involved in a temporary electrical power failure or flood conditions (Impact of Severe Weather Conditions on Biological Products ) .Storage and Handling Plans23 Notes:Staff24 Staff Key Messages: Designate one staff member to be the primary coordinator . Designate at least one alternate (back-up) coordinator . Primary and alternate (back-up) coordinators should be fully trained in routine and emergency policies and procedures . It is also important that a physician partner or member of management is directly involved with responsible clinical staff\u2014someone with a clear understanding of vaccine replacement costs and clinical implications of mismanaged storage units and vaccines . All staff who receive deliveries and handle or administer vaccines should be familiar with storage and handling policies and procedures . Storage and handling training should: -Be part of new employee orientation -Be annual training for all staff involved in these activities -Occur whenever recommendations are updated and when new vaccines are added Click here for CDC's online training module, You Call the Shots: Vaccine Storage and Handling . Primary Vaccine Coordinator and Alternate (Back-up) Vaccine Coordinator Designate one staff member to be the primary coordinator . This person will be responsible for ensuring that all vaccines are stored and handled correctly . Coordinator responsibilities include but are not limited to: Ordering vaccines Overseeing proper receipt and storage of deliveries Organizing vaccines within storage unit(s) Reading and recording storage unit temperatures a minimum of 2 times each workday Reading and recording minimum/maximum temperatures once per workday, preferably 1 time each morning Downloading and reviewing temperature data at least 1 time each week Making sure the door is firmly closed when not in use Rotating stock at least 1 time each week so that vaccine closest to the expiration date will be used first Removing expired vaccine from storage unit(s) so that it is not used Responding to possible temperature excursions ( Handling Inappropriate Vaccine Storage Conditions [Light and Temperature ]) Overseeing proper Vaccine Transport Maintaining all documentation, including temperature excursion responses and VFC program records Ensuring adequately trained staffStaff25 Also designate at least one alternate (back-up) coordinator who will assume these responsibilities in the absence of the primary coordinator . Coordinators should be fully trained in routine and emergency policies and procedures . It is also important that a physician partner or member of management is directly involved with responsible clinical staff\u2014 someone with a clear understanding of vaccine replacement costs and clinical implications of mismanaged storage units and vaccines . Designate a Primary Vaccine Coordinator and at least one Alternate (back-up) Vaccine Coordinator.Training If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding required training and resources . All staff who receive deliveries and handle or administer vaccines should be familiar with storage and handling policies and procedures at their facility . This includes anyone who accepts vaccine deliveries or who may have access to unit(s) where vaccines are stored . Include storage and handling training as part of new employee orientation and provide annual training for all staff involved in storage and handling activities . To maintain staff competency, provide training whenever recommendations are updated and when new vaccines are added to inventory . Record dates of trainings and names of participants . Skill checks are also recommended to validate competence (IAC's Checklist for Safe Vaccine Storage and Handling ) . Click here for CDC's online training module, You Call the Shots: Vaccine Storage and Handling . This toolkit can also serve as a reference guide in conjunction with other resources on the CDC Storage and Handling web page . Many immunization programs and professional organizations also offer vaccine storage and handling training programs . Staff26 Notes:Vaccine Storage Equipment27 Vaccine Storage Equipment Key Messages: Keep a logbook for each piece of storage equipment . CDC recommends stand-alone units or pharmacy grade/purpose-built units . CDC does not recommend and VFC does not allow storage of any vaccine in a dormitory- style (or bar-style) refrigerator under any circumstances . When setting up a storage unit, allow at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between unit and wall . Nothing should block the cover of unit motor compartment . Make sure that unit stands firm and level and is 1 to 2 inches (2 .5 to 5 cm) above the floor . Set refrigerator temperature mid-range to achieve an average of about 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) . The freezer should maintain temperatures between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) . Only primary or alternate (back-up) coordinator should adjust temperature of a vaccine storage unit . Before using a new storage unit, allow for 1 week of temperature readings a minimum of 2 times each workday, including minimum/maximum temperatures 1 time each morning . Water bottles can help maintain stable temperatures and serve as a physical barrier to placing vaccines in an area where there is greater risk for temperature excursions (for example, top shelf, floor, and in door racks of refrigerator) . Frozen coolant packs can help maintain stable temperatures and serve as a physical barrier when placed along walls, back, and bottom of freezer, and inside racks of freezer door . Routinely check unit door throughout the day and at end of workday to ensure it is tightly closed . An open door alarm and self-closing door may prevent a problem . Check door seals for sign of wear and tear . Back-up generators should: -Be tested quarterly -Receive maintenance at least annually -Have sufficient capacity to run continuously for 72 hours -Have adequate fuel supply on handVaccine Storage Equipment28 Disclaimer: This chapter provides guidance on vaccine storage equipment, equipment maintenance, and methods and devices used to protect vaccines against equipment failure. Use of trade names and commercial sources in this toolkit is for identification only, and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Photographs from non-federal organizations are provided solely as a service to our users. These photographs do not constitute an endorsement of these organizations by CDC or the federal government and none should be inferred. If you provide VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding requirements for vaccine storage equipment. General Recommendations Think of your storage equipment as an insurance policy to protect patients' health and your facility against costly vaccine replacement, inadvertent administration of compromised vaccine, and other consequences (e .g ., costs of revaccination and loss of patient confidence in your practice) . Equipment Logbook Keep a logbook for each piece of storage equipment that includes the following: Serial number(s) Manuals, instructions, or links to equipment websites Dates of installation Dates of routine maintenance Dates of repairs or servicing Name of company(ies) and contact information Vaccine Storage Equipment Recommendations While CDC does not recommend specific brands of storage units, CDC does provide guidance on types of storage units that offer greater assurance of proper temperatures based on equipment testing by NIST . Refrigerators and freezers are available in different grades (household, commercial, and pharmaceutical) and types (stand-alone, combination) . Stand-alone Units CDC recommends stand-alone units that either refrigerate or freeze or pharmaceutical/purpose-built units . These units can vary in size, from compact, under-the- counter style to large, stand-alone units . (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C)Vaccine Storage Equipment29 A NIST study, conducted in 2009, demonstrated that stand-alone or pharmaceutical units maintain required temperatures better than household/commercial combination units, particularly the freezer section of household, combination units .1 Minimum characteristics of refrigerators and freezers used for vaccine storage include: Enough room to store the year's largest inventory a provider might have at busiest point in the year without crowding (e .g ., flu season) Enough room to store water bottles in refrigerator and frozen coolant packs in freezer to stabilize temperatures ( Stabilizing Temperatures with Water Bottles and Frozen Coolant Packs ) Reliably maintains appropriate vaccine storage temperatures year-round It is normal for ice and frost to accumulate inside the freezer (and even in some types of refrigerators) . A thin layer of frost does not affect cooling performance, but a thick layer will affect a unit's ability to efficiently maintain temperatures and will eventually cause failure . If your stand-alone freezer is manual defrost, defrost it regularly to maintain temperature stability . You will need another storage unit that maintains appropriate freezer temperatures for temporary vaccine storage while defrosting . The following is a suggested defrosting procedure: 1 . Check inside walls of freezer weekly a . When frost has accumulated to a thickness of approximately 1 cm, unit should be defrosted b . The more the unit is opened/closed, the quicker frost will accumulate c . Follow manufacturer's recommendations for defrosting 2 . Remove all vaccines 3 . Place vaccines in alternate unit that maintains appropriate temperatures 4 . Turn off power and unplug unit being defrosted 5 . Remove frozen coolant packs and keep frozen 6 . Keep freezer door open and allow ice to melt 7 . Remove loose ice by hand, do NOT use a sharp tool 8 . Place container of warm (NOT boiling) water in freezer to speed melting 9 . Clean and dry unit when all ice is melted 10 . Clean refrigerator compartment, if combination unit 11 . Connect to power and set thermostat to correct setting 12 . Monitor temperature with calibrated thermometer every hour for several hours until stable and within appropriate range . May take days for some units 13 . Restock with vaccines once temperature is stable 14 . Continue to monitor temperature closely If defrosting is necessary every month or more frequently, check door seals or call a technician for necessary maintenance . A frost-free unit with an automatic defrost cycle may be preferred if regular manual defrosting cannot be assured .Vaccine Storage Equipment30 Combination Units Typical household single-condenser combination refrigerator/freezer units are less capable of simultaneously maintaining proper storage temperatures in refrigerator and freezer compartments . Most of these types of units have cold spots and temperature fluctuations in the refrigerator portion of the unit . Risk of freeze- damage to refrigerated vaccines is increased because air from the freezer is circulated for cooling into the refrigerator . Freezer compartments in these units have demonstrated that they are not capable of maintaining correct temperatures for frozen vaccines . Purchasing new vaccine storage equipment may require planning . If existing equipment is a household, combination refrigerator/freezer, CDC recommends using only the refrigerator compartment for refrigerated vaccines . Keep the freezer compartment on to maintain proper temperatures in the refrigerator . However, water bottles should be added to the refrigerator to reduce risk of freezing vaccines ( Stabilizing Temperatures with Water Bottles and Frozen Coolant Packs ) . Use a stand-alone freezer for frozen vaccines . Because freezing refrigerated vaccines can affect vaccine potency, it is especially important that refrigerators be selected and set up in a way that eliminates this risk ( Refrigerators ) . Dormitory-style Units CDC does not recommend storage of any vaccine in a dormitory-style (or bar-style), combined refrigerator/freezer unit under any circumstances . A dormitory-style refrigerator is defined as a combination refrigerator/freezer unit that is outfitted with one exterior door and an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside Refrigerated Vaccines ONLY Combination refrigerator/freezer FREEZER Water bottles in refrigerator to absorb cold air blown in from freezer to reduce risk of vaccines becoming too coldVaccine Storage Equipment31 an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator . In performance testing, this type of unit demonstrated consistently unacceptable performance, regardless of where vaccines were placed . It also exhibited the inability to maintain temperatures and there were wide variations throughout the unit . There is no \"good\" vaccine storage area in this style unit .1 These units pose a significant risk of freezing vaccine even when used for temporary storage . Use of dormitory-style units for storage of VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds is prohibited . Note, size is not always an indicator of this type unit . There are compact, purpose-built storage units for biologics that are not considered to be dormitory-style or bar-style and can be used for vaccine storage . Dormitory-style (or bar-style) combined refrigerator/freezer units should NOT be used for any storage of any vaccine. Storage Unit Placement Good air circulation around the storage unit is essential . Place the unit(s) in a well-ventilated room with space around the sides and top . Allow at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between unit and wall . Nothing should block the cover of the motor compartment, which is normally located at the back or side of the unit . Make sure the unit stands firm and level and wheels or leveling legs are adjusted so the bottom of the unit is 1 to 2 inches (2 .5 to 5 cm) above the floor . Refer to the manufacturer-supplied owner's manual for additional guidance on placement . Required Temperature Ranges for Storage Units Refrigerators The refrigerator should maintain temperatures between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) . Set the temperature mid-range to achieve an average of 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) . This temperature setting will provide the best safety margin . Freezers The freezer should maintain temperatures between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) . Setting and Stabilizing Temperatures in Storage Units Thermostats Consult the owner's manual for instructions on how to operate the thermostat . Refrigerator and freezer thermostats are marked in various ways, depending on brand, to indicate the temperature setting . For example, some have a series of numbers or letters on the control knob . Others have \"MIN,\" \"MED,\" and \"MAX\" marked on the knob or a dial ranging from \"cold\" to \"coldest .\" In general, thermostats do not show temperatures, but rather levels of coldness . The only way to know what the temperature is where vaccines are stored is to measure and monitor it with a calibrated thermometer . Adjusting Storage Unit Temperatures Only primary or alternate (back-up) coordinators should adjust the temperature of a vaccine Vaccine Storage Equipment32 storage unit . Post a warning sign on storage unit(s) that says, \"Do NOT adjust refrigerator (or freezer) temperature controls . Notify (insert name) if adjustments are necessary .\" In some situations, the thermostat may need to be reset in summer and winter, depending on room temperature . Use caution in adjusting a thermostat . It should not be done during a busy clinic day when there is frequent door opening and closing . First, be sure unit is plugged into power source . Then check temperature inside storage unit . Next, check thermometer data from continuous data loggers (if applicable) to verify that temperature control reset is appropriate . To adjust the control and avoid exceeding the required temperature range: Turn thermostat knob slowly, making small adjustments toward a warmer or colder setting as necessary . Allow temperature inside unit to stabilize for 30 minutes . Then recheck temperature . Adjust thermostat again as necessary . Aim to stabilize refrigerator temperature around 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) . Aim to stabilize freezer +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) . Recheck temperature every 30 minutes until stable . -Consider placing additional water bottles to increase temperature stability Refrigerator unit thermostat Freezer unit thermostat Only primary or alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinators should adjust the temperature of a vaccine storage unit. Only the primary or alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinator should adjust the temperature of a vaccine storage unit.Vaccine Storage Equipment33 If you are using the refrigerator compartment of a household, combination unit, use care when adjusting the freezer temperature because this will affect the temperature of air venting into the refrigerator compartment . Without careful and frequent temperature monitoring inside the refrigerator compartment, there is risk of freezing refrigerated vaccines . It may take 2 to 7 days to stabilize the temperature between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) in a newly installed or repaired refrigerator . Likewise, it may take 2 to 3 days to stabilize the temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) in a newly installed or repaired freezer . Allow a week of refrigerator and freezer temperature readings/recordings a minimum of 2 times each workday, including minimum/ maximum temperatures 1 time each morning (Storage Unit Temperature Monitoring ) to make sure temperatures are within appropriate ranges before using units to store vaccines . NEVER store vaccine in a unit that cannot maintain the required temperature range . Identify an alternate unit that is able to maintain the appropriate temperature range and has sufficient storage space until the primary unit is ready .Stabilizing Temperatures with Water Bottles and Frozen Coolant Packs Water bottles and frozen coolant packs will help maintain stable temperatures with frequent opening and closing of unit doors, in the event of a power failure, and serve as a physical barrier to placing vaccines in an area where there is greater risk for temperature excursions . Place water bottles on top shelf, floor, and in door racks of refrigerator . The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission) does not recommend storage of food or beverages in a medication storage unit, so label water bottles \"Do NOT Drink .\" Place frozen coolant packs along walls, back, and bottom of freezer, and inside door racks . Place items in unit doors carefully so they cannot dislodge, and prevent doors from closing or weighing them down so much that seals are not tight . Stabilize temperature in a refrigerator with water bottles labeled \"Do NOT Drink. \" Stabilize temperature in a freezer with frozen coolant packs. Vaccine Storage Equipment34 Doors Avoid letting the door stand open unnecessarily . Not only does this affect temperature in the unit, it also exposes vaccines to light, which can reduce potency of some vaccines (see package inserts ) . Leaving the door open can cause the temperature control to respond to warmer air temperatures from the room . The unit will then continue to work harder to maintain the correct temperature inside the unit . The unit will continue to adjust output of cool air and increase the possibility that temperatures will become very cold in some part of the unit . Routinely check refrigerator and freezer doors throughout the day and at the end of each workday to ensure they are tightly closed . Use of an open door alarm and self-closing doors may be helpful in preventing a problem . Also ensure door seals are tight each time the door is closed and at the end of the workday . Check regularly for signs of wear and tear . Seals should not be torn or brittle and there should be no gaps between seals and body of the unit when the door is closed . The door should open and close properly and fit squarely against body of the unit . For this to happen, hinges must be correctly adjusted . If there are any problems with a door seal, see Assessing Storage Unit Door Seals . Call a repair technician if seals need to be replaced . Deli, fruit, and vegetable drawers Remove any deli, fruit, and vegetable drawers from the refrigerator . Removing drawers not only provides extra space for storing containers of water, but it also removes the temptation to use drawers for storage of food, beverages, or vaccines . Some pharmaceutical grade units have built-in drawers . Testing demonstrated that these units maintain good temperatures for vaccine storage . However, maintaining appropriate vaccine temperature relies on good air circulation . Storage Unit Maintenance Regular maintenance is required to ensure proper operation, to maintain required temperatures, and to extend useful life of the equipment . Check manufacturer specifications for cleaning instructions and recommended maintenance schedules . Document routine maintenance tasks and repairs ( Equipment Logbook ) . Place frozen coolant packs along walls, back, and bottom of freezer, and inside door racks.Place water bottles on the top shelf, floor, and in door racks of refrigerator.Vaccine Storage Equipment35 Routine Maintenance Tasks Clean coils and motor. Keep storage unit coils and motor free of dust and dirt build-up . Dust and dirt build-up affect transfer of heat from coils and, therefore, efficiency of the unit . For safety reasons, you may need to unplug your unit to do this, so check manufacturer instructions . Clean inside refrigerator and freezer units. This discourages bacterial and fungal growth . Cleaning should be done quickly to minimize risk of the temperature going out of range . Clean drain pan. Clean the drain pan periodically . Frost-free freezers have a drain pan at the bottom of the unit . It holds water that collects after frost melts during the defrost cycle . You do not need to empty the pan regularly as the water should evaporate . However, over time, it may begin to smell and become moldy so check and clean as needed . Back-up Generators Facilities storing large vaccine inventories should consider installing back-up generators that automatically provide power to storage units in the event of power outages . Back-up generators should be tested quarterly and should receive maintenance at least annually (check manufacturer specifications for test procedures and maintenance schedules) . References 1 . Chojnacky MJ, Miller WW, Ripple DC, Strouse GF . Thermal Analysis of Refrigeration Systems Used for Vaccine Storage . November 2, 2009 Monitoring Equipment Key Messages: CDC recommends and VFC requires using only calibrated temperature monitoring devices with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration Testing (also known as Report of Calibration) . Calibration testing should be performed every 1 to 2 years or according to manufacturer's suggested timeline . VFC providers should consult their immunization program for specific requirements . If calibration testing indicates that your thermometer is no longer accurate within +/-1\u00b0F (+/- .5\u00b0C), then your thermometer should be replaced . CDC recommends and immunization program may require having a back-up thermometer . CDC recommends using digital data loggers for continuous temperature monitoring . Staff should be trained and understand how to set up, read, and analyze temperature data provided by the data logger . Consult your immunization program for data logger selection and training resources . The temperature monitoring device should be near where vaccines are stored .

If you provide VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding requirements for temperature monitoring equipment. Temperature Monitoring Devices General Recommendations Accurate temperature history that reflects actual vaccine temperatures is imperative to effective vaccine management . Investing in reliable temperature monitoring devices is less expensive than replacing vaccines wasted due to inaccurate temperature readings . Calibrated Temperature Monitoring Devices For measuring vaccine storage unit temperatures, CDC recommends using only calibrated temperature monitoring devices with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration Testing (also known as Report of Calibration) . Calibration testing and traceability that is performed by a laboratory with accreditation from an International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) signatory body assures the user that testing performed meets the appropriate standard . An alternative is a Temperature Monitoring Equipment38 laboratory or manufacturer that provides documentation that demonstrates calibration testing performed meets International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 17025 international standards for calibration testing and traceability . If a temperature monitoring device claims to be \"certified,\" this does not mean that it has been tested to meet ISO/IEC 17025 standards . CDC's recommendation is that testing be performed by ILAC accredited laboratories because it is the easiest way to identify that the instrument has been tested correctly according to international standards . Providers are responsible for maintaining up-to-date certificates of calibration . If calibration testing was performed by ILAC/ MRA accredited laboratories, certificates should include the following elements: 1 . Clearly identifiable accreditation 2 . Name of device (optional) 3 . Model number 4 . Serial number 5 . Date of calibration (report or issue date) 6 . Measurement results that indicate passed testing and documented uncertainty within suitable limits (recommended uncertainty is +/-1 F [+/- .5 C]) Non-ILAC accredited laboratories and manufacturers must provide a Certificate of Traceability (Report of Calibration) that includes the following elements: 1 . Name of device (optional)2 . Model . Serial number 4 . Date of calibration (report or issue date) 5 . Measurement results that indicate passed testing and documented uncertainty within suitable limits (recommended uncertainty is +/-1 F [+/- .5 C]) 6 . Measurement results for the device 7 . Statement that calibration testing conforms to ISO 17025 Follow links for listings of accredited laboratories: The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) http://www.a2la.org/dirsearchnew/ newsearch.cfm Laboratory Accreditation Accreditation Service (IAS) http://www.iasonline.org/Calibration_ Laboratories/CL.html Perry Johnson Laboratory Accreditation, Inc .(PJLA) http://www.pjlabs.com/search-accredited- labs A listing of signatory bodies outside of the U .S . can be found on the ILAC website: https://www.ilac.org/members_contact_ details.html Temperature Monitoring Equipment39 All temperature monitoring devices experience \"drift\" over time that affects their accuracy . When traceability and calibration testing needs to be done, CDC recommends one of the following: Have accuracy of your temperature monitoring device tested . Calibration testing should be performed every 1 to 2 years from the last testing date or according to the manufacturer's suggested timeline . Providers who receive VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds should consult their immunization program regarding the required timeframe for calibration testing . Purchase a new temperature monitoring device with a Certificate of Traceability and Calibration Testing (also known as a Report of Calibration) . Contact your immunization program for resources on checking the accuracy of your temperature monitoring device . If calibration testing indicates that your temperature monitoring device is no longer accurate within +/-1\u00b0F (+/- .5\u00b0C), then it should be replaced . Adjustments to correct accuracy of the device are not recommended . If a temperature monitoring device is dropped or hit against the side of the storage unit, CDC recommends that at minimum, the device be checked for accuracy against a known calibrated temperature monitoring device . Mishandling a temperature monitoring device can affect its accuracy . If there is any question about accuracy, your device should be sent for calibration testing or a new device should be obtained . Some temperature monitoring devices require batteries . If you use one of these, have a supply of extra batteries on hand . If you change a battery (this does not include an alarm battery) in your device, it should undergo calibration testing as described above . Purchasing a replacement device may be less expensive than calibration testing . Types of Temperature Monitoring Devices Continuous monitoring devices CDC recommends using a continuous temperature monitoring device for each storage unit . These devices can provide an indication of length of time a unit has been operating outside the recommended vaccine storage temperature (excursion) and when an excursion occurred . Unlike a simple min/max thermometer, which provides only information about warmest and coldest temperatures that were reached, the continuous monitoring device provides detailed information on all temperatures recorded at preset intervals . There are a variety of devices available . Contact your immunization program for resources and information on acceptable temperature monitoring devices . Based on studies of temperature monitoring devices conducted by NIST in 2009,1 CDC recommends devices with the following characteristics: 1 . Digital display on outside of storage unit to allow reading temperatures without opening unit door 2 . Detachable probe in a bottle filled with a thermal buffer, like glycol, which more closely reflects vaccine temperatures. Vaccine temperatures have been found to be more thermostable than air temperature, which fluctuates with defrost cycles and Temperature Monitoring Equipment40 Digital display of temperature monitoring device on outside of storage unit Attach digital display to outside of refrigerator Cable is not thick enough to affect refrigerator door seal Probe in thermal buffer such as glycol, inside unit is attached by cable to main monitor Immersion depth > 10 x PD Bottle width > 4 x PD Probe diameter (PD) 1-2 cmSelect a glass or plastic bottle Minimum diameter = 4 x probe diameter (PD) Bottle height chosen so that: -Immersion depth 10 x probe diameter -Probe tip to bottom 1 to 2 cm Sealable lid preferred (e .g ., pierceable, rubber septum cap) Note: If manufacturer supplies a fluid-filled bottle/vial with data logger, this may be used instead . Completely fill bottle with fluid (e .g ., glycol) Insert probe through center of cap Position probe tip to achieve depth 10 x PD Make sure tip doesn't touch bottom of bottle Make sure entire length of probe is centered within bottle To keep probe from shifting, fix cable to outside of bottle with tape or cable tieHow to Set up a Probe in Fluid-filled BottleTemperature Monitoring Equipment41 opening and closing the unit door 3 . Alarm to alert out- of- range temperatures 4 . Accuracy within +/-1\u00b0F (+/- .5\u00b0C) 5 . Low battery indicator 6 . Continuous monitoring and recording capabilities to track and record temperatures over time 7 . Display of current, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures, which indicate the coldest and warmest temperatures recorded since device was reset CDC recommends having a back-up temperature monitoring device in the event that something happens to the primary device or if the primary device needs to be sent to a laboratory for calibration testing . The back-up temperature monitoring device should have the same set-up as the primary set-up (i .e ., probe in buffer such as glycol) . In addition, CDC recommends that the back-up device have a different calibration testing schedule so that your back-up is available when the primary is sent for testing . Some immunization programs require VFC providers to have a back-up thermometer . Contact your immunization program for specific requirements . Digital data loggers CDC recommends using digital data loggers for continuous temperature monitoring and recording . These electronic devices may be programmed to record temperatures at intervals throughout the day, with frequency of reading set by user . Digital data logger temperature monitoring devices are capable of recording and storing thousands of individual temperature readings . Digital data loggers are typically battery operated . They are often simple to use and have a number of beneficial features . Choose a model that is capable of displaying current, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures . An alarm that rings outside the storage unit is preferable as it is readily noticed and can be responded to quickly . Digital data loggers Digital units store continuous temperature data, which can then be downloaded into a computer or retrieved from a website for review and archiving . These devices may be accompanied by special software that is installed on a computer . Either the software or the website may allow the user to set frequency of temperature readings, download data from device, and review minimums and maximums . To review temperature history, the user must download data from the digital data logger on a regular basis . Even if you don't have a computer for downloading data, these devices are still helpful in monitoring temperatures a minimum of 2 times each workday, as well as providing minimum and maximum temperatures since the last reading . Temperature Monitoring Equipment42 CDC recommends that temperatures displayed on the unit are still reviewed and recorded a minimum of 2 times each workday, as well as minimum and maximum temperatures since the last reading, to determine if temperatures are out of range . Data logger Most data loggers contain a probe that is used to detect temperature readings . As stated previously, CDC recommends using probes encased in a thermal buffer such as glycol because they provide a more accurate reading of actual vaccine temperature . Some data loggers have digital displays showing current and min/max temperatures, as well as current room temperature . Some data loggers have an audible alarm to alert the user to out-of-range temperatures . Other data loggers have external lights that alert the user (a green light indicates temperatures have remained in range and a red light indicates an inappropriate temperature occurred) . If the alarm activates, take immediate corrective action . Download and review temperature readings and proceed as noted in Handling Inappropriate Vaccine Storage Conditions (Light and Temperature) . In conclusion, the data logger should have the following: Alarm for out-of-range temperatures Current, minimum, and maximum temperatures Low battery indicator Accuracy of +/-1\u00b0F (+/- .5\u00b0C) Memory storage of at least 4,000 readings User programmable logging interval (or reading rate) Use of calibrated digital data loggers is a best practice . Staff should be trained and understand how to set up, read, and analyze temperature data provided by the data logger . Consult your immunization program for data logger selection and training resources . Temperature Monitoring Devices that are NOT Recommended CDC does NOT recommend the following temperature monitoring devices: Fluid-filled biosafe liquid temperature monitoring devices Bi-metal stem temperature monitoring devices Food temperature monitoring devices Household mercury temperature monitoring devices Chart recorders Infrared temperature monitoring devices Temperature monitoring devices that are not calibrated These devices can have significant limitations. They can be difficult to read and most only provide information on the temperature at the precise time they are read. Therefore, temperature fluctuations outside the recommended range may not be detected .Temperature Monitoring Equipment43 Testing demonstrated that infrared thermometers (IR thermometers) are not reliable or accurate for assessment of vaccine storage temperatures . 1 Do not use temperature monitoring devices that do not have a certificate of calibration . Generally, devices obtained in hardware and appliance stores are not calibrated instruments and are designed to monitor temperatures for domestic food storage . These devices are not accurate enough and can pose a significant risk of losing expensive vaccines . Temperature Monitoring Device Placement Prior to storing vaccines in a unit, determine where the most reliable and consistent temperature readings are and store your vaccines there . The probe should be near where vaccines are being stored . This should be in the main body of the storage unit, away from walls, ceiling, cooling vents, doors, floor, and back of the unit . Vaccine Security Protecting Power Supply To prevent problems with the power supply, take the following steps: Plug only one storage unit into an outlet to avoid triggering a safety switch and turning off power, and to avoid creating a fire hazard . Use a safety-lock plug or an outlet cover to prevent unplugging . Post warning signs at plugs and on storage units alerting staff, custodians, electricians, or other workers not to unplug units ( Do NOT unplug ) . Label fuses and circuit breakers to alert people not to turn off power to storage units . Labels should include immediate steps to take if power is interrupted . If your building is owned by a third party and you do not have access to circuit breakers, work with your building manager . Avoid using power outlets with: Built-in circuit switches (they have little red reset buttons) Outlets that can be activated by a wall switch Multi-outlet power strips These can be tripped or switched off, resulting in loss of electricity to the storage unit . Placement of probe Temperature Monitoring Equipment44 Temperature Alarms Alarms are a useful tool to alert staff to potential problems . However, any alarm is only as good as the people responding to it . Large vaccine losses and the need to revaccinate have occurred despite using alarmed, continuous monitoring systems . Issues around untrained staff who do not know how to read the monitor, unexpected events, poor monitoring and response procedures, equipment failure, and improper maintenance have all been implicated in vaccine mishandling incidents . Refer to Storage Unit Temperature Monitoring . VFC providers or providers who receive other vaccines purchased with public funds should contact their immunization program for further guidance .

Store frozen vaccines in freezer between -58\u00b0F and (-50\u00b0C and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C with a desired average temperature of 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) . Place vaccines and diluents with soonest expiration dates in front of those with later expiration dates . In refrigerator, do not store vaccines in deli, fruit, and vegetable drawers, or on floor . Avoid storing vaccines on refrigerator top shelf . If top shelf must be used, place water bottles close to vent and only store vaccines not sensitive to coldest temperatures (e .g ., MMR) . Place vaccines and diluents 2 to 3 inches from walls and allow space between rows of vaccines and diluents to promote cold air circulation . Do not place near vents or pack unit too tightly . Keep vaccines and diluents in original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration . Label and store look-alike or sound-alike vaccines (e .g ., Hib and HepB), and pediatric and adult formulations (e .g ., DTaP and Tdap) of the same vaccine in different locations to lessen risk of administration errors ( Vaccine Labels for Storage Unit ) . Clearly label diluents (IAC's Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them ) . Store food and beverages in separate refrigerator and storage units than where vaccines are stored . NEVER store vaccines and other medications or biologics in same tray or containers/bins . If possible, store products other than vaccines in different unit .Vaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices47 Vaccine and Diluent Storage Temperatures Always refer to the manufacturer's product information/ package inserts for the most up-to-date storage and handling recommendations for specific vaccines and diluents . Freezer Temperature Store frozen vaccines (e .g ., varicella-containing vaccines [VAR, HZV, and MMRV]) (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) until reconstitution and administration . These vaccines can deteriorate rapidly after removal from the freezer . Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) can be stored in a refrigerator or in a freezer . Refrigerator Temperature Store all other routinely recommended vaccines in a refrigerator between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C), with a desired average temperature of 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) . This will allow for slight temperature fluctuations while still maintaining the recommended temperature range . Diluents Some diluents must be stored in the refrigerator . Other diluents have an option of being stored at room temperature (no warmer than 77\u00b0F [25\u00b0C]) or in the refrigerator . Whenever possible, store diluent with the corresponding refrigerated vaccine (meningococcal conjugate vaccine) contain antigen . They are packaged together with the corresponding lyophilized vaccine and must be stored together ( package inserts ) . NEVER store diluent in the freezer .Vaccine and Diluent Placement within Storage Unit Place vaccines and diluents with soonest expiration dates in front of those with later expiration dates . Freezers Store vaccines away from walls, ceiling, and vents . Do not store vaccines in the door . The temperature in the door is not stable and differs from that inside the unit . Vaccines in freezer with frozen coolant packs Refrigerators Store vaccines away from walls, floor, ceiling, and vents . Do not store vaccines in deli, fruit, and vegetable drawers, or in the door . Temperature and air flow in these areas may not be stable, exposing vaccines to inappropriate storage temperatures . Avoid storing vaccines on top shelf . If top shelf of refrigerator must be used, place water bottles close to vent and only store vaccines that are not sensitive to coldest temperatures (e .g ., MMR) .Vaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices48 Air vents and water bottles Water bottles on unit floor Water bottles in unit door Spacing Place vaccines and diluents in central area of unit 2 to 3 inches away from storage unit walls . Store vaccines and diluents by type and arrange in rows . Allow space between rows to promote cold air circulation around vaccines and diluents . Adequate cold air circulation helps each vaccine and diluent maintain a consistent temperature . Do NOT pack any vaccine storage unit too tightly .Packaging Keep vaccines and diluents in their original packaging with lids closed until ready for administration to protect them from light . Removing vaccines and diluents from original packaging is not recommended . This can increase risks for storage, handling, and administration errors . Do NOT store loose vials or manufacturer-filled syringes outside of their packaging . This practice makes managing inventory and tracking expiration dates more difficult, increases risk of administration errors, and exposes vaccines to light . Vaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices49 Store vaccines and diluents with similar packaging or names on different shelves to lessen risk of administration errors . If you have pediatric and adult formulations of the same vaccine, label and store them on different shelves . For example, DTaP and Tdap might be easily confused, as might Hib and HepB . Trays and Containers/Bins Trays and uncovered containers/bins may be used for better organization . Each should only contain vaccine or diluent of the same type . Always allow space between trays and containers/bins for air circulation . Best and worst locations for storage can vary with different types of units. A best practice is to place vaccines in central area of unit and keep vaccines in original packaging in trays or containers/bins 2 to 3 inches away from walls. Vaccine Storage Methods and Locations in the Refrigerator Household Combination Pharmaceutical Stand-alone Freezerless NO vials touching glass shelf or directly under cooling vent = 2\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C colder .Avoid storage on top shelf - near cooling vent . First location to exceed max allowed temp during outages . No storage in crisper drawers: thermally isolated + floor level runs cold . Remove drawers, fill space with water bottles .This is an area of caution in some pharmaceutical units .1\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C colder than main fridge space . Best storage practice - place vaccines in center fridge space, contained in original packaging, inside designated storage trays positioned 2 to 3 inches from refrigerator walls .Vaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices50 Labeling Clearly identify the location of each specific vaccine type and diluent by attaching labels to shelves, trays, or containers/ bins where each is stored . Label pediatric and adult versions of the same vaccine to avoid confusion ( Vaccine Labels for Storage Unit ) . A diluent must only be used with the corresponding vaccine . If diluent is stored separately from the corresponding vaccine, label the shelf, tray, or container/ bin where it is stored (IAC's Vaccines with Diluents: How to Use Them ) . Storage of Non-Vaccine Products Food and Beverages Store food and beverages in a separate storage unit, not where vaccines are stored . Storing food and beverages in the same unit with vaccines can result in: Frequent opening of the door Greater risk of temperature fluctuations Excessive light exposure Risk of spills and contamination Other Medications and Biologic Products If possible, these products should be stored in a different unit . If they must be stored in the same unit as vaccines, always store them below vaccines on a different shelf . This prevents contamination of vaccines should other products spill, and reduces the likelihood of medication errors . NEVER store these products in the same tray or container/bin as vaccines . HepA\u2014Adult Formulation Ages: 19 years and older Use for: Any dose in the series Route: Intramuscular (IM) injectionHepA\u2014Pediatric Formulation Ages: 12 months through 18 years Use for: Any dose in the series Route: Intramuscular (IM) injection Do NOT store food or beverages inside a vaccine refrigerator or freezer. If other medications/biologics are stored in same unit with vaccines, store on a lower shelf.Vaccine Storage and Handling Best Practices51 Notes:Storage Unit Temperature Monitoring52 Storage Unit Temperature Monitoring Key Messages: Routine storage and handling plans should include protocols for reviewing and recording storage unit temperature readings a minimum of 2 times each workday and minimum and maximum temperatures 1 time each morning . Use of a continuous monitoring device/digital data logger to record and store temperatures for 24-hour monitoring at regular intervals is recommended . The data logger should have a digital display attached to the outside of unit to allow reading temperatures without opening door and disturbing the probe . Download and review stored temperature data at least 1 time each week . Maintain ongoing file of temperature data, including hard copies and downloaded data, for 3 years . If storage temperatures are in question, contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) per your protocol for further guidance in determining if vaccine can be used . Be prepared to provide data from temperature logs and/or data logger ( CDC's Temperature Excursion Checklist ) . Document date and time of any mechanical malfunction or power outage . Reviewing and Recording Temperatures If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding specific requirements for reviewing and recording storage unit temperatures . CDC recommends that routine vaccine storage and handling plans include protocols for reviewing and recording storage unit temperature readings a minimum of 2 times each workday . This can prevent inadvertent loss of vaccine and the potential need for revaccination by assuring that temperature excursions are identified quickly and immediate corrective action is taken . This is also an opportunity to visually inspect the storage unit, reorganize any vaccines that are inadvertently misplaced, and remove any expired vaccines . This best practice recommendation applies to all vaccine storage units, regardless of whether or not there is a temperature alarm or a digital data logger temperature monitoring device . This assures that any temperature excursions are recognized promptly and provides early identification of problems with your storage unit . CDC recommends use of a continuous monitoring device/digital data logger to record and store temperature information at frequent programmable intervals for 24-hour temperature monitoring . Storage Unit Temperature Monitoring53 The data logger's active digital display should be attached to the outside of unit to allow reading temperatures without opening the door and disturbing the probe . Set data loggers to measure temperatures at regular intervals . Best practices include: 1 . Post a temperature log on each storage unit door or nearby in a readily accessible and visible location . 2 . Read temperature monitoring devices in both refrigerator and freezer units a minimum of 2 times each workday, at least in the morning and before leaving at the end of the workday . 3 . Record readings in both refrigerator and freezer units on temperature logs . 4 . If alarm systems are used, temperatures should still be reviewed and recorded a minimum of 2 times daily . 5 . Take immediate action to correct out- of range temperatures . 6 . Record incident and action taken (IAC's Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record ) . 7 . If a temperature reading is missed, log entry should remain blank .8 . Download and review stored temperature data at least 1 time each week . 9 . Maintain an ongoing file of temperature data, including hard copies and downloaded data, for 3 years (unless state statutes or rules require longer retention) . As a vaccine storage unit ages, you can track recurring problems or identify how long problems have existed by referring to these data . CDC recommends reviewing and recording minimum and maximum temperature readings at the beginning of the workday . This helps to ensure temperature excursions are identified quickly and corrections are made to prevent vaccine loss . Record times of readings and initials of person who took readings . The Immunization Action Coalition has developed Temperature Logs ) to support these activities .

If, at any time, Storage Unit Temperature Monitoring54 storage temperatures are in question, contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) per your protocol for further guidance in determining if vaccine can be used . When contacting the manufacturer or immunization program, be prepared to provide them with data from temperature logs and/ or data logger so they can offer you the best guidance ( CDC's Temperature Excursion Checklist ) . Reviewing Temperature Recording Data The primary vaccine coordinator should review temperature recording data at least 1 time each week to ensure appropriate temperature documentation . If the primary vaccine coordinator is monitoring and recording temperatures, the alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinator should review data at least 1 time each week .Noting Equipment Failures and Room Temperatures Document date and time of any mechanical malfunction or power outage (e .g ., IAC's Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record ) . Take immediate action to correct these situations ( Handling Malfunctioning Vaccine Storage Units and Power Outages ) . Notes:Troubleshooting55 Troubleshooting Key Messages: Any temperature reading outside ranges included in manufacturers' package inserts is considered a temperature excursion . Responses from vaccine manufacturers to events are dependent on information received . Different information about the same event will inevitably lead to different recommendations on usability of vaccine or need to revaccinate . In addition, each event is unique and manufacturer recommendations based on existing stability data cannot be applied to what may appear to be similar events . Do not allow vaccines to remain in a nonfunctioning storage unit for an extended period of time (in general, more than 2 hours) . If longer, activate Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan . If temperature monitoring device indicates temperature is outside recommended range, first check that device is appropriately placed . Handling Inappropriate Vaccine Storage Conditions (Light and Temperature) If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding required actions in the event of a temperature excursion . Take immediate action to correct inappropriate vaccine storage conditions . Any temperature reading outside ranges included in manufacturers' package inserts is considered a temperature excursion . However, depending on the vaccine, it may be total amount of time (cumulative) out of range that affects whether the vaccine can be used . If there is any question that a vaccine has been exposed to inappropriate conditions, take the following steps: 1 . Notify primary or alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinator immediately . If not available, report problem to your supervisor 2 . At minimum, document (IAC's Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting Record ) : a . Date and time of event b . Room and storage unit temperatures (include minimum/maximum temperatures, if available) c . Person completing report d . Description of event* i . General description (i .e ., what happened) ii . Estimated length of time vaccine may have been affected (for example, if your temperature monitoring device shows that temperature of refrigerated vaccine rose to 48\u00b0F [9\u00b0C] for 10 minutes in morning and 5 minutes in afternoon, total time out of range was 15 minutes) iii . Inventory of affected vaccines iv . At time of event, what else was in storage unit (e .g ., water bottles in refrigerator or frozen coolant packs in freezer)Troubleshooting56 v . Prior to this event, any problems with storage unit and/or with affected vaccines vi . Other relevant information e . Action taken i . Do NOT discard vaccines ii . Label exposed vaccines \"Do NOT Use\" iii . Store exposed vaccines under appropriate conditions (set apart from other vaccines) iv . Contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) per your protocol for further guidance on whether to use affected vaccines v . What you did to prevent a similar problem in the future f . Results (i .e ., what happened to affected vaccines) You may also use the Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan Worksheet to help organize your response . Consult your agency or immunization program for any special instructions or forms . Notify the primary or alternate (back-up) vaccine coordinator immediately of any vaccine storage unit temperature that is outside the recommended range. Handling Malfunctioning Vaccine Storage Units General Instructions Do not allow vaccines to remain in a nonfunctioning unit for an extended period of time (in general, more than 2 hours) . If longer than 2 hours, activate Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan . The temperature in a refrigerator or freezer can vary throughout the unit . In addition, several external factors can affect the temperature in the unit, including: 1 . Seasonal weather affecting room temperature 2 . Frequency of opening and closing unit door 3 . Unit's mechanism for cooling Leaving a refrigerator door open can cause the thermostat to respond to warmer room temperatures by working harder at adjusting cooling output to maintain correct temperature inside the unit . This increases the possibility that the temperature will become very cold inside the unit and possibly freeze refrigerated vaccines . Using an open door alarm and self-closing doors may be helpful . Refer to the equipment user's guide for instructions on handling malfunctions in the unit . Another helpful problem-solving tool is CDC's Temperature Excursion Checklist . Assessing Storage Unit Door Seals To check that door is sealing properly: 1 . With door open, place thin paper strip *Responses from vaccine manufacturers to events depend on information received. If different information about the same event is provided to different manufacturers, this will inevitably lead to different recommendations on usability of vaccine or need to revaccinate. In addition, each event is unique and manufacturer recommendations based on existing stability data cannot be applied to what may appear to be similar events. Troubleshooting57 against front of unit (see Illustration 1) . 2 . Close door . 3 . Pull paper strip . If it moves easily or falls away by itself, door may need adjustment and/or rubber seals may need to be replaced . 4 . Check all the way around door to make sure seals are tight . Pay particular attention to corners . 5 . If problem suspected, contact repair technician . Illustration 1\u2014Checking the door seal (Adapted from the User's Handbook for Compression Refrigerators WHO/EPI/ LOG/8415) Temperature Monitoring Device Problems Temperature Monitoring Device Set-up If the temperature monitoring device indicates that the temperature is outside the recommended range, check that the device is appropriately placed . It should be placed in proximity to the vaccines . If the device is placed near walls, floor, vent, or ceiling, or in the door, it may indicate colder or warmer temperatures than if it was properly placed . Proper placement helps the provider accurately assess actual vaccine temperatures and take immediate corrective action if necessary . In addition, vaccine temperatures measured in air can be misleading with regard to actual vaccine temperatures . A buffered probe is the most accurate way to measure actual vaccine temperatures . Checking if Device Works It is common with some devices to see a slight variation in temperature from one reading to another, even when unit thermostat is set at a particular temperature . If no change in temperature reading occurs, the device may be faulty and may need calibration testing or replacement . Checking Repeated Alarm Alerts If temperature alarm goes off repeatedly, do NOT disconnect alarm until you are sure it is a false alarm . Start by conducting basic checks of unit door, power supply, and thermostat settings . If alarm continues to sound, transfer vaccines to back-up unit ( Emergency Vaccine Retrieval and Storage Plan ) . A repair technician should check your equipment to determine need for repair or replacement . Check the temperature every 30 minutes using a calibrated temperature monitoring device until the unit is in the recommended range and stable before returning vaccines .Troubleshooting58 Notes:Vaccine Inventory Management59 Vaccine Inventory Management Key Messages: Expiration dates vary by type of vaccine or diluent and lot number . They indicate the date by which a product should be used ( package inserts ) . Once lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccine is mixed with diluent (liquid) and reconstituted, there is a limited time frame in which vaccine can be used ( package inserts ) . If inadvertently administered, an expired or mishandled dose generally should not be counted as valid and should be repeated . Contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance on revaccination . At least 1 time each week and each time vaccines are delivered, vaccine coordinator should ensure that someone checks and rearranges placement of vaccines and diluents in storage unit according to expiration dates . If you receive multiple doses of same vaccine with same presentation (i .e ., single-dose vial, multidose vial, or manufacturer-filled syringe) from same lot with same expiration date, these doses may be documented as one entry on stock record . Number of vaccine doses in unit and number of doses reflected on stock records should match . Order smaller quantities to help prevent over-ordering and subsequent risk of expired, wasted vaccines . If you provide VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding requirements pertaining to vaccine inventory management . Vaccine Access Only authorized staff should have access to vaccine supplies . Expiration Dates Interpreting Expiration Dates All vaccines and diluents have expiration dates . These dates vary by type of vaccine or diluent and lot number and are printed on vials, manufacturer-filled syringes, and packages . They indicate the date by which a product should be used ( package insert ) . When the expiration date is marked with only month and year, vaccine or diluent may be used up to and including the last day of the month indicated . If a day is included with month and year, the vaccine may only be used through that day .Vaccine Inventory Management60 Vaccine may be used up to and including the expiration date. Vaccine Expiration Date: 08/16/15 Note: Use through August 16, 2015. Do NOT use on or after August 17, 2015.Vaccine Expiration Date: 08/15 Note: Use through August 31, 2015. Do NOT use on or after September 1, 2015. Exceptions to Expiration Dates on Labels (Beyond Use Date) There are 3 instances when vaccines must be used prior to the expiration date printed on the label . 1 . Reconstitution Once a lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccine is mixed with a diluent (liquid) and reconstituted into a liquid form, there is a limited time frame in which the vaccine can be used . This time frame is indicated in the manufacturer's package insert . Also see Reconstitution and IAC's Vaccines with Diluents: How 2 . Multidose vials Most multidose vials may be used until the expiration date printed on the vial unless contaminated or compromised in some way . However, some multidose vials have a specified time frame for use once the vial is entered with a needle ( package insert ) . Also see Multidose Vials .3 . Manufacturer shortened expiration date If vaccine has been exposed to inappropriate storage conditions, its potency may be reduced before the expiration date printed on the label . A manufacturer may determine that the vaccine can be used, but with a shortened expiration date . Contact your immunization program and/ or the vaccine manufacturer (s) per your protocol for further guidance in determining if the vaccine can be used with a shortened expiration date or if it should be discarded . When vaccines must be used prior to the expiration date on the label, this is referred to as the \"beyond use date\" or \"BUD\" noted in the package insert . For reconstituted vaccines, this may be a date and/or time after which the vaccine cannot be used . The \"BUD\" (date and/ or time) should be noted on the label along with the initials of the person changing the date/time .Vaccine Inventory Management61 Vaccines and Diluents that Cannot Be Used Before Expiration If vaccine transfer is necessary so vaccine can be used before expiration, contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) per your protocol for guidance (Emergency or Off-site/Satellite Facility Transport ) . Appropriate inventory management can be helpful in reducing need for transfer and transport of vaccines . What to Do with Expired and Mishandled Vaccines and Diluents Contact your immunization program and/ or vaccine manufacturer (s), as appropriate for your situation, for specific policies regarding disposition of expired or mishandled vaccines . If inadvertently administered, the dose generally should not be counted as valid and should be repeated . If this occurs, contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance on revaccination . Stock Rotation Immediately unpack vaccine deliveries . At least 1 time each week and each time vaccines are delivered, vaccine coordinator should ensure that someone checks and rearranges placement of vaccines and diluents in storage unit according to expiration dates . Vaccines with soonest expiration dates should be placed in front of other vaccines of same type that have later expiration dates . Immediately remove expired vaccines and diluents from storage units to avoid risk of inadvertent administration .Vaccine Inventory Accounting General Recommendations Proper vaccine and diluent inventory management includes recording quantities: Received Administered, wasted, spoiled, expired, transferred Currently in stock To be used first Which need to be ordered Vaccine Stock Records All vaccine doses removed from unit should be totaled by vaccine type and recorded on a stock record . Stock records should be completed weekly . The balance of doses remaining in stock is indicated on stock record using tally of doses administered, wasted, spoiled, expired, or transferred during that week . For lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccines that require reconstitution, document information for diluents on a separate vaccine stock record . Quantities of these vaccines and diluents should be equal at all times . Stock records may be kept in either computerized or written formats . One benefit of participation in an immunization information system (IIS) is ability to manage vaccine inventory electronically . Stock records should contain the following: Date each vaccine and diluent delivered Initials of person who unpacked delivery (this person should document delivery on stock record) Condition of each vaccine and diluent upon arrival (i .e ., did vaccine arrive in good condition at proper temperature) Cold chain monitor (CCM) readings if Vaccine Inventory Management62 included in shipping container and actions taken if monitor was triggered ( Unpacking Deliveries ) Name of each vaccine and diluent Name of manufacturer(s) Vaccine presentation (i .e ., single-dose vial, multidose vial, or manufacturer-filled syringe) Lot number(s) (each lot should be documented separately) Expiration date(s) for each lot (including new expiration dates/times based on beyond use date [BUD] guidance in manufacturers' product information/ package insert ) Number of doses received (or balance of doses carried forward) Number of doses used (i .e ., administered, wasted, compromised, expired, or transferred - if vaccine is transferred, note destination beside number of doses) Balance remaining (in DOSES) after subtracting amount used (i .e ., administered, wasted, compromised, expired, or transferred) If you receive multiple doses of same vaccine with same presentations from same lot with same expiration date, these doses may be documented as 1 entry on stock record . Simply indicate total number of doses received of that particular presentation (regardless of number of vials or syringes those doses came in) . For example, if you receive 10 single-dose vials of same vaccine meeting above criteria, these 10 vials can be documented as single entry, noting that 10 doses were received . If you do not have a stock record, see Sample Stock Record for information that should be included . A blank Stock Record is also available . If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for information about stock records and inventory protocols and procedures . Sample Stock Record Vaccine Inventory Management63 Tally Sheets These should be placed in easily accessible locations (e .g ., outside unit door) and used to document each time doses are removed from unit, including administered, wasted, compromised, expired, or transferred . This can be documented with tick marks . Tally sheets can be used to keep stock records updated . For example, at the end of the week, the vaccine coordinator or designated person should add up number of doses on tally sheet of each vaccine used and update stock record accordingly . The old tally sheet should then be removed and replaced with a new one for the following week . Store and maintain used tally sheets in a file for future reference . If you do not have a tally sheet, see Sample Tally Sheet for information that should be included . A blank Tally Sheet is also available . If you are a VFC provider or have other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for information about tally sheets and inventory protocols and procedures .Documenting Administered, Wasted, Compromised, Expired, and Transferred Doses Contact your immunization program for details about inventory accounting practices . General Guidelines Document every dose removed from storage unit whether administered, wasted, compromised, expired, or transferred . Expiration dates should be checked a minimum of 1 time each week and stock should be rotated to ensure that soonest to expire is in front ( Expiration Dates and Stock Rotation ) . Document each time vaccine or diluent doses expire and immediately remove from unit . These records will help you decide how much vaccine to order to minimize future waste . Note each time vaccine doses cannot be used because they have been exposed to inappropriate storage conditions or because vials have been damaged . Once confirmed unusable by your immunization program or manufacturer(s), immediately remove these vaccines from unit . Subtract these unusable doses from running balance on stock record to calculate new balance of doses . Contact your Sample Tally Sheet Vaccine Inventory Management64 immunization program for instructions on how to dispose of these doses . They may have to be discarded, but sometimes unused vaccines may be returned for credit . Contact immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance if vaccine transfer is required . Document transfer details on appropriate tally sheet and stock record, including: Vaccine(s)/diluent(s) transferred Contact name Telephone number on delivery note or packing slip that accompanies transfer This helps recipient know exactly what items are being transferred . Copies of temperature logs that document appropriate storage also can be included . Counting Stock At least 1 time each month and before ordering, vaccine and diluent doses should be counted . This will ensure there are enough vaccine doses to meet needs of the facility, and is useful for checking accuracy of running balance of doses in the stock record . Number of vaccine doses in unit and number of doses reflected on stock records should match . When counting vaccine doses: Always review expiration dates . Immediately remove expired vaccines and diluents . Contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for specific policies regarding disposition of expired vaccines . If expired vaccines are VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for instructions on returning them . If expired vaccines cannot be returned, dispose of them appropriately ( Vaccine Disposal ) . If there is a difference between count of doses in unit and stock record balance, enter correct balance from your count on a separate line in stock record below old balance . Write a note with your signature beside it to indicate that your count has confirmed new balance . Use new corrected balance for all future stock calculations . If there are inventory discrepancies of VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for guidance . At end of every month, make a summary of amount of each vaccine and diluent used during that month and amount of stock still available at end of that month . At end of every year, total amount of each vaccine and diluent received and amount used . This information is useful for determining annual vaccine needs of facility . Vaccine Stock Calculations and Ordering There are three main principles for calculating amount of vaccine needed when placing orders: 1 . Order and stock only enough vaccines to ensure there is an adequate supply to meet patient needs . Vaccines and presentations ordered should be appropriate for ages and types of patients facility serves . An adequate supply for most facilities would normally be enough vaccines to last 60 days, with re-ordering threshold of 30 days . While vaccine orders usually arrive within 1-2 weeks, delays can occur . Avoid placing last-minute or rush orders to minimize the risk that you will run out of vaccines . Vaccine Inventory Management65 2 . Order smaller quantities to help prevent over-ordering and subsequent risk of expired, wasted vaccines . Over-ordering can lead to unnecessarily large volumes of vaccine being stored, increasing risk of losing a large quantity should vaccines be compromised (e .g ., mechanical failure of the storage unit) . Notes:Vaccine Deliveries66 Vaccine Deliveries Key Messages: Arrange for vaccine and diluent deliveries to be made only when vaccine coordinator or alternate (back-up) coordinator is on duty . All staff members who may be involved in deliveries should be trained to immediately notify vaccine coordinator or alternate (back-up) coordinator when deliveries arrive and ensure that vaccines and diluents are properly stored in a timely manner . Immediately unpack and examine deliveries upon arrival . After contents have been checked according to procedures, immediately store vaccines and diluents at recommended temperatures . Staff members who accept deliveries for facility must be aware that vaccine deliveries require immediate attention and know their responsibility in assuring cold chain is maintained . Standard Operating Procedures Each facility should develop its own written standard operating procedures (SOPs) for handling deliveries ( Routine Vaccine Storage and Handling Plan ) . Without SOPs, there can be no assurance that proper procedures will be followed or that problems will be identified, reported, and corrected . If you provide VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program for protocols and requirements pertaining to vaccine deliveries . Receiving and Unpacking Deliveries Receiving Deliveries Arrange for vaccine and diluent deliveries to be made only when the vaccine coordinator or alternate (back-up) coordinator is on duty . Consider holidays, vacations, staff schedules, and changes in hours of operation . All staff members (including non-medical staff, e .g ., receptionists and other front desk personnel) who may be involved in deliveries must be aware of importance of maintaining cold chain . They should be trained to: immediately notify coordinator or alternate (back-up) when deliveries arrive and ensure that vaccines and diluents are properly stored in a timely manner . All staff members who accept vaccine deliveries must be aware of the importance of maintaining the cold chain and the need to immediately notify the vaccine coordinator or alternate (back-up) coordinator upon arrival. If you need to pick up vaccines or diluents from another facility, you must ensure that cold chain Vaccine Deliveries67 can be maintained . If you have VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, you must coordinate any transfer with your immunization program . See Vaccine Transport . Unpacking Deliveries Immediately unpack and examine deliveries upon arrival . Examine shipping container and contents for signs of physical damage . Cross-check contents with packing slip to be sure they match . Check expiration dates to ensure that you have not received any vaccines or diluents that have already expired or will expire soon (Expiration Dates ) . Check that lyophilized (freeze-dried) vaccines have been shipped with correct type and quantity of diluents . For varicella- containing vaccines, diluents should be in a separate compartment . If you suspect heat or cold damage, check: -Vaccine cold chain monitor(s) (CCM), if present, and contact distributor or manufacturer for guidance . CCMs may not be required when vaccines are shipped directly from the manufacturer . Note: CCMs are one-time use and should be discarded . -Vaccines were properly packed . There should be an insulating barrier (such as bubble wrap, Styrofoam pellets, or some other barrier) between vaccines and the refrigerated or frozen coolant packs . Examine the shipping container and its contents for any signs of physical damage. If there are any discrepancies with the packing slip or concerns about contents, immediately notify immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance . Label vaccines \"Do NOT Use\" and store under appropriate conditions (set apart from other vaccines). Storing and Documenting Deliveries After contents have been checked according to procedures, immediately store vaccines and diluents at recommended temperatures and record each vaccine and diluent, noting all details on Stock Record . Do NOT leave shipping container unpacked and unattended as vaccines and diluents inside might warm to inappropriate Vaccine Deliveries68 temperatures and become unusable . Staff members who accept deliveries for the facility must be aware that vaccine deliveries require immediate attention and know their responsibility in assuring cold chain is maintained . Notes:Vaccine Transport69 Vaccine Transport Key Messages: If at all possible, have vaccines delivered directly to an off-site/satellite facility . If vaccines must be transported to off-site/ satellite facility, the amount transported should be limited to only what is needed for that workday . Transport and workday should total no more than a maximum of 8 hours . Use a calibrated temperature monitoring device with continuous monitoring and recording capabilities during transport . CDC recommends transport of refrigerated or frozen vaccines using a portable refrigerator/ freezer unit . If necessary, varicella-containing vaccines that have not been reconstituted may be transported at refrigerated temperatures . However, you must contact the vaccine manufacturer for guidance upon arrival at off-site/satellite facility . When packing vaccines for transport, use a barrier layer between coolant packs and vaccines and place a calibrated temperature monitoring device next to vaccines . Do NOT use dry ice to transport varicella-containing vaccines . Diluents should be transported with corresponding vaccines at storage temperatures specified in package insert . In advance, refrigerate diluents stored at room temperature before transporting in same container with refrigerated vaccines so they will not increase temperature in container . NEVER freeze diluents, even in transport . Read and record storage unit temperature at off-site/satellite facility a minimum of 2 times during the workday . If vaccines are kept in transport container, read and record temperatures hourly . Emergency or Off-site/Satellite Facility Transport If you provide VFC vaccines or other vaccines purchased with public funds, contact your immunization program regarding vaccine transport, details on how to pack vaccine and diluent, and procedures for maintaining the cold chain .General Recommendations Transport involves the movement of vaccine over a short time and distance between providers . Vaccine manufacturers do not generally recommend or provide guidance for transport of vaccines and CDC discourages routine transport . If at all possible, have vaccines delivered directly to an off-site/satellite facility . Each Vaccine Transport70 transport increases risk of exposing vaccines to inappropriate storage conditions . If vaccines must be transported to off-site/ satellite facility, the amount transported should be limited to only what is needed for that workday . Transport and workday should total no more than a maximum of 8 hours . CDC recommends using a calibrated temperature monitoring device with continuous monitoring and recording capabilities during transport . CDC does NOT recommend using cold chain monitors (CCMs in Unpacking Deliveries ) during transport since they do not provide adequate data on excursions that may occur . Providers should contact immunization program and/ or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance . The facility SOP should specify that vaccines are: Monitored with calibrated temperature monitoring device Not placed in vehicle trunk Delivered directly to facility Promptly unpacked and placed into appropriate storage units upon arrival (Unpacking Deliveries ) When transporting vaccines in non-commercial vehicles use the passenger compartment\u2014not the trunk.There are many variables to consider when transporting vaccines: Type of vaccines Time of year and seasonal temperature Amount of vaccines Container, packing materials, pack out method Number of times container is opened and closed Contact your immunization program for specific guidance regarding vaccine transport, details on how to pack vaccine and diluent, and procedures for maintaining cold chain . General Guidance Refrigerated vaccines Pack refrigerated vaccines before packing frozen vaccines . CDC recommends transport with a portable refrigerator unit . If this type of unit is not available, a hard-sided insulated cooler with at least 2-inch walls may be used if it can maintain recommended temperature range (between 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F [2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C]) . Place a layer (at least 2 inches) of \"conditioned\" coolant packs in transport container first . Coolant packs that are frozen must be \"conditioned\" by leaving them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until edges have defrosted and packs look like they've been \"sweating .\" Frozen coolant packs that are not \"conditioned\" can freeze vaccines . Place an insulating barrier layer on top of coolant packs (e .g ., bubble wrap or Styrofoam pellets) . Next, place a calibrated temperature monitoring device (preferably with a probe Vaccine Transport71 in a thermal buffer, e .g ., glycol) on top of barrier . Next, stack vaccines with temperature monitoring device on top of barrier . Place another insulating barrier layer on top of vaccines . Place another layer of \"conditioned\" coolant packs on top of barrier . Always ensure there is no direct contact between coolant packs and vaccines . Place a final insulating barrier layer (at least 2 inches) on top of coolant packs along with a list of vaccines in container . Transporting Varicella-containing Vaccines The vaccine manufacturer does not recommend transporting varicella-containing vaccines (VAR, HZV, MMRV) . If these vaccines must be transported (e .g ., during an emergency): CDC recommends transport in a portable freezer unit that maintains temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) . Portable freezers may be available for rent in some places . If not using a portable freezer, use same packing layers as noted above . Coolant packs should be frozen . If necessary, varicella-containing vaccines that have not been reconstituted may be transported at refrigerator temperature between 36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C) for up to 72 continuous hours prior to reconstitution ( package inserts ) . Follow these steps: 1 . Place a calibrated temperature monitoring device (preferably with a probe in a thermal buffer, e .g ., glycol) in the container as close as possible to vaccines . If transported in same container with refrigerated vaccines, place insulating material (e .g ., bubble wrap) around refrigerated vaccines to protect from freezing temperatures and use rubber bands around frozen vaccines to keep them separate . 2 . Record: a . Time vaccines are removed from storage unit and placed in container b . Temperature during transport c . Time at end of transport when vaccine returned to main storage unit 3 . Immediately upon arrival at off-site/ satellite facility: a . Place varicella-containing vaccines in freezer -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) and label \"Do NOT Use .\" Any stand-alone freezer that reliably maintains a temperature between -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C) is acceptable for storage of varicella-containing vaccines . b . Document time vaccines are removed from container and placed in alternate storage unit . c . Note: This is considered a temperature excursion . Do NOT use vaccine until the vaccine manufacturer is contacted at 1-800-637-2590 for guidance . 4 . Do not discard vaccines without contacting your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance . Do NOT use dry ice, even for temporary storage or emergency transport . Dry ice may expose varicella-containing vaccines to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C) .Vaccine Transport72 Diluents Diluents should be transported with their corresponding vaccines to ensure there are always equal amounts of vaccine and diluent for reconstitution . Follow manufacturer guidance for specific temperature requirements . Diluents that contain antigen (e .g ., DTaP-IPV diluent used with Hib lyophilized vaccine) should be transported with corresponding vaccines at refrigerator temperature . Place an insulating barrier between diluents and coolant packs . Refrigerate, in advance, diluents stored at room temperature before transporting in same container with refrigerated vaccines so they will not increase temperature in container . NEVER freeze diluents, even in transport . Multidose Vials Only if absolutely necessary, a partially used vial may be transported to or from an off-site/satellite facility operated by the same provider, as long as the cold chain is properly maintained . However, a partially used vial may NOT be transferred to another provider or transported across state lines . Monitoring Temperatures at Off-site/Satellite Facility Immediately upon arrival at off-site/ satellite facility, store vaccines at recommended temperature range in an on-site refrigerator or freezer . Place a calibrated temperature monitoring device(s) in storage unit(s) with vaccines . Read and record temperatures a minimum of 2 times during the workday if the vaccines are stored in a refrigerator and freezer . CDC does not recommend keeping vaccines in a transport container(s) unless it is a portable refrigerator or freezer unit . If vaccines must be kept in a transport container(s) during an off- site clinic, temperature{s) should be read and recorded at least hourly . In addition: Container(s) should remain closed as much as possible A calibrated temperature monitoring device(s) (preferably with a probe in a thermal buffer, e .g ., glycol) should be placed as close as possible to vaccines Only amount of vaccine needed at one time (no more than 1 multidose vial or 10 doses) should be removed for preparation and administration by each vaccinator If you have concerns about vaccines or diluents that may have been compromised (exposed to inappropriate conditions/ temperatures or handled improperly), label them \"Do NOT Use\" and store them under appropriate conditions (set apart from other vaccines) . Immediately contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance . Do NOT discard the vaccines or diluents unless directed to by your immunization program and/or manufacturer(s) . Vaccine Transport73 Notes:Vaccine Preparation74 Vaccine Preparation Key Messages: Do not open a single-dose vial until ready to use . Once the protective cap is removed the vaccine should be used or discarded at the end of the workday . Multidose vials can be used until the expiration date printed on the vial unless contaminated, compromised, or there is a \"beyond use date\" (BUD) noted in the package insert . NEVER use partial doses from two or more vials to obtain a full dose of vaccine . Once a manufacturer-filled syringe is activated (i .e ., syringe cap removed or needle attached), the vaccine should be used or discarded at the end of the workday . Diluents are NOT interchangeable unless specified by manufacturer (e .g ., diluent for MMR, VAR, HZV, and MMRV) . If vaccine must be reconstituted, use only diluent supplied by manufacturer for that vaccine . NEVER use a stock vial of sterile water or normal saline to reconstitute vaccines . Always check expiration dates on both diluent and vaccines to make sure neither has expired . Refer to manufacturer's product information/ package insert for instructions on reconstituting specific vaccines . CDC recommends that providers draw up vaccines only at time of administration . If not used by the end of the workday, vaccines should be discarded . You should only administer vaccines that you have prepared . Preparation for Vaccine Administration Single-dose Vials Single-dose vials are meant for one-time not contain a bacteriostatic (preservative) agent . Do not open a single-dose vial until ready to use . Once the protective cap has been removed, the vaccine should be used because it may not be possible to determine if the rubber seal has been punctured . Always check the vial before removing the cap to assure the correct vaccine has been selected . Unused single-dose vials without a protective cap should be discarded at the end of the workday . Single-dose vials are meant for one-time use only. Once unsealed, discard vial at end of the workday.Vaccine Preparation75 Multidose Vials Multidose vials can be entered more than once to draw up multiple doses . They do contain a bacteriostatic (preservative) agent . They can be used until the expiration date printed on the vial unless contaminated, compromised in some way, or there is a \"beyond use date\" or \"BUD\" noted in the package insert . Also see Exceptions to Expiration Dates on Labels (Beyond Use Date) . NEVER use partial doses from two or more vials to obtain a dose of vaccine . Manufacturer-filled Syringes Manufacturer-filled syringes are prepared and sealed under sterile conditions by the manufacturer . Once a manufacturer-filled syringe is activated (i .e ., syringe cap removed or needle attached), the sterile seal is broken . The vaccine should then be used or discarded at the end of the workday . Manufacturer-filled syringes Reconstitution Lyophilized (Freeze-dried) be a powder or pellet that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) in a process known as \"reconstitution\" before it can be administered . Diluents A diluent is liquid that is mixed with a lyophilized powder or pellet to reconstitute vaccine into liquid form for administration . Diluents vary in volume and composition . They are specifically designed to meet volume, pH (acid/ alkaline balance), and chemical requirements of their corresponding vaccine . Some diluents contain antigen (e .g ., DTaP-IPV) . Diluents are NOT interchangeable unless specified by the manufacturer (e .g ., diluent for MMR, VAR, HZV, and MMRV) . If vaccine must be reconstituted with sterile water or saline, use only the diluent supplied for that vaccine . NEVER use a stock vial of sterile water or normal saline to reconstitute vaccines . Always check expiration dates on both diluent and vaccines to make sure neither has expired . NEVER administer vaccine reconstituted with the wrong diluent . If the vaccine has already been administered, contact your immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for guidance regarding revaccination . For general guidance on vaccine reconstitution see Vaccine Administration . Manufacturers' package insert s also contain instructions on reconstitution of specific vaccines . Diluent + Lyophilized Powder = Reconstituted VaccineVaccine Preparation76 Predrawing Vaccines CDC recommends that providers draw up vaccines only at the time of administration . Problems associated with this practice Once vaccines are inside syringes, it is difficult to tell them apart leading to administration errors . Leads to vaccine waste and increases risk of storage under inappropriate conditions . Most syringes are designed for immediate administration, not for storage . Bacterial contamination and growth can occur in syringes with predrawn vaccine that does not contain bacteriostatic agents . Vaccine components may interact with polymers in plastic syringes over time, potentially reducing vaccine potency . Only administer a vaccine you have prepared and drawn up . If vaccine is drawn up by one person and administered by a different person, the person administering vaccine cannot be sure about what is in the syringe and its sterility . This is a quality control and patient safety issue and a best practice standard of medication administration . CDC discourages predrawing vaccines. Influenza Clinics and Predrawing Vaccines Vaccine manufacturers do not recommend that vaccines be predrawn in advance of clinics because no data exist on stability of vaccines stored in syringes that have been filled by providers . As an alternative to predrawing vaccines, CDC recommends using manufacturer-filled syringes for large immunization clinics . Cautions if vaccine must be predrawn: If more than one vaccine type is to be administered, separate administration stations should be set up for each vaccine type to prevent medication errors . Vaccines should NOT be drawn up in advance of arriving at clinic site . Drawing up doses of vaccine hours or even days before a clinic is NOT acceptable . At clinic site, no more than 1 multidose vial or 10 doses should be drawn up at one time by each vaccinator . Patient flow should be monitored to avoid drawing up unnecessary doses . At end of workday, any remaining vaccine in provider predrawn syringes should be discarded . Vaccine Preparation77 Notes:Vaccine Disposal78 Vaccine Disposal Key Messages: Contact immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s) for policies regarding disposition of unopened vials, expired vials, unused doses, and potentially compromised vaccine . Open vials, activated manufacturer-filled syringes, vaccine predrawn by a provider, and broken vials and syringes are not returnable and should be appropriately discarded . Contact your immunization program or state environmental agency to ensure that your vaccine disposal procedures and any related documentation are in compliance with state and federal regulations . Unused vaccine and diluent doses may be returnable under certain circumstances . Contact the vaccine supplier, which may be the immunization program and/or vaccine manufacturer (s), for specific policies regarding the disposition of unopened vials, expired vials, unused doses, and potentially compromised vaccine due to inappropriate storage conditions . Open vials, activated manufacturer-filled syringes, vaccine predrawn by a provider, and broken vials and syringes are not returnable and should be appropriately discarded . In general, most empty vaccine vials are not considered hazardous or pharmaceutical waste and do not require disposal in a biomedical waste container . Requirements for medical waste disposal are regulated by state environmental agencies . Contact your immunization program or state environmental agency to ensure that your vaccine disposal procedures and any related documentation are in compliance with state and federal regulations .

It will also main- tain recommended temperatures if the cooler is exposed to outside temperatures as low as -4\u00baF for one of those 12 hours.If the vaccine will be stored in refrigerators after transport, be sure those refrigerators have maintained temperatures be- tween 35\u00baF and 46\u00baF for at least 3 to 5 days. Assemble packing supplies 1. Cooler. Use hard plastic Igloo-type coolers. Attach a \"Vaccines: Do Not Freeze\" label to the cooler. 2. \"Conditioned\" cold packs. Condition frozen gel packs by leaving them at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours until the edges have defrost-ed and packs look like they've been \"sweating.\" Cold packs that are not conditioned can freeze vaccine. Do not use dry ice. 3. Thermometer. Prepare the thermometer by placing it in the refrigera- tor at least 2 hours before you pack the vaccine. 4. Packing material. Use two 2-inch layers of bubble wrap. Not using enough bubble wrap can cause the vaccine to freeze. Pack vaccine Spread conditioned cold packs to cover only half of the bot-tom of the cooler. Spread \"conditioned\" cold packs to cover only half of the bubble wrap. Make sure that the cold packs do not touch the boxes of vaccine.Completely cover the vaccine with another 2-inch layer of bubble wrap. Fill the cooler to the top with bubble wrap. Place the thermom-eter's digital display and the Return or Transfer of Vaccines Report form on top. It's ok if temperatures go above 46\u00baF while packing.Stack layers of vaccine boxes on the bubble wrap. Do not let the boxes of vaccine touch the cold packs.Completely cover the cold packs with a 2-inch layer of bubble wrap. Then, place the thermometer/probe on top of the bubble wrap directly above a cold pack.1. Cold packs 2. Bubble wrap 3. Vaccine& Thermometer4. Bubble wrap 6. Form & display5.

I will annually submit a provider profile represent ing populations served by my practice/facility. I w ill submit more frequently if 1) the number of children served changes or 2) the status of the facility changes during the calendar year. 2. I will screen patients and document eligibility sta tus at each immunization encounter for VFC eligibil ity (i.e., federally or state vaccine - eligible) and administer VFC-purchased vaccine by s uch category only to children who are 18 years of a ge or younger who meet one or more of the following categories: A. Federally Vaccine-eligible Children (VFC eligibl e) 1. Are an American Indian or Alaska Native; 2. Are enrolled in Medicaid; 3. Have no health insurance; 4. Are underinsured: A child who has health insurance, but the coverage does not include vaccines; a chil d whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (VFC-eligible for non -covered vaccines only). Underinsured children are eligible to receive VFC vaccine only through a Federally Qualified Health C enter (FQHC), or Rural Health Clinic (RHC) or under an approved deputization agreement. B. State Vaccine-eligible Children 1. In addition, to the extent that my state designates additional categories of children as \"state vaccin e-eligible\", I will screen for such eligibility as listed in the addendum to this agreement and will administer state-funded doses (i ncluding 317 funded doses) to such children. Children aged 0 through 18 years that do not meet o ne or more of the eligibility federal vaccine categ ories (VFC eligible), are not eligible to receive VFC-purchased vaccine. 3. For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider profile, I will comply with immunization s chedules, dosages, and contraindications that are established by the Advis ory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and included in the VFC program unless: a) In the provider's medical judgment, and in accordan ce with accepted medical practice, the provider dee ms such compliance to be medically inappropriate for the child; b) The particular requirements contradict state law, i ncluding laws pertaining to religious and other exe mptions. 4. I will maintain all records related to the VFC prog ram for a minimum of three years and upon request m ake these records available for review. VFC records include, but are not limited to , VFC screening and eligibility documentation, bill ing records, medical records that verify receipt of vaccine, vaccine ordering records, and v accine purchase and accountability records. 5. I will immunize eligible children with publicly sup plied vaccine at no charge to the patient for the v accine. 6. VFC Vaccine Eligible Children I will not charge a vaccine administration fee to n on-Medicaid federal vaccine eligible children that exceeds the administration fee cap of $21.93 per vaccine dose. For Medicaid children, I will acc ept the reimbursement for immunization administrati on set by the state Medicaid agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans. Non-VFC Vaccine Eligible Children I will not charge a vaccine administration fee to n on-Medicaid state vaccine eligible children that ex ceeds the administration fee cap of $21.93 per vaccine dose 7. I will not deny administration of a publicly purcha sed vaccine to an established patient because the c hild's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to pay the administration fee. 8. I will distribute the current Vaccine Information S tatements (VIS) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCV IA), which includes reporting clinically significan t adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). 9. I will comply with the requirements for vaccine man agement including: a) Ordering vaccine and maintaining appropriate vaccin e inventories; b) Not storing vaccine in dormitory-style units at any time; c) Storing vaccine under proper storage conditions at all times. Refrigerator and freezer vaccine storage units and temperature monitoring equipment and practices must meet Georgi a Department of Public Health, Division of Health P rotection, Immunization Office storage and handling requirements; d) Returning all spoiled/expired public vaccines to CD C's centralized vaccine distributor within six mont hs of spoilage/expiration 10. I agree to operate within the VFC program in a mann er intended to avoid fraud and abuse. Consistent wi th \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" as defined Revised 07/29/14 in the Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR \u00a7 455.2, and for the purpose s of the VFC Program: Fraud: is an intentional deception or misrepresentation m ade by a person with the knowledge that the decepti on could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other perso n. It includes any act that constitutes fraud unde r applicable federal or state law. Abuse: provider practices that are inconsistent with soun d fiscal, business, or medical practices and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, (and/or including actions that re sult in an unnecessary cost to the immunization pro gram, a health insurance company, or a patient); or in reimbursement for services tha t are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. It also includes recipient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid pro gram. 11. I will participate in VFC program compliance site v isits including unannounced visits, and other educa tional opportunities associated with VFC program requirements. 12. For providers with a signed deputization Memorandum of Understanding between a FQHC or RHC and the Geo rgia Department of Public Health, Division of Health Protection, Immunization Office to serve underinsured VFC-eligible children , I agree to: a) Include \"underinsured\" as a VFC eligibility categor y during the screening for VFC eligibility every visit; b) Vaccinate \"walk-in\" VFC-eligible underinsured ren; and c) Report required usage data Note: \"Walk-in\" in this context refers to any underinsure d child who presents requesting a vaccine; not just established patients. \"Walk-in\" does not mean that a provider must serve underinsured patients wi thout an appointment. If a provider's office policy is for all patients to make an appointment to rece ive immunizations then the policy would apply to underi nsured patients as well. 13. For pharmacies, urgent care, or school located vacc ine clinics, I agree to: a) Vaccinate all \"walk-in\" VFC-eligible children and b) Will not refuse to vaccinate VFC-eligible children based on a parent's inability to pay the administra tion fee. Note: \"Walk-in\" refers to any VFC eligible child who pres ents requesting a vaccine; not just established pat ients. \"Walk-in\" does not mean that a provider must serve VFC patients without an appointment. If a provider's office policy is for all patients to m ake an appointment to receive immunizations then th e policy would apply to VFC patients as well. 14. I agree to replace vaccine purchased with state or federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non-viable due to provider negligence on a dose-for-dose basis. 15. Pursuant to O.C.G.A.\u00a731-12-3, the vaccination data for every dose of vaccine administered by the clini c will be entered into the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS) within thirty (30) business days of the ser vice being rendered. 16. I understand this facility or the Georgia Departmen t of Public Health, Division of Health Protection, Immunization Office may terminate this agreement at any time. If I choose to terminate thi s agreement, I will properly return any unused fede ral vaccine as directed by the Georgia Department of Public Health, Division of Health Pro tection, Immunization Office. By signing this form, I certify on behalf of myself and all immunization providers in this facility, I have read and agree to the Vaccines for Children enrollment requirements listed above and u nderstand I am accountable (and each listed provide r is individually accountable) for compliance with these requirements.

This policy is designed to ensure: 1. Vaccine purchased with Vaccines for Children (VFC), federal and state funds are admin istered only to VFC- eligible and state-eligible recipients; 2. Vaccine loss and waste are minimized and measured; 3. The Georgia Immunization and VFC Programs are protected against fraud and abuse; 4. State, VFC and other federally purchased vaccines are ordered a ppropriately based on a provider's VFC-eligible and state-eligible populations. The increase in the number of ACIP recommended vaccines and a r ise in their associated cost s have prompted a renewed emphasis on program accountability at all levels. As part of th e enrollment and annual recertification processes for VFC and state vaccine programs, provi ders agree to comply with VFC and Georgia Immunization Program (GIP) requirements for ordering, storage, hand ling and accountability of vaccine t o avoid vaccine loss as outlined in the Georgia Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A). Providers als o agree to operate in a manne r intended to avoid vaccine fraud and abuse as outlined in the Georgia Vaccine Fraud and Abuse policy (Appendix B). Georgia will help ensure vaccine accountability in provider off ices by: 1. Using provider profiles to monitor provider orders; 2. Monitoring provider vaccine inve ntory levels to ensure adequate supplies of public and privately purchased vaccine for the population size served in provider offices; 3. Monitoring vaccine wastage and lo ss that occur in provider offi ces; 4. Monitoring provider activities to prevent and/or identify fraud and abuse against the VFC and state vaccine programs. 5. Providing clear guidance to providers regarding the return of e xpired and wasted public vaccine for excise tax credit. Using Provider Profiles to Monitor Provider Orders VFC Providers are required to submit supporting documents for t he enrollment estimates produced during VFC enrollment, re-enrollment, or annual re-certification with the VFC Program. Documentation is required to verify that submitted estimates are ba sed on previous years': 1. Doses administered, benchmarking , Medicaid and/or other billing data; or 2. IIS (GRITS) data. The VFC Logistics Associate will review a random provider sampl e on a monthly basis for accountability review purposes. Doses administered data will be reviewed over a 6 mon th span and data will be com pared to the providers submitted profile estimates. Aggregate vaccine data exceeding a nnual profile estimates identif ied during this will result in corrective action development and implementation as necessary, including vaccine replacement for unaccounted for doses. Page 2 of 3 Revised 4/15/2015 1. GIP staff contact providers that exceed profile amounts to dete rmine if distribution of additional vaccine is justified, or if adjustments to the profile are needed. 2. Future vaccine orders are adjust ed appropriately to ensure prov iders receive sufficient supply to serve their VFC or State-eligible population w ithout creating an increased risk for vaccine loss, fraud, and/or abuse. Monitoring of Provider Inventory Levels (Public vs. Private Sup ply) In order to receive vaccine from Georgia's VFC program, VFC-enr olled providers must comply with reporting requirements for vaccine usage in cluding: doses administered b y eligibility category, wastage, and inventory. Georgia uses the following methods as ways to monitor provider inventor y levels for both public a nd private vaccine supply: 1. VFC Program Representatives have been trained to routinely revi ew monthly comprehensive reports for excessive use, underreporting, over reporting and anything that may look out of the ordinary. 2. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provide r(s) and unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will res pond accordingly. Monitoring Vaccine Wastage and Loss The Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Program Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A) details the action taken by the Georgia VFC Program for identifying, monitoring an d management of incidents that result in loss of public vaccine. The action taken by the Georgia VFC Program will depen d on the category of the vaccine loss. For this policy, lost vaccines fall under three categories: 1. Negligence, 2. Non-preventable loss, and 3. Noncompliance. VFC staff use the CDC Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirement Protocol (algorithm) to address all vaccine loss policy violations. Continued violation of any section of this p olicy will result in termination from the VFC Program. Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Abuse in Provider Offices The Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Program Fraud and Abuse Policy (Appendix B) details the action taken by the Georgia VFC P rogram to provide programmatic direction for the prevention of fraud and abuse in the utilization of state-supplied a nd/or VFC-funded vaccine. The Fr aud and Abuse Policy is rev iewed annually and updated, as necessary. Training on fraud and abuse takes place as part o f new employee orientation. Additionally, program staff (VFC staff and Immunization Prog ram Consultants [IPCs]) receive s annual educational updates, led by the Deputy Director. Georgia uses the following methods as ways to detect and/or pre vent fraud and abuse of public vaccine supply: 1. Upon enrollment and on a monthly basis thereafter, provider inf ormation is cross-checked against the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the Department of Health and H uman Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General website. If located in th e Exclusion database, provider s are not allowed to participate in VFC. 2. VFC Program staff has been trained to routinely review monthly comprehensive reports for excessive use, underreporting, and anything that may look out of the ordinary. 3. Georgia Immunization Representatives are required to review wit h the provider a vaccine accountability statement representative of at least six (6) months, which can help identify areas of pot ential fraud and/or abuse. 4. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provide r, and unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will res pond accordingly. 5. Any individual, group, or practice who wants to report a suspec ted case of fraud and/or abuse, a dedicated Fraud and Abuse Hotline has been imple mented and is monitored by the Deputy Director. The Fraud and Abuse hotline number is (404) 657-5950. Reports must include (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Source of the allegation; 3. Source's name, address, and telephone number (if available) 4. A description of the reason for the report (suspected misconduc t/violation) 5. Specific VFC requirements violated; Page 3 of 3 Revised 4/15/2015 6. Value of vaccine involved (if available); 7. If the report was initiated in r esponse to a complaint, a copy and/or summary of the complaint and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 8. Success of educational intervention; and 9. A summary of the result of any pr eliminary investigation conduc ted by GIO staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. Once a report is received, the Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirements Protocol will be used to determine the appropriate follow up action. At the GIP, the Deputy Director is the person with primary resp onsibility for responding to suspected fraud and/or abuse. The Deputy Director will have aut hority to make decisions, refe rrals, and notifications when a ppropriate. In the event that the Deputy Director is not available, the VFC Coordinator will assume responsibility. In the event that neither of these individuals is available, the Program Director will assume resp onsibility. The Deputy Director (or designa ted respondent) will review all information submitted and initia te an internal investigation on all cases reported without sufficient evidence of fraud and abuse within five (5) busin ess days of the report. All suspected cases of VFC fraud and abuse will be forwarded electr onically to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office and CDC within ten (10) business days following disposition. MIG will conduct pre liminary investigations and, as warranted, transmit the re ferral to the appropriate oversight entity and will monito r the handling of the referral by entity. Process for Returning Expired and/or Wasted Public Vaccine All vaccine received from the GIP must always be accounted for. This includes doses administered and inventory as well as wasted and expired vaccine. Pr oviders are required to report doses wasted or expired on t heir Monthly Comprehensive Report which begins the processing of their return request and our excise tax credit process. Vaccine returns are approved by the Vaccine Logistics Associate. The Vaccine Logistics Assoc iate submits requests via VTrckS to McKesson for UPS return labels. Once returns are finalized in VTrckS, McKesson w ill ship UPS return label(s) dir ectly to the provider site. Providers are asked to box returns properly to ensure safe tran sit of the vials. Providers subm it return request monthly to ensure vaccines are returned with in 6 months following the date of expiration per VFC program requirements. The Vaccine Logistics Associate processes and screens each return t o ensure returned vaccines have been properly accounted for and determines if replaceme nt of the loss vaccine(s) are re quired according to Georgia's Vaccine Loss Policy. The Vaccine Logistics Associate ente rs all returns and wastage into VTrckS and e-mails a copy of the VTrckS Return Invoice to the provider. Providers are to place a copy of the return in voice(s) in the box with the appropriate vaccine return(s).Providers are reminded to mark expired or wasted vacc ine(s) \"DO NOT USE\" and store it securely and outside of the refrigerator to avoid acci dental administration of non-v iable vaccine. Vaccine return boxes should include: 1. Full vials or manufactured pre-filled syringes (no needle attac hed) of unused vaccine 2. Appropriate padding to protect vials from breaking 3. VTrckS Return Invoice (copy e- mailed from the VFC office) Vaccine return boxes should not include: 1. Needles or syringes with needles (vaccine that has been drawn i nto a syringe should be wasted on-site, not returned.) 2. Broken or partially used vials (including partially used multi- dose vials) 3. Paperwork or other re ports intended for VFC 4. Any other objects Page 1 of 5 Revised 3/18/2015 State of Georgia Immunization Office V A C C I N E S F O R C H I L D R E N ( V F C ) P R O G R A M Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A) This document will serve as the Ge orgia Department of Public He alth - Immunization Program's (GIP) policy for management of incidents that result in loss of state supplied v accines. The action taken by the Georgia VFC Program will depend on the category of the vaccine loss. For this policy, lo st vaccines fall under three cat egories: 1) negligence, 2) non-preventable loss, and 3) noncompliance. 2014 VFC Operations Guide Content Changes - Changes to vaccine restitution/replacement policies: Awardees with restitution policies must ensure that providers r eplace vaccine on a dose-for-dose basis only. Providers must not financially reimburse awardees for the cost of federally-purchased vaccine. Providers must submit receipt of purchase to the awardee within 90 days demonstrating that all doses were replaced appropriately Definitions: Spoiled - Vaccines that were refused or not administered for other reasons after preparation, or the vial/syringe has been broken or physically damage d during transport or preparation. Spoiled vaccines may or may not be eligible for retu rn, but providers are stil l required to report doses lost as a result of spoilage. Wasted - Vaccines that have been stored or handled under inappropriate conditions or loss as a result of refrigerator or freezer malfuncti on. Wasted vaccines are eligible for return to McKesson for excise tax credit. Category 1 Vaccine loss due to negligence is defined as, but not limited to, the following: a) Vaccines stored improperly (i.e., refrigerating vaccine that sh ould have been frozen, freezing vaccine that should have been refrigerated, or storing any vaccine in a dormitory s tyle refrigerator even for day use). b) Vaccines left out of refrigerator or freezer. c) Refrigerator or freezer unplugged. d) Door of refrigerator or freezer left ajar resulting in unit temperatures outside the acceptable range. e) Improper maintenance of recommended refrigerator and freeze r temperatures resulting in vaccine spoilage, including prolonged storage of vaccines when out of range tempe ratures are recorded. (Note: Temperatures recorded on temperature logs will be considered officia l in making vaccine viability decisions. Also, a thermometer's margin of error will not be considered wh en temperatures a re recorded at or below 35\u00b0F/2\u00b0C.) f) Pre-drawing or premixing vaccine, then not administering. g) Discarding vaccine prior to the manufacturer's stated expir ation date (e.g., discarding vaccine in a multi-dose vial 30 days after the vial is first used). h) Transporting/shipping vaccine with lack of or inappropriate coolants (e.g., packing refrigerated vaccines with dry ice or frozen vaccines with ice packs only). Page 2 of 5 Revised 3/18/2015 i) Failure to notify the VFC Program when provider office hour s change or the practice moves, resulting in vaccines being undeliverable and consequently spoiled. j) Failure to notify the VFC Program Vaccine expired due to fa ilure of the provider to notify the VFC Program three months prior to expiration date so that vaccine might be transf erred. Action Plan If the provider or GIP staff disc overs: vaccine not refrigerat ed or frozen within the recommended temperature range, vaccine left outside the refrigerator or freezer, the refrigera tor or freezer door left ajar, continued documentation of temperatures outside the recommended range, vaccine lost in tra nsit to a satellite facility, or vaccine undeliverable and spoiled due to a change in office hours, the incident must be r eported to VFC immediately. Vaccines should be kept in the appropriate storage environmen t (refrigerator or freezer) until a decision is made concerning their viability. Call 404-657-5013 and explain the circumstances to the Vaccine Logistics Associate. The Vaccine Logistics Associate will send the provider a copy of the Vaccine Incident Report form to complete, verify vaccine viability with the appropriate manufacturer and retu rn for further review of the i ncident. Be prepared to furnish the following information: a) Last known temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; b) Current temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; c) Duration of time the vaccin es were stored out of recommended temperature range; and d) Lot numbers, expiration dat es, and number of doses of all va ccines in question. Upon receipt of the Vaccine Incident Report, the Vaccine Logist ics Associate may contact the vaccine manufacturers and verify vaccine viability. The pr ovider may be required to purch ase dose for dose replacement of non-viable vaccines. Vaccine Logistics Associate will review the provider's vaccine shipment history for each vacc ine wasted to determine the need for replacement. The provi der will be required to replace VFC vaccine losses due to negligence when those losses are valued at more than 5 percent of the number of doses of VFC vaccines available to be admi nistered by the provider in the past 12 months. For example , VFC MMR shipped to a provider in the past 12 months totals 1,000 doses. A vaccine loss of 75 doses of MMR occurs. A 5% loss would equal 50 doses. In this case, the provide r would be required to purchase and replace 25 doses of MMR to be administered to VFC- eligible children. When replacement of lost vaccine is required: a) The provider must email, fax or mail copies of invoices for replacement vaccine to the VFC Program within 90 days following receipt of the VF C Vaccine Replacement Notice re ceived via e-mail from the Vaccine Logistics Associate; b) The assigned Immunization Program Consultant (IPC) will ver ify, by site visit, the replacement of the lost vaccines within 30 days following receipt of the replacement sh ipment; c) The provider must submit a description of the incident in w riting within 5 business days that discusses the circumstances of the loss and th e steps taken to ensure that va ccine is protected in the future; and d) The provider must ensure all wasted vaccine is returned to McKesson within 6 months following wastage or expiration (whichever date is earliest). When replacement of vaccine is not required: a) The provider will submit a letter describing the incident w ithin 5 business days that di scusses the circumstances of the loss and the steps taken to ensure that vaccine is protecte d in the future; and b) Vaccine shipments will be resumed upon receipt of the afore mentioned letter. Any vaccine that is deemed non-viable due to negligent circumst ances should be returned to McKesson following the VFC Vaccine Return Process. Information and instructions on re turning wasted/expired vaccine can be found via the web at http://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.ge orgia.gov/files/Vaccine_Retu rn_Policy_2015.pdf under the section titled 'Provider Resources'. Page 3 of 5 Revised 3/18/2015 Category 2 Vaccine loss due to non-preventable circumstances, such as: a) Area power outages due to severe weather or other unavoidab le and unanticipated causes. b) Refrigerator failure. c) Transport company error (i.e., FedEx or Drug Transport, Inc .) Failure of the provider to notify VFC of a change in office hours or address will not be considered a transport c ompany error. Action Plan If the provider discovers a power outage has occurred or the re frigerator storing vaccines has malfunctioned, the VFC program should be notified imme diately by calling 404-657-5013. Vaccines should be kept in the appropriate storage environment (refrigerator or freezer) until a decision is made concerning their viability (provider should enact their Vaccine Disaster Recovery Plan immediately if necessary). The V accine Logistics Associate will send the provider a copy of the Vaccine Incident Report form to complete, verify vacci ne viability with the appropriat e manufacturer and return for further review of the incident. The provider should be prepared to supply the following information: a) Last known temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; b) Current temperature of the refrigerator and freezer; c) Duration of time the vaccin es were stored out of recommended temperature range; and d) Lot numbers, expiration dat es, and number of doses of all va ccines in question. Upon receipt of the Vaccine Incident Report, the Vaccine Logist ics Associate may contact t he vaccine manufacturers to verify the status of the vaccin es. If the vaccines are determin ed to be viable, but the power to the office has not been restored or the refrigerator is still in disrepair, vaccines mu st be transported immediately to an alternate refrigerator/freezer and steps followed as noted in the provide r's Routine and Emergency V accine Handling Plans. If no plan is in place, the Vaccine L ogistics Associate will assist t he provider in determining a plan of action. Providers without a Routine and Emergency Vaccine Handling Plan will be required to develop and submit a copy of their plan within 10 business days to prevent interruption in shipment of public vac cine supply from VFC. Any vaccine that is deemed non-viable due to negligent circumst ances should be returned to McKesson following the VFC Vaccine Return Process. Information and instructions on ret urning wasted/expired vaccine can be found via the web http://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph. georgia.gov/files/Vaccine_Retu rn_Policy_2015.pdf under the section titled 'Provider Resources'. As soon as power is restored or a replacement refrigerator is a cquired, the provider should: a) Monitor and document temperatures of the refrigerator and free zer for 5 days. b) The assigned IPC will verify, by s ite visit, that the storage u nit is functioning properly and is adequate in size to accommodate safe storage of public supply within 1 0 days follow ing provider's notification that the above step has been completed. c) If adequate temperatures are maintained, replacement vaccines will be shipped to the provider from VFC. Category 3 Vaccine loss due to noncompliance with VFC written policies, such as: a) VFC vaccine not accounted for by monthly usage and inventor y reports. This can be reflected by usage data or inventory discrepancies that reflect lost vaccine supply. Examp les include the following: Failure to document doses ad ministered on usage log; Page 4 of 5 Revised 3/18/2015 Failure to document patient eligibility on usage log; Failure to report inventory; Inaccurate reporting of inventory; Failure to report expired/wasted vaccine; or Failure to report short date d vaccines 90 days prior to expi ration b) VFC vaccine knowingly administered to children who are not eligible for the VFC program, including the following: Administration of VFC vaccine to patients who are over 18 ye ars of age; Administration of VFC to every patient in the practice wheth er eligible or not (i.e., a provider discontinues purchasing private st ocks of vaccine for administr ation to patients whose insurance covers immunizations or to patients who can afford vaccine); Administration of VFC vaccine because the reimbursement rate of the child's insurance company is low; Administration of VFC vaccine to a child who is fully insure d (has insurance and vaccines are a covered benefit), including administra tion of VFC vaccine to a child wh o has not met their deductible in order to save the parent the cost of the deductible (a child is consider ed fully insured until the deductible has been met); or Administration of VFC vaccine to a child even though the ins urance company provides a flat rate of coverage for immunization for th e year (upon exhaustion of flat rate coverage, the child is then eligible for VFC vaccine). Failure to maintain separate inventories for VFC, Adult (sta te supplied if applicable), and privately purchased vaccine doses resulting in possible administration of state supplied vaccines to privately insured children. c) Accepting reimbursement from insurance companies or patient s for VFC vaccine as evidenced by: Administering VFC vaccine to a child and subsequently billin g the child's insurance for the cost of the vaccine; Charging the patient for the cost of the vaccine; or Charging a Medicaid recipient any fee at all. Action Plan If a provider is found to be in violation of written VFC polici es, the action taken will depe nd upon the policy violated, as follows: a) Vaccine unaccounted for in usage reports: Vaccine usage and inventory must be reported to the VFC offi ce monthly. Vaccine accountability statements will be processed and remitted to the provider. These accountab ility statements tell the provider what their vaccine losses have been over the current reporting period. If accountability statements indicate unaccounted for VFC va ccine in excess of 5% for any vaccine for 3 consecutive reporting periods: 1. The assigned IPC will be informed; and 2. A site visit will be conducte d before the next reporting pe riod to investigate possible reasons for the vaccine inventory discrepancies. Future vaccine accountability statements must reflect 5% or less of vaccine loss. Possible consequences include, but are not restricted to: 1. A decrease in shipment of VFC vaccine; or 2. Providers replacing unaccount ed for vaccines exceeding 5% o f the total number of doses of vaccine available to be adminis tered by the provider in the pas t 12 months. For example, if 10% of the provider's VFC provided Varicella va ccine is unaccounted for, then the provider may be asked to purchase 5% of the Vari cella lost as replacement vacci ne, or future shipments of Varicella will be decreased so that only the vaccine accounted for is replaced. Page 5 of 5 Revised 3/18/2015 Decisions concerning the consequences of having unaccounted for vaccine will be made after receiving input from the IPC, the Vaccine Logist ic Associate, VFC Coordinator, and the Deputy Director. b) VFC supplied vaccines knowingly administered to children no t eligible for VFC. The VFC Coordinator or Vaccine L ogistics Associate will notify the provider by letter detailing the following (when available): Name of child vaccinated; Date vaccine given; Each vaccine administered; Deadline for replacement of vaccine; Request for invoices for replacement vaccine; Request for action plan to prevent further misuse of VFC sup plied vaccine; and Notification of future chart reviews by assigned Immunizatio n Program Consultant. Upon receipt of written notifica tion, any infractions or contin ued administration of VFC supplied vaccine to children not eligible for VFC will result in termination from t he VFC. c) Accepting reimbursement from insurance companies or patient s for VFC supplied vaccine. Providers found billing insurance companies or charging patient s for state supplied vaccine will be notified of the infraction by letter from the VFC Coordinator or Vaccine Logist ics Associate. The letter will include the following: Name of child vaccinated; Date vaccine given; Each vaccine administered and billed; Deadline for replacement of vaccine; Request for invoices for replacement vaccine; Request for action plan to prevent further fraudulent billin g; and Notification of future chart reviews by assigned Immunizatio n Program Consultant. Continued acceptance of reimburse ment from insurance companies or patients for VFC supplied vaccine after receiving notification by letter will result in terminati on from the VFC Program. Reports from outside sources of fraudulent use of VFC supplied vaccine will be referred to the Deputy Director immediately. The assigned IPC will be asked to perform a site v isit and chart review within 5 business days of the report. Findings will be reviewed with the provider and reported to the Deputy Director. Any action to be taken will be decided after receiving input from the IP C, the VFC Coordinator, the Va ccine Logistics Associate and the Deputy Director. Page 1 of 4 Revised 04/15/2015 S t a t e o f G e o r g i a I m m u n i z a t i o n P r o g r a m VACCINES FOR CHILREN (VFC) PROGRAM Fraud and Abuse Policy (Appendix B) I. Background The purpose of this policy is to provide programmatic direction for the prevention of fraud and abuse in the utilization of public (state-supplied and/or Vaccines for Children [VFC]) fund ed vaccine. The Georgia Immunization Program (GIP) is required by federal granting authorities to implement vaccine f raud and abuse prevention policies. Vaccines supplied through GIP are funded through several federa l sources. For simplifica tion purposes, those funding sources can be divided into two p rimary groups: VFC and non-VFC funds. VFC funds may be used to purchase vaccine for children and adolescents who are birth through 18 years of age (less than 19), and who are: Medicaid eligible Uninsured (have no health insurance) American Indian/Alaskan Native Underinsured (have health insurance that does not pay for vacci nations), seen in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), or Rural Health Centers (RHC) Non-VFC funds are utilized to pur chase vaccines for children an d adolescents who are birth through 18 years of age (less than 19), and who are: Underinsured, seen in their medical home PeachCare for Kids \u00ae eligible Georgia VFC providers must adhe re to the vaccine usage constrai nts relative to vaccine funding. Providers must administer this vaccine only to the aforementioned categories o f adolescents and children. M isuse of state/VFC-funded vaccine may result in civil or criminal penalties. The Fraud and Abuse Policy will be reviewed a nnually and update d, if necessary. Training on fraud and abuse will take place as part of new employee orie ntation. Additio nally, progra m staff (VFC staff Program Consultants [IPCs]) will receive annual educa tional updates, led by the Dep uty Director. II. Definitions Fraud is defined by Medicaid as \"an intentional deception or misrepr esentation made by a pers on with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other pers on. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicab le federal or state law.\" Abuse is defined by Medicaid as \"provider practices that are inconsi stent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, [and /or including actions that result in an unnecessary cost to the immunization program, a hea lth insurance company, or a pati ent]; or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recogni zed standards for health care . It also includes recipient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid progr am.\" Examples of fraud and abuse include, but are not limited to, th e following: Providing VFC vaccine to non VFC non-VFC-eligible children; Selling or otherwise misdirecting VFC vaccine; Page 2 of 4 Revised 04/15/2015 Billing a patient or third party for VFC vaccine; Charging more than the established maximum regional charge ($21 .93) for administration of a VFC-funded vaccine to a federally vaccine-eligible child; Not providing VFC-eligible child ren VFC-funded vaccine because of inability to pay for the administration fee; Not implementing provider enrollm ent requirements of the VFC pr ogram; Failing to screen patients for VFC eligibility at every visit; Failing to maintain VFC records for a minimum of three (3) year s or comply with other requirements of the VFC program; Failing to fully account for VFC-funded vaccine through require d monthly reporting of doses administered, doses wasted, and inventory on hand; Failing to properly store and handle VFC vaccine; Ordering VFC vaccine or reporting vaccine usage in quantities o r patterns that do not match provider profile or otherwise involve over-ordering of VFC doses; Waste of VFC vaccine due to negligence. III. Compliance Assessment In order to receive vaccine from Georgia's VFC program, VFC-enr olled providers must comply with reporting requirements for vaccine usage in cluding: doses administered b y eligibility category, wastage, and inventory. Every vaccine order submitted is compare d to the most recent provider profile estimates, calculated by GIP, and approved by the provider. The provider profile is an estimate of the number of VFC-eligible children the provi der expects to see in a given year by eligibility category. Th ese estimates are entered into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)- developed Vaccine Management System (VACMAN). Aggregate vaccine orders exceeding annual profile data are identified by VACMAN. GIP staff contact providers that exceed p rofile amounts to determine if distribution of additional vaccine is justified, or if adjustments to the profile are need ed. Upon enrollment and on a monthly basis thereafter, provider inf ormation is cross-checked against the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the Department of Health and Human Serv ices (HHS) Office of Inspector General website. If located in the Exclusion database, providers are not allowed to participate in VFC. VFC Program staff has been trained to routinely review monthly comprehensive reports for e xcessive use, underreporting, and anything that may look out of the ordinary. In addition, IP Cs are required to review w ith the provider a vaccine accountability statement representative of at least six (6) mon ths, which can help identify ar eas of potential fraud and/or abuse. Vaccine over- and under-re porting will be reviewed with provider, and unexplaine d amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will res pond accordingly. VFC fraud or abuse determinati on is not a responsibility of GIP . However, GIP is required to report suspected VFC fraud and abuse to state and federal authorities. Unjustified, excess ive, and/or repeated discrepan cies between provider profile data, vaccine orders, and vaccine usage will be referred for fu rther investigation as is required of the program. IV. Referrals The GIP Deputy Director is the person with primary responsibili ty for responding to suspected fraud and/or abuse. The Deputy Director will have authority to make decisions, referral s, and notification when appropriate. In the event that the Deputy Director is not available, the VFC Coordinator will assu me responsibility. In the ev ent that neither of these individuals is available, the Program Director will assume resp onsibility. Should any individual, group, or practice want to report a susp ected case of fraud and/or abuse, a dedicated Fraud and Abuse Hotline has been implement ed and is monitored by the Depu ty Director. The Fraud and Abuse hotline number is (404) 657-5950. Reports must include (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Source of the allegation; 3. Source's name, address, and telephone number (if available) 4. A description of the reason for the report (suspected misconduc t/violation) 5. Specific VFC requirements violated; 6. Value of vaccine involved (if available); Page 3 of 4 Revised 04/15/2015 7. If the report was initiated in r esponse to a complaint, a copy and/or summary of the complaint and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 8. Success of educational intervention; and 9. A summary of the result of any pr eliminary investigation conduc ted by GIP staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. Once a report is received, the Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirements Protocol will be used. This protocol has two levels of formal education - secondary and tertiary. Each l evel requires a minimum amount of education intervention and follow-up. For a provider to successfully complete the Seco ndary Education process, the provider must have corrected the situation. Tertiary Education requires a full VFC compliance site visit, and the compliance issue must be resolved for the provider to be released from the educational i ntervention. For example, if an employee from a practice calls to report that the practice is failing to properly store vaccine, the IPC assigned to the p rovider will be notified that a storage and handling visit need s to be made. It is expected tha t the IPC will enter the provider into secondary education and take steps to resolve the issue, which may involve suspendi ng vaccine shipment until the s ituation is resolved. If the issue is not resolved the provide r will be entered into Tertiar y Education. If the issue rema ins unresolved, the provider has more than three instances with the same issue, or any allegatio n where it is discovered that a provider is billing Medicaid inappropriately (inaccurate servi ces, ineligible clients, etc.) , then the IPC will notify the Deputy Director immediately and provide the following information (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Specific VFC requirements violated; 3. Value of vaccine involved (if available); 4. If the report was initiated in r esponse to a complaint, a copy or summary of the complain t and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 5. Success of educational intervention; and 6. A summary of the result of any pr eliminary investigation conduc ted by GIP staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. The Deputy Director will review a ll information submitted. The Deputy Director will initiate an internal investigation on all cases reported with sufficien t evidence of fraud and abuse within five days of the repor t. All suspected cases of VFC fraud and abuse will be forwarded electronically to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office and CDC within ten (10) busi ness days following dis position. MIG will conduct preliminary investigations and, as warranted, transmit the refe rral to the appropriate oversight entity and will monitor the handling of the referral by entity. V. Allegation and Referral Database GIP will maintain a database to monitor and document all action s taken on allegations related to fraud and abuse of the VFC program requirements, including actions taken to address id entified situations. As requested, database will be made available to CDC. The following data will be collected for the database: 1. Provider's name (Medicaid ID if known); 2. Address; 3. Source of allegation; 4. Date allegation reported to program; 5. Description of suspected misconduct; 6. Specific VFC requirements violated; 7. Value of vaccine involved if available; 8. Success of educational intervention; 9. Disposition (closed, referred, entered into educational process ) of case; and 10. Date of disposition V. Resolution Determination of fraud or abuse is made by the appropriate over sight entity. Providers identified to be engaged in VFC fraud or abuse will be suspended from the VFC program. Reinstat ement to the VFC program will be contingent on the outcome of proceedings conducted by the appropriate oversight e ntity. Final resolution may include the following (not all-Page 4 of 4 Revised 04/15/2015 inclusive) interventions: reme dial education, recoupment of fun ds, reinstatement without penalty, or referral for criminal prosecution or civil resolution. Providers who have been cleared of suspected fraud due to excus able lack of knowledge will be required to work with IPC staff to complete corrective action training sessions prior to reinstatement to the progr am. Trainings may include: Provider Refresher, Vaccine Storage and Handling, and Vaccine A dministration. IPC will be r equired to document all steps taken and will have author ity to reinstate providers, whi ch will then be reviewed by the Deputy Director. In all cases, providers will be require d to submit a corrective action plan in which the practice will be expected to outline how to avoid a similar situation in the future. In those instances where provide r activities do not involve Med icaid or billing agencies, GIP will work with the provider directly within the VFC policy guidelines. This may include req uiring education, suspending vaccine shipments until corrective actions are taken, or termination from the VFC progr am. In any event that a provider's activities violate Medicaid requirements, the abovementioned notification steps wi ll be taken to inform MIG and OIG.

Children are only eligible for vaccines that are not covered by insurance. In addition, to receive VFC vaccine, underinsured children must be vaccinated through a Federally Qualified Health Cent er (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinic (RHC) or under an approved deputized provid er. The deputized provider must have a written agreement with an FQHC/RHC and the state/local/territorial immunization program in order to vaccinate these underinsured children. 2Other underinsured are children that are underinsured b ut are not eligible to receive federal vaccine through the VFC program because the provider or facility is not a FQHC/RHC or a deputized pr ovider. However, these children may be served if vaccin es are provided by the state program to cover these non-VFC eligible children. 3CHIP - Children enrolled in the state Children's Health Insu rance Program (CHIP). These children are considered ins ured and are not eligible for vaccines through the VFC program.

I will annually submit a provider profile represent ing populations served by my practice/facility. I w ill submit more frequently if 1) the number of adults served changes or 2) the status of the facility changes during the calendar year. 2. I will screen patients and document eligibility sta tus at each immunization encounter for AVP eligibility and administer 317 -purchased adult vaccine only to adults who are 19 years of age or o lder who meet one or more of the following categori es: 1. Have no health insurance; 2. Are underinsured: An adult who has health insurance , but the coverage does not include vaccines; an ad ult whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (AVP-eligible for non -covered vaccines only). Adults aged 19 years and older that do not meet one or more of the eligible vaccine categories (AVP el igible), are not eligible to receive 317-purchased adult vaccine. 3. For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider profile, I will comply with immunization s chedules, dosages, and contraindications that are established by the Advis ory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and included in the AVP program unless: a) In the provider's medical judgment, and in accordan ce with accepted medical practice, the provider dee ms such compliance to be medically inappropriate for the patient; b) The particular requirements contradict state law, i ncluding laws pertaining to religious and other exe mptions. 4. I will maintain all records related to the AVP prog ram for a minimum of three years and upon request m ake these records available for review. AVP records include, but are not limited to , AVP screening and eligibility documentation, bill ing records, medical records that verify receipt of vaccine, vaccine ordering records, and v accine purchase and accountability records. 5. I will immunize eligible adults with publicly suppl ied vaccine at no charge to the patient for the vac cine. 6.

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health FOREIGN TRAVEL INFORMATION 12. Travel Information - 11/2015 Foreign Travel Information 1In general, U.S. citizens who are up-to-date with regard to the ACIP recommendations do not need any additional immunizations. When advising individuals regarding foreign travel, recommend they check their immunization record to see if they are due to receive any of the vaccines routinely recommended by the ACIP. The CDC may recommend other vaccines and prophylaxis depending on traveler destination and kind of traveler (e.g. pregnant women, immunocompromised, etc.). Therefore, it is important that if you administer vaccines for travel purposes, you have a system for keeping current information regarding travel requirements for specific countries. These recommendations should be referred to for specific vaccine dosage and administration information and guidelines. Additional information resources are included under the Travel Resource Information section. How to Obtain Travel Vaccines The Georgia Department of Public Health does not purchase and distribute any vaccines or preventive medications that might be recommended for travel. Healthcare Providers must obtain these from the drug manufacturer. For direct travel from the United States only a few countries require certificates. No vaccinations are required for return to the United States. Travel Resource Information Travelers and immunization travel clinics may refer to the following resources when seeking information about recommendations and requirements: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Internet Address: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ CDC Health Information for International Travel (commonly called the Yellow Book) is published every two years as a reference for those who advise international travelers about health risks. The Yellow Book is written primarily for health professionals, but is a useful resource for anyone interested in healthy international travel. It can also be accessed online at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/yellowbook-home Epidemiology and Prevention Branch Department of Public Health Georgia Department of Public Health (404) 657-2588 Immunization Program Department of Public Health Georgia Department of Public Health (404) 657-3158 The embassies and consulates of the countries to be visited may be of some assistance, as well, especially if certain vaccines are required prior to entry.

Georgia Department of Public Health Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement for Public Health Nursing Practice June 2015 1 QUALITY ASSURANCE /QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FOR IMMUNIZATION PRACTICE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES INTRODUCTION The Georgia Immunization Program, under the Department of Public Health, produces an Immunization Program Manual based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations that outline the recommended Policies and Procedures for administering vaccines by registered nurses and for providing immunization services. An advisory committee consisting of district immunization coordinators and pediatricians, a state pharmacist and the Immunization Program management team, review and update the manual on an ongoing basis. Each district is responsible for having written policies and procedures for the administration of vaccines that have been reviewed and signed annually by the health director or their designee. Districts are encouraged to either utilize the Policies and Procedures outlined in the Georgia Immunization Program Manual and the current ACIP Recommendations, or to write their own which should be consistent with those outlined in these two references. PURPOSE The purpose of this quality assurance tool is to document the training /education expectations and the parameters of clinical practice immunization services. Use of this tool will help promote consistency in practice across programs on a statewide basis. Quality assurance will provide an opportunity to identify excellence in practice, as well as opportunities for improvement. The components of this tool may be used to conduct QA reviews of training programs, administration of vaccines by registered nurses. These reviews may be done by Public Health staff from either the local and/or state level. The credentialing, training, and education expectations, as well as the parameters of clinical practice for Licensed Practical Nurses in immunization services are located in Chapter 13 of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. This tool may be used when evaluating immunization services provided by Licensed Practical Nurses.

Attachment I 1 Revised June 2015 GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH G uidelines for Student Nurses Administering Immunizations for Clinical Experience in Public Health Settings The Department of Public Health supports the concept of providing student nurses meaningful and appropriate learning opportunities related to vaccine-preventable diseases and immunizations as part of their clinical experience. Administering immunizations to people in the community is a fundamental role for public health. Assessing the immunization needs of communities and individuals is an integral part of public health services. Public health assesses immunization status as a routine part of serving each individual receiving clinical service. Public health also monitors the immunization status of communities and the state and collaborates with private and public partners and community agencies to improve immunization levels. Because improving the immunization status of a community is such an important public health issue, the Department supports efforts to assure that student nurses receive planned opportunities to learn about this public health role, which may include clinical experience in the actual administration of immunizations, reviewing the data sources for monitoring immunization levels for communities and planning with community partners to improve immunization levels. The student learning experience related to immunizations should be planned to include the following: 1. The written agreement between the nursing school and the public health agency should clearly specify the responsibilities of public health and those of the nursing school, including a) Orientation to immunizations and vaccine preventable diseases prior to student beginning clinical experience (suggested training may be found at http://dph.georgia.gov/health-care-professionals) b) Who is responsible for clinical supervision of the s tudents; c) Who is responsible for overall provision of patient care; and d) Compliance with public health guidelines/policies/pr ocedures and documentation requirements related to immunizations. 2. The written agreement should specify that each stude nt is covered by liability insurance carried by the school.

STANDARD OPERATING GUIDELINES FOR MASS VACCINATION CLINICS Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics (REPLACE) Appendix A: Sample Vaccination/Administration Site Flowchart Appendices B1, B2, Vaccination Site Command Charts Appendices C1, C2, C3: Sample Clinic, District and State Vaccination Reports Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 10/2015 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 1Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Introduction Any mass vaccinating effort in response to a bioterrorism or naturally occurring event will require pre-event planning and coordination of vaccines, personnel, facilities, communication, and other support activities. The purpose of this annex to the Immunization Program Manual is to provide standard operating standards and generic templates for the vaccinating processes that meet State and federal laws related to mass vaccination clinics. The standards will include the following information to assist districts and local clinics in planning and including mass vaccination activities in their written emergency operations plan: Guidelines for the administration of routinely supplied vaccines Determination of need for mass vaccination clinic(s) Mass clinic goals Vaccine supply Storing and handling vaccines Authority to vaccinate Suggested roles and responsibilities Informed consent Documentation of vaccination Adverse events following vaccination Recommended references The templates included in the appendices are not meant to be all-inclusive and should be adapted according to the type of event and the number of persons that need to be served. In providing these standards , the assumption applies that districts have made arrangements for and have addressed the following issues in their written emergency operations plans: The securing of appropriate administration site facilities and medical supplies The provisions for staffing The addressing of liability, training and education issues The establishment of communication, security, transportation, and storage and handling procedures The establishment of guidelines for the requesting, obtaining, administration, and documentation of vaccines routinely provided to the districts and local health departments Standards for the Administration of Routinely Supplied Vaccines The standards for administration of vaccines routinely provided by the State Immunization Program outlined in the \"Recommended Schedule and Standards\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual should be followed and a written copy of this manual must be readily accessible to clinics. In addition, this manual may be accessed through the Georgia Immunization Program web site: http://dph.georgia.gov/immunization-section These standards are based upon ACIP Recommendations located on the following web site: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/vax _clinic.htm Clinics must be able to access the ACIP recommendations either as written copies located on site or through the above mentioned web site. In an emergency situation, a current hard copy must be accessible. If a district chooses to write their own guidelines, these standards must be consistent with the current information contained in the Georgia Immunization Program Manual and the current ACIP Recommendations. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 10/2015 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 2Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Determination of Need for Mass Vaccination Clinic(s) Prior to the implementation of a mass vaccination clinic(s), determination of persons/populations who are considered to be \"at risk\" and need to receive vaccinations should be done by state and local health officials based on epidemiologic surveillance, reporting information and current CDC and ACIP recommendations. Recommendations outlined in the current Georgia Immunization Program Manual and the following documents and/or web sites should be referenced regarding exposure to vaccine preventable diseases: Georgia Notifiable Disease Manual (Not available as a complete manual. Disease-specific fact sheets are available online at: http://dph.georgia.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases : (Click on specific disease to view fact sheet {i.e. Notifiable Disease: xxxxxx}) CDC Surveillance and Reporting of Vaccine Preventable Disease Manual at: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/index.h tml Current http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/ CDC Bioterrorism web site: www.bt.cdc.gov/bioterrism The need to establish a mass clinic(s) will be dependent upon the number of persons who need to be vaccinated and the accessibility of appropriate vaccination sites. Mass Clinic Goals The goal of a mass vaccination clinic should be to vaccinate with the appropriate vaccine(s) and provide accompanying education to persons who have been determined to be \"at risk\" by epidemiological surveillance, public health reporting and CDC/ ACIP recommendations. Other arrangements should be made to vaccinate or dispense medications to persons who are unable to attend the mass dispensing /vaccination sites. District and local plans should include estimates for how many persons can be vaccinated within designated time periods, utilizing a designated number of sites and stations at each site according to the current CDC recommendations. District and local plans should also address the dispensing of medication at a mass clinic site, since there is a possibility that administration of vaccine(s) and dispensing of medications may need to occur simultaneously. In this incidence, nursing protocols that are included in the current Nurse Protocol Manual and the Protocol Manual for Chemical and Biological Agents should be referenced. See Appendix A to this document for samples of Vaccine Administration /Dispensing Flow charts. Vaccine Supply The provision and distribution of vaccines routinely supplied to public health clinics from the State and federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program is outlined in the \"Vaccine for Children and Adult Vaccine Program Policy and Procedure\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. District and local clinics should assess current vaccine supplies, estimate the amount of vaccine(s) needed for response, and request any additional vaccine needed according to standards outlined by the State Immunization Program and CDC. Vaccine usage and supply inventories should be documented according to the standards outlined in \"Vaccine for Children and Adult Vaccine Program Policy and Procedure\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. In the event that an emergency situation may warrant the administration of vaccine(s) that are not routinely provided by the State or VFC program, the State Immunization Program, working in collaboration with Pharmacy, Epidemiology and Emergency Preparedness will follow CDC's guidelines for obtaining and administering vaccines. If an investigational new drug (IND) is recommended by CDC, guidance for requesting obtaining and administering this drug(s) will be obtained from the CDC and FDA and communicated to the districts. Storing and Handling of Vaccine(s) The storage and handling of vaccines that are routinely provided by the State and VFC is outlined in the \" Vaccine for Children and Adult Vaccine Program Policy and Procedure\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual and should be adhered to. The guidelines include instructions and templates for documenting storage temperatures and transporting vaccines if indicated. Guidelines detailed in the \"McKesson Vaccine Return Instructions\" for reporting short-dated vaccine, rotation of stock, and returning unused vaccine should be followed. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 10/2015 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 3Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Authority to Vaccinate Georgia law empowers certain licensed health professionals to administer vaccines. There are no provisions in the Code or in the state's rules and regulations that explicitly give individuals who are not licensed health care professionals the same authority. However, the Georgia Emergency Management Act of 1981 may be interpreted to provide non-licensed health care professionals the authority to vaccinate by deeming such individuals emergency management workers and volunteers that are engaged in emergency management activities. It also appears that this issue can be resolved through the rules and regulations process. DPH can develop a rule that specifically authorizes volunteers, who are not licensed health care professionals, to administer the smallpox vaccine. Various health professionals are currently considered to have the authority to administer vaccines under the Georgia Code due to their job duties, job descriptions, protocols, or delegation from a physician. Some of these professionals can only administer medications/drugs while under the supervision of another. Following is a list of health professionals followed by the statute that provides them with the authority to administer medications/ drugs, i.e. vaccinate: Physicians. O.C.G.A. \u00a743-34-20 \u00a743-26-32 (7). Registered Professional O.C.G.A. \u00a743-26-3 (6) and (8) and O.C.G.A. \u00a743-34-26.1 (b). Advanced Practice Nurses - Certified Nurse Midwife, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, Certified Nurse Practitioner and Clinical Nurse Specialist. O.C.G.A. \u00a743-26-3 (1), (6) and (8) and (PA). O.C.G.A. \u00a743-34-105 and Intern or Resident. O.C.G.A. \u00a743-34-26 (b)(5) and (b)(10)(A). Certified Emergency Medical O.C.G.A. \u00a731-11-54. Certified Cardiac Technicians. O.C.G.A. \u00a731-11-55. The Code does not give the following professionals explicit authority to administer drugs. Acupuncturists. O.C.G.A. \u00a743-34-62 (1) and (4) (acupuncture does not include administering drugs). Veterinarians. O.C.G.A. \u00a743-50-3 (5) (can only administer drugs to animals). Chiropractors. O.C.G.A. \u00a743-9-1 (2) (cannot use drugs). Dentists. O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a743-11-1 (5) and 43-11-17 (can prescribe drugs, but can only perform procedures in the oral cavity). Suggested Roles and Responsibilities District and local health departments written plans should include: Plans for recruitment, liability, training and use of personnel, including volunteers Detailed description of process of triage, registering and administering vaccine to appropriate individuals. Process should include venue specific roles and responsibilities for command and support personnel as outlined in CDC's Incident Command guidelines (See Appendix A) Lay out of clinic plan and flow chart List of supplies needed Plans to vaccinate first responders in a separate setting prior to implementation of a mass vaccination clinic, when indicated (i.e. smallpox) Plans for utilizing teams of personnel to administer and/or dispense medication to persons that would be unable to attend a mass clinic Plans for identifying persons who require personalized attention in the mass clinic setting due to physical, mental, or communication issues See Appendices B1, B2, B3, and B4 to this document for sample templates of Dispensing/ Vaccination Site Command charts and Appendices C1, C2 and C3 for sample templates of Clinic, District and State Vaccination Report forms. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 10/2015 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 4Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Informed Consent Prior to administering vaccines, informed consent should be secured. Consent for treatment is documentation that the person has been provided information about the purposes, risks, benefits, and alternatives for care. In Georgia, the legal definition of a person authorized to make a request for immunization is cited as the Georgia Medical Consent Law located in the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Title 31, Chapter 9, 12/2001. A copy of this law and an explanation of the informed consent process and the mandated use of current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) prior to vaccinating are located in the \"Informed Request Policy\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. The policies outlined in this section should be referenced and utilized by districts in conducting vaccination clinics. Documentation of Vaccination Required documentation of vaccine administration is outlined in the \"Informed Request Policy\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. Documentation of each vaccine administered and the receipt by vaccine recipients (or their parent or legal representative) of the current appropriate VIS is required in the vaccine recipient's medical record. Georgia law requires that vaccines administered to individuals of all ages must be documented in the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS). This legal requirement is referenced in the \"Requirements of Law\" section of the Immunization Program Manual. GRITS may be utilized as an individual's medical record of immunization. In addition, immunizations may be recorded on form number 25-IMM-002 E, \"Georgia Vaccine Administration Record\", which is located in the \"Informed Request Policy\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. When vaccines are administered in a mass vaccination clinic situation, each clinic is responsible for tracking, documenting, and reporting the number of doses of each vaccine administered during designated time periods. The Vaccine Site Coordinator is ultimately responsible for submitting summary reports of the number of doses administered to the District Command Site at the designated times. See Appendix C 1, \"Clinic Site Vaccination Report\" for a suggested tabulating template. In addition, each clinic site is responsible for tracking, documenting and keeping a record of the number of personnel working in the mass vaccination clinic. The District Command Site is responsible for collecting, tabulating, and reporting to the Georgia Immunization Program, the total number of vaccines doses administered in all of the sites located within their district for the time periods that have been established in collaboration with the State Immunization Program and the Emergency Operation Center (EOC). See Appendix C 2, \"District Command Site Vaccination Report\" for a suggested tabulating template. The District Command Sites should submit the total number of doses administered, requests for additional vaccine, and any other pertinent information as part of their \"Situation Report\" which is located on the web based EOC. See Appendix C 3, \"Georgia Immunization Vaccination Report\" for a suggested tabulating template. Screening for contraindications to vaccines shall be completed prior to administration of a vaccine. Sample forms (one for children and teens and another for adults) that can be utilized to screen for contraindications to the vaccines routinely recommended by ACIP and to document the screening process are located in the \"Recommended Schedule and Standards \" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. In the event of an emergency situation where an investigational new drug (IND) might be recommended by CDC, an IND consent form for off-labeled use must be utilized. In this instance, guidance and forms obtained from the CDC and FDA will be utilized and distributed to the districts. Adverse Events Following Vaccination Each district should utilize the guidelines outlined in the Nursing Protocols for Registered Nurses, Chapter 12, Emergency Guidelines, Policies, Procedures and Protocol located on the Georgia Public Health Nursing website at https://dph.georgia.gov/nurse-protocols or develop and utilize emergency protocols and procedures consistent with those outlined in the State Nurse Protocols. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Public Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 10/2015 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 5Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Any adverse reaction or event occurring after the administration of a routinely recommended vaccine should be documented and reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) according to the guidelines established in the \"Adverse Events Following Vaccination\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. VAERS is a national vaccine safety surveillance program. Reporting an event to VAERS does NOT file a claim for compensation. VAERS form can be downloaded at http://vaers.hhs.gov/index The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to compensate individuals whose injuries may have been caused by vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine use. VICP provides liability protection to both vaccine companies and health care providers. If there is an adverse reaction requiring medical treatment, that treatment should be paid for by the individual or their insurance company, not the administrator or the vaccine company. If the reaction is one covered by the VICP, an individual can file a claim with VICP. A civil claim can only be filed against the vaccine company and/or the vaccine administrator after first filing a claim under the VICP and then rejecting the decision of the Court. Information on VICP can be obtained from the VICP website http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html. Recommended References Current versions of reference materials should be readily accessible for individuals administering the vaccines routinely recommended by the ACIP. A listing of these references is located in the \"Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement for Immunization Practice for Public Health Nurses and Immunization Support Staff\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual.
