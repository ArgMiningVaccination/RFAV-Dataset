Herbal nootropics have become popular among those seeking a cognitive edge without resorting to synthetic compounds. Derived from the Greek nous (\"mind\") and trepin (\"to turn\" or \"to bend\"), the term \"nootropic\" was coined in 1972 by Romanian chemist and psychologist Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea. According to Dr. Giurgea, \"mind-bending\" nootropics are substances that enhance learning and memory, have neuroprotective effects and low toxicity, increase cognition under stress, and promote intercellular communication in the brain (Giurgea & Salama, 1977). There is a range of herbs and mushrooms that possess increasingly researched nootropic properties: they enhance memory and cognitive function, improve blood flow to the brain, and protect against degenerative effects. In this blog post, we'll delve into five of these fascinating herbs and mushrooms with brain-boosting properties, all supported by scientific research: Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) - one of the most well-known herbal nootropics, being primarily used to support healthy memory and to enhance cognition Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri) - the revitalizing \"herb of grace\" in Ayurveda has been used for its cognitive enhancing properties for ages Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea) - this \"golden root\" boosts endurance and stamina, both physical and mental Ashwaghandha (Withania somnifera) - this potent Ayurvedic adaptogen relieves stress and helps enhance clarity and focus Lion's mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) - a unique mushroom which has gained popularity for its neuroprotective and brain-boosting effects Ginkgo biloba: The Time-Tested Brain Booster Ginkgo biloba, often called a", "sitename": "Zen Maitri", "date": "2023-04-24", "cleaned_text": "Are you looking for a natural way to boost your brainpower?

It may have even have been saved from extinction by the Chinese, who revered the tree and planted it around their temples. Today, science backs up the plant's benefits for memory and concentration, its neuroprotective effects and its ability to improve microvascular circulation in the brain, concentration, and overall cognitive function. A 1999 clinical study showed pronounced effects of ginkgo administration on memory and cognition with participants experiencing a significant increase in speed of attention tasks ( [Rigney et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10441781/), 1999). In 2011, another trial with 410 dementia patients showed significantly improved cognitive test results for patients that took ginkgo compared to those who received a placebo ( [Ihl et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.2662), (Bacopa monnieri), a central herb in Ayurvedic medicine, has been relied upon for millennia for its memory-enhancing properties - among a host of other benefits. In 2001, a clinical trial demonstrated that Bacopa monnieri supplementation led to improvements in memory, learning, and cognitive performance in healthy individuals. Interestingly, the effects were more pronounced after 12 weeks of supplementation, suggesting that the benefits might build up over time ( [Stough et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002130100815), 2001). Rhodiola: The Stress Warrior for Mental Stamina Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea) is a powerful adaptogen that helps the body adapt to stress. This wonder herb boasts potential benefits for mental stamina and resilience. A 2003 randomized controlled trial among 161 participants found that Rhodiola could alleviate mental fatigue and improve cognitive function under stress. Participants experienced a significant reduction in fatigue and an increase in mental performance during stress-inducing tasks ( [Shevtsov et al.](https://doi.org/10.1078/094471103321659780), 2003). Ashwagandha: The Versatile Herb for Stress Relief and Cognitive Health [Ashwagandha](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/ashwagandha-capsules) (Withania somnifera) is another adaptogenic herb with a broad range of potential cognitive benefits - particularly by improving resilience to stress, which can impair mental clarity, alertness and focus. A systematic review of scientific literature has shown that ashwagandha administration can lead to significant improvements in anxiety or stress levels ( [Pratte et al.](https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2014.0177), 2014). Research conducted by Chandrasekhar and colleagues showed that Ashwagandha supplementation could reduce stress, anxiety, and improve cognitive performance in adults experiencing chronic stress. Participants reported a 44% reduction in perceived stress after taking ashwagandha for 60 days ( [Chandrasekhar et al.](https://doi.org/10.4103/0253-7176.106022), 2012). Lion's Mushroom: Fungi with Neuroprotective Powers Lion's Mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) stands out as a unique natural nootropic with potential neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties. A 2009 clinical trial found that Lion's Mane supplementation could stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF) production, supporting overall brain health. Notably, the study participants with mild cognitive impairment experienced improvements in cognitive function after taking Lion's Mane for 16 weeks ( [Mori et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2634), 2009).
