Students should refer to the information below and contact the appropriate licensing board to ensure they will meet the licensure requirements in the state(s) in which they intend to practice upon graduation. LACC's Doctor of Chiropractic program meets the educational requirements for licensure in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some states have requirements in addition to educational requirements. Prospective and enrolled students are encouraged to research licensure requirements for the state in which they intend to practice. Licensure requirements vary from state to state. Neither acceptance for admission into the program nor the subsequent earning of a Doctor of Chiropractic degree guarantees that a state or foreign country will grant a graduate a license to practice chiropractic. Each state and foreign country, through its legislative and administrative process, defines the standards of competency and scope of practice of chiropractic within its jurisdiction. For further information on each of the jurisdictions, please visit the Official Directory of the [Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Board](https://fclb.org/chiropractic-licensing-boards.php). Please note that licensure requirements are always subject to change. Although SCU will confirm the licensure requirements on a routine basis, we strongly recommend that you inquire with the licensing agency to confirm that you understand and will meet the requirements for licensure before enrolling in your program of choice. Additionally, while progressing through the program, we recommend that you check licensing agency requirements regularly to monitor whether they have changed in a manner that impacts your licensure plans. The following states require students to have a bachelor's degree, in addition to a D.C. degree, to obtain a license: |Curriculum Meets Licensure Requirements||Curriculum Does Not Meet Licensure Requirements||Unknown/Cannot Be Confirmed as Meeting| | | In states above indicated with an asterisk (*) - students must have completed a bachelor's degree prior to matriculating into the D.C. program.

Some of my favorite courses at SCU have to be the chiropractic procedure classes; those are the classes you get to hone in on your chiro skills, your palpation skills and ultimately work on the adjustments that make you a chiropractor. Those are the classes I feel enhance my knowledge the most and are some of the reasons I chose to become a chiropractor here are SCU. On top of chiropractic procedures classes, my favorite is the cadaver lab experience. The cadaver classes opened up my perception of what the human body is made up of. It allowed me to get an in-person perspective of how the body works and looks on the inside. I am genuinely thankful for those experiences because they opened and broadened my horizons to the human body and anatomy in general. The student body at SCU is unique. Everyone is open-minded and willing to talk to you and help you out. I love that I have found my main group of friends who have become my life support. I am also in numerous clubs, which have helped with networking and support; a great community to be a part of. \"I wanted to become a chiropractor after sitting in on a chiropractor lecture. Everything clicked, and I knew this was what I wanted to do. I came from a background where I wasn't a good student; I was at a low point, but SCU gave me a chance. I received help, support, resources, and tutoring. I now have the skills to succeed as a chiropractic student and as a leader on campus.\" Doctor of Chiropractic faculty, Dr. Sermeno, ensures you understand [the material] to the best of your ability. If he is presenting in a way you do not understand, he will present it differently so you can understand. I appreciate that. He is also in practice and brings that knowledge to the classroom, so we have an idea of what is happening in clinics and have real-life examples to learn from.\" If you have 90 credit hours or more and meet other admission standards, you are eligible for the Doctor of Chiropractic program.

Applicants who do not meet all standards may be admitted with the approval of the Dean; exceptions are made on an individual basis.

The Force Sensing Table Technology Lab helps enhance student training, expedite assessment of manual therapy skills, and improve treatment for patients. SCU's FSTT Lab improves clinician training by providing instant analytical information to students, something that cannot be directly measured from human patients. The force sensing technology is built into the tables, allowing students to practice adjustments on people, or practice on mannequins. The FSTTs are tools for chiropractic students to take advantage of and learn early on, where they need to develop. The FSTT shows students where they excel, and where they need to focus more attention. It shows them their speed, pre-load tension, if they recoil (meaning lose pre-adjustive tension) during the thrust, how much force they are delivering, their line of drive, among several other types of helpful feedback. The FSTT Lab helps students create good habits early on in their adjusting careers, which will make them better adjusters, as future chiropractors. This tool has the ability to give students the confidence they need to deliver the best care, through proper, effective adjustments. As a chiropractor, you'll have many career options available to you, including: In just about any setting, you'll work with people of a wide variety of ages, abilities and backgrounds.
