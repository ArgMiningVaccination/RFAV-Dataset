Our lifelong health and vitality depend on many factors including diet, physical activity, weight management, rest, stress management, exposure to toxins, and inherited genetic predisposition for disease or wellness. While some of these variables are beyond our complete control, breakthrough scientific research is revealing many ways we can influence\u2014and even control\u2014significant factors of aging and wellness. A long life full of vitality and healthy aging begins with providing your cells with essential nutrients and metabolic factors to help them perform optimally. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

NFR Item Hotline: +852 3197 6699The three to provide you with targeted levels of essential nutrients and powerful metabolic factors for optimal health, energy, and longevity.*4 www.doterra.com.hk PROTECT YOUR CELLS WITH POLYPHENOLS Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage and even destroy healthy, functioning cells and speed the aging process by compromising cellular DNA and other critical cell structures, including energy-producing mitochondria. Free radicals are a toxic byproduct of breathing and the metabolism of food. They also come from other sources, such as pollution, smoking, sun exposure, and exposure to radiation. All these free-radical sources can push oxidative stress beyond what the body can safely handle. Cellular free-radical damage is believed to play a major role in aging. Antioxidants are stable molecules that can neutralize free radicals. Some antioxidants are found in the foods we eat, particularly in fruits and vegetables, and some antioxidants are manufactured by the body. Most medical experts recommend that we increase our consumption of foods containing antioxidants. Polyphenols are a particularly powerful group of antioxidants that provide protection against free-radical damage to cellular DNA and mitochondria. They have a very high capacity to neutralize free radicals and have been studied for a number of longevity health benefits. Reducing oxidative stress to cellular DNA and other important cell structures supports healthy cell proliferation, function, and lifespan. DNA is the nucleic acid in cells that contains the genetic instructions for cell proliferation, specialized function, and lifespan. It is through the DNA that the instructions for life are stored and passed to new cells that make up tissues, organs, systems, and organisms. Disruption of normal DNA function can result in sub-optimal health. THE do-TERRA\u00ae LIFELONG VITALITY PROGRAM provides a concentrated source of powerful antioxidants.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Hotline: +852 3197 66996 www.doterra.com.hk REDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS Our bodies are made up of millions of cells that rely on complex chemical communication pathways to perform their many specialized and synchronized functions. When cells are under stress, especially oxidative stress, they respond defensively to reduce the stressor. This is an important and normal function of the body's immune system, which helps protect against threats to cellular health. Free-radical damage to critical cell structures can trigger a defensive response that, if left unchecked, can lead to a chronic state of defensive readiness and can have long-term health consequences. Many of the ingredients found in the do-TERRA\u00ae Lifelong Vitality Program have been shown to support a healthy oxidative stress response in cells.* The program also includes a blend of essential fatty acids and CPTG\u00ae essential oils that have been clinically demonstrated to support normal and healthy oxidative stress response in cells .* OXIDATION CELLULAR STRESS CELLULAR AGINGAcute cellular damage can trigger a defensive response in cells. Cells, tissues, and organs become more prone to oxidative stressors.Damaged cells can lead to unhealthy aging.Free radicals can damage cellular DNA, mitochondria, and other critical cell structures. 4 3 1 2 *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.to order 1-800-411-8151 7 INCREASE YOUR ENERGY AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL All energy for life is produced in tiny cellular structures called mitochondria in which food molecules and oxygen are combined to produce chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). As we age, the number of mitochondria per cell and their output efficiency can decline, resulting in decreased vitality and energy. Compromised mitochondria can also release more toxic exhaust in the form of free-radical molecules, which can further damage mitochondria, DNA, and other critical cell structures. Less efficient production of energy in cells can result in a decrease of physical performance and mental energy. Increasing our dietary consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols, can help protect mitochondria and other cell structures from free-radical byproducts of energy production in cells. Additionally, supplementing our diets with nutritional co-factors of energy production in mitochondria can support healthy production of cellular energy. The do-TERRA\u00ae Lifelong Vitality Program includes these antioxidant and energy cofactors.* Mitochondria : Sometimes described as micro power plants in cells, mitochondria produce the energy chemical adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that powers all cellular activity for life. Cellular mitochondria also play critical roles in other cell functions, including intracellular signaling, cellular differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. Mitochondrial energy functions can decrease with age or increased exposure to oxidative stressors. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
