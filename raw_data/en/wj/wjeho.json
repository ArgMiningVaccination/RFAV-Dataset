Because of the nutrient deficiency in today's food supply, it's vital to complement our nutrition with key supplements to support our bodies, aid disease prevention, and help us achieve optimal health. I include supplements in my personal wellness practice and recommend them to my patients. But what are the best holistic supplements for weight loss? Below, I share my eight top recommended supplements for weight loss. All of the supplements on this list provide important wellness benefits and also play significant roles in healthy weight loss and weight management. These are the exact same supplements I've included with my signature [weight loss program](https://drlaraweightloss.com/weight-loss-programs/awakening/). 8 Best Holistic Supplements for Weight Loss 1. Omega-3 Fish Oil Fish oil is one of the most beneficial supplements most people can take, period. If a patient is on a budget and can only afford one or two supplements at a time, I generally recommend fish oil be one of them. The oils of fatty fish are full of Omega-3 fatty acids, which help support a healthy body and mind in many important ways. To start, Omega-3s reduce inflammation throughout the body and brain. Obesity, like many modern diseases, is fed by inflammation. Reducing inflammation is an essential first step to healthy weight loss, and this is where fish oil shines. Fish oil is one of the most beneficial supplements most people can take, period. Learn more about the [benefits of Omega-3s](https://drlaraweightloss.com/2020/10/fish-oil-what-is-the-difference-between-epa-and-dha/) found in fish oil. As with all supplements, there are many different levels of fish oil quality available and it's vital to select a high-quality formula. Each serving of our pharmaceutical-grade [Awaken Supreme Omega-3](https://www.awakensupplements.com/collections/supplements/products/supreme-omega-3) provides 720 mg of EPA and 480 mg DHA in true triglyceride form. We source our fish from the pristine waters off the Chilean coast, one of the world's cleanest and most sustainable fish sources. 2. Vitamin D + K2 Many people are already aware of Vitamin D3's weight loss and wellness benefits. Vitamin D is a powerful metabolism optimizer that supports healthy thyroid function, proper glucose metabolism, and insulin resistance. What's less widely known is the [importance](https://drlaraweightloss.com/2020/11/why-should-i-take-vitamin-d3-with-vitamin-k2/) of taking Vitamin D with Vitamin K2. Taking Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K2 helps to ensure the calcium transported by the Vitamin D is absorbed by your bones where it's needed, rather than accumulating in deposits in your arteries. Many people are already aware of Vitamin D3's weight loss and wellness benefits...What's less widely known is the importance of taking Vitamin D with Vitamin K2. Many readily-available Vitamin D products on the market don't contain K2. That's one reason why we've created our own Vitamin D supplement. [Awaken K2 + D3](https://www.awakensupplements.com/collections/supplements/products/k2-d3) is a powerful combination of Vitamin with Vitamin K2 as MK-7. Awaken K2 + D3 is also superior to other Vitamin D supplements in testing and potency verification. Our supplements are routinely tested to ensure that each capsule is pure and contains 5,000 IU of Vitamin D. 3. Multi-Probiotic Our gastric biome\u2014 the collection of microorganisms that live in our digestive tract \u2014plays a major role in our metabolism. This makes a high-quality probiotic a \"must\" for healthy weight loss and weight management. Some gut bacteria create fat instead of energy and vital nutrients. Probiotics help promote the growth of gut bacteria that produce energy instead of fat. Some gut bacteria create fat instead of energy and vital nutrients. Probiotics help promote the growth of gut bacteria that produce energy instead of fat.

Rich Earth Greens Rich Earth Greens are shown to cleanse the digestive system, detoxify the liver, balance PH levels, support a strong immune system, enhance mental acuity, and increase energy.

Each serving provides your body with an optimal mix of nutrient-rich superfoods, sea vegetables, and nutritional grasses. 5. CoQ-10 CoQ-10 is a powerful antioxidant naturally found in every cell of the human body, where it protects cells from damage and produces energy. CoQ-10 supports a strong immune system, promotes weight loss, provides energy, and protects cells from damage by free radicals. The body's CoQ-10 production naturally diminishes with age. Obesity, other diseases, and medications also deplete the body of CoQ-10. [Awaken CoQ-10 300](https://www.awakensupplements.com/collections/supplements/products/co-q10-300) delivers a highly concentrated dosage of CoQ10 in a proprietary formulation for optimal absorption. 6. Calcium Pyruvate Calcium pyruvate supports healthy weight loss by boosting metabolism and energy levels and improving the body's ability to burn fat for fuel. Found naturally in the body, calcium pyruvate plays a significant role in energy (ATP) synthesis, fat metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Along with a balanced nutritional plan and exercise routine, this powerful fat-burner supplement can help minimize the amount of fat stored around the waist and other areas of the body. [Awaken Meta-Pyruvate](https://www.awakensupplements.com/collections/supplements/products/meta-pyruvate) empowers your body to release excess weight efficiently and effectively. Each capsule contains 750 mg of calcium pyruvate, giving your body the extra boost it needs to burn more fat. 7. Liver Detox To achieve optimal weight loss results, you must cleanse your liver.
