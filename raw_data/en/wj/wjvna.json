What you drag into your space after a bad day or all of those outside vibrations your guests bring in? And what about the remaining energy from those who lived in your home before you? Well, as someone who lives and works in a high-anxiety cluster-f*ck of a city like New York, I think about this a lot. I wanted to know what I (and you, my internet friends) could be doing to keep the energy in my home flowing, pure, and powerful. Naturally, I turned to [Lynsey Ayala](https://www.instagram.com/breadxbutta/), founder, creative director, and curandera behind [BreadxButta](https://www.breadxbutta.com/), the Brooklyn-based brand focused on the fusion of Puerto Rican and Caribbean remedies with organic healing products. Equipped with immersive experiences and community workshops, BreadxButta provides the remedios we all need. According to Lynsey, energy functions almost like dust and clutter\u2014it's easily collected. \"Your home surrounds your whole energetic being,\" says the Bronx native. Her advice? Treat the clean-up like a self-care regimen. We spend so much time thinking about routines: cleaning routines, organizational routines, health routines. Sadly, more often than not, the energy we maintain in our homes gets lost in this conversation. Lynsey reminds us that \"energetically clearing your home is an essential spiritual upkeep tool to maintain a sacred space.\" Remember that just like any other routine, there's no one-size-fits-all solution to keeping an energetically cleansed home. Be sure to pay attention to how your body reacts to your new practices\u2014ask yourself how you're feeling and take note. \"Some will resonate, some won't,\" Lynsey warns. \"Be open and experiment.\" Read on to hear what the energy worker had to say about the grounding importance of spiritual maintenance and my personal favorite topic (my friends can confirm), creating energetic boundaries. Clever: What are your tips for making your home an energetically safe place? Lynsey: If you are feeling called to energetically clear and protect your space, follow your intuition. Your intuition gently guides and shows you what you need. For some folks like myself, we begin with music and incense or resin burning. If your body wants to dance as you prepare to clear, put on your favorite dance track. If your vibration prefers to be more internal, find a great sound bath or binaural beat to play. These sounds combined with your intentions will begin to energetically shake up stagnant energies. Adding an element of smoke [like incense or different resins] will carry your intentions to the areas you direct it. Opening a window or door while you clear your space will also help usher out the old, creating space for new positivity. Clever: What can folks do to cleanse their own energy and keep the energy of others outside of their home? Lynsey: If we are spiritually clearing and maintaining our homes, we must also do the same for ourselves. How we treat ourselves is a mirror to how others treat us-we have to suit up accordingly. If we want to lighten our energetic load, we must get moving, if possible. Put down your phone, dance, walk, run, stretch, loosen your shoulders, unclench your jaw. Most importantly, breathe deeply as many times as you need to until your chest feels lighter and your mind feels calmer. Drink lots of water and speak intentions into it\u2014ask it to nourish your physical and energetic bodies. I often give myself a smoke clearing after a day of energy work with clients. I burn resin in a hanging bowl and surround my body with the healing smoke. I visualize the smoke removing anything that does not serve my highest good. Sometimes, spending time in the kitchen cooking a delicious meal and giving your body nourishment is the kind of spiritual connection you need at the moment. Rest, listen to your intuition, be patient and open. Clever: How can we keep the positive energy flowing if we live with a partner or roommate(s)? Lynsey: At times we can find ourselves being affected by energies outside of ourselves like the news, someone you live with, a rude person in line at the bodega...we can absorb all those energies, and sometimes it'll show up in how we exist throughout the day. Communication is always number one for me when it comes to keeping a healthy energetic balance, but I understand that in some situations, that is not always an option. Energetic boundaries are a great place to begin. If this person drains you energetically, decide what kind of boundaries you can maintain to protect your peace of mind. [Editor's note: I've found that by speaking clearly and directly, putting my self-care and mental health first, and understanding that my time is precious, I've been able to create sustainable boundaries with those around me.] Clever: We often see people start certain wellness and healing practices and then never actually keep up with them. Can you talk about the importance of maintenance? Lynsey: In chaotic times like these, spiritual maintenance is what will keep us grounded and connected to each other. Wherever you are, whatever your situation, try to find at least three minutes a day to dedicate to yourself. On my busiest of days, I use my morning shower as my meditation/intention-setting time. It's great to connect your spiritual practices to something you're already doing to ensure you're actually going to be there every day. Spend those few moments nourishing your spiritual body, asking your higher self and the universe to protect you from things that do not serve your highest good. Visualize, feel, smell, and taste how amazing and kick-ass your day will be. Clever: How can we clear our minds and detach ourselves from the day when we are working and living in the same space? Lynsey: I have been working from home for the past five years and had to learn how to create boundaries quickly. I was given great advice from an elder who did cleanings and readings from her home. She said to me, \"Start a daily work routine, keep your work out of your bedroom, and clear the space when you're done.\" She said that when we constantly work from our bed/room, when it is time to sleep our bodies can't tell the difference. After you are done working for the day, take a quick moment to clear your space. Light a candle, burn incense, and clean up. As you do so, visualize a light energetically clearing away your workload for the day. Lynsey's Energy Clearing Starter Pack If you are new to healing and are still building your relationship with your intuition, here are some great tools to start off with. 1. Words Speaking or writing your intentions and what you would like to energetically clear away will carry them directly to the universe. You can tell these stagnant energies to leave and begin to call in positivity. Speak into existence the kind of vibration and feeling you want to create in your home, and imagine how cozy and at ease your sacred space will be. Close your manifestation/visualization with \"and so it is,\" to put your energetic stamp on it and send it off. 2. Candle A candle signifies divine light. Setting an intention of clearing your space, speaking it aloud, and lighting a candle will direct any unwanted energies away. 3. Sound Put on your favorite record, jam out, sing and dance in your living room. Open your windows before you begin your sound clearing and set an intention for this sound to drive out any heavy energies. Call in positivity, light, and ease. 4. Smoke clearings I do not use white sage for home clearings\u2014it is an endangered plant, sacred to Native and Indigenous communities, and is in high demand because of trends and the lack of education on wild harvesting. Its power and medicine have been highly disrespected for many years. Instead, I use incense, resins, and more local, available plants from my home garden or farmers markets. Things like peppermint, bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme are some examples of great alternatives you can make a DIY bundle with. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. "}
