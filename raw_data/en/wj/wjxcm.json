This is often referred to as the mind body connection. Emotions and thought patterns can contribute to imbalances within the body, and therapies like visual imagery, meditation, yoga, and breathing are being used to reestablish balance and promote health. These therapies can all be valuable tools for increasing awareness of the body's biological processes, such as heart rate and breathing patterns, in order to help you become empowered to manage emotions and mitigate their neurophysiological impacts. A list of current research studies highlighting the mind body connection can be found at the University of Minnesota and Life Foundation. WHAT IS MIND-BODY THERAPY? Mind-Body Therapy is a mind body connection approach to healing that looks at a person as an integrated whole: mind + body + spirit. In contrast to traditional psychotherapy or \"talk therapy,\" which focuses on life history and the analysis of thoughts and emotions, the Mind-Body therapist incorporates these aspects, but also is interested in the relationship between a person's mental, physical, and spiritual experiences. Therapy sessions include the combination of traditional talk therapy and biologically based practices, such as: mindful movement, yoga therapy, walking in nature, mindfulness exercises, meditation, somatic awareness exercises, diaphragmatic breathing, relaxation exercises, guided imagery, and visualization. During our initial session, we will discuss your individual needs and therapy goals, while developing an individualized plan. Please be aware, Mind-Body Therapy is not for every client and/or clinical concern; thus, we will discuss in detail at the onset of therapy if this approach is an appropriate fit. WALK TALK THERAPY + TALK THERAPY Walk Talk Therapy is just like it sounds - the client and the therapist are outside walking during therapy instead of sitting inside an office. Many clients express feeling more relaxed compared to sessions in the therapy office. If you are looking for an alternative approach to traditional talk therapy, walk talk therapy may be the right fit for you. Walk Talk therapy may used for a variety of struggles, including: anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, life transitions, and more. SOMATIC THERAPY + TALK THERAPY Somatic therapy is a form of body-centered therapy that looks at the connection of mind and body and uses both psychotherapy and physical therapies for holistic healing. The theory behind somatic therapy is that the mind, body, spirit, and emotions are all related and connected to each other. Through developing awareness of the mind-body connection and using specific interventions like body scanning, somatic therapy helps you to release emotions stored within the body. "}
