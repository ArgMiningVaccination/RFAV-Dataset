METHODS We searched electronic databases and reference lists from database inception through May 20, 2020 for studies of adult populations examining health inequalities by race/ethnicity, SES, disability, or geographic location related to infectious disease epidem ics predating COVID-19 or disasters (KQ 2 only) in the United States. We abstracted data on study design, factors, interventions, and outcomes. Dual assessment of studies' full text, quality, and strength of evidence ( where applicable) was agreed upon by consensus using published criteria. RESULTS We identified 50 articles relevant to health inequalities in infectious disease epidemics in the United States predating COVID -19. We found 14 studies (16 articles) that examined potential mediating factors associa ted with health inequities, and 12 studies (3 articles) and 5 CDC expert panel reports that provide examples of interventions and lessons learned from previous epidemics and disasters to guide us forward in mitigating health inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. We also identified 20 studies that examined inequalities in H1N1 vaccine uptake and mediating factors, and 1 vaccine-related intervention study. To our knowledge, this is the first review of studies aimed at identifying both the fac tors that mediate health disparities in infectious disease epidemics and also potential avenues for mitigating then. Our conceptual framework was guided by the work of Quinn and Kumar, who considered the potential causes of epidemic influenza based on measures of exposure, susceptibility, and access to care as they applied to data collected in 2009 -2010 during the H1N1 pandemic. The framework points to proximal and distal determinants of disease burden with the ultimate goal of identifying potential points of policy and programmatic intervention. Across Key Questions, studies were heterogeneous in their operationalization of potentially mediating factors, populations, programs and interventions. Studies of potentially mediating factors generally , and those related specifically to H1N1 vaccine uptake specifically, were largely cross -sectional . Several included studies did not control for confounding variables or their methods were unclear ; however, many were well conducted and adequately reported. A few of the qualitative studies clearly reported their methodo logy and/or findings. However , more did not. We identified very few interventions or program evaluation studies specific to infectious disease epidemic s; most were focused on post- disaster need s or disaster preparedness. KEY QUESTION 1 . What factors contribute to disparate infection rates and health -related outcomes among different segments of the Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 2 population during infectious disease epidemics or pandemics in the United States? Our f indings related to mediators associated with differential exposure or the transmission of infectious disease were unsurprising. Despite looking across racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic status independently, the findings that disparities were related to societal -based structural and work -related factors, rather than individual factors such as hygiene and cleaning, were consistent across studies. We identified few significant differences in social distancing attitudes and intentions between groups. Instead, it was clear that the meaningful differences lay in the ability or inability to social distance. Only 1 study examining variables related to exposure to illness disaggregated the Latino population by language proficiency, and 1 additional study provided qualitative input in the form of stakeholder interviews. In contrast with other populations we examined, compared to either English-proficient Latinos or Whites, limited English- proficient Latinos (and/or migrant and seasonal farm workers) were at higher risk across both structural and work- related variable s measured (see Table 9). Susceptibility to illness played a major role in H1N1 severity and mortality; however, access to care ( ie, having a primary care provider or health insurance) did not. Significantly greater proportions of every racial and ethnic minority group reported having experienced discrimination while seeking healthcare, and many reported being less informed or were le ss prepared. Much of the literature guiding communication is dated due to advances in technology, and findings of proportionally high rates of trust in the federal governmental, particularly in AA/Black and Latino adults, may be out of date. KEY QUESTION 2. What interventions or intervention components have been used to reduce health inequalities (or identified in preliminary studies) in infectious disease transmission or health outcomes in disasters, or infectious disease epidemics or pandemics in the Uni ted States? Of the 12 studies that described interventions or intervention components, only 1 study examined effectiveness outcomes, while the majority described acceptability and feasibility of the studied interventions. We identified only 1 randomized control led trial and 1 longitudinal cohort study. While many focus on disaster preparedness and response, the interventions in this review often represent real world applications of CDC and expert panel re commendations. For instance, the positive effect that interpersonal, culturally appropriate education delivered by a community health worker can have on disaster preparedness in vulnerable communities validates the recommendation for using lay promotoras in delivery of health services, goods, and messaging in the case of a pandemic. These results could be translated into an intervention to reach vulnerable populations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of community engagement and partnership with community leaders was repeated often in expert-based recommendations, and was empirically grounded in some studies we examined. For example, 1 study found that African American clergy could be integral as community liaisons in facilitating the delivery of mental health services after Hurricane Katrina , and that churches could serve as sites for delivery of community -based services. These findings Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 3 mirror the recommendations of partnering with faith -based organizations and community leaders in order to \"allay distrust and ensure successful implementation of mitigation interventions in minority communities \" in the setting of an influenza pandemic. These recommendations support the use of such partnerships to lessen the disproportionate burden of COVID -19 in racial and ethnic minorities. While it is too early in the pandemic to expect a rigorous evaluation of the effect of faith-based partnerships on COVID-19 disparities, the popular media has already chronicled that such interventions are underway. The interventions described here emphasize that preparedness efforts must be prioritized and that marginalized communities must be included before disaster hits. Nevertheless, some of the lessons learned may be relevant to the current pandemic phase: months into the trajectory of pandemic response but prior to a safe and widely available vaccine or treatment. Proven preparedness interventions could also be considered for implementation now given the potential for future waves of COVID -19 or new epidemics to emerge. What remains missing from the studies in this review are examples of successful systems- level interventions that target the distal determinants of worse outcomes of influenza illness in vulnerable populations. This is despite evidence from the H1N1 pandemic that variables of exposure that occur at higher rates among these vulnerable groups, such as inability to take sick leave, can drastically affect disease rates. I n key stakeholder reports, we find multiple systems - level recommendations, such as liberal workplace leave and teleworking policies, wage freezes and childcare vouchers, and creating an ethical and equitable system for ensuring access to treatment and vaccination, particularly among the uninsured. T hese interventions may already be underway, and researchers and policymakers should actively test their impact on health disparities so that lessons learned may be applied to our current and possible future disease epide mics. INEQUIT IES IN H1N1 VACCINE UPTAKE, CONTRIBUTING FACTORS, AND INTERVENTIONS We identified 10 studies examin ing disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake in the US during the 2009-2010 flu season. We found moderate -strength evidence that vaccine uptake was lower in AA/Black than White populations from 4 of 6 studies presenting unadjusted data. We also found low-strength evidence of lower vaccine uptake for Latino populations, although there was some inconsistency in results. The evidence for Asian, AI/AN, and Pacific Islander populations compared to Whites was insufficient . Three studies looked at disparities by socioecono mic status ( SES) and provide low-strength evidence that lower- SES individuals were less likely to have been vaccinated. Lastly, a very small study of rural versus urban participants provided insufficient evidence for H1N1 vaccine uptake between those populations. There was no evidence by disability status (see Table i). Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 4 Table i.

Health insurance coverage and availability of/access to vaccines were both important factors. Also important were receipt of the s easonal influenza vaccine, vaccine -related safety and effectiveness beliefs, and perceived susceptibility to H1N1. Across all factors AA/Black adults, and often Latino and low SES adults as well, were at higher risk. We did not identify any studies of inter ventions specifically targeting disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake. However, the single vaccine intervention study we did find demonstrated greater Hepatitis A vaccine uptake in an ED setting after the implementation of an EHR alert system that informed providers of the patient's homeless status and prompted them to recommend vaccination during a regional outbreak. This sugge sts that EHR notification systems may be useful in increasing vaccination, and potentially could be used in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign to prompt providers to recommend vaccination, especially for vulnerable groups . CONCLUSION The literature examining health disparities associated with previous infectious disease epidemics, and in some cases disasters, may provide some guidance for the current COVID -19 response. Evidence consistently pointed to disparities in structural and work -related exposure to i nfection as underlying disparities, with the impact of comorbid conditions on susceptibility for more severe infection and higher rates of mortality playing a less certain role. Discrimination was reported more frequently by all racial and ethnic minoritie s. However, its impact on disparities during infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. African American/Black and Latino adults generally were disproportionately affected. However, Latinos with limited English proficiency were at especially high risk. The re is moderate -strength evidence that AA/Black adults were less Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 5 likely to receive a H1N1 vaccine, and low- strength evidence of lower vaccination rates for Latinos adults of lower SES. Advances in technology, and sociopolitical shifts over the past decade call into question the applicability of findings. Interventions and programs from the disaster literature bring to light recommendations for infectious disease response by the CDC and other experts. In order to better prevent widespread health disparities that emerge in the wake of the current and future disease epidemics, more research is needed on policy - and systems- level interventions and their effect on the distal determinants of poor health outcomes among vulnerable groups. Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 6 EVIDENCE REPORT BACKGROUND Health inequalities in the United States generally, and in Veteran populations specifically, are well documented.1,2 Infectious disease -related outbreaks create unique challenges, as they involve rapid transmission and may necessitate public health measures ( eg, social distancing, school, business and facility closures) that could inadvertently differentially impact disadvantaged populations, and potentially contribute to higher burdens of morbidity and mortality among certain populations. Since the first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were detected in the US in early 2020, the effects of the disease have varied greatly between and across regions and communities. Recent studies have shown poorer health outcomes for those of lower socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minorities and higher rates of hospitalization among African Americans/Blacks. 3-5 A study of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data examined COVID- 19 testing patterns and results from early February to early May, and found that African American/Black and Latino Veterans were more likely to test positive, regardless of underlying medical conditions and geographic location. 6 Similar disparities in health outcomes have been observed in past infectious disease outbreaks. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics had higher rates of hospitalizations and mortality in Illinois. 7 Patients of low socioeconomic status (SES) were also found to have higher odds of hospitalization in New York City.8 While it is early in the pandemic to know the true impact of the novel SARS - CoV2 virus on vulnerable populations, it is likely the US will be feeling the ripple effects of these unequal health outcomes for years. For this reason, research on the root causes and potential mitigating strategies of these disparities is crucial. The VHA places a high priority applying lessons learned from past experience to develop and target evidence -based interventions to mitigate health inequalities in the current COVID -19 pandemic and future epidemics and pandemics. THE CURRENT STUDY The scope of this review was refined through a process that included a preliminary review of published peer-reviewed literature and iterative discussions with our operational partners. Our approach is guided by existing frameworks used to describe: 1) health inequalities specifically related to infectious disease epidemics 9,10 and 2) healt h inequality research generally.11-13 The conceptual framework we adapted was initially developed in 2008 by Blumenshine et al14 to describe the mechanisms through which inequalitie s in influenza health outcomes occur, and was later adapted by Quinn, Kumar, et al to describe evidence from the H1N1 pandemic.9,10 Factors contributing to inequalities are cat egorized into the following domains: 1) exposure ( eg, structural factors such as working and living conditions; work- related factors such as the inability to work from home or fear of job loss; and other factors related to childcare or public transportatio n), 2) susceptibility ( eg, existing chronic conditions), 3) access to care ( eg, lack of a Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 7 regular healthcare provider, insurance, or ability to pay co-insurance or copays), and 4) experiencing health -care related discrimination (see Figure 1) . We expanded the model to add hygiene and health -related behaviors to the exposure category, broadened discrimination to go beyond experiences of interpersonal mistreatment and include community discrimination, as well as trust in healthcare systems and government, and added a category to take into consideration information and knowledge . We categorized studies based on the framework initially developed by Kilbourne in 2006, 11 and later refined by Saha13 and Thomas.12 This framework describes 3 types of health inequality research. First generation studies are those that identify health inequalities, second generation studies examine mediating and moderating factors that may contrib ute to inequalities for any given group/population, and third generation studies examine interventions to mitigate or reduce inequalities. The aims of this evidence synthesis are to : 1) examine existing literature of infectious disease pandemics or epidemi cs predating COVID-19 to better understand the potentially modifiable factors that may have contribute d to differential infection rates and health outcomes; and 2) identify interventions that have been used to mitigate and reduce health inequalities in pas t infectious disease pandemics, epidemics, or disasters. KEY QUESTION S The Key Questions (KQs) for this study are: KQ1: What factors contribute to disparate infection rates and health -related outcomes among different segments of the population during infe ctious disease epidemics or pandemics in the United States? KQ2: What interventions or intervention components have been used to reduce health inequalities (or identified in preliminary studies) in infectious disease transmission or health outcomes in disa sters, or infectious disease epidemics or pandemics in the United States?

Organizational Framework D ev eloped by Quinn, Kumar, and Colleagues Note. Framework was developed by Quinn, Kumar, et al.9,10 SEARCH STRATEGY We searched MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through May 20, 2020. Searches included controlled vocabulary terms ( eg, MeSH), along with free- text words, related to previous epidemics, pandemics, disasters, and health disparities. We reviewed the bibliographies of relevant articles and contacted experts to identify additional studies. Search strategies were designed and conducted by an experienced systematic review/medical reference librarian with input from the investigators (Appendix 1). We further refined search results by performing keyword searches in EndNote (X9.3.3) to exclude articles that are not studies ( ie, errata, comments, replies, proposals), basic science studies and studies of animals, studies that are not of infectious disease pandemics or epidemics relevant to the US, and studies of only non- US state or territory populations. Titles and abstracts excluded via keyword search were confirmed by an investigator. LANGUAGES We searched for English- language publications. Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 9 METHODS INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA Criteria for population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting (PICOTS) were developed in collaboration with our operational partners (see Table 1). We included studies of adult populations examining health inequalities by race/ethnicity, SES, disability, or geographic locati on related to infectious disease epidemics predating COVID-19 or disasters (KQ2 only) in the United States. To examine the effectiveness of interventions, we include d studies with a comparison group (pre-, other-, or no intervention). We also included studies that would help to identify potentially important components and strategies to target in future interventions. I n preliminary searches we found very little intervention effectiveness literature . Given the immediacy of the pandemic and the need to ident ify even potentially relevant information that might help guide intervention development we were more inclusive. For these studies ( eg, cross -sectional surveys, qualitative), no comparator was required . SCREENING PROCESS A single reviewer screened titles and abstracts, and 2 reviewers independently assessed the full text of studies for inclusion based on pre- specified criteria. All discordant results were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer. Articles meeting eligibility criteri a were included for data abstraction. OUTCOMES SELECTED For all key questions, we examined outcomes related to the utilization and the quality of healthcare, health outcomes, and outcomes that were a result of measures implemented during a n infectious dis ease pandemic/epidemic that may have impact ed a health outcome ( eg, job loss due to social distancing mandates). RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each study using established methods for each study design. For trials, we adapt ed criteria established by the Cochrane Collaboration.15 The Newcastle- Ottawa scale16 was used for observational studies, and we used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Checklist for qualitative studies. 17 Disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer.

Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 12 SYNTHESIS For studies examining proximal and distal factors that may contribute to h ealth inequalities during infectious disease epidemics predating COVID -19, we qualitatively synthesized the evidence and present it in tables organized by the framework we adapted from Quinn, Kumar, and colleagues.9,10 We organized studies examining interventions designed to mitigate health inequalities according to whether they were an individual or system focused intervention. We summarized findings from expert panel interviews and present them in tabular form. We identified a number of studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake, factors associated with differential rates , and interventions to mitigate inequities in vaccination. We qualitatively synthesized the evidence from these studies and present them after Key Question 2. ASSESSING THE OVERALL BODY OF EVIDENCE For studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake we assessed the overall strength of evidence for each population using a method developed for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Evidence -based Practice Centers (EPCs). 18 The AHRQ EPC method considers study limitations, directness, consistency, precision, and reporting bias to classify the strength of evidence for individual outcomes independently for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, with supplemental domains of dose- response association, plausible confounding that would decrease the observed effect, and strength of association, as well as separate guidance for applicabil ity. 19 Ratings were based on the following criteria: High = Very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has few or no deficiencies, the findings are stable, and another study would not c hange the conclusions. Moderate = Moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has some deficiencies and the findings are likely to be stable, but some doubt remains. Low = Limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has major or numerous deficiencies (or both). Additional evidence is needed before concluding either that the findings are stable or that the estimate of effect is close to the true effect. Insufficient = No evidence, unable to estimate an effect, or no confidence in the estimate of effect for this outcome. No evidence is available, or the body of evidence has unacceptable deficiencies, precluding reaching a conclusion. We did not assess the strength of evidence for factors related to disparate infection rates, health - related outcomes (KQ1), or vaccine uptake due to heterogeneity, nor did we assess SOE for interventions (KQ2), as our approach to the intervention literature was exploratory.

We identified 14 studies (1 6 articles) that met criteria for Key Question 1. All but 2 studies focused on factors that potentially contributed to health disparities during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Other studies examined the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbr eak, 44 or planning for future infectious disease epidemics.63 Six studies examined both African American/Black and Latino populations.10,30,32,40,44,59 Two studies examined Asian populations,50,59 and 2 focused on American Indian/Alaska Natives.37,59 Five studies examined participants with limited English proficiency (LEP), 4 were of Latino populations,10,47,57,63 and 1 of Chinese immigrants.66 Five studies ( 6 articles) examined persons with low SES,8,30,42-44,59 and 1 study was of Veterans with spinal cord disorders30 (see Table 2 ). We have organized findings in this section to report: 1) associations between demographic characteristics ( eg, race/ethnicity, SES) and hypothesized mediating risk factors ( eg, exposure, susceptibility); 2) associations between risk factors and outcomes ( eg, influenza- like illness, hospitalization); 3) evidence of mediation of associations between demographic chara cteristics and outcomes by hypothesized risk factors; and 4) findings from qualitative studies. Exposure Structural Three studies examined structural factors of exposure. 10,40,57 Two nationally representative cross- sectional studies examined measures of density by race and ethnicity . After controlling for socio demographics, the studies by Kumar et al (N = 2,042)40 and Quinn and colleagues (N = 1479)10 both found that compared to White s, AA/Black and Latino (both English-speaking and those with Limited English Proficiency [LEP]) participants were more likely to live in apartments and metropolitan areas. Both studies also found that AA/Black participants had a similar number or fewer children per household than White s, and Kumar and colleagues found that Latino families reported significantly more children per household than White s. 40 Quinn et al disaggregated Latinos by language and found that while English -speaking Latino participants reported fewer children per household, Latino participants with LEP reported more.10 Kumar et al also examined the relationship between structural factors and the likelihood of a self-reported influenza like illness (ILI) in both the participant and their household. They found the number of children in a household was positively related to the likelihood of ILI in the household (OR = 1.10, 95% CI NR). Neither apartm ent nor metropolitan living were related. 40 No studi es directly addressed the role of structural factors of exposure in mediating disparities in epidemic- related outcomes. The third study, by Schoch-Spana et al, was a qualitative analysis of interviews with stakeholders from government agencies, community health clinics, advocacy groups, and academia engaged in work related to H1N1 and Latino migrant and seasonal farmworkers (N = 33). Study methods were no t well described. S takeholders acknowledged that labor camp living conditions, with 10-Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 26 12 people or 2- 3 families sharing small cabins, inhibited compliance with official H1N1 containment guidance (see Tables 2 and 3 for more detail).57 Work -Related The same 3 studies also looked at work -related exposure factors. The studies by both Quinn and colleagues10 and by Kumar et al40 used a work -related social distancing index that assessed the ease or difficulty of staying home from work if needed (eg , paid sick leave, ability to work from home), and found that c ompared to White s, AA/Black participants were similar ly40 or better able to social distance.10 Kumar and colleagues found that Latinos were less able to social distance.40 Examining the role of LEP , Quinn and colleagues found that there was no difference between English- speaking Latinos and White s, but that Latinos with LEP reported more work -related barriers to social distancing.10 Kumar and colleagues40 also examined the rel ationship between work- related factors and self - reported ILI and found an 8% increase in the likelihood of an ILI in the participant and a 6% increase for each unit increase in the social distancing index. No studies directly addressed the role of work -related exposure factors in mediating disparities in epidemic- related outcomes. Findings from Schoch-Spana and colleagues' qualitative study suggest that Latino migrant and seasonal farmworkers have numerous barriers to staying home from work. As a result it is not uncommon for them to go to work when sick and also to take their (sick or well) children with them (see Tables 2 and 3 for more detail). 57 Social Distancing Four studies ( 5 articles) examined measures of social distancing by race, ethnicity, and SES.10,40,42,43,59 Across studies, findings comparing AA/Black and Latino to White participants were inconsistent. Two studies found that AA/Black participants were similar to White s or were more likely to social distance ( eg, avoid public transportation, air travel, social gatherings, people with flu -like symptoms).40,59 However, Quinn et al found that AA/Blacks reported being more dependent on public transportation.10 One study found that Latinos were better able to social distance.59 However, both Quinn et al10 and Kumar and colleagues40 found that both English-speaking Latinos and those with LEP reported more barriers to social distancing than White s. Quinn et al found that AA/Black and Latino participants with LEP reported more difficulty than White s in securing childcare that wasn't with a group of children. However, English-speaking Latinos and Whites were similar. 10 Only 1 study (N = 2,355) examined Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations and found that both groups were as or more likely than White s to avoid social gatherings, air travel, and public transportation, and to avoid people with flu- like symptoms during the H1N1 epidemic.59 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 27 Two studies ( 3 articles) examined the relationship between SES and social distancing and also reported conflicting findings.42,43,59 One was a cross- sectional study (reported in 2 articles) of the H1N1 epidemic (N = 1569) that found no association between educational attainment and \"staying home,\" social distancing (including using public transportation), and the reduction of contact with non-household members. 42,43 The other found that participants with less than a high school education were more likely to avoid social gatherings, air travel, and public transportation but less likely to avo id people with flu -like symptoms. 59 Kumar and colleagues examined the relationship between dependence on public transportation and self -reported ILI in the self and household. No differences were reported (see Table s 2 and 3). 40 No studies directly addressed the role of social distancing in mediating disparities in epidemic - related outcomes. Hygiene -Related Behaviors Two cross- sectional studies (3 articles) examined hygiene-related behaviors during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.42,43,59 Findings were consistent that participants with lower education attainment were as or more likely than those with some college or college graduates to report adhering to recommended cleaning and hygiene practices during H1N1 ( eg, frequen t handwashing, hand sanitizer, coughing with mouth covered, cleaning more frequently). One study compared White to AA/Black, Latino, Asian, and AI/AN participants. R acial and ethnic minority participan ts were no t significantly less likely to report following recommended cleaning and personal hygiene practices (see Table s 2 and 3 for detail). 59 No studies examined associations of hygiene- related behaviors with epidemic -related outcomes, or the role of hygiene- related behaviors as mediators of racial or socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Susceptibility One cross- sectional study examined comorbid conditions associated with susceptibility to H1N1 complications and found that AA/Black, English- speaking Latino participants, and Latino participants with LEP all had similar or fewer comorbid conditions than White s.10 Two case control stud ies examined the relationship between comorbid conditions associated with suscept ibility to H1N1 complications and patient outcomes. One study (N = 374) was conducted in New York City, and looked at the impact of both education and neighborhood poverty on hospitalization for H1N1 . It found that overall, adults with 1 or more comorbid conditions associated with susceptibility to H1N1 complications were significantly more likely to be hospitalized. (OR = 12.83, 95% CI [4.99-32.97]). In a model adjusted for education and access to care, adults with 1 or more comorbid conditions remained more likely to be hospitalized (AOR = 7.61, 95% CI [2.68-21.65]). Comorbid conditions (and access to care) only partially mediated the relationship between education and hospitalization. After adjustment, compared to adults with some college or more, both adults with less than or equal to a high school education (AOR = 21.21, 95% CI [5.32-84.53]) and high school graduates (AOR = 3.82, 95% CI [1.64-8.90]) wer e still more likely to be hospitalized. 8 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 28 The findings were similar for the relationship between neighborhood poverty and hospitalization. After controlling for access to care and the percentage of residents below the federal poverty level (FPL) in a neighborhood, adults with 1 or more comorbid conditions were 10 times more likely to be hospitalized (AOR = 10.05, 95% CI [3.65-27.64]). After adjusting for comorbid conditions (and access to care) adults from neighborhoods with 30% or more residents under the FPL remained 5 time s more likely to be hospitalized (AOR = 5.02, 95% CI [1.83-13.89]). 8 The second case control study (N = 381) found that although American Indian/Alaska Natives were nearly t wice as likely to die from H1N1 (OR = 1.95, 95% CI [1.03-3.68]), comorbid conditions and age mediated the relationship and AI/AN race was not an independent risk factor for H1N1 mortality.37 Access to Care Findings across a disparate array of studies were mixed in terms of the association among race/ethnicity, SES, access to care variables, and health outcomes. Three cross- sectional studies 10,59,63 and a qualitative study57 examined factors related to access to care during H1N1. Findings indicated that AA/Black and English- speaking Latino participants were no different from White s on an access to care index measure (see Table 3). However, Latinos with LEP scored significantly lower.10 In addition, controlling for demographics, access to healthcare, and H1N1 -related attitude s, AA/Black, Latino , and AI/AN participants were more likely than White s to have spoken to a doctor or other healthcare professional about how to protect them selves or their families from H1N1. There was no difference for Asians or low SES participants.59 Other studies found that among LEP Latinos, a primary reason for not having medication on hand in case of an influenza pandemic was a lack of health insurance. 63 (see Table s 2 and 3). One additional study examined the relationship between measures of access to care and hospitalization for H1N1 in New York City. Findings indicated no difference in hospitaliza tion when comparing adults with and without health insurance (OR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.12-1.49]). However, people with private (versus public) insurance were less likely to be hospitalized (OR = 0.15, 95% CI [0.07-0.32]). T here was no significant relationship between having a primary care provider and hospitalization for H1N1 (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.35-2.18]). In a model adjusted for participant education and comorbid conditions , the relationships between having a primary care provider (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI [0.50-7.05]) and having health insurance (AOR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.14-3.70]) and hospitalization for H1N1 remained nonsignificant. When adjusting for access to care (and comorbid conditions) , compared to adults with some college or more, both adults with less than o r equal to a high school education (AOR = 21.21, 95% CI [5.32-84.53]) and high school graduates (AOR = 3.82, 95% CI [1.64- 8.90]) were more likely to be hospitalized. The findings were similar for the relationship between neighborhood poverty and hospitalization. After controlling for comorbid conditions and the percentage of residents below the federal poverty level (FPL) in a neighborhood, neither having a primary care provider (AOR = 1.50, 95% CI [0.42-5.30]) nor health insurance (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI [0.09-2.04]) were significantly associated with hospitalization. After adjusting for access to care (and comorbid conditions ) adults from neighborhoods with 30% or more residents under the FPL were 5 times more likely to be hospitalized (AOR = 5.02, 95% CI [1.83-13.89]). 8 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 29 A qualitative study of migrant and seasonal farmworkers found that ingr ained barriers for low healthcare utilization such as lack of money for care, lack of insurance or ability to access public assistance, lack of knowledge of migrant health clinics, lack of Spanish and indigenous language materials and support at health centers, lack of transportation, and fear of deportation , would likely impede treatment for H1N1. 57 Discrimination and Trust One cross- sectional study10 and 1 qualitative study57 examined experiences of discrimination in health care settings. Findings indicated that compared to White s, AA/Black, and Latino participants (both English- speaking and LEP) were more likely to have ever experienced discrimination when seeking health care.10 Three cross- sectional studies32,53,67 and 1 qualitative study47 examined trust in the government and government agencies regarding the handling of H1N1. Findings indicated similar or highe r government trust scores among AA/Black and Latino participants,53,67 and that AA/Black and Latino participants were more likely than White s to trust the Federal Government specifically, including President Obama specifically, with no difference for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or state or local governments. 32 There was no difference in trus t by SES (see Tables 2 and 3).32 No studies examined associations of discrimination or trust with epidemic-related outcomes, or the role of discrimination and trust as mediators of racial or socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Findings from a qualitative study suggests that AA/Black participants were unsure who to trust with regard to H1N1 due to mixed messages in the media and by government officials. 47 Another found that providers-stakeholders reported knowledge of stigmatization directed towards Latino migrant and seasonal farmworkers by other providers. F or example, 1 participant reported overhearing a colleague say, \"People [are] coming from Mexico and they're bringing in the swine flu \" (see Tables 2 and 3). 57 Information and Knowledge Five cross -sectional studies examined factors related to information and knowledge of pandemics predating COVID-19. A study of Veterans with spinal cord injuries (N = 3,384) found that, compared to White s, fewer AA/Black and Latino Veterans, and fewer l ow SES participants reported receiving \"adequate\" information about H1N1.30 Another study asked respondents about the MERS outbreak and previous pandemics. AA/Black and Latino participants were similar to White s in their awareness of previous pandemics; however, participants with lower SES (education) had less awareness. Both AA/Blacks and Latino participants were less likely than White s to have heard of MERS, and AA/Black participants were less likely to have accurate knowledge about MERS. There was no difference by SES for having heard of or having accurate knowledge of MERS (see Table 3 ). 44 Two studies exa mined information and knowledge by English proficiency. A small cross- sectional survey of Latinos in a rural setting in California (N=209) compared English -speaking Latinos to LEP Latinos and found that those with LEP scored lower on an influenza pandemic Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 30 preparedness scale.63 The second was a study of Chinese residents in Seattle. It found that compared to those with better English skills, LEP part icipants were less likely to feel well informed about H1N1. Commonly used channels for information among LEP participants were TV (including Chinese-language channels; 81%), Chinese-language newspapers (69%), and community -based organizations (30%; see Tab le 3 for more detail). The study did not control for confounding variables. 66 A study (N = 1,569) examined H1N1 knowledge and misconceptions by SES (education), and found that after controlling for sociodemographics and communication behaviors, there were no differences on an H1N1 transmission knowledge and misconception index. However, even after controlling for confounders, participants with less than a high school education were more likely than those with a college degree to avoid eating pork products. 42,43 No studies examined associations of information and knowledge with epidemic -related outcomes, or the role of information and knowledge as mediators of racial or socioeconomic disparities in outcomes.

What interventions or intervention components have been used to reduce health inequalities (or identified in preliminary studies) in infectious disease transmission or health outcomes in disasters, infectious disease epidemics or pandemics in the United States? We included 12 studies that described interventions or intervention components to reduce health inequal ities or health outcomes related to infectious disease epidemics pre- dating COVID-19 or relevant disasters. The 12 studies included 4 studies (5 publications) of individual-focused interventions 28,29,48,52,55 and 8 studies (9 publications) of systems-focused interventions.20- 22,36,46,49,64,65,50 Only 1 study28 describes intervention effectiveness outcomes, while the majority described acceptability and feasibility of the studied interventions. We found only 1 randomized control led trial and 1 longitudinal cohort study among those included. The remainder of the papers reviewed were program ev aluations or studies to inform future interventions with resulting recommendations. Table 4 provides study details. We additionally included 5 papers presenting expert recommendations from CDC key stakeholder meetings on pandemic influenza preparedness in vulnerable populations convened in 2008 (see Table 5) . 23,58,60,62 Individual -Focused Interventions and Programs Four studies (5 papers) featured interventions focused at the individual level. One longitudinal cohort study aimed to improve emergency preparedness among a low- income Latino community. Participants (N=231) were randomized to receive either culturally tailored information se nt by mail or to participate in discussion groups led by a community health worker. The discussion groups arm reported better disaster preparation post- intervention than the mailer -only group. 28 In a subsequent publication, the authors attributed the success of the emergency preparedness discussion groups to the use of targeted outreach provided by community- based organizations and the use of clear, consistent, culturally appropriate messaging. 29 A poor-quality, small (N = 50) , unblinded randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility of an automated call -monitoring system to detect H1N1 symptoms among low-income pregnant women. In addition to an individualized health education session, the intervention group received daily calls with prompts for yes or no responses for H1N1 symptoms. Participants who responded \"yes\" were transferred to a nurse midwife, and a same -day appointment was scheduled. Findings indicated that the intervention was feasible. There was no difference between groups in prenatal care visit attendance. One participant in the intervention group experienced H1N1 symptoms and received immediate intervention. Nearly all (93.3%) women in the intervention group recommended a similar system in future health crises. 48 Another paper describing a program evaluation analyzed differences in completion rates by race/ethnicity of a post -disaster web -based mental health intervention. The intervention included a baseline interview and mental health screen, after which participants (N=1 180) were directed to relevant online modules addressing PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, marijuana abuse, alcohol abuse, and smoking. The evaluation found that rates of access, use, and completion of the intervention did not differ between African -Americans, Latino s, and White s. 52 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 40 Finally, a program evaluation examined an intervention to train migrant and seasonal farmworkers in disaster preparedness through 2 workshops utilizing the Community Emergency Response Team curriculum.55 Results showed that the intervention was feasible and the workshops were highly rated by participants (N=22), but challenges existed with reaching recruitment goals. An outcom es evaluation revealed lessons learned includ ing the need for partnering with stakeholders and accounting for participants' work schedules and language needs in planning the training (see Table 4) . System-Focused Interventions and Programs Eight studies (9 publications) focused on system- level interventions to improve emergency preparedness and response. These are categorized below as either program evaluations 36,46,49 or studies to inform future interventions 20-22,50,64,68. Program Evaluations A qualitative evaluation of a program that aimed to increase efficacy of counseling provided to ethnically and culturally diverse populations after a natural disaster used a critical consciousness approach to train psychology graduate students (N = 6). 36 The authors found that the experience increased participants' cultural competence and social -justice oriented perspective. While effects on the care the students provided were not directly evaluated, this training potentially increased their efficacy at serving a majority African American community. In a paper by McCabe et al, 46 the authors describe a disaster/emergency preparedness training for lay communities in a rural region of Maryland with the goal of enhancing capacity o f rural emergency response through a systems-based partnership between faith-based organizations, local health departments, and academic institutions. A post- intervention assessment demonstrated an increased understanding among participants (N = 178) of community disaster and mental health plans and increased self -efficacy to execute these plans. It also showed the feasibility of recruiting from local health departments and faith -based organizations, and potential for scale -up of the training program. Another publication49 described a program evaluation of a University of Nebraska Medical Center cross -agency rural health system response simulation exercise for communities in rural Nebraska. The exercise highlighted system weaknesses that included difficulties with backup communication, lack of knowledge around how to request additional medical staff and assets or to make patient transfer requests, the need to develop coordinated public messaging, and deficits in intra -agency coordination, for example not initiating a report of a notifiable disease. Overall, the program demonstrated the utility of functional exercises for testing regional disaster response coordination. Studies to Inform Future Interventions A qualitative study consisting of 41 interviews with pastors of African American churches in Southern Mississippi recommended that mental health professionals build relationships with churches prior to disasters and work to engage and empower pastors and congregants, building trust. Through these partnerships, mental health services could potentially be brought to the communities during disasters, increa sing access. 21,22 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 41 In a different study, a situational analysis was c ompleted of emergency preparedness of diverse communities in California. The analysis was conducted via a literature review, an environmental scan of organizational websites, and key informant interviews (N = 17). It showed that there is a need to better e ngage diverse communities in all stages of disaster preparedness and response, mitigate stigma and fear, build cultural competence, and better coordinate information and resources when planning for community disaster preparedness. 20 In Person et al (2004), the study team performed a situational analysis of stigmatizatio n of Asian communities in the United States during the SARS pandemic in 2003. The analysis included group discussions with key informants (N = 70) from 50 different organizations, monitoring of the CDC public response service hotline, and a scan of Asian -language information services. Results demonstrated significant stigmatization and misinformation related to SARS. Important recommendations gleaned from these findings included the need to develop simple, tailored SARS prevention messages and materials in various Asian languages and to disseminate SARS information through multiple and culturally appropriate channels, including (but not limited to) community visits and town hall meetings. In Wyte- Lake , 64 7 interviews were conducted with Home -based Primary Care ( HBPC ) providers to explore issues regarding emergency management planning for homebound patients. The qualitative analysis showed that a lack of standardized policies and procedures and unclear designation of provider responsibility resulted in inconsistent preparedness among HBPC Veteran s. Recommendations included better training of providers to assist their patients in disaster preparedness, and formalization of the preparedness evaluation and intervention process. One additional study evaluated use of a disaster preparedness assessment tool among homebound Veterans enrolled in HBPC. 65 The assessment tool was deployed with patients at 10 HBPC sites in 8 states (N = 754) over a 3-week period. Results showed that in general, providers were teaching basic skills of disaster preparedness to their most vulnerable patients. Evacuation planning was the most commonly covered topic, and V eterans in the high - or medium -risk categories were more likely to receive preparedness information than those in the low -risk category (see Table 4) .

Goodman, 200936 N = 6 Culturally Competent Disaster Response mental health students AA/BlackCultural competence program; 8- day outreach experience providing disaster response counseling services, accompanied by journal and processing with peers and faculty supervisor Results highlighted: Participants demonstrated increased critical consciousness and social -justice oriented perspective. Also, increased cultural competence and understanding of its importance in counseling. They integrated this understanding into their personal and professional identities. Developing cultural competence of disaster response counselors can be achieved throughoutreach experience with processing using a critical consciousness lens. A critical consciousness- bas ed approach could be useful in training counselors to provide culturally competent counseling to vulnerable individuals who experience trauma related to COVID -19.

Participants completed a baseline telephone interview and, based on survey results, were directed to a series of online modules including depression, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, alcohol abuse, marijuana abuse, and cigarette smoking. Engagement was assessed based on 3 types of attrition. Results highlighted: Non-use attrition of the internet intervention (completed baseline telephone interview but did not access website): No difference between White s and AAs (OR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.43) or (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 0.76 to 2.29) Dropout attrition for access of intervention modules (a ccessed website but did not complete modules) : No difference between White s and AAs (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 0.63 to 3.29) or White s and Latino s (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.32 -1.74) Intervention module completion at trition (failing to complete a module after having accessed a module): No difference between White s and AAs (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.36) or White s (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.86 -1.67). Bottom line: Rat es of non- use attrition, access attrition , and completion attrition did not differ between AAs, Latino s and White s.

Aten, 201021 Aten, 201122 N = 41 Post Disaster Mental Health Disparities AA/BlackPastors of churches in South Mississippi affected by hurricane Katrina participated in semi - structured interviews 1 year after the storm. Results were synthesized to provide recommendations for fostering collaboration between African American religious leaders and mental health professionals towards better serving minority communities. Results highlighted: Need for pastor education on effects of disasters on mental health, referral services,stigma towards receiving mental health services and providers Need for collaboration between AA churches and mental health professionals to performmental health assessments Need for collaboration to provide consultation activities to help churches better prepare fordisasters ( eg, evacuation plans) Need for clinically focused activities offered by mental health professionals in theaftermath of a disaster; Possibility through collaboration for bidirectional referrals; rather than churches only referring to providers, providers could also refer to spiritual resources.

Provider recommendations: (1) training to focus on better strategies to get patients to participate, (2) more consistent time spent on patient education, (3) formalizing the initialassessment to actually evaluate how prepared patients are, and (4) having emergency preparedness be formally addressed on a more consistent basis, possibly in the annual interdisciplinary review of each patient. HBPC providers are uniquely positioned to provide education and intervention around disaster prep aredness to vulnerable patients. This could include provision of education about COVID - 19.

These meetings were held in 2008, with reports published in an American Journal of Public Health supplement in 2009. Experts were convened around the following vulnerable groups: publicly housed, single parent families, low income families, racial and ethnic minorities, migrant farm workers, and immigrants and refugees. One paper addressed communicatio n strategies to vulnerable populations in general (see Table 5) . In Bouye et al, 23 the expert group highlight ed the ways in which poverty makes those who are publicly housed, part of single parent households, or low wage earners more susceptible to a pandemic outbreak. Early implementation of community mitigation strategies we re considered paramount to halt the spread of infection. The ways in which these strategies are disseminated was also considered important, as wa s the need for education and communication strategies to account for the distinction in cultures, lifestyles, and behaviors of these groups. The panel recommended engaging community liaisons in devising education campaigns as being essential to their success. Many of the strategies discussed hinge on preparedness planning prior to the onset of a pandemic, which would build community partnerships, establish an emergency communication plan, initiate appropriate education and training programs, and plan for advocacy for policy and program change to better enable mitigation strategies (eg , flexible work policies, home delivery services). Another expert group meeting report 39 looked at the effect of influe nza on racial and ethnic minorities. The experts point ed to evidence for an increased rate of comorbid conditions, increased rate of complications, inferior vaccine coverage, and higher rates of poverty as factors that may have contributed to racial/ethnic minorities having been disproportionately affected during past influenza pandemics. Similarly to Bouye et al,23 possible solutions they propose d hinge on tailored educational strategies and strengthening of public health infrastructure. The group emphasized the importance of involving racial and ethnic minorities at all stages of planning and prevention in order to address the socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic, and educational barriers that may prevent community mitigation and vaccine delivery. Steege et al 58 argued for the need for a distinct approach to protecting migrant farm workers against pandemic influenza. Migrant workers constitute a unique group in that they risk contracting disease due to their exposure to animals. Furthermore, working conditions and cultural or linguistic barriers may make an influenza outbreak more likely among this vulne rable group. Mitigation strategies focus ed on delivery of timely prevention and treatment of influenza. Two other recommended strategies included the use of mobile clinics and lay community health workers. Given that workers may delay seeking care due to f ear of legal repercussions, establishing trusting relationships with service providers to enable care delivery wa s considered important. Immigrants and refugees share important risk factors with the aforementioned vulnerable groups. 60 This group may be more at risk for pandemic influenza due to factors including higher rates of chronic conditions, lower seasonal influenza vaccine rates, and linguistic or cultural barriers. In the case of undocumented immigrants, they may be reluctant to seek care due to fear Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 49 of detention or deportation, similar to migrant farm wo rkers. The authors propose d a multi- level approach to risk mitigation, with strategies that are household- focused ( eg, remaining home while ill), vaccine provision), and agency- driven ( eg, effective communication). This expert group also emphasize d involvement of the target group in all preparedness planning and communication. One final paper62 focused on general communication strategies to vulnerable groups during an influenza pandemic. They recommended that communication strategies b e tailored to the phase of the pandemic and that they be situation specific. For example, schools, workplaces, and public gatherings all require different communication strategies. Like the other expert panels, they emphasized the importance of linguistica lly and culturally appropriate communication. A participatory approach was considered important to the development of communication, with dissemination to be best done in partnership with community organizations, faith- based organizations, or other trusted intermediaries (see Table 5) .

All messages, materials, and documents should be culturally sensitive, match the language proficiency of targeted individuals, and be responsive to the changing conditions and needs of the audience as the crisis unfolds. Vaccines: Communications that address concerns arising from values, beliefs, and cultural traditions, and that feature spokespersons who are credible from the perspec tives of targeted populations, will be more persuasive in disseminating information about vaccine effectiveness and safety. Social distancing: Pre-pandemic planning and communications need to identify ways to make actions feasible and communications credible. PPE: Affordability, accessibility, availability, and appropriateness are real considerations for v ulnerable populations. Equally important are language considerations and ensuring that instructions on how and when to use PPE ( eg, masks, gloves) are cle ar and workable.

We identified 20 studies examining health inequalities in H1N1 vaccine uptake , factors associated with vaccine uptake, an d intervention to address disparities in vaccine uptake. H1N1 Vaccine uptake There were 10 studies of H1N1 vaccine uptake.24,25,31,34,38,51,54,56,59,61 Racial and ethnic differences , comparing minority groups to White s, were examined in the majority of studies. Nine studies reported on AA/Black participants, 8 on Latinos, 2 of Asians, and 1 each of Pacific Islande rs, and Asians and Pacific Islanders as a combined group. Differences in vaccine uptake by participants with lower versus higher socioeconomic status were examined in 4 studies, and 2 studies looked at participants' uptake based on rural versus urban status. All but 1 study51 used self-reported vaccinatio n status, as opposed to status obtained from health records. Eight of the 10 provided data on H1N1 vaccine uptake that was unadjusted. Studies that reported adjusted rates controlled for a variety of factors, not consistent across studies. As such, we rate d our strength of evidence for H1N1 vaccine uptake based only on unadjusted data. Afterwards we report the findings of adjusted models where applicable. By Racial/ Ethnic Group Affiliation Seven studies 31,34,51,54,56,59,61 provide evidence examining vaccine uptake in AA/Black versus White participants. Of these, six31,51,54,56,59,61 reported unadjusted data and contribute to moderate -strength evidence of lower H1N1 vaccine uptake in AA/Blacks. Four of the 6 studies found that AA/Black participants were less likely than White s to be vaccinated with the H1N1 vaccine.51,54,56,61 In a large (N = 55,850), national cross -sectional survey study, 17% of AA/Black participants reported receiving the H1N1 vaccine compared to 26% of White s (P<0.05).56 Another (N = 4,040) national study showed similar results (14% vs 20%; P = 0.02),61 as did a Los Angeles (LA)-area survey study (N = 1,541; OR = 0.7 [95% CI 0.6 to 1.0]).54 In LA c ounty, Plough and colleagues conducted a study during a vaccination campaign consisting of free public mass vaccination sites throughout the county (distributing 20% of LA County's total H1N1 vaccine supply). AA/Black residents were half as likely as White s to receive the H1N1 vaccine at 1 of the clinic sites despite targeted outreach efforts specific to that population. 51 A study of Veterans with spinal cord conditions (N = 3384) found no difference in vaccine uptake by race.31 One other national study by Steelfisher and colleagues (N = 2,355)59 found no difference between AA/Black and White participants for H1N1 vaccine uptake (RR = 0.92 [95% CI: 0.73 to 1.55]; See Table 6). Despite these 2 studies showing no racial differences, given the size and quality of the majority of studies finding less vaccine uptake for AA/Black populations, our strength in that finding is moderate. One additional national cross- sect ional study also examined vaccine uptake for AA/Blacks compared to Wh ites, but only reported adjusted data. It found that after controlling for sociodemographic factors, there was no difference in vaccine uptake (N = 1,569; OR = 0.78 [95% CI: 0.49 Additionally, after controlling for sociodemographics, comorbidities, healthcare access, and attitudes towards the vaccine, the study by Steelfisher and Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 53 colleagues still found no difference (OR = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.75 to 1.50]; See Table 6 ).59 These adjusted data were not reported in a manner consistent with other studies, so we did not include it in our determining our strength of evidence. Eight studies provide evidence examining vaccine uptake in Latino versus White participants.25,31,34,51,54,56,59,61 Seven of these studies reported unadjusted data and contribute to low-strength evidence of lower H1N1 vaccine uptake among Latinos.25,31,51,54,56,59,61 Three studies found that Latino participants were less likely to report being vaccinated than White s.25,54,56 One of these was a large (N = 55,850), national cross-sectional survey study in which 21% of Latino participants reported vaccination versus 26% of White s (P<0.05),56 and another substantially sized study by Burger and colleagues (N = 11,834) that examined US-born and immigrant (foreign -born) Latino populations separately found similar results for both groups compared to White s.25 An LA -area survey also found Latino participants less likely to be vaccinated than White s.54 The Plough study actually found that Latino participants were more likely to have been vaccinated for H1N1 (RR = 1.45 [95% CI: 1.43 to 1.47]), but this was among LA County residents who received the H1N1 vaccine at free clinic sites.51 A study of Veterans with spinal cord conditions (N = 3384) found no difference in vaccine uptake by race,31 as did the remaining 2 national cross -sectional studies (N = 2,355 and 4,040).59,61 Adjusted analyses provide some clues about factors associated with vaccine uptake for Latinos. Burger and colleagues unadjusted findings were that Latinos (US- born and immigrants) were less likely to be vaccinated. Controlling for demographics and comorbidities accounted for the disparity for US -born Latinos. Further modeling found that after controlling for demographics and comorbidities, SES accounted for the disparity for foreign-born Latinos. 25 Another study controlling for confounders found that Latinos were more likely to be vaccinated when SES and demographic factors were accounted for. 34 However, after controlling for sociodemographics, comorbidities, healthcare access, and attitudes towards the vaccine, the study by Steelfisher and colleagues still found no difference for H1N1 vaccine uptake between Latino and White participants.59 Other racial groups examined included Asian, Amer ican Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Pacific Islander populations. Two studies examined H1N1 vaccine uptake for Asian participants compared to White s. The Plough study found that Asian participants in LA County were more likely be vaccinated than White s (RR = 3.16 [95% CI: 3.12 to 3.21]),51 but a nation al survey study found no significant difference.59 We considered these studies' findings insufficient to determine st rength of evidence, due to inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness of the evidence. Two studies examined differences in H1N1 vaccine uptake between AI/AN participants and White s and found AI/AN participants were more likely to be vaccinated (RR = 1.87 [95% CI: 1.72 to 2.03]51; OR = 1.36 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.84]59), but we determined the evidence for this finding to be insufficient . Pacific Islanders in LA County were over 4 times more likely to be vaccinated than White s.51 Finally, an LA-area survey combining Asian and Pacific Islander identified participants into a single category found no difference for this group versus White participants. 54 The evidence for these groups was insufficient. By Socioeconomic Status Two of 3 studies provided low- strength evidence that low -SES participants were less likely to be vaccinated. A large (N = 55,850), national, cross-sectional survey study found that a significantly Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 54 lower percentage of low-SES adults reported receiving the H1N1 vaccine.56 In a small cross - sectional study (N = 225) of pregnant women in 2 large, Midwestern cities, those with less than a bachelor's degree were also less likely to have been vaccinat ed.38 A study of Veterans with spinal cord conditions (N = 3384) found no difference in vaccine uptake by education.31 A study that controlled for demographic confounders found no difference in vaccine uptake by educational attainment, aside from lower uptake among those with a high school education (see Table 6). 34 By Rural/Urban Status One small, mixed -methods study (N = 56) of Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clients and staff in Georgia found that rural clients were less likely than urban ones to vaccinate themselves (3% vs 15%) or their children (23% vs 35%). Among staff participants however, the rural location staff were more likely to have vaccinated themselves and their children. 24 The evidence from these unadjusted results was insufficient to draw con clusions. A study that controlled for sociodemographic factors also found that urban participants were still more likely to be vaccinated (see Table 6) . 34 Table 6.

Some studies provided evidence of disparities mediation (or lack thereof) by analyzing whether the association between group status and H1N1 vaccine uptake was changed when a given factor was incorporated in a model. Others, particularly the qualitative studies, provided factors potentially contributing to lower or higher vaccine uptake for particular groups. The factors fell into 5 main categories: h ealth insurance and healthcare access, information and knowledge about the H1N1 vaccine, vaccination intentions, seasonal influenza vaccination, and trust and beliefs (Table 7 provides details by each of these categories). Health Insurance and Access Four studies examined the association between health insurance coverage and H1N1 vaccine uptake. 25,40,59,61 Health insurance coverage was associated with greater H1N1 vaccine uptake in 2 studies, and further, these studies found that minority racial/ethnic and lower-SES groups were less likely to have insurance coverage. 25,59 In 1 study with multivariable modeling, health insurance status of foreign-born Latino participants was a significant factor in whether they reported receiving the H1N1 vaccine. 25 In the nationwide survey study by Uscher- Pines and colleagues (N = 4,040),61 AA/Black participants remained less likely to be vaccinated after controlling for a number of sociodemogr aphic factors and insurance status. However, another study did not find racial or ethnic differences in H1N1 vaccine uptake by insurance coverage.40 Besides health insurance, other issues of H1N1 vaccine accessibility identified in studies included work- related issues, such as inflexible work schedules to take time off for vaccination, lack of availability of the vaccine, concerns about its cost, and inconvenient locations/settings for vaccination. Information/Knowledge About Vaccine No broadly representative studies reported on information or knowledge of H1N1 as it directly pertained vaccine uptake. Two studies in specific populations offer some insights. In 1 study among Veterans with spinal- cord related disabilities (N = 3,384), those with adequate and accurate information about H1N1 were more likely to be vaccinated, and AA/Black, Latino, and less educated participants were more likely to report not receiving enough information. 30 A small study (N = 225) among pregnant women in the American Midwest, found that while lower educational attainment p redicted lower vaccination rates, the relationship was mediated by the proportion of social network connections who were college educated H1N1 vaccine supporters. 38 Intention to V accinate/Vaccine- seeking Behavior Vaccine seekin g, and willingness and intention to vaccinate, did not differ by SES in 3 studies.33,43,67 In the national survey study by Lin and colleagues (N = 1,569) 43 this was true for income and education; however, unemployed participants were more likely to vaccinated with the other factors controlled. Latino participants were more likely to be willing to get the H1N1 vaccine than White participants in a nationwide survey. 33 Similarly, a study conducted prior to the approval of the H1N1 vaccine asked about willingness to receive a new, unapproved vaccine, and found that Latinos were more willing in all analyses. 53 AA/Black participants were no different from White participants in their willingness or intention to be vaccinate d in studies conducted during vaccination efforts35,67 and before the vaccine was approved.53 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 58 Receipt of Seasonal Influenza V accine Two studies provide evidence of an overall association between receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine and H1N1 vaccine uptake,33,34 with 1 specifically among minority participants.33 In this small study (N = 503) in Atlanta, Georgia, participants who were more likely to report that they were likely to get a seasonal influenza vaccine were also more likely to report intention to get an H1N1 vaccine. 33 The other study, in a nationally representative sample (N = 1,569), found an overall association between seasonal influenza vaccination and H1N1 vaccine uptake, but there was no difference in seasonal vaccination for AA/Blacks or Latinos compared to White s, nor by participant educational status. 34 Trust/Beliefs Trust (or lack thereof) in the government and healthcare providers, as well as beliefs about vaccines and government were examined in several studies. A small study (N = 503) of racial and ethnic minority adults in Atlanta, Georgia found that acceptance of the H1N1 vaccine was associated with a group of survey items indicating higher trust in the US government and greater disagreement with vaccine conspiracy beliefs. 33 It also found that participants with negative attitudes towards the H1N1 vaccine were less likely to accept the vaccine.33 In another study of low-S ES participants in Los Angeles (N = 1,750), those with negative beliefs about vaccines generally were also less likely to receive the H1N1 vaccination.54 In regards to trust in government, a study utilizing intercept interviews in Washington, DC found that AA/Black and Latino participants were less likely than White s to trust the US government and its agencies when it came to medical countermeasure messages in a hypothetical scenario of an infectious disease outbreak. 45 In another national survey study (N = 1,543), within group associations were not found for government trust and H1N1 vaccine uptake among AA/Black or Latino participants, while a positive relationship existed for White s.32 Multiple stud ies noted participants' concerns over the novelty of the vaccine and whether it had been adequately tested. In 1 study, an overall analysis of all participants found that belief in H1N1 vaccine safety was highly predictive of vaccination (OR = 5.11 [3.50-7.45] P<0.001), and low-SES and urban participants were less likely to believe the vaccine was safe. 34 In another survey study in which safety beliefs were associated with vaccination in the overall sample, H1N1 vaccine safety beliefs differed between racial and ethnic groups, with AA/Black participants in particular less likely to believe the vaccine was safe (Latin o and AI/AN participants had more mixed views of vaccine safety, and Asian participants were no different than White s). 59 Another study found that AA/Black participants were more concerned about safety and side effects of the H1N1 vaccine than other racial and ethnic groups.51 A large national survey study found more fear that the vaccine was unsafe among Latino participants, followed by AA/Black participants, with White participants least likely to perceive the vaccine as unsafe. 56 However, fear of getting sick from the vaccine was counterintuitively associated with higher vaccine uptake in bivariate analysis, but after adjusting for other factors, there was no association; fear of getting sick from the vaccine did not influence vaccine uptake.56 Another smaller national survey study found no racial differences in perceptions of vaccine safety, but in all groups the percentage who believed it was safe was less than 45%. 61 Fears about vaccine novelty and safety were also highlighted in qualitative studies. For instance, among Spanish-Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 59 speaking Latino participants of 1 qualitative study, fear of vaccine side effects including \"urban legends\" of vaccine adverse events were common themes.26 Relatedly, belief in the effectiveness of the vaccine may also be associated with uptake. The largest survey study found that AA/Black and low- SES participants were less likely to believe the vaccine was effective in preventing H1N1, and in the overall sample belief in vaccine effectiveness was associated with uptake. 56 Perception of the risk posed by H1N1 was another factor associated with vaccination. The largest survey study found that Latinos were more likely to believe they would get sick if not vaccinated than AA/Black and White participants. 56 Concern that someone in their family could get H1N1 was higher for all surveyed racial and ethnic minority groups than for White s in another study, and the same study found that those who were very concerned were more likely to be vaccinated than those who were less concerned in the overall sample. 59 In 2 qualitative studies, perception of susceptibility to H1N1 was low among minority participants.24,26 Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 60 Table 7.

In unadjusted comparison, more Latinos than White s had no healthcare coverage. In adjusted models vaccination remains less likely for those with less than college education - health insurance cov erage doesn't account for the disparity.

We found 14 studies (16 articles) that examined potential mediating factors associated with health inequities , and 12 studies (3 articles) and 5 expert panel reports that provide examples of interventions and lessons learned from previous epidemics and disasters to guide us forward in mitigating health inequalities during the COVID -19 pandemic and beyond. We also identified 20 studies that examined inequ alities in H1N1 vaccine uptake and mediating factors, and 1 vaccine -related intervention study . To our knowledge, this is the first review of studies aimed at identifying both the factors that mediate health disparities in infectious disease epidemics and also potential avenues for mitigating then. Our conceptual framework was guided by the work of Quinn and Kumar, who consider ed the potential causes of epidemic influenza based on measures of exposure, susceptibility, and access to care as they applied to data collected in 2009-2010 during the H1N1 pandemic (see Figure 1). The framework points to proximal and distal determinants of disease burden with the ultimate goal of identifying potential points of policy and programmatic intervention. Across Key Quest ions, studies were heterogeneous in their operationalization of potentially mediating factors , populations, programs, and interventions. Studies of potentially mediating factors generally, and those related to H1N1 vaccine uptake specifically, were largely cross- sectional . Several included studies did not control for confounding variables or their methods were unclear 44,51,63,65,66; however, many were well conducted and adequately reported. A few of the qualitative studies clearly reported their methodo logy and/or findings.21,22,26 However , more did not.20,45,47,57,64 We identified very few intervention s or program evaluation studies specific to infectious disease epidemics ; most were focused on post- disaster needs or disaster preparedness. Key Question 1 Our findings related to mediators associated with differential exposure or the transmission of infec tious disease were unsurprising. Despite looking across racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic status independently, the findings that disparities were related to societal -based structural and work -related factors, rather than individual factors such as hy giene and cleaning were consistent across studies. We identified few significant differences in social distancing attitudes and intentions between groups. Instead, it was clear that the meaningful differences lay in the ability or inability to social dista nce. Only 1 study examining variables related to exposure to illness disaggregated the Latino population by language proficiency, and 1 additional study provided qualitative input in the form of stakeholder interviews. In contrast with other populations we examined, compared to either English- proficient Latinos or Whites, limited English- proficient Latinos (and/or migrant and seasonal farm workers) were at higher risk across both structural and work- related variables measured (see Table 9). Susceptibility to illness played a major role in H1N1 severity and mortality; however, access to care ( ie, having a primary care provider or health insurance) did not. Significantly greater proportions of every racial and ethnic minority group reported having experienced discrimination while seeking healthcare, and many reported being less informed or were less prepared. Much of the literature guiding communication is dated due to advances in technology, and findings of Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Program Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 69 proportionally high rates of tr ust in the federal governmental , particularly in AA/Black and Latino adults, may be out of date (see Table 10).

While the recommendations generated from CDC stakeholder meetings preceded Quinn and Kumar's 2014 publication, many of them can be classified according to th eir framework. Collectively the ir recommendations address proximal causes that influence differential exposure ( eg, hand -washing and social distancing ),23 disease susceptibility (ie, vaccinations),39 and differential consequences (eg, mobile clinics).58 They also provide recommendations for distal determinants of disease exposure ( eg, liberal leave policies and job security guarantees),60 and disease severity (eg, migrant health clinics).58 Of the 12 studies that described interventions or intervention components, only 1 study28 examined effectiveness outcomes, while the majority described acceptability and feasibility of the studied interventions. We identified only 1 randomized control led trial and 1 longitudinal cohort study. While many focus on disaster preparedness and response, the interventions in this review often represent real world applications of the recommendations outlined in the 2008 CDC stakeholder meetings. For instance, the intervention studied in Eisenman28 demonstrates the positive effect that interpersonal, culturally appropriate education delivered by a community health worker can have on disaster preparedness in vulnerable communities. This validates the recommendation for using lay promotoras in delivery of health services, goods, and messaging in the case of a pandemic. 58 These results could be translated into an intervention to reach vulnerable populations during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of community engagement and partnership with community leaders was repeated often in expert-based recommendations,39 and was empirically grounded in some studies we examined . In Aten et al, the authors found that African American clergy could be integral as community liaisons in facilitating the delivery of mental health services after Hurricane Katrina. They also found that churches could serve as sites for delivery of community - based services.21,22 These findings mirror the recommendations of partnering with faith -based organizations and community leaders in order to \"allay distrust and ensure successful implementation of mitigation interventions in minority communities \" in the setting of an influenza pandemic. 39 These recommendations support the use of such partnerships to lessen the disproportionate burden of COVID -19 in racial and ethnic minorities. While it is too early in the pandemic to expect a rigorous evaluation of the effect of faith -based partnership s on COVID-19 disparities, the popular media has already chronicled that such interventions are underway.70 The interventions described here emphasize that preparedness efforts must be prioritized and marginalized communities must be included before disaster hits. Nevertheless, some of the lessons learned may be relevant to the current pandemic phase: months into the trajectory of pandemic response but prior to a safe and widely available vaccine o r treatment. Proven preparedness interventions could also be considered for implementation now given the potential for future waves of COVID -19 or new epidemics to emerge. What remains missing from the studies in this review are examples of successful syst ems-level interventions that target the distal determinants of worse outcomes of influenza illness in vulnerable populations. This is despite evidence from the H1N1 pandemic that variables of Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Prog ram Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 81 exposure that occur at higher rates among these vulnerable groups, such as inability to take sick leav e, can drastically affect disease rates.40 In the key stakeholder reports, we find multiple systems- level recommendations; for instance liberal workplace leave and teleworking policies ,60 wage freezes and childcare vouchers ,23 and creating an ethical and equitable system for ensuring access to treatment and vaccination, particularly among the uninsured.39 These interventions may already be underway, and researchers and policy makers should actively test their impact on health disparities so that lessons learned may be applied to our current and possible future disease epidemics. H1N1 Vaccine We identified 10 studies examin ing disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake in the US during the 2009-2010 flu season. We found moderate -strength evidence that vaccine uptake was lower in AA/Black than White populations from 4 of 6 studies presenting unadjusted data. We also found low-strength evidence of lowe r vaccine uptake for Latino populations, although there was some inconsistency in results. The evidence for Asian, AI/AN, and Pacific Islander populations compared to White s was insufficient . Three studies looked at disparities by SES and provide low-strength evidence that lower- SES individuals were less likely to have been vaccinated. Lastly, a very small study of rural versus urban participants provided insufficient evidence for H1N1 vaccine uptake between those populations. There was no evidence by disability status (see Table 11). Table 11.

Health insurance coverage, and availability of/access to vaccines Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Prog ram Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 82 were both important factors . Also important were receipt of the s easonal influenza vaccine, vaccine -related safety and effectiveness beliefs, and perceived susceptibility to H1N1. Across all factors AA/Black adults, and often Latino and low SES adults as well, were at higher risk. We did not identify any studies of interventions specifically targeting disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake. However, the single vaccine intervention study we did find demonstrated greater Hepatitis A vaccine uptake in an ED setting after the implementation of an EHR alert system that informed providers of the patient's homeless status and prompted them to recommend vaccination during a regional outbreak. This suggests that EHR notification systems may be useful in increasing vaccination, and potentially could be used in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign to prompt providers to recommend vaccination, especially for vulnerable groups . Applicability Many of the studies we identified were more than 10 years old and examined the H1N1 epidemic. Much has changed over the last decade, including advances in technology that affect the ways that we communicate, access information, and interact with health care providers. In recent years our country has shifted socio -politically, affecting factors related to discriminatio n and government trust. Similarly, beliefs and theories about vaccine safety may have also shifted , bringing into question the applicability of H1N1 vaccine data . In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is very different than H1N1. Not only is SARS -CoV-2 more infectious and more widely spread in United States, it has affected the way that we live, work, and even socialize in more pervasive ways that the H1N1 epidemic did. However, despite a decade of change, some things have remained stagnant. The societal factors that placed vulnerable populations at higher risk for health disparities are largely unchanged. Groups that were vulnerable a decade ago are similarly or more so today. Social and institutional barriers remain. Only 3 studies were of Veterans, all of which were narrowly focused on specific populations ( ie, Veterans who are homebound and Veterans with spinal injuries and conditions). More research is needed to elucidate pandemic- related disparities and their mitigation for the Veteran population . Limitations There are a number of limitations of this evidence base. Studies were largely cross -sectional, and we identified only 1 RCT, which was of poor quality. The operationalization of potential mediating factors w as heterogeneous, and we iden tified very few studies that examined whether risk factors mediated the associations between population characteristics and outcomes. Many of the studies are a decade old, and findings may no longer be applicable. The categorization of racial and ethnic groups was not consistent across studies ( eg, Latinos as a group or stratified by nativity or language), and very few studies examined disparities among Asian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations, or among rural residents and adul ts with disabilities. Very few studies examined interventions or programs to mitigate disparities during infectious disease epidemics. The strength of H1N1 vaccine uptake was limited by imprecision and poor reporting, and vaccine uptake was measured by sel f-report in all but 1 study. Health Inequalities in Infectious Disease Epidemics Evidence Synthesis Prog ram Pre-dating COVID -19 in the United States 83 CONCLUSION The literature examining health disparities associated with previous infectious disease epidemics, and in some cases disasters, may provide some guidance f or the current COVID -19 response. Evidence consistently pointed to disparities in structural and work -related exposure to infection as underlying disparities, with the impact of comorbid conditions on susceptibility for more severe infection and higher rates of mortality playing a less certain role . Discrimination was reported more frequently by all racial and ethnic minorities. However, its impact on disparities during infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. African American/Black and Latino adults generally were disproportionately affected. How ever, Latinos with limited English proficiency were at especially high risk. There is moderate -strength evidence that AA/Black adults were less likely to receive a H1N1 vaccine, and low- strength evidence of lower vaccination rates for Latinos adults of lower SES. Advances in technology, and sociopolitical shifts over the past decade, call into question the applicability of findings. Interventions and programs from the disaster literature bring to light recommendations for infectious disease response by the CDC and other experts. In order to better prevent widespread health disparities that emerge in the wake of the current and future disease epidemics, more research is needed on policy - and systems- level interventions and their effect on the distal determina nts of poor health outcomes among vulnerable groups.

Risk of Bias in Randomized Controlled Trials of Interventions to Reduce Pandemic/Epidemic -related Health Disparities Study Randomization/ sequence generation? Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? Blinding: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? Missing data: How was incomplete data addressed? Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? Other sources of bias: Was the study apparent ly free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias (ROB)?
