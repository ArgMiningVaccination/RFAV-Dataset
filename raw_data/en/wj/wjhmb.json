Moves Energy It often requires no more than a few drops of an essential oil to benefit the body in powerful ways. Energy is the vital, vibrating, moving force of nature that influences the quality of our happiness, aging and health. Cultures around the world have given life energy a name; in India it's called prana; in Hebrew, ruach; in Greek pneuma; in Hawaiian, mana; in Japanese, ki, and in Chinese it's called qi (pronounced chee). Qi is connected with the breath, because it animates our body and brings it to life. Unbalanced, blocked or weak qi can mean an unbalanced body - bringing on pain and other negative ailments. The aroma of Temple Oil invigorates your blood as it makes contact with the body, communicates with your brain as it moves through your nose and stimulates your organs as it enters your lungs. 2. Relaxes the Mind The intention with our Temple Oil during sessions is to create a welcoming, relaxing and pleasant environment that will put the client at ease. Some emotional symptoms of Qi stagnation include feelings of stress, agitation and irritability. During your treatment, a little bit of Temple Oil is applied directly on the problem areas, rubbed into acupuncture points, and inhaled - and can bring a great deal of relief. This instantly calms your body, harmonizes your mind and enhances the experience. 3. Reduces Pain One of the ancient secrets in producing effective topical remedies that alleviate pain is the use of herbs and essential oils that promote the circulation of blood/Qi. Because essential oils are not ingested, but applied topically or inhaled, they don't have to be processed through the digestive system and will act more directly. There can be little to no pain when the blood and Qi are moving freely through the acupuncture channels and collateral vessels, according to Chinese Medicine principles. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory herbs that we include in Temple Oil produces amazing pain reducing affects. "}
