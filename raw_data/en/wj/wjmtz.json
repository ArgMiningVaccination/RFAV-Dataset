I was allergic to a lot of the seizure medications that I was first placed on back in 1996 when I had brain surgery, but had no allergic to the Depakote. I have however had a considerable weight gain that has made my life very unpleasant at times. My doctor explained to me early on that I might gain some extra weight, but it is to the point of being unhealthy. The reason I have never switched meds is because my doctor said that if I had another allergic reaction, it would just mean starting over, getting my meds back where they need to be. I have been very lucky and have not had a seizure in two years, and not sure if I want to risk having one. All my seizures have been grand-mals, and I'm sure you all know how those feel. Could anyone that was taking Depakote and was switched to something else, let me know why you were switched. Thanks Again First of all, I am still on Depakote, and not sure why I am.
