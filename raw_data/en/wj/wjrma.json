Tel: 82-63-469-1886; Immune Resp onse Sang-Hoon Life Medicine, Kunsan National University, Kunsan, 1Department of Food and Nutrition, Yuhan College, Gyeonggi, Korea Background: The effects of the dietary administration of two heat-inactivated whole bacteria from the Vibrionaceae family, singly or combined, on innate immune response of the rainbow trout were studied. The two bacteria (Pdp11 and 51M6), which were obtained from the skin of rainbow trout, showed in vitro characteristics that suggested they could be considered as potential fish probiotics. Methods: The fish were fed four different diets: control (non-supplemented), or diets supplemented with cfu/g 51M6 for 4 weeks. Six fish were sampled at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, and then the main humoral (natural haemolytic complement activity and serum peroxidase con-tent) and cellular innate immune responses (leucocyte perox-idase content, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and cytotox-icity) were evaluated. Results: The serum peroxidase con- tent and the natural haemolytic complement activity in-creased with time, reaching the highest values in the third and fourth weeks of feeding, respectively. The phagocytic ability of specimens fed the mixture of the two inactivated bacteria was significantly higher than in the controls after 2 and 3 weeks of treatment. The same activity increased sig-nificantly in rainbow trout fed the Pdp11 diet for 2 weeks or the 51M6 diet for 3 weeks. Respiratory burst activity was un-affected by all the experimental diets at all times assayed. Cytotoxic activity had significantly increased after 3 weeks in fish fed the 51M6 diet. Conclusion: Our results demon- strated the usefulness of inactivated probiotic bacteria into fish diets.[Immune Network 2008;8(3):67-74]INTRODUCTION Probiotics are defined as live microbial preparations that im- prove the health and well-being of the host (1-3). Recent works have studied the use of probiotics for aquacultural use ( 4 - 8 ) . H o w e v e r , c r i t e r i a h a v e b e e n l i m i t e d t o d i s e a s e r e s i s t - ance and the in vitro inhibition of pathogenic bacteria while there are few data concerning their effects on the host im- mune responses (9-12). Releasing the cells of live bacteria into fish pens or cages poses a potential risk to wild aquatic organisms since the bac-teria may escape into the environment at large. The use of inactivated bacteria clearly solves such safety-related issues s i n c e t h e y c a n n o l o n g e r i n t e r a c t w i t h o t h e r a q u a t i c o r g a - nisms.

However, studies concerning the effects of dead probiotics on fish health are very scarce (15,16). The aim of the present work was to assess the effects of the dietary administration of two heat-inactivated whole bac- teria on the rainbow trout innate immune response. The two assayed bacteria (Pdp11 and 51M6) were selected as candi-date probiotics from rainbow trout skin from a pool of 49 isolates taken from skin, gills and gut. They were charac- terized according to their adhesive ability to fish mucus, thei r antagonistic activity against fish pathogens, and their resist- ance to fish bile and mucus. fish mucus by competitive exclusion (17). \u0000R\u0000e\u0000t\u0000r\u0000a\u0000c\u0000t\u0000i\u0000o\u0000nNon-specific Immune Response of Rainbow Trout by Dietary Probiotics Sang-Hoon Choi and Taek-Joon Yoon IMMUNE NETWORK68Although these in vitro characte ristics suggest their potential usefulness as fish probiotics, their in vivo immune-modulatory properties have never been described. Therefore, the present paper evaluates the immunomodulatory effects of the dietary administration, singly or combined, of these two potential probiotics, after inactivation by heat, on the rainbow trout in - nate immune system. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacteria Two bacteria from the Vibrionacease family, isolated from rainbow trout skin, Pdp11 and 51M6, were selected from a pool of 49 isolates obtained from skin, gills and intestine of rainbow trout, because their in vitro characteristics suggested they could be considered as potential fish probiotics (17).

Bacterial cells were harvested in sterile phos- phate-buffered saline (PBS, pH (7.4) and the number of bac- t e r i a l c e l l s p r e s e n t p e r m l o f c u l t u r e m e d i a o f s u c h a l i q u o t s was measured by using a Z2 Coulter Particle Counter (Beck- man Coulter, USA) to adjust the required concentration. Both bacterial cultures were heat-inactivated for 1 h at 60oC. Fish and experimental design One hundred specimens (65 g mean weight) of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) obtained from a fish farm placed near Kunsan, Korea. The fish were kept in four fiber glass flow-through underground fresh water tanks (25 fish per tan k ) o f 45 0 L (flo w rate 1, 50 0 L/h ) at 20 oC wit h a 1 2 h d ark : 12 h light ph otoperio d and fed with a commercial pellet d iet. Fish were allowed to acclimatize for 15 days before the start o f f e e d i n g t r i a l s . B e f o r e s a m p l i n g , t h e y w e r e s t a r v e d f o r 2 4 h. Specimens were sacrificed by an overdose of benzocaine (4% in acetone) (Sigma), weighed and measured. Experimental diets containing 0 (control), heat-inactivated Pdp11, heat-inactivated 51M6 or both killed bacteria, which showed no bacterial colony after inactivation, were prepared in the laboratory from the commercial pellet diet. Briefly, the no rmal pellet d iet was cru shed and mixed with tap water b e-fore adding the bacterial suspensions at the desired concen-tration, and then made into pellets again, The re-made pellets were allowed to dry and were stored at 4 oC until use. The fish in each aquarium received one of the four differ-ent diets: a diet consisting of the non-supplemented commer-cial diet (control group); the same diet supplemented with 8 cfu/g heat supplemented with 108 cfu/g heat-inactivated 51M6 and, finally, the fourth group received with 0.5\u00d7108/g Pdp11 and 0.5\u00d7108 cfu/g 51M6, both heat-inactivated. Fish were fed at a r a t e o f 1 0 g d r y d i e t k g / b i o m a s s ( 1 % ) p e r d a y f o r 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 weeks. The biomass of the fish in each aquarium was m e a s u r e d b e f o r e t h e e x p e r i m e n t a n d d a i l y r a t i o n w a s a d - justed accordingly. No mortality was observed during the experiment. Serum collection and leucocyte isolation S i x f i s h f r o m e a c h a q u a r i u m w e r e r a n d o m l y s a m p l e d a t 1 , 2, 3 and 4 weeks after the beginning of the feeding trial. Blood and head kidney (HK) s amples were obtained from each specimen and several immunological parameters were determined, as described below. Blood samples were col- lected from the caudal vein with a 27-gauge needle, 1 ml sy-ringe and allowed to clot at 4 oC for 4 h. After centrifugation, the serum was removed and frozen at 80oC until used to assess natu ral h emo lytic co mplemen t activity and th e perox-idase level. HK leucocytes were isolated under sterile con- ditions as described previously (18). Briefly, the head kidney was cut into small fragments and transferred to 8 ml of sRPMI medium: RPMI 1640 culture medium (Gibco) supplemented (to adjust the medium 's osmo- larity to rainbow trout plasma osmolarity, 353.33 mOs), (Flow), bovine serum (Gibco). Cell suspensions were obtained by forcing fragments of the organ through a 100 m nylon mesh. After two washes (400 g, 10 min, 4oC), HK leucocytes were counted in a Neubauer chamber and adjusted to 107 cells/ml of sRPMI. Natural hemolytic complement activity The activity of the alternative complement pathway was as- sayed using sheep red blood cel ls (SRBC, Biomedics) as tar- g e t s ( 1 9 ) .

The relative hemoglobin content of the super- natants was assessed by measuring their optical density at 550 nm in a spectrophotometer (BMG, Fluoro Star Galaxy). The values of maximum (100%) hemolysis were obtained by add- ing 100l of distilled water to 100 l samples of SRBC and minimum (spontaneous) hemolysis was obtained from DRBC without serum. The degree of hemolysis (Y) (percentage of hemolytic ac- tivity with respect to the maximum) was estimated and the lysis curve for each specimen was obtained by plotting Y/(1-Y) against the volume of serum added (ml) on a log scaled graph. The volume of serum producing 50% hemolysis (ACH 50) was determined for each experimental group. Peroxidase content The total peroxidase content pre sent in serum or inside leuco- cytes was measured according to Quade and Roth (20). Briefly, 15 l o f s e r u m w a s d i l u t e d w i t h 3 5 l of Ca2-and Mg2-free HBSS in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. Then, 50 o f 2 0 m M 3 , 3 ', 5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride (T M B , S ig m a ) a n d 5 m M H 2O2 (Sigma) were added (both sub- strates of peroxidase). To estimate the leucocyte peroxidase content, 106 H K leuco cytes in sRPMI well were d ispensed 96-well pl ates. The plates were centri- fuged (400 g, 10 min) and the supernatants were removed. Leucocytes were then lysed with 75 l of 0.02% cetyl- trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Sigma) on a shaker at 40 cycles per min. Afterwards, 50 l of 10 mM TMB and 5 mM H 2O2 were added. Then, 150 l o f seru m w as t ran sferred from each well to new 96-well plates. In both cases, the col-or-change reaction was stopped after 2 min by adding 50 l of 2 M sulphuric acid and the optical density was read at 540 nm in a multiscan reader. Standard samples without serum or leucocytes, respecti vely, also phagocytosis Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain S288C) by rainbow trout HK leucocytes was studied by flow cy- tometry according to Rodriguez et al. (21). Heat-killed and lyophilized yeast cells were labeled with fluorescein iso-thiocyanate (FITC, Sigma), washed and adjusted to 5\u00d710 7 cells/ml of sRPMI. Phagocyto sis samples consisted of 125 l of labeled yeast cells and 100 l of HK leucocytes in sRPMI (6.25 yeast cells:1 leucocyte). Samples were mixed, centri-fuged (400 g, 5 min, 22oC), resuspended in sRPMI and in- cubated at 22oC for 30 min. At the end of the incubation time, the samples were placed on ice to stop phagocytosis and 400 l ice-cold PBS was added to each sample. The fluorescence of the extracellular yeasts was quenched by adding 40 l ice-cold trypan blue (0.4% in PBS). Standard samples of FITC-labelled S. cerevisiae o r H K l e u c o c y t e s w e r e i n c l u d e d in each phagocytosis assay. All samples were analyzed in a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with an argon-ion laser adjusted to 488 nm. Analyses were performed on 5000 cells, which were acquired at a rate of 300 cells/s. data were col- lected in the form of FSC, SSC and green fluorescence (FL1). The cytometer was set to analyze the phagocyte population identified by their high FCS and SSC. Phagocytic ability was defined as the percentage of cells with one or more ingested yeast cells (green-FITC fluorescent cells) within the phagocyte cell population. The relative n umber of ingested yeasts per cell (phagocytic capacity) was assessed in arbitrary units from the mean fluorescence intensity of the phagocytic cells. Respiratory burst activity Respiratory burst activity of founder kidney cells was assessed by monitoring their ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (22). Briefly, leucocytes (10 5) were washed one time with HBSS at 1,000 rpm for 3 min at 4oC and incubated in 100 l of complete media in the presence of phorbol myristate ace- tate (PMA, 1 g/ml) and NBT 1 hr at 25oC, excess amount of NBT was washed out with PBS and the leucocytes were fixed with 70% methanol. After discarding 70% methanol, the leucocytes were washed twice with PBS. The reduced formazan was solubilized with 120 l KOH and 140l dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and optical density val- ues were read at 620 nm in an ELISA reader (ASYS HITECH, Austria). Natural cytotoxic activity The natural cytotoxic activity of rainbow trout HK leucocytes was evaluated using a flow cytometry technique based on a double-fluorescent labeling (2 3). Each cytotoxic assay was carried out in duplicate. L-1210 tumor cells (mouse lympho- ma, ATCC CCL-219) were cultured in sRPMI-1640 culture medium. were at 37oC, with 85% relative hu- midity and 5% CO 2 atmosphere and maintained in ex- ponential growth.

Samples were centrifuged (400 g, 1 min, 22oC) and incubated at 22oC for 3 h. Cytotoxic samples incubated for 0 h (control) were used to determine initial target viability. At the end of the incubation period, 30 l of propidium iodide (400 g/ml, PI, Sigma) was added t o e a c h s a m p l e a n d m i x e d g e n t l y b e f o r e a n a l y s i s i n a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer adjusted to ob- tain optimal discrimination of the target cell population. Data were collected in the form of two parameter FSC, SSC, FL1 (green fluorescence, DiO) and FL 2 (red fluorescence, PI) dot plots and histograms. Each analysis was performed on 3000 cells, which were acquired at a rate of 300 cell/ml. The FACS only accepted the positive FL1 region, which corresponded to DiO-labelled target cells. The percentage of dead or non-viable target cells showing green and red fluorescence was related to the cytotoxic activity of rainbow trout leuco- cytes.

RESULTS Natural haemolytic complement activity The supplementation of rainbow trout diet with heat-in- activated Pdp11, 51M6 or both bacteria resulted in a similar pattern of effects upon natural haemolytic complement activ- ity in serum. For all the experi mental diets, the highest activ - ity was always recorded at w eek 4, although the observed differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 1).

Natural cytotoxic activity The dietary administration of heat-inactivated Pdp11 did not cause any significant variations in the cytotoxic activity of H K leucocytes. Fish fed either of the two diets containing heat-in - activated 51M6 showed no significant differences in the cyto-toxic activity of HK leucocytes during the first 2 weeks of treatment but administration of these two diets for 3 weeks significantly increased the cytotoxic activity of HK leucocytes , although such enhancement was not observed after 4 weeks of treatment (Fig. 5). DISCUSSION Studies on how the fish immune system is affected upon pro- biotic stimu lation are scarce. In this work, we have evalu ated both the humoral and cellular innate immune responses of rainbow trout fed for 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks with h eat-inactivated bacteria-supplemented diets. Despite the existence of previous reports revealing the sig- nificant positive effect of different probiotic bacteria in the level of complement (24), all the experimental diets in this study led to increased complement activity although differ-ences were not statistically significant compared with the con- trol group. The finding that the highest values were reached a t t h e e n d o f t h e e x p e r i m e n t a grees with results found by Panigrahi et al. (24) in rainbow trout fed live Lactobacillus rhamnosus . The other humoral immune parameter that was assayed, the peroxidase content in serum, was not significantly af- fected by any experimental diet at any time of the trial. The highest levels of peroxidase we re observed during the third week, especially in rainbow trout that received the diet con-taining Pdp11. On the other hand, the peroxidase content of leucocytes responded in different ways, with values that peaked in the second week in the groups fed the single bac- terial diets, although the differences with respect to control group were not statistically sig nificant. Nevertheless, Salinas et al. (12) reported a significant decrease in the leucocyte peroxidase content in the third week in fish fed live Lactobacillus delbr \u00fceckii ssp. lactis an d Bacillus subtilis -sup- plemented diets. Phagocytic activity was significantly enhanced in rainbow trout fed Pdp11 at week 2 but the enhancement occurred a week later in th e grou ps fed 51M 6 or th e mixtu re o f b acteria. These results suggest that in order to enhance phagocytic ac-tivity by using dietary 51M6, longer administration periods are required than when Pdp11 supplemented diets are provided. Increased phagocytic activity in the head kidney leucocytes of fish fed live probiotic bacteria-supplemented diets (24,25) and killed bacteria-supplemented diets by other authors (15,16). However, Lactococcus lactis s u p p l e - mentation did not affect the phagocytic activity of turbot head kidney macrophages after 1 week of daily administration (26). rainbow trout fed live L. delbr\u00fceckii ssp. lactis, B. sub- tilis, or both in equal amounts, showed a more sustained stimulatory effect in their phagocytic activity of head kidney phagocytes, the mixture of both bacteria again having the greatest stimulatory effect (12). Although phagocytic activity showed a significant increase, no statistically significant differences were found in the resp i- ratory burst activity of rainbow trout head kidney leucocytes between control and treated fish at any time of the experiment. Supplementation with Pdp11 provoked the great- est stimulation after 4 weeks of administration. These results lead us to conclude that the bacterium with the greater stimulatory effect on the rainbow trout innate im- mune system is Pdp11, since sp ecimens fed this bacteria pos- sessed higher levels of serum peroxidase and their HK leuco-cytes showed higher levels of phagocytic and respiratory burst activities.

On the other hand, the immunomodulatory effects caused by Pdp11 administration were faster than those prompted by 51M6. This time-course difference was well il- lustrated by the changes recorded in the phagocytic activity of HK leucocytes from each of these experimental groups. While, phagocytic ability was significantly greater with respec t t o t h e c o n t r o l g r o u p a f t e r t h e s e c o n d w e e k o f b e i n g f e d P d p 1 1 a n d t h e m i x t u r e o f t h e t w o b a c t e r i a , i t w a s n o t u n t i l w e e k 3 t h a t a s t i m u l a t o r y r e s p o n s e w a s o b s e r v a b l e i n t h e group fed 51M6. More importantly, the combination of both bacteria resulted in higher ph agocytic activities at week 3, probably due to the presence of 51M6. The present study investigate d the effects of two mono- strain probiotics and one multistrain formulation. Timmerman et al. (27) concluded that multistrain probiotics (more than one strain of the same species or closely related species) and/or multispecies probiotics could be more effective and more consistent than that of a monostrain probiotic, since mixed cultures may contain bacteria that complement each other's health effect and thus have synergistic probiotic properties. The two bacteria assayed in the present work had no synergistic immun ostimulato ry effects, which cou ld b e du e t o t h e c l o s e s y s t e m a t i c r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n t h e m . O n t h e contrary, Salinas et al. (12) reported synergistic effects be- tween Lactobacillus ssp. and Bacillus ssp., which do not be- long to the same family. Finally, it is worth pointing out that most of the innate im- mune parameters assessed were enhanced in the third week of the trial, and so longer periods of feeding are not necessar y. This agrees with Salinas et al. (12) and could be a consequence of the way of administration. It is known that the most effec- tive method for administering immunostimulants to fish is by injection, whereas the efficacy of oral and immersion methods decreases with long term administration (27). T o c o n c l u d e , t h e p r e s e n t r e s u l t s i n d i c a t e t h a t o r a l a d m i n - istration of heat-inactivated bacteria has stimulatory effects on the innate immune system of the rainbow trout, with Pdp11 b eing mo re effective than 51M6. It is clear th at bacteria is o- lated from fish surfaces, such as Pdp11 and 51M6, are capable of modulating the rainbow trout innate immune system. The possibility of more potent effects being observed when these bacteria are administered as live cells awaits confirmation.
