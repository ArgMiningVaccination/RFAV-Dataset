Introduction Three federal taxes are paid on wages and self- employment income \u2014income tax, social security tax, and Medicare tax. Social security and Medicare taxes are collected under one of two systems. Under the Self -Employment Con- tributions Act (SECA), the self -employed per- son pays all the taxes. Under the Federal Insur- ance Contributions Act (FICA), the employee and the employer each pay half of the social se- curity and Medicare taxes. No earnings are subject to both systems. In addition, all wages and self -employment income that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax to the extent they exceed the applicable threshold for an individual's filing status. Medicare wages and self -employment income are combined to determine if income exceeds the threshold. A self- employment loss isn't considered for pur- poses of this tax. Railroad retirement (RRTA) compensation is separately compared to the threshold. Additional Medicare Tax applies to Medicare wages, RRTA compensation, and self-employment income that are more than: $125,000 if married filing separately, $250,000 if married filing jointly, or $200,000 for any other filing status. There is no employer match for Additional Med- icare Tax. For more information, see Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax, and its separate instructions. This publication contains information for the following classes of taxpayers. Ministers. Members of a religious order. Christian Science practitioners and read- ers. Religious workers (church employees). Members of a recognized religious sect. Note.

Social Security Coverage This section gives information about which sys- tem (SECA or FICA) is used to collect social se- curity and Medicare taxes from members of the clergy (ministers, members of a religious order, and Christian Science practitioners and read- ers) and religious workers (church employees). 54 525 529 535 590-A 590-B 596 SS-8 8962 Coverage of Members of the Clergy The services you perform in the exercise of your ministry, of the duties required by your reli- gious order, or of your profession as a Christian Science practitioner or reader are covered by social security and Medicare under SECA. Your earnings for these ministerial services (defined later) are subject to self -employment (SE) tax unless one of the following applies. You are a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty. You ask the IRS for an exemption from SE tax for your services and the IRS approves your request. See Exemption From Self-Employment (SE) Tax , later. You are subject only to the social security laws of a foreign country under the provi- sions of a social security agreement be- tween the United States and that country. For more information, see Bilateral Social Security (Totalization) Agreements in Pub. 54. Your earnings that aren't from ministerial services may be subject to social security tax under FICA or SECA according to the rules that apply to taxpayers in general. See Ministerial Services , later. Ministers If you are a minister of a church, your earnings for the services you perform in your capacity as a minister are subject to SE tax, even if you per- form these services as an employee of that church. However, you can request that the IRS grant you an exemption, as discussed under Exemption From Self -Employment (SE) Tax , later. For the specific services covered, see Ministerial Services , later. Ministers defined. Ministers are individuals who are duly ordained, commissioned, or li- censed by a religious body constituting a church or church denomination. Ministers have the authority to conduct religious worship, per- form sacerdotal functions, and administer ordi- nances or sacraments according to the prescri- bed tenets and practices of that church or denomination. If a church or denomination ordains some ministers and licenses or commissions others, anyone licensed or commissioned must be able to perform substantially all the religious func- tions of an ordained minister to be treated as a minister for social security purposes. Employment status for other tax purposes. Even though all of your income from performing ministerial services is subject to self -employ- ment tax for social security tax purposes, you may be an employee for income tax or retire- ment plan purposes in performing those same services. For income tax or retirement plan pur- poses, your income earned as an employee will be considered wages. Common- law employee. Under com- mon- law rules, you are considered either an Page 3 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 517 (2022) Page 3employee or a self -employed person. Gener- ally, you are an employee if you perform serv- ices for someone who has the legal right to con- trol both what you do and how you do it, even if you have considerable discretion and freedom of action. For more information about the com- mon- law rules, see Pub. 15 -A, Employer's Sup- plemental Tax Guide. If a congregation employs you and pays you a salary, you are generally a common -law em- ployee and income from the exercise of your ministry is wages for income tax purposes. However, amounts received directly from mem- bers of the congregation, such as fees for per- forming marriages, baptisms, or other personal services, aren't wages; such amounts are self- employment income for both income tax purposes and social security tax purposes. Example. A church hires and pays you a salary to perform ministerial services subject to its control. Under the common -law rules, you are an employee of the church while performing those services. Form SS -8. If you aren't certain whether you are an employee or a self -employed per- son, you can get a determination from the IRS by filing Form SS-8. Members of Religious Orders If you are a member of a religious order who hasn't taken a vow of poverty, your earnings for ministerial services you perform as a member of the order are subject to SE tax. See Ministerial Services , later. However, you can request that the IRS grant you an exemption as discussed under Exemption From Self -Employment (SE) Tax, later. Vow of poverty. If you are a member of a reli- gious order and have taken a vow of poverty, you are already exempt from paying SE tax on your earnings for ministerial services you per- form as an agent of your church or its agencies. You don't need to request a separate exemp- tion. For income tax purposes, the earnings are tax free to you. Your earnings are considered the income of the religious order. Services covered under FICA at the election of the order. However, even if you have taken a vow of poverty, the services you perform for your church or its agencies may be covered under social security. Your services are covered if your order, or an autonomous subdivision of the order, elects social security coverage for its current and future vow -of-pov- erty members. The order or subdivision elects coverage by filing Form SS -16. The election may cover cer- tain vow -of-poverty members for a retroactive period of up to 20 calendar quarters before the quarter in which it files the certificate. If the elec- tion is made, the order or subdivision pays both the employer's and employee's share of the tax. You don't pay any of the FICA tax. Services performed outside the order. Even if you are a member of a religious order who has taken a vow of poverty and the order requires you to turn over amounts you earn, your earnings are subject to federal income tax and either SE tax or FICA tax (including estimated tax payments and/or withholding) if you: Are self-employed or an employee of an organization outside your religious com- munity; and Perform work not required by, or done on behalf of, the order. In these cases, your income from self -em- ployment or as an employee of that outside or- ganization is taxable to you directly. You may, however, be able to take a charitable deduction for the amount you turn over to the order. See Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions. Rulings. Organizations and individuals may request rulings from the IRS on whether they are religious orders, or members of a religious order, respectively, for FICA tax, SE tax, and federal income tax withholding purposes. To re- quest a ruling, follow the procedures in Reve- nue Procedure 2022- 1. To find the revenue pro- cedure, go to IRS.gov and type \"Revenue Procedure 2022-1\" in the search box. Christian Science Practitioners and Readers Generally, your earnings from services you per- form in your profession as a Christian Science practitioner or reader are subject to SE tax. However, you can request an exemption as dis- cussed under Exemption From Self -Employ- ment (SE) Tax , later. Practitioners. Christian Science practitioners are members in good standing of the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts, who practice healing according to the teachings of Christian Science. State law specifically exempts Christian Sci- ence practitioners from licensing requirements. Some Christian Science practitioners are also Christian Science teachers or lecturers. In- come from teaching or lecturing is considered the same as income from their work as practi- tioners. Readers. For tax purposes, Christian Science readers are considered the same as ordained, commissioned, or licensed ministers. Coverage of Religious Workers (Church Employees) If you are a religious worker (a church em- ployee) and aren't in one of the classes already discussed, your wages are generally subject to social security and Medicare tax under FICA, not SECA. Some exceptions are discussed next. Election by Church To Exclude Its Employees From FICA Coverage Churches and qualified church -controlled or- ganizations (church organizations) that are op- posed for religious reasons to the payment of social security and Medicare taxes may elect to exclude their employees from FICA coverage. If your employer makes this election, it doesn't pay the employer's portion of the FICA taxes or withhold from your pay your portion of the FICA taxes. Instead, your wages are subject to SECA and you must pay SE tax on your wages if they exceed $108.28 during the tax year. However, you can request an exemption from SE tax if you are a member of a recognized religious sect, as discussed below. Churches and church organizations make this election by filing two copies of Form 8274. For more information about making this elec- tion, see Form 8274. Election by Certain Church Employees Who Are Opposed to Social Security and Medicare You may be able to choose to be exempt from social security and Medicare taxes, including the SE tax, if you are a member of a recognized religious sect or division and work for a church (or church -controlled nonprofit division) that doesn't pay the employer's part of the social se- curity tax on wages. This exemption doesn't ap- ply to your service, if any, as a minister of a church or as a member of a religious order. Make this choice by filing Form 4029. See Requesting Exemption \u2014Form 4029 , later, un- der Members of Recognized Religious Sects . U.S. Citizens and Resident and Nonresident Aliens To be covered under the SE tax provisions (SECA), individuals must generally be citizens or resident aliens of the United States. Nonresi- dent aliens aren't covered under SECA unless a social security agreement in effect between the United States and the foreign country deter- mines that they are covered under the U.S. so- cial security system. To determine your alien status, see Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens. Residents of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Is- lands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa. If you are a resident of one of these U.S. territories but not a U.S. citizen, for SE tax purposes you are treated the same as a citizen or resident alien of the United States. For information on figuring the tax, see Self-Employment Tax: Figuring Net Earnings , later. Ministerial Services Ministerial services, in general, are the services you perform in the exercise of your ministry, in the exercise of your duties as required by your religious order, or in the exercise of your profes- sion as a Christian Science practitioner or reader. Income you receive for performing min- isterial services is subject to SE tax unless you have an exemption, as explained later. Even if you have an exemption, only the income you re- ceive for performing ministerial services is ex- empt. The exemption doesn't apply to any other income.Page 4 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 4 Publication 517 (2022)The following discussions provide more de- tailed information on ministerial services of min- isters, members of a religious order, and Chris- tian Science practitioners and readers. Ministers Most services you perform as a minister, priest, rabbi, etc., are ministerial services. These serv- ices include: Performing sacerdotal functions; Conducting religious worship; and Controlling, conducting, and maintaining religious organizations (including the reli- gious boards, societies, and other integral agencies of such organizations) that are under the authority of a religious body that is a church or denomination. You are considered to control, conduct, and maintain a religious organization if you direct, manage, or promote the organization's activi- ties. A religious organization is under the author- ity of a religious body that is a church or de- nomination if it's organized for, and dedicated to, carrying out the principles of a faith accord- ing to the requirements governing the creation of institutions of the faith. Services for nonreligious organizations. Your services for a nonreligious organization are ministerial services if the services are as- signed or designated by your church. Assigned or designated services qualify even if they don't involve performing sacerdotal functions or con- ducting religious worship. If your services aren't assigned or designa- ted by your church, they are ministerial services only if they involve performing sacerdotal func- tions or conducting religious worship. Services that aren't part of your ministry. Income from services you perform as an em- ployee that aren't ministerial services is subject to social security and Medicare tax withholding under FICA (not SECA) under the rules that ap- ply to employees in general. The following aren't ministerial services. Services you perform for nonreligious or- ganizations other than the services stated above. Services you perform as a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church as an employee of the United States, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any of their political subdi- visions. These services aren't ministerial services even if you are performing sacer- dotal functions or conducting religious wor- ship. (For example, if you perform services as a chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States, those services aren't minis- terial services.) Services you perform in a govern- ment-owned and operated hospital. (These services are considered performed by a government employee, not by a minis- ter as part of the ministry.) However, serv- ices that you perform at a church-related hospital or health and welfare institution, or a private nonprofit hospital, are considered to be part of the ministry and are consid- ered ministerial services.Books or articles. Writing religious books or articles is considered to be in the exercise of your ministry and is considered a ministerial service. This rule also applies to members of reli- gious orders and to Christian Science practi- tioners and readers. Members of Religious Orders Services you perform as a member of a reli- gious order in the exercise of duties required by the order are ministerial services. The services are considered ministerial because you perform them as an agent of the order. For example, if the order directs you to per- form services for another agency of the super- vising church or an associated institution, you are considered to perform the services as an agent of the order. However, if the order directs you to work outside the order, this employment won't be considered a duty required by the order unless: Your services are the kind that are ordina- rily performed by members of the order; and Your services are part of the duties that must be exercised for, or on behalf of, the religious order as its agent. Effect of employee status. Ordinarily, if your services aren't considered directed or required of you by the order, you and the outside party for whom you work are considered employee and employer. In this case, your earnings from the services are taxed under the rules that ap- ply to employees in general, not under the rules for services performed as an agent of the order. This result is true even if you have taken a vow of poverty. Example. Pat Brown and Chris Green are members of a religious order and have taken vows of poverty. They renounce all claims to their earnings. The earnings belong to the or- der. Pat is a licensed attorney. The superiors of the order instructed her to get a job with a law firm. Pat joined a law firm as an employee and, as she requested, the firm made the salary pay- ments directly to the order. Chris is a secretary. The superiors of the or- der instructed him to accept a job with the busi- ness office of the church that supervises the or- der. Chris took the job and gave all his earnings to the order. Pat's services aren't duties required by the order. Her earnings are subject to social secur- ity and Medicare tax under FICA and to federal income tax. Chris' services are duties required by the or- der. He is acting as an agent of the order and not as an employee of a third party. He doesn't include the earnings in gross income, and they aren't subject to income tax withholding or to social security and Medicare tax under FICA or SECA. Christian Science Practitioners and Readers Services you perform as a Christian Science practitioner or reader in the exercise of your profession are ministerial services. Amounts you receive for performing these services are generally subject to SE tax. You may request an exemption from SE tax, discussed next, which applies only to those services. Exemption From Self-Employment (SE) Tax You can request an exemption from SE tax if you are a member of the clergy (minister, mem- ber of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner or reader) or a member of a recog- nized religious sect.The Self-Employment Tax Exemption Application and Approval Process Who Can Apply Members of the Clergy Members of Recognized Religious Sects How File Form 4361 File Form 4029 When File by the due date (including extensions) of your income tax return for the second tax year in which you had at least $400 of net earnings from self-employment, any of which came from ministerial servicesFile anytime Approval If approved, you will receive an approved copy of Form 4361If approved, you will receive an approved copy of Form 4029 Effective DateFor all tax years after 1967 in which you have at least $400 of net earnings from self-employment, any of which came from ministerial servicesFor all tax years beginning with the first year you meet the eligibility requirements , discussed laterTable 2.

MUST be removed before printing. Publication 517 (2022) Page 5Generally, members of religious orders who have taken a vow of poverty are already exempt from paying SE tax, as discussed earlier under Members of Religious Orders under Social Security Coverage . They don't have to request the exemption. Who can't be exempt. You can't be exempt from SE tax if you made one of the following elections to be covered under social security. These elections are irrevocable. You elected to be covered under social se- curity by filing Form 2031, Revocation of Exemption From Self-Employment Tax for Use by Ministers, Members of Religious Orders, and Christian Science Practition- ers, for your 1986, 1987, 2000, or 2001 tax year. You elected before 1968 to be covered un- der social security for your ministerial serv- ices. Requesting exemption. Table 2 briefly sum- marizes the procedure for requesting exemp- tion from the SE tax. More detailed explana- tions follow. If you are a minister, member of a reli- gious order, or Christian Science prac- titioner, an approved exemption only applies to earnings you receive for ministerial services , discussed earlier. It doesn't apply to any other self-employment income. Members of the Clergy To claim the exemption from SE tax, you must meet all of the following conditions. You file Form 4361, described below under Requesting Exemption \u2014Form 4361 . You are conscientiously opposed to public insurance because of your individual reli- gious considerations (not because of your general conscience), or you are opposed because of the principles of your religious denomination. You file for other than economic reasons. You inform the ordaining, commissioning, or licensing body of your church or order that you are opposed to public insurance if you are a minister or a member of a reli- gious order (other than a vow-of-poverty member). This requirement doesn't apply to Christian Science practitioners or read- ers. You establish that the organization that or- dained, commissioned, or licensed you, or your religious order, is a tax-exempt reli- gious organization. You establish that the organization is a church or a convention or association of churches. You didn't make an election discussed ear- lier under Who can't be exempt . You sign and return the statement the IRS mails to you to certify that you are request- ing an exemption based on the grounds lis- ted on the statement. TIP CAUTION!Requesting Exemption\u2014Form 4361 To request exemption from SE tax, file Form 4361 in triplicate (original and two copies) with the IRS. The IRS will return to you a copy of the Form 4361 that you filed indicating whether it has approved your exemp- tion. If it's approved, keep the approved copy of Form 4361 in your permanent records. When to file. File Form 4361 by the date your income tax return is due, including extensions, for the second tax year in which both of the fol- lowing are true. 1.You have net earnings from self-employ- ment of at least $400. 2.Any part of those net earnings was from ministerial services you performed as a: a.Minister, b.Member of a religious order, or c.Christian Science practitioner or reader. The 2 years don't have to be consecutive tax years. The approval process can take some time, so you should file Form 4361 as soon as possible. Example 1. Rev. Lawrence Jaeger, a member of the clergy ordained in 2022, has net self- employment earnings as a minister of $450 in 2022 and $500 in 2023. He must file his ap- plication for exemption by the due date, includ- ing extensions, for his 2023 income tax return. However, if Rev. Jaeger doesn't receive IRS approval for an exemption by April 15, 2024, his SE tax for 2023 is due by that date. Example 2. Rev. Louise Wolfe has only $300 in net self -employment earnings as a min- ister in 2022, but earned more than $400 in 2021 and expects to earn more than $400 in 2023. She must file her application for exemp- tion by the due date, including extensions, for her 2023 income tax return. However, if she doesn't receive IRS approval for an exemption by April 15, 2024, her SE tax for 2023 is due by that date. Example 3. In 2020, Rev. David Moss was ordained a minister and had $700 in net self- employment earnings as a minister. In 2021, he received $1,000 as a minister, but his related expenses were over $1,000. Therefore, he had no net self -employment earnings as a minister in 2021. Also in 2021, he opened a bookstore and had $8,000 in net self -employ- ment earnings from the store. In 2022, he had net self -employment earnings of $1,500 as a minister and $10,000 net self -employment earnings from the store. Rev. Moss had net earnings from self -em- ployment in 2020 and 2022 that were $400 or more each year, and part of the self -employ- ment earnings in each of those years was for his services as a minister. Thus, he must file his application for exemption by the due date, RECORDS TIPincluding extensions, for his 2022 income tax return. However, if Rev. Moss doesn't receive IRS approval for an exemption by April 18, 2023, his SE tax for 2022 is due by that date. Death of individual. The right to file an appli- cation for exemption ends with an individual's death. A surviving spouse, executor, or admin- istrator can't file an exemption application for a deceased clergy member. Effective date of exemption. An approved exemption is effective for all tax years after 1967 in which you have $400 or more of net earnings from self -employment and any part of those earnings is for services as a member of the clergy. Once the exemption is approved, it is irrevocable. Example. Rev. Trudy Austin, ordained in 2019, had $400 or more in net self -employment earnings, in both 2019 and 2022, part of which was from her services as a minister. She files an application for exemption on February 19, 2023. If an exemption is granted, it is effective for 2019 and the following years. Refunds of SE tax. If, after receiving an ap- proved Form 4361, you find that you overpaid SE tax, you can file a claim for refund on Form 1040- X. Generally, for a refund, you must file Form 1040 -X within 3 years from the date you filed the return or within 2 years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. A return you filed, or tax you paid, before the due date is considered to have been filed or paid on the due date. If you file a claim after the 3 -year period but within 2 years from the time you paid the tax, the credit or refund won't be more than the tax you paid within the 2 years immediately before you file the claim. Members of Recognized Religious Sects If you are a member of a recognized religious sect, or a division of a recognized religious sect, you can apply for an exemption from payment of social security and Medicare taxes on both your self -employment income and the wages you earn from an employer who also has an ex- emption. Exception. If you received social security ben- efits or payments, or anyone else received these benefits or payments based on your wa- ges or self -employment income, you can't ap- ply. However, if you pay your benefits back, you may be considered for exemption. Contact your local SSA office to find out the amount you must pay back. Eligibility requirements. To claim this ex- emption from SE tax, all of the following require- ments must be met. 1.You must file Form 4029, discussed later under Requesting Exemption \u2014Form 4029 . 2.As a follower of the established teachings of the sect or division, you must be consci- entiously opposed to accepting benefits of Page 6 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 6 Publication 517 (2022)any private or public insurance that makes payments for death, disability, old age, re- tirement, or medical care, or provides services for medical care. 3.You must waive all rights to receive any social security payment or benefit and agree that no benefits or payments will be made to anyone else based on your wa- ges and self-employment income. 4.The Commissioner of Social Security must determine that: a.Your sect or division has the estab- lished teachings as described in (2) above; b.It is the practice, and has been for a substantial period of time, for mem- bers of the sect or division to provide for their dependent members in a manner that is reasonable in view of the members' general level of living; and c.The sect or division has existed at all times since December 31, 1950. Requesting Exemption\u2014Form 4029 To request the exemption, file Form 4029 in triplicate (original and two copies) with the SSA at the address shown on the form. The sect or division must complete part of the form. The IRS will return to you a copy of the Form 4029 that you filed indicating whether it has approved your exemp- tion. If it is approved, keep the approved copy of Form 4029 in your permanent records. When to file. You can file Form 4029 at any time. If you have an approved exemption from SE tax and for some reason that approved exemp- tion ended, you must file a new Form 4029 if you subsequently meet the eligibility require- ments , discussed earlier. See Effective date of exemption next for information on when the newly approved exemption would become ef- fective. If you have a previously approved exemp- tion from SE tax, you are considered to have met the requirements for exemption from social security and Medicare taxes on wages and don't need to file a new Form 4029. Effective date of exemption. An approved exemption from SE tax is generally effective for all tax years beginning with the first year you meet the eligibility requirements discussed ear- lier. (For example, if you meet the eligibility re- quirements in 2020, file Form 4029 in 2021, and the IRS approves your exemption in 2022, your exemption is effective for tax year 2020 and all later years.) The exemption will end if you fail to meet the eligibility requirements or if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the sect or di- vision fails to meet them. You must notify the IRS within 60 days if you are no longer a mem- ber of the religious group, or if you no longer fol- low the established teachings of this group. The exemption will end for the tax year in which you RECORDSor your sect/division first fails to meet the eligi- bility requirements. Refunds of SE tax paid. To get a refund of any SE tax you paid while the exemption was in effect, file Form 1040 -X. For information on fil- ing this form, see Refunds of SE tax under Re- questing Exemption\u2014Form 4361 , earlier. Exemption From FICA Taxes Generally, under FICA, the employer and the employee each pay half of the social security and Medicare tax. Both the employee and the employer, if they meet the eligibility require- ments , discussed earlier, can apply to be ex- empt from their share of FICA taxes on wages paid by the employer to the employee. A partnership in which each partner holds a religious exemption from social security and Medicare tax is an employer for this purpose. If the employer's application is ap- proved, the exemption will apply only to FICA taxes on wages paid to employ- ees who also received an approval of identical applications. Information for employers. If you have an approved Form 4029 and you have an em- ployee who has an approved Form 4029, don't report wages you paid to the employee as so- cial security and Medicare wages. If you have an employee who doesn't have an approved Form 4029, you must withhold the employee's share of social security and Medi- care taxes and pay the employer's share. Form W -2. When preparing a Form W -2 for an employee with an approved Form 4029, enter \"Form 4029\" in box 14, \"Other.\" Don't make any entries in box 3, 4, 5, or 6. Forms 941, 943, and 944. If both you and your employee have received approved Forms 4029, don't include these exempt wages on the following forms. Instead, follow the instructions given below. Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Fed- eral Tax Return: check the box on line 4 and enter \"Form 4029\" in the empty space below the checkbox. Form 943, Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees: enter \"Form 4029\" on the dotted line next to the lines 2 and 4 entry spaces. Form 944, Employer's ANNUAL Federal Tax Return: check the box on line 3 and enter \"Form 4029\" in the empty space be- low the checkbox. Effective date. An approved exemption from FICA becomes effective on the first day of the first calendar quarter after the quarter in which you file Form 4029. The exemption will end on the last day of the calendar quarter be- fore the quarter in which the employer, em- ployee, sect, or division fails to meet the re- quirements. TIPSelf-Employment Tax: Figuring Net Earnings There are two methods for figuring your net earnings from self -employment as a member of the clergy or a religious worker. Regular method. Nonfarm optional method. You may find Worksheets 1 through 3 helpful in figuring your net earnings from self -employment. Blank work- sheets are in the back of this publication. Regular Method Most people use the regular method. Under this method, figure your net earnings from self -em- ployment by totaling your gross income for services you performed as a minister, a mem- ber of a religious order who hasn't taken a vow of poverty, or a Christian Science practitioner or reader. Then, subtract your allowable business deductions and multiply the difference by 92.35% (0.9235). Use Schedule SE (Form 1040) to figure your net earnings and SE tax. If you are an employee of a church that elec- ted to exclude you from FICA coverage, figure net earnings by multiplying your church wages shown on Form W -2 by 92.35% (0.9235). Don't reduce your wages by any business deductions when making this computation. Use Sched- ule SE (Form 1040), to figure your net earnings and SE tax. If you have an approved exemption, or you are automatically exempt, don't in- clude the income or deductions from ministerial services in figuring your net earnings from self-employment. Amounts included in gross income. To fig- ure your net earnings from self -employment (on Schedule SE (Form 1040)), include in gross in- come: 1.Salaries and fees for your ministerial serv- ices (discussed earlier); 2.Offerings you receive for marriages, bap- funerals, masses, etc.; 3.The value of meals and lodging provided to you, your spouse, and your dependents for your employer's convenience; 4.The fair rental value of a parsonage provi- ded to you (including the cost of utilities that are furnished) and the rental allow- ance (including an amount for payment of utilities) paid to you; and 5.Any amount a church pays toward your in- come tax or SE tax, other than withholding the amount from your salary. This amount is also subject to income tax. For the income tax treatment of items (2) and (4), see Income Tax: Income and Expen- ses, later. Example. Pastor Roger Adams receives an annual salary of $39,000 as a full -time minister. The $39,000 includes $5,000 that is TIP of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 517 (2022) Page 7designated as a rental allowance to pay utilities. His church owns a parsonage that has a fair rental value of $12,000 per year. The church gives Pastor Adams the use of the parsonage. He isn't exempt from SE tax. He must include $51,000 ($39,000 plus $12,000) when figuring his net earnings for SE tax purposes. The results would be the same if, instead of the use of the parsonage and receipt of the rental allowance for utilities, Pastor Adams had received an annual salary of $51,000 of which $17,000 ($5,000 plus $12,000) per year was designated as a rental allowance. Overseas duty. Your net earnings from self- employment are determined without any foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion or deduction if you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien serving abroad and liv- ing in a foreign country. For information on excluding foreign earned income or the foreign housing amount, see Pub. 54. Example. Diane Jones was the minister of a U.S. church in Mexico. She earned $35,000 in that position and was able to exclude it all for in- come tax purposes under the foreign earned in- come exclusion. The United States doesn't have a social security agreement with Mexico, so Mrs. Jones is subject to U.S. SE tax and must include $35,000 when figuring net earn- ings from self-employment. Specified U.S. territories. The exclusion from gross income for amounts derived from Ameri- can Samoa or Puerto Rico doesn't apply in fig- uring net earnings from self -employment. Also see Residents of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Is- lands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the North- ern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Sa- moa , earlier, under U.S. Citizens and Resident and Nonresident Aliens . Amounts not included in gross income. Don't include the following amounts in gross in- come when figuring your net earnings from self-employment. Offerings that others made to the church. Contributions by your church to a tax-shel- tered annuity plan set up for you, including any salary reduction contributions (elective deferrals) that aren't included in your gross income. Pension payments or retirement allowan- ces you receive for your past ministerial services. The rental value of a parsonage or a par- sonage allowance provided to you after you retire. Allowable deductions. When figuring your net earnings from self -employment, deduct all your expenses related to your ministerial serv- ices performed as a self -employed person. These are ministerial expenses you incurred while working other than as a common -law em- ployee of the church. They include expenses in- curred in performing marriages and baptisms, and in delivering speeches. Deduct these ex- penses on Schedule C (Form 1040), and carry the net amount to line 2 of Schedule SE (Form 1040).Wages earned as a common -law employee (explained earlier) of a church are generally subject to self -employment tax unless an ex- emption is requested, as discussed earlier un- der Exemption From Self -Employment (SE) Tax. Subtract any allowable expenses from those wages, include the net amount on line 2 of Schedule SE (Form 1040), and attach an ex- planation. Don't complete Schedule C (Form 1040). Employee reimbursement arrangements. If you received an advance, allowance, or reim- bursement for your employee expenses, how you report this amount and your employee ex- penses depends on whether your employer re- imbursed you under an accountable plan or a nonaccountable plan. Ask your employer if you aren't sure if it reimburses you using an ac- countable or a nonaccountable plan. Accountable plans. To be an accountable plan, your employer's reimbursement arrange- ment must include all three of the following rules. Your expenses must have a business con- nection\u2014that is, you must have paid or in- curred deductible expenses while perform- ing services as an employee of your employer. You must adequately account to your em- ployer for these expenses within a reason- able period of time. You must return any excess reimburse- ment or allowance within a reasonable pe- riod of time. The reimbursement isn't reported on your Form W -2. Generally, if your expenses equal your reimbursement, you have no deduction. If your expenses are more than your reimburse- ment, you can deduct your excess expenses for SE tax and income tax purposes. Nonaccountable plan. A nonaccountable plan is a reimbursement arrangement that doesn't meet one or more of the three rules lis- ted under Accountable plans above. In addition, even if your employer has an accountable plan, the following payments will be treated as being paid under a nonaccountable plan. Excess reimbursements you fail to return to your employer. Reimbursement of nondeductible expen- ses related to your employer's business. Your employer will combine any reimburse- ment paid to you under a nonaccountable plan with your wages, salary, or other compensation and report the combined total in box 1 of your Form W -2. Because reimbursements under a nonaccountable plan are included in your gross income, you can deduct your related expenses (for SE tax and income tax purposes) regard- less of whether they are more than, less than, or equal to your reimbursement. For more information on accountable and nonaccountable plans, see Pub. 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses. Married Couple Missionary Team If both spouses are duly ordained, commis- sioned, or licensed ministers of a church and have an agreement that each will perform spe- cific services for which they are paid jointly or separately, they must divide the self -employ- ment income according to the agreement. If the agreement is with one spouse only and the other spouse isn't paid for any specific duties, amounts received for their services are included only in the self -employment income of the spouse having the agreement. Earnings Subject to SE Tax For 2022, the maximum net earnings from self- employment subject to social security (old age, survivors, and disability insurance) tax is $147,000 minus any wages and tips you earned that were subject to social security tax. The tax rate for the social security part is 12.4%. In ad- dition, all of your net earnings are subject to the Medicare (hospital insurance) part of the SE tax. This tax rate is 2.9%. The combined self-employment tax rate is 15.3%. Additional Medicare Tax. A 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax applies to Medicare wages, RRTA compensation, and self -employment in- come that are more than: $125,000 if married filing separately, $250,000 if married filing jointly, or $200,000 for any other filing status. Medicare wages and self -employment income are combined to determine if income exceeds the threshold. A self -employment loss isn't con- sidered for purposes of this tax. RRTA compen- sation is separately compared to the threshold. For more information, see Form 8959, Addi- tional Medicare Tax, and its separate instruc- tions. Nonfarm Optional Method You may be able to use the nonfarm optional method for figuring your net earnings from self- employment. In general, the nonfarm op- tional method is intended to permit continued coverage for social security and Medicare pur- poses when your income for the tax year is low. You may use the nonfarm optional method if you meet all of the following tests. 1.You are self-employed on a regular basis. You meet this test if your actual net earn- ings from self-employment were $400 or more in at least 2 of the 3 tax years before the one for which you use this method. The net earnings can be from either farm or nonfarm earnings or both. 2.You have used this method less than 5 prior years. (There is a 5-year lifetime limit.) The years don't have to be consecu- tive. 3.Your net than 72.189% of your gross non- farm income. If you meet all three tests, use Table 3 to fig- ure your net earnings from self -employment un- der the nonfarm optional method.Page 8 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Multiply your total earn- ings subject to SE tax by 92.35% (0.9235) to get actual net earnings. Actual net earnings are equivalent to net earnings under the \"Regular Method.\" More information. For more information on the nonfarm optional method, see Pub. 334, Tax Guide for Small Business, and the Instruc- tions for Schedule SE (Form 1040). Income Tax: Income and Expenses Some income and expense items are treated the same for both income tax and SE tax purpo- ses and some are treated differently. Note. For purposes of this section, referen- ces to members of the clergy are only to minis- ters or members of a religious order. Income Items The tax treatment of offerings and fees, outside earnings, rental allowances, rental value of a parsonage, earnings of members of religious orders, and foreign earned income is discussed here. Offerings and Fees If you are a member of the clergy, you must in- clude in your income offerings and fees you re- ceive for marriages, baptisms, funerals, masses, etc., in addition to your salary. If the of- fering is made to the religious institution, it isn't taxable to you. Outside Earnings If you are a member of a religious organization and you give your outside earnings to the or- ganization, you still must include the earnings in your income. However, you may be entitled to a charitable contribution deduction for the amount paid to the organization. For more information, see Pub. 526. Exclusion of Rental Allowance and Fair Rental Value of a Parsonage Ordained, commissioned, or licensed ministers of the gospel may be able to exclude from in- come tax the rental allowance or fair rental value of a parsonage that is provided to them as pay for their services. Services include: Ministerial services , discussed earlier; Administrative duties and teaching at theo- logical seminaries; and The ordinary duties of a minister performed as an employee of the United States (other than as a chaplain in the Armed Forces), a state, territory, political subdivision, or the District of Columbia. This exclusion applies only for income tax purposes. It doesn't apply for SE tax purposes, as discussed earlier under Amounts included in gross income under Self- Employment Tax: Fig- uring Net Earnings . Designation requirement. The church or or- ganization that employs you must officially des- ignate the payment as a housing allowance be- fore it makes the payment. It must designate a definite amount. It can't determine the amount of the housing allowance at a later date. If the church or organization doesn't officially desig- nate a definite amount as a housing allowance, you must include your total salary in your in- come. If you are employed and paid by a local con- gregation, a resolution by a national church agency of your denomination doesn't effectively designate a housing allowance for you. The lo- cal congregation must officially designate the part of your salary that is a housing allowance. However, a resolution of a national church agency can designate your housing allowance if you are directly employed by the national agency. An official designation of an amount as a housing or rental allowance may be shown in an employment contract, in the minutes of a church or qualified organization, in a budget, or in any official action taken in advance of pay- ment of the allowance. A designation is suffi- cient if it permits a payment to be identified as a payment of a rental or housing allowance as distinguished from salary or other remuneration. Informal discussions don't amount to an offi- cial designation. However, the facts and cir- cumstances of a designation may demonstrate that the designation was official. A church or employing organization may report the rental allowance or fair rental value of the parsonage (and util- ities) in box 14 of Form W-2. Rental allowances. If you receive in your sal- ary an amount officially designated as a rental allowance (including an amount to pay utility costs), you can exclude the allowance from your gross income if: You use the amount to provide or rent a home, and The amount isn't more than reasonable pay for your services. The amount you exclude can't be more than the fair rental value of the home, including fur- nishings, plus the cost of utilities. Fair rental value of parsonage. You can ex- clude from gross income the fair rental value of a house or parsonage, including utilities, fur- nished to you as part of your earnings. How- TIPever, the exclusion can't be more than the rea- sonable pay for your services. If you pay for the utilities, you can exclude any allowance desig- nated for utility costs, up to your actual cost. Example. Rev. Joanna Baker is a full -time minister. The church allows her to use a par- sonage that has an annual fair rental value of $24,000. The church pays her an annual salary of $67,000, of which $7,500 is designated for utility costs. Her actual utility costs during the year were $7,000. For income tax purposes, Rev. Baker ex- cludes $31,000 from gross income ($24,000 fair rental value of the parsonage plus $7,000 from the allowance for utility costs). She will report $60,000 ($59,500 salary plus $500 of unused utility allowance). Her income for SE tax purpo- ses, however, is $91,000 ($67,000 salary + $24,000 fair rental value of the parsonage). Home ownership. If you own your home and you receive as part of your salary a housing or rental allowance, you may exclude from gross income the smallest of: The amount actually used to provide a home; The amount officially designated as a rental allowance; or The fair rental value of the home, including furnishings, utilities, garage, etc. Excess rental allowance. You must in- clude in gross income the amount of any rental allowance that is more than the smallest of: Your reasonable salary, The fair rental value of the home plus utilit- ies, or The amount actually used to provide a home. Include this amount in the total on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR, line 1a. On the dotted line next to line 1a, enter \"Excess allowance\" and the amount. You may deduct the home mortgage interest and real estate taxes paid on your home even though you pay all or part of those expenses with funds you get through a tax -free rental or parsonage allow- ance. However, you can only deduct these ex- penses as itemized deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). Retired ministers. If you are a retired minister, you can exclude from your gross income the rental value of a home (plus utilities) furnished to you by your church as a part of your pay for past services, or the part of your pension that was designated as a rental allowance. How- ever, a minister's surviving spouse can't ex- clude the rental value unless the rental value is for ministerial services he or she performs or performed. Teachers or administrators. If you are a min- ister employed as a teacher or administrator by a church school, college, or university, you are performing ministerial services for purposes of the housing exclusion. However, if you perform services as a teacher or administrator on the faculty of a nonchurch college, you can't ex- clude from your income a housing allowance or TIPPage 9 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 517 (2022) Page 9the value of a home that the college provides to you. If you live in faculty lodging as an em- ployee of an educational institution or academic health center, all or part of the value of that lodging may be nontaxable un- der a different rule. In Pub. 525, see Faculty lodging in the discussion on meals and lodging under Fringe Benefits . If you serve as a minister of music or minis- ter of education, or serve in an administrative or other function of your religious organization, but aren't authorized to perform substantially all of the religious duties of an ordained minister in your church (even if you are commissioned as a minister of the gospel), the housing exclusion doesn't apply to you. Theological students. If you are a theological student serving a required internship as a part- time or assistant pastor, you can't exclude a parsonage or rental allowance from your in- come unless you are ordained, commissioned, or licensed as a minister. Traveling evangelists. You can exclude a designated rental allowance from out -of-town churches if you meet all of the following require- ments. You are an ordained minister. You perform ministerial services at churches located away from your com- munity. You actually use the rental allowance to maintain your permanent home. Cantors. If you have a bona fide commission and your congregation employs you on a full-time basis to perform substantially all the re- ligious functions of the Jewish faith, you can ex- clude a rental allowance from your gross in- come. Earnings\u2014Members of Religious Orders Your earnings may be exempt from both in- come tax and SE tax if you are a member of a religious order who: Has taken a vow of poverty, Receives earnings for services performed as an agent of the order and in the exer- cise of duties required by the order, and Renounces the earnings and gives them to the order. See Members of Religious Orders , earlier, under Social Security Coverage . Foreign Earned Income Certain income may be exempt from income tax if you work in a foreign country or in a specified U.S. territory. Pub. 54 discusses the foreign earned income exclusion. Pub. 570, Tax Guide for Individuals With Income From U.S. Posses- sions, covers the rules for taxpayers with in- come from U.S. territories. You can get these free publications from the IRS at IRS.gov/Forms or from most U.S. embassies or consulates. TIPExpense Items The tax treatment of expenses allocable to tax-free income and health insurance costs is discussed here. Expenses Allocable to Tax-Free Income If you receive a rental or parsonage allowance that is exempt from income tax (tax free), you must allocate a portion of the expenses of oper- ating your ministry to that tax -free income. You can't deduct the portion of your expenses that you allocate to your tax-free rental or parsonage allowance. Exception. This rule doesn't apply to your de- ductions for home mortgage interest or real es- tate taxes on your home. Figuring the allocation. Figure the portion of your otherwise deductible expenses that you can't deduct (because you must allocate that portion to tax -free income) by multiplying the expenses by the following fraction: Tax-free rental or parsonage allowance All income (taxable and tax free) earned from your ministry When figuring the allocation, include the in- come and expenses related to the ministerial duties you perform both as an employee and as a self-employed person. Reduce your otherwise deductible ex- penses only in figuring your income tax, not your SE tax. Example. Rev. Charles Ashford received $40,000 in earnings for ministerial services con- sisting of a $28,000 salary for ministerial serv- ices performed as an employee, $2,000 for weddings and baptisms performed as a self- employed person, and a $10,000 tax -free parsonage allowance. He incurred $4,000 of unreimbursed expenses connected with his earnings for ministerial services: $3,500 of the $4,000 is for employee expenses related to his ministerial salary. He is no longer able to deduct the $3,500 incurred for employee expenses re- lated to his ministerial salary. Miscellaneous itemized deductions aren't allowed for tax years 2018 through 2025 pursuant to section 67(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. Since the $500 is related to the weddings and baptisms he per- formed as a self -employed person, this amount is otherwise deductible. Rev. Ashford figures the nondeductible (tax- free) portion of expenses related to his wedding and baptism income as follows: ($10,000 \u00f7 $40,000) x $500 = $125 Required statement. If you receive a tax -free rental or parsonage allowance and have minis- terial expenses, attach a statement to your tax TIPreturn. The statement must contain all of the fol- lowing information. A list of each item of taxable ministerial in- come by source (such as wages, salary, weddings, baptisms, etc.) plus the amount. A list of each item of tax-free ministerial in- come by source (parsonage allowance) plus the amount. A list of each item of otherwise deductible ministerial expenses plus the amount. How you figured the nondeductible part of your otherwise deductible expenses. A statement that the other deductions claimed on your tax return aren't allocable to your tax-free income. At the end of this publication, you will find blank worksheets for your own use. Health Insurance Costs of Self-Employed Ministers If you are self -employed, you may be able to deduct the amount you paid in 2022 for medical and dental insurance and qualified long -term care insurance for you, your spouse, your de- pendents, and any child you may have who, as of the end of the tax year, had not attained age 27. For purposes of this deduction, your child must be an individual who is your son, daugh- ter, stepson, stepdaughter, or eligible foster child. An individual who has been legally adop- ted by you (or placed with you for adoption) will be treated as your child. If you qualify, you can take this deduction as an adjustment to income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 17. See the Instructions for Form 1040 to figure your deduction. The following special rules apply to the self-employed health insurance deduction. You can't take a medical expense deduc- tion on Schedule A (Form 1040) for any ex- penses you claim for purposes of the self-employed health insurance deduction. You can't take the deduction for any month you are eligible to participate in a subsi- dized plan of your (or your spouse's) em- ployer. The deduction can't exceed your net earn- ings from the business under which the in- surance plan is established. Your net earn- ings under this rule don't include the income you earned as a common -law em- ployee (discussed earlier) of a church. More information. For more information about the self -employed health insurance de- duction, see chapter 6 in Pub. 535. Deduction for SE Tax You can deduct one -half of your SE tax in figur- ing AGI. This is an income tax deduction only, which is claimed on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 15. This deduction doesn't include taxes imposed by section 1401(b)(2), pursuant to section 164(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.Page 10 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Income Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax The federal income tax is a pay -as-you- go tax. You must pay the tax as you earn or receive in- come during the year. An employee usually has income tax withheld from his or her wages or salary. However, your salary isn't subject to fed- eral income tax withholding if both of the follow- ing conditions apply. You are a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister, a member of a religious order (who hasn't taken a vow of poverty), or a Christian Science practitioner or reader. Your salary is for ministerial services (see Ministerial Services , earlier). If your salary isn't subject to withholding, or if you don't pay enough tax through withholding, you may need to make estimated tax payments to avoid penalties for not paying enough tax as you earn your income. You must generally make estimated tax pay- ments if you expect to owe taxes, including SE tax, of $1,000 or more, when you file your re- turn. Determine your estimated tax by using the worksheets in Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. You can also use the IRS With- holding Estimator at IRS.gov/W4App . Pay the entire estimated tax for 2023 or the first install- ment by April 18, 2023. See Form 1040 -ES for the different payment methods. The April 18 date applies whether or not your tax home and your abode are outside the United States and CAUTION!Puerto Rico. For more information, see chap- ter 2 of Pub. 505. If you perform your services as a com- mon- law employee of the church and your sal- ary isn't subject to income tax withholding, you can enter into a voluntary withholding agree- ment with the church to cover any income and SE tax that may be due. Filing Your Return You must file an income tax return for 2022 if your gross income was at least the amount shown in the third column of Table 4 . Additional requirements. Even if your in- come was less than the amount shown in Ta- ble 4 , you must file an income tax return on Form 1040 or 1040 -SR, and attach a completed Schedule SE (Form 1040), if: You aren't exempt from SE tax, and you have net earnings from self-employment (discussed earlier under Self-Employment Tax: Figuring Net Earnings ) of $400 or more in the tax year; You are exempt from SE tax on earnings from ministerial services and you have $400 or more of other net earnings subject to SE tax; or You had wages of $108.28 or more from an electing church or church-controlled or- ganization (see Coverage of Religious Workers (Church Employees) , earlier, un- der Social Security Coverage ). Self- employment tax. For services in the ex- ercise of the ministry, members of the clergy re- ceive a Form W- 2, but do not have social secur- ity or Medicare taxes withheld. You must pay social security and Medicare taxes by filing Schedule SE (Form 1040) with your return.If you filed Form 4361 and didn't receive ap- proval from the IRS, you must pay SE tax on your ministerial earnings , as explained earlier. You should report ministerial earnings and ex- penses from nonemployee ministerial services on Schedule C (Form 1040). You should then carry the net amount over to line 2 of Sched- ule SE (Form 1040). However, if you were a duly ordained minister who was an employee of a church and you must pay SE tax on the wa- ges you earned for those services, don't report those wages on Schedule C (Form 1040). In- stead, report those wages less any allowable expenses on line 2 of Schedule SE (Form 1040) and attach an explanation. Exemption from SE tax. If you filed Form 4361 and received IRS approval not to be taxed on your ministerial earnings, and you don't have any other income subject to SE tax, don't file Schedule SE (Form 1040). Instead, enter \"Ex- empt\u2014 Form 4361\" on the dotted line next to Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 4. However, if you had net earnings from another trade or busi- ness of $400 or more subject to SE tax, see line A at the top of Schedule SE (Form 1040). If you filed Form 4029 and received IRS ap- proval not to be taxed on those earnings, and you don't have any other income subject to SE tax, don't file Schedule SE (Form 1040). In- stead, enter \"Exempt \u2014Form 4029\" on the dot- ted line next to Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 4. More information. For more information on filing your return, including when and where to file it, see the Instructions for Form 1040. Table 4. 2022 Filing Requirements for Most Taxpayers IF your filing status is...AND at the end of 2022 you were*...THEN file a return if your gross income** was at least... Singleunder age 65 65 or older$12,950 14,700 Married filing jointly***under 65 (both spouses) 65 or older (one spouse) 65 or older (both spouses)$25,900 27,300 28,700 Married filing separately any age $5 Head of household under 65 65 or older$19,400 20,800 Qualifying surviving spouseunder 65 65 or older$25,900 27,300 * If you were born on January 1, 1958, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2022. (If your spouse died in 2022 or you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2022, see Pub. 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.) ** Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can exclude part or all of it). Don't include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any time in 2022, or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the instructions for Form 1040, lines 6a and 6b, to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D (Form 1040). Gross income from a business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C (Form 1040), line 7; or Schedule F (Form 1040), line 9. But, in figuring gross income, don't reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C (Form 1040), line 7; or Schedule F (Form 1040), line 9. *** If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2022 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least $5, you must file a return regardless of your age.Page 11 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

You can generally deduct your con- tributions to the plan. Your contributions and the earnings on them generally aren't taxed until they are distributed. Retirement plans for the self -employed. To set up one of the following plans, you must be self-employed. SEP (simplified employee pension) plan. SIMPLE (savings incentive match plan for employees) plan. Qualified retirement plan (also called a Keogh or H.R. 10 plan), including a 401(k) plan. The common -law rules determine whether you are an employee or a self -employed person for purposes of setting up a retirement plan. See Employment status for other tax purposes under Coverage of Members of the Clergy , ear- lier. This result is true even if your compensa- tion for ministerial services (defined earlier) is subject to SE tax. For example, if a congregation pays you a salary for performing ministerial services and you are subject to the congregation's control, you are generally a common -law employee. You aren't a self -employed person for purposes of setting up a retirement plan. This result is true even if your salary is subject to SE tax. On the other hand, amounts received di- rectly from members of the congregation, such as fees for performing marriages, baptisms, or other personal services that you report on Schedule C (Form 1040), are earnings from self-employment for all tax purposes. For more information on establishing a SEP, SIMPLE, or qualified retirement plan, see Pub. 560, Retirement Plans for Small Business. Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). The traditional IRA and the Roth IRA are two in- dividual retirement arrangements you can use to save money for your retirement. Generally, your maximum contribution for 2022 to either of these plans (or to a combination of the two) is the smaller of your taxable compensation or $6,000 ($7,000 if you are age 50 or older by the end of 2022). However, your maximum contribution to a Roth IRA will be further reduced or eliminated if your AGI is above a certain amount. You can't deduct Roth IRA contributions, but if you satisfy certain requirements, all earnings in the Roth IRA are tax free and neither your nondeductible contributions nor any earnings on them are tax- able when distributed. If you contribute to a traditional IRA, your contribution may be deductible. However, your deduction may be reduced or eliminated if you or your spouse is covered by an employer re- tirement plan (including, but not limited to, a SEP, SIMPLE, or qualified retirement plan). For more information on IRAs, see Pub. 590- A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements.Tax- sheltered annuity plans. Church em- ployees, members of religious orders, and duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed ministers working as ministers or chaplains can generally participate in tax -sheltered annuity (403(b)) plans. For more information, see Pub. 571, Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans. Deducting contributions to tax -sheltered annuity plans. If you are an employee, your employer may exclude allowable contributions to a 403(b) plan from your income. These con- tributions won't be included in your total wages on your Form W -2, but you will pay tax on distri- butions from your plan. However, if you choose to have contributions made to a Roth contribu- tion program, they won't be excluded from your income, but will be distributed tax free if you satisfy certain requirements. You may also participate in a 403(b) plan if you are a minister or chaplain and, in the exer- cise of your ministry, you are either self -em- ployed or employed by an organization that isn't exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. If either situation ap- plies to you, you can deduct your contributions to a 403(b) plan as explained next. If you are self-employed, deduct your con- tributions on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 16. If you aren't self-employed and your em- ployer doesn't exclude your contributions from your earned income, deduct your contributions on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24g. Retirement savings contributions credit. You may be able to take a tax credit of up to $1,000 (up to $2,000 if filing jointly) for certain contributions you make to any of the retirement plans or IRAs discussed earlier. The credit is based on the contributions you make and your credit rate. Your credit rate can be as low as 10% or as high as 50%, depending on your fil- ing status and AGI. Figure the credit on Form 8880, Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contributions. You can't take the credit if any of the follow- ing apply. 1.You were born after January 1, 2004. 2.You were a student who during any part of 5 calendar months (not necessarily con- secutive) of 2022: a.Was enrolled as a full-time student at a school that has a regular teaching staff, course of study, and regularly enrolled body of students in attend- ance; or b.Took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school that has a regular teaching staff, course of study, and regularly enrolled body of stu- dents in attendance or a state, county, or local government agency. 3.Someone, such as your parent(s), claims an exemption for you on his or her 2022 tax return. 4.Your AGI for 2022 is more than: a.$68,000, if your filing status is married filing jointly;b.$51,000, if your filing status is head of household; or c.$34,000, if your filing status is single, married filing separately, or qualifying surviving spouse. School. A school includes technical, trade, and mechanical schools. It doesn't include on-the- job training courses, correspondence schools, or schools offering courses only through the Internet. Full- time student. You are a full -time stu- dent if you are enrolled for the number of hours or courses the school considers to be full time. AGI. When figuring AGI, you must add back any exclusion or deduction claimed for the year for: 1.Foreign earned income, 2.Foreign housing costs, 3.Income of bona fide residents of American Samoa, and 4.Income of bona fide residents of Puerto Rico. More information. For more information about the credit, see Pub. 590-A. Earned Income Credit (EIC) The EIC is a tax credit for certain people who work. If you qualify for it, the EIC reduces the tax you owe. The EIC may give you a refund even if you don't owe any tax. You can't take the credit for 2022 if your earned income (or adjusted gross income) is: $16,480 or more ($22,610 or more if mar- ried filing jointly) and you don't have a qualifying child, $43,492 or more ($49,622 or more if mar- ried filing jointly) and you have one qualify- ing child, $49,399 or more ($55,529 or more if mar- ried filing jointly) and you have two qualify- ing children, or $53,057 or more ($59,187 if married filing jointly) and you have three or more qualify- ing children. Earned income. Earned income includes your: 1.Wages, salaries, tips, and other taxable employee compensation (even if these amounts are exempt from FICA or SECA under an approved Form 4029 or 4361); and 2.Net earnings from self-employment that are not exempt from SECA (you don't have an approved Form 4029 or 4361) that you report on Schedule SE (Form 1040), line 3, with the following adjust- ments. a.Subtract the amount you claimed (or should have claimed) on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 15, for the deducti- ble part of your SE tax.Page 12 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Reporting and resolving your tax -related identity theft issues. Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be af- fected if your SSN is used to file a fraudu- lent return or to claim a refund or credit. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with tax- payers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify per- sonal or financial information. This in- cludes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar in- formation for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts. Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft , the IRS Iden- tity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protec- tion for taxpayers, tax professionals, and Page 16 of 18 Fileid: ... tions/p517/2022/a/xml/cycle05/source 13:44 - 29-Nov-2022 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you're a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to tax- payers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax re- turns. When you have an IP PIN, it pre- vents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN . Ways to check on the status of your refund. Go to IRS.gov/Refunds . Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status. Call the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954. Note. The IRS can't issue refunds before mid- February for returns that claimed the EIC or the additional child tax credit (ACTC). This ap- plies to the entire refund, not just the portion as- sociated with these credits. Making a tax payment. Go to IRS.gov/ Payments for information on how to make a payment using any of the following options. IRS Direct Pay : Pay your individual tax bill or estimated tax payment directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you. Debit or Credit Card : Choose an approved payment processor to pay online or by phone. Electronic Funds Withdrawal : Schedule a payment when filing your federal taxes us- ing tax return preparation software or through a tax professional. Electronic Federal Tax Payment System : Best option for businesses. Enrollment is required. Check or Money Order : Mail your payment to the address listed on the notice or in- structions. Cash : You may be able to pay your taxes with cash at a participating retail store. Same-Day Wire : You may be able to do same-day wire from your financial institu- tion.

The IRS uses the latest encryption technology to ensure that the electronic pay- ments you make online, by phone, or from a mobile device using the IRS2Go app are safe and secure. Paying electronically is quick, easy, and faster than mailing in a check or money or- der. What if I can't pay now? Go to IRS.gov/ Payments for more information about your op- tions. Apply for an online payment agreement (IRS.gov/OPA ) to meet your tax obligation in monthly installments if you can't pay your taxes in full today.

Filing an amended return. Go to IRS.gov/ Form1040X for information and updates. Checking the status of your amended re- turn. Go to IRS.gov/WMAR to track the status of Form 1040-X amended returns.

Understanding an IRS notice or letter you've received. Go to IRS.gov/Notices to find additional information about responding to an IRS notice or letter. Note. You can use Schedule LEP (Form 1040), Request for Change in Language Prefer- ence, to state a preference to receive notices, letters, or other written communications from the IRS in an alternative language. You may not immediately receive written communications in the requested language. The IRS's commitment to LEP taxpayers is part of a multi -year timeline that is scheduled to begin providing translations in 2023. You will continue to receive communi- cations, including notices and letters in English until they are translated to your preferred lan- guage. Contacting your local IRS office.
