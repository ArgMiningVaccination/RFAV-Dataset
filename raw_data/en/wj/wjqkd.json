Two laws in Texas that both facilitate and regulate medical care are the Texas Natural Death Act (TNDA) and the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPOAHC). The TNDA implements the treatment wishes of the patient who is terminally ill. The DPOAHC designates a proxy to make medical decisions for patients when they become incompetent. Because these laws can provide considerable help in caring for terminally ill or incompetent patients, physicians in Texas should understand these laws and use them in their practices. "}
