Some changes have had to be made for us to provide a safe environment for both you, and your chiropractor. We ask you to familiarise yourself with our Covid-19 safety protocol prior to your appointment. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Appointment availability will be on a reduced schedule to ensure that there is adequate time to clean in between patients to maintain a safe and hygienic environment. Prior to your appointment: You will be asked to fill out a [risk assessment and consent form](https://yorkshirechiropracticclinic.co.uk/covid-19-consent-form/). We ask patients to pay online in advance where possible. If for any reason treatment cannot be carried out this fee will be refunded back to you. Upon arrival: Please bring your own face mask (single use face masks can be purchased at the clinic for a \u00a31 charge). Please bring a clean towel as a bench covering. Wear comfortable, clean clothes that are appropriate for treatment (shorts/loose trousers, vest/t-shirt). Only bring essential items with you into the clinic. Leave accessory items at home or in the car (watches, jewellery, bags). Please do not bring friends or family members in with you as we can only permit one patient in the clinic at a time. If you are presenting with any Covid-19 symptoms, we will be unable to carry out treatment. We will ask you to wash your hands before treatment. During your appointment: Your chiropractor will be wearing Personal Protective Equipment (gloves, mask) We ask that you also wear your face covering, we will not treat anybody who refuses to do so. After your appointment: Your chiropractor will dispose of the PPE equipment and will be washing hands between every patient. All surfaces will be cleaned and disinfected ready for the next patient. To help reduce the spread of the infection, our toilet facilities will not be available for use. If you or anyone in your household are presenting with Covid-19 symptoms, DO NOT come in for treatment. Please contact the clinic and re-schedule your appointment for 2 weeks later. You will not be charged a cancellation fee; however, you will be charged if you fail to inform us that you will not be attending the appointment. Thank you for your cooperation. "}
