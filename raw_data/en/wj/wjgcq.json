Empathy 18 levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale. 19 The learning experience consisted of collaborative meetings with stakeholders from 20 the refuge sector, fieldwork, individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving in 21 teams. Students then developed design guides for refuges that demonstrated their 22 emerging understanding of the specific needs and perspectives of the issues faced by 23 women and children who were homeless. 24 A convenience sample of 48 students (nursing n = 22; architecture n = 11; and 25 landscape n = 13) participated in the study. Participants were aged from 19 to 37 years with 26 an average of 23.8 years (SD= 3.65). Pre-post Comprehensive State Empathy Scale results 27 indicated that the empathy levels of nursing and landscape students increased and those of 28 architecture students decreased, however, these results were not statistically significant. 29 In Australia, one in six women have experienced domestic violence and domestic 30 violence remains the single largest cause of homelessness for women. Yet reports suggest 31 that these women frequently encounter discrimination, both in the community and when 32 accessing services. As empathy is one of the strongest negative correlates of prejudice, 33 authentic teaching and learning activities, such as the one described in this paper, have the 34 potential to positively impact the lived experience of these women. 35 Keywords 36 Empathy, interdisciplinary, authentic learning, collaboration, women's refuges, nursing, 37 architecture, landscape.

Refuge services have been implemented to provide safe crisis accommodation, 41 emotional support and advocacy for this vulnerable group of individuals [2]. When 42 considering the design of refuges, an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach is needed, 43 with input from a range of stakeholders. Healthcare professionals can provide important 44 insights as family violence and homelessness are major causes of physical and mental harm. 45 The contribution from architecture and landscape is also essential because of the need for 46 good design principles to be used in creating both permanent and temporary 47 accommodation. However, most importantly, the concerns, preferences, and perspectives 48 of individuals who access and provide refuge services must be sought in order to create safe 49 spaces that are conducive to the needs of this diverse group. 50 This paper describes an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience where 51 nursing, landscape and architecture students engaged with refuge service providers and 52 women who were victims of domestic violence, to gain insights into their needs and 53 preferences in relation to the design of women's refuges. This real-world learning 54 experience provided an empathic 'lens' and enabled students to appreciate the lived 55 experience of service users. Additionally, by working collaboratively with other disciplines, 56 sharing knowledge, understandings and ideas, they were able to imagine possible 57 alternatives to existing refuge spaces. 58 This unique learning experience was informed by the philosophical tenets of 59 empathy.

These types of initiatives to allow learners to 'step 61 into another person's shoes' in order to gain new insights into their feelings, perspectives 62 and experiences [3-4]. While previous studies have reported benefits of empathy in the 63 fields of nursing [5] and more recently in the fields of architecture and design studio 64 learning [6], limited studies have examined the impact of collaborative learning experiences 65 involving various disciplines working together to develop real-world understandings of the 66 lived experience of homelessness and domestic violence. The impact of this interdisciplinary 67 learning experience on nursing, landscape and architecture students' empathy levels were 68 measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale (CSES). 69 70Literature Review 71 The word empathy comes from the German term, Einf\u00fchlung, meaning 'feeling into' 72 [7]. The theory of Einf\u00fchlung first appeared in philosophy in 1778 with Herder writing on 73 \"body truth\" and was further examined by Vischer in 1873 who stated that \"the result of the 74 spatial relationship with an object is an increase or decrease in our vital sensation.\" Further 75 studies by Schmarsow and Wolfflin in 1886 explored the connection between breathing and 76 cardiac movements with spatial experience [8]. In the early 1900s, empathy was understood 77 as a projection of feelings onto the world. In the 1950s however, the experimental 78 psychologist Rosalind Cartwright proposed empathy as an interpersonal exchange, rejecting 79 projection in preference for \"true\" empathy - the accurate understanding of another's 80 feelings. More recently the discovery of mirror neurones by neuroscientists has linked 81 empathy with personal relationships [9]..

Empathy requires the perception and articulation of the emotional 85 state of another and results in a range of responses, often including a desire to help or an 86 ability to experience a similar emotional state. There are two principal issues that need to 87 be understood in the context of this research - the difference between \"cognitive\" and 88 \"affective\" empathy, and whether empathy is understood as a \"trait\" or \"state\" condition 89 [10]. 90 Cognitive empathy refers to the accurate perception of another person's perspective 91 or mental state (feeling into), whereas affective empathy involves an ability to experience 92 actual feelings or emotions that are consistent with another person, that is, \"feeling with\" 93 or \"feeling concern for\" the other [10]. Krznaric proposes that empathy is the combination 94 of the ability to perceive and share (affective) as well as to think and act (cognitive). This 95 kind of empathetic relationship describes a balance between looking inwards and looking 96 outwards; and stepping outside of ourselves to explore the perspectives of another person 97 people [11]. 98 Bloom argues, controversially, that affective empathy is often privileged over 99 cognitive empathy, leading to inaccurate decisions, based on incorrect perceptions of 100 another's emotional state or value judgements of another's experience. Bloom proposes 101 that cognitive empathy - the ability to perceive and act from an objective position, requires 102 understanding another, without needing to emotionally match the other [12]. This is a 103 perspective reiterated by Zurek [13]. Empathy is also viewed as both a 'trait' (predisposed .

In healthcare, empathy is integral to therapeutic relationships, allowing 108 nurses to respond appropriately to the emotional needs of patients, to recognize their 109 psychological status and to respond with understanding and insight [15]. A body of research 110 attests to the benefits of empathic interactions between healthcare professionals and 111 patients. Such benefits include decreased levels of patient anxiety and depression [16], and 112 increased levels of emotional wellbeing, satisfaction and adherence to treatment regimens 113 [17}. A wide range of physiological outcomes have also been attributed to empathic 114 encounters including improved wound healing, level of immunity, and cancer survival rates 115 [18]; and lower blood pressure levels, pain diabetic complications [19]. Empathic 116 interactions also enhance healthcare professionals' job satisfaction, resilience and coping 117 skills [16-17]. 118 Integration of empathy in design programs has become increasingly common in 119 recent years, although it is not often promoted as a graduate attribute, being referenced 120 almost exclusively in relation to understanding user requirements rather than as a design 121 skill. Focus on user-focused design thinking has shown that empathy aids in developing an 122 understanding of the problem that can lead to more successful design outcomes including 123 objects, buildings and urban environments. A spatial understanding in terms of empathetic 124 response tends to involve \"an attempt to trace both aesthetic effect and the meaning of 125 spatial form ... back to the human body and its sensations\" [20]..

Nowak describes the human tendency to anthropomorphize 128 and animate nature, facilitating an understanding of strange phenomena and ascribing life 129 and feelings to the inanimate elements of nature [7]. This suggests a more constructed idea 130 of empathetic understanding that relates to material and spatial function. 131 Lifchez [21], Ghajargar and Longo [22] both discuss the manifestation of empathy in 132 the design process and the resulting communication between designer and client. Hess and 133 Fila explore the notion that visualisation of empathetic thinking is demonstrated by 134 students' ability to integrate user requirements in the design brief development of a project 135 and then in design outcomes, describing these as \"empathetic pathways\" [6]. 136 In neither healthcare nor design studies, has the value of empathy within a 137 collaborative learning experience involving nursing, landscape and architecture students 138 working together to develop real-world understandings of the lived experience of 139 homelessness and domestic violence been explored. Thus, the project described in this 140 paper sought to address this gap in the literature. 141 142 Methodology 143 Aim 144 The aim of this study was to examine the impact of an interdisciplinary learning experience 145 on nursing, architecture and design students' empathy towards women seeking refuge 146 services. 147.

Interested students were asked to email one of the researchers if they 160 wished to participate in the study. Although the learning activity was mandatory, only 161 students who provided written informed consent were included the study. Data were 162 collected between March and June 2018. 163 164 Intervention - Learning experience 165 Over the semester, students undertaking the interdisciplinary learning experience 166 were enrolled in separate nursing, architecture or landscape design subjects. The nursing 167 students were enrolled in a third-year elective subject focused on women's health and 168 including content on domestic and family violence and homelessness.

Students 171 undertake a four-week work-based placement in various women's health service 172 environments (such as women's health clinics, sexual health clinics, abortion services, 173 women's substance abuse facilities such as detox and rehab centres, women's refuges) as a 174 part of the learning experience. 175 The architecture students were enrolled in a masters level elective subject that 176 focused on the typology of refuge, exploring retreats, monasteries, sanatoriums and 177 domestic spaces as precedents. Statistical research and current media coverage of domestic 178 violence and refuge provision were examined with a focus on spatial provisions and 179 programmatic requirements. 180 Landscape students were enrolled in a third-year design studio, which required the 181 development of a scheme for a real-life refuge. This subject required innovative responses 182 to community and stakeholder requirements for community landscape projects with an 183 exploration of the biological and therapeutic characteristics of plants. 184 The students from all disciplines met on three occasions to collaborate about the 185 design of the women's refuge. The first meeting involved students working in mixed 186 discipline teams to research the healthcare and social needs of women and children who 187 accessed refuges, identifying typical scenarios for women accessing refuge services, and 188 exploring their physical, mental, emotional and spatial needs. The knowledge acquired by 189 the nursing students during their placement experiences was shared with the design 190 students, so as to help them understand and frame user profiles in a more empathic and 191 realistic manner. This exercise aimed to provide foundational knowledge about the varied 192 needs of refuge users. .

Fieldwork and conversations with clients, service 195 providers and refuge workers allowed the real-world and current conditions of those 196 experiencing and working in the field of domestic and family violence to emerge. The 197 service providers also discussed the daily management and funding requirements of refuges 198 while the case workers spoke about the lived experiences of women and children staying in 199 the refuge. 200 Using the information provided by the nursing students and the insights gained 201 through their fieldwork experiences with service providers, the architecture and landscape 202 students then drafted spatial responses to the needs of users, with reference to safety, 203 access to sunlight, cross-ventilation and flexible room layouts. An example of this included 204 the design of external play areas with specific planting to address the needs of children 205 experiencing anxiety and depression. 206 In the third collaborative meeting architecture and landscape students sought 207 feedback from the nursing students, service providers and users about their spatial 208 responses. The students showcased their sketches, plan, diagrams and design guides 209 containing ten best-practice principles for refuges, and combining landscape and 210 architectural elements as a type of 'how-to guide' for conceptualising a refuge as a designed 211 space. 212 213 Data collection 214 Students' empathy levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale 215 (CSES) [24] prior to and immediately following the learning experience.

The CSES was previously developed to 217 evaluate the impact of an educational experience on participants' empathy towards specific 218 people or groups over a brief time period. It measures both cognitive and affective 219 empathy, as well as state empathy (at a point in time). [25] The scale includes 30 items and 220 takes 10-15 minutes to complete. Each CSES item is scored using a five-point Likert scale 221 with response ranges from 1 (completely untrue) to 5 (completely true), with higher scores 222 reflecting higher empathy levels. Previous psychometric testing of the CSES revealed good 223 internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha (CA) of 0.96 for the overall scale. 224 225 Data Analysis 226 Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program SPSS (version 22). Data 227 distribution was assessed by numerical methods included assessment of Z-score for 228 skewness and kurtosis, Shapiro-Wilk's test, and by visual methods including inspection of 229 histograms and Q-Q plots for pre-test and post-test total scores. The Z-score is the number 230 of standard deviations a value lies away from the mean and higher absolute Z-scores 231 correspond to lower p-values. A Z-score of \u00b11.96 equates to a p-value of 0.05 in a two-tailed 232 test. If data were normally distributed, parametric tests were performed, otherwise, non- 233 parametric tests were used. The significance level was set at < 0.05, two-sided. 234 235 Comprehensive State Empathy Scale (CSEC) 236 To compare pre-test and post-test scores, the sum of the individual items of Comprehensive 237 State Empathy Scale (CSES) for both the CSEC-Feelings and the CSEC-Perception were 238 calculated.

Homelessness can also result in 365 discrimination which restricts people's access to necessary services and supports, including 366 housing and employment. [30] However, empathy is one of the strongest negative 367 correlates of prejudice [31] providing a lens through which women experiencing 368 homelessness can be better understood and addressed. 369 The study described in this paper sought to examine impact of an authentic 370 interdisciplinary learning experience on nursing, architecture and landscape students' 371 empathy towards women and children who access refuge services as a result of 372 homelessness and/or domestic violence. Prior to the study we assumed that there would be 373 a pre-post increase in empathy levels in all students, but that the increase may be less for 374 nursing students who were frequently exposed to situations and scenarios designed to 375 increase empathy towards vulnerable groups. 376 The results indicated that nursing students' pre-test empathy levels were markedly 377 higher than those of architecture and landscape students, and that changes in pre-post 378 empathy scores for this cohort was minimal. This possibly reflects a dispositional tendency - 379 nursing fundamentally involves a commitment to understanding and responding to human 380 suffering - so that the nursing students commenced the study with higher levels of empathy 381 and were therefore less likely to experience a significant change over the 12-week study 382 period. 383 The increase in landscape students' empathy was approximately twice as much as 384 the nursing students, whereas architecture students' empathy levels decreased by a similar .

These results were unanticipated outcomes of the study but may be explained, at 386 least in part, by the gender and age distribution of the participants. 387 There was significant variation in gender within the overall sample, with more male 388 than female landscape students, compared to architecture students who were 389 predominantly male and nursing students who were all female. The generally accepted fact 390 that males are less empathetic than women [32] may have influenced by the gendered 391 nature of the results. The range in ages, and the relationship between life experiences and 392 empathy levels may have also influenced the results as the landscape students were a 393 slightly older group, although this is only an assumption. Additionally, no clear relationship 394 could be found between empathy levels and ethnic diversity, with the sample that was 395 predominantly South East Asian and Caucasian, and a small number of Middle Eastern 396 students. 397 Other reasons for these results include the nursing students' greater exposure to 398 refuge users in their field of study, and consequently, their understanding of human 399 suffering may be more refined. Architecture and landscape students may have never dealt 400 with design in the context of social issues which include human cruelty and suffering. The 401 teaching and learning activities for the three cohorts of students, each enrolled in different 402 subjects, may also have contributed to the outcomes. For example, architecture and 403 landscape students worked from a data set provided by conversations with stakeholders 404 and independent research, with input from nursing students - to produce a design proposal. 405 This hypothetical project was presented for evaluation by a select number of academics 406 with little expertise in the field of domestic violence. Design students, aware of this mode of 407 assessment, may have focused their design responses on aesthetic concerns in an .

Nursing students, in contrast, 409 may have responded more directly to the needs of women accessing a refuge with learning 410 activities that involved a more empathetic framework to be established. Additionally, the 411 nursing students undertook a four-week work-based placement in various women's health 412 service environments, while the architecture students focused on the typology of refuge, 413 exploring retreats, monasteries, sanatoriums and domestic spaces as precedents, and 414 landscape students developed a scheme for a real-life refuge, which may also have 415 influenced the outcomes of the study. 416 The CSES levels of architecture students at the pre-test stage might also be explained 417 in part by response bias theory which suggests that experimental conditions can bias 418 respondents thereby damaging the validity of a study. Architecture and landscape students 419 are used to rigorous competition to perform and present unique and critically challenging 420 ideas. The first responses were higher - when the desire to 'please' the instructor was 421 greater, than at the post-test stage when the students might have deduced that the study 422 had little or no impact on their results [33]. Architecture students may be positively 423 distracted by the requirement for social agency in the outset of the course, but in the 424 finalising of the subject deliverables revert to practices of ensuring aesthetic quality is 425 privileged, therefore removing emphasis from the importance of the user. 426 427 Limitations 428 The results of this study are limited by the relatively small sample size and the fact 429 that the participants were from one university which prevents generalisability and 430 representativeness.

Additionally, limitations inherent to the two-group pre-test post- 432 test research design such as the lack of control group and reactive interaction effect of pre- 433 testing must be considered when evaluating the internal and external validity of the study. 434 Lastly, the outcomes from this study demonstrated an immediate change in participant 435 empathy scores only. Whether these results would be sustained over time and, more 436 importantly, whether they would influence participants' professional practice, has not been 437 determined. 438 The potential areas of this project which still remain unresolved include the 439 specificity of the CSES in interdisciplinary subjects and whether it can be effectively used to 440 measure radically different disciplines equally. The impact of response bias on students, 441 particularly of a design background, is still not completely understood. Lastly, the 442 development of empathetic understanding in different genders of students has not been 443 clearly tracked in this project but may in fact have a large effect on the resulting data. 444 445 Future research 446 Future studies should specifically document each collaborative session and its impact 447 on empathy levels to decipher which activities are more effective in enhancing students' 448 empathy levels. Future iterations of this project could also include a wider range of 449 discipline specific courses, such as law, building, engineering and business. 450 This project assisted students to develop the requisite skills of empathetic 451 understanding while still in a university setting rather than relying on this development to 452 occur in the future practice of the professional.

This teaching and learning strategy had the potential to 461 enhance students' understanding of service user requirements so as to better design safe 462 spaces that are conducive to the needs of women and children who have experienced 463 domestic violence.
