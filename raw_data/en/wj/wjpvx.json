The heterogeneity of immune memory from person to person has a \"1,000-fold range\" for the cellular parameters that Crotty has assessed in his lab. Armed with this backdrop of knowledge, Crotty then turned to [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.healio.com/news/rheumatology/20220112/flares-breakthroughs-rare-after-covid19-vaccination-in-inflammatory-rheumatic-disease). \"The RNA vaccines have been incredibly successful and clearly elicited really good short-term neutralizing antibody responses and clearly were capable of eliciting T-cell responses,\" Crotty said. What is less certain is how well they elicited T-cell memory or CD8 T-cell responses. \"Those are the questions we wanted to answer.\" In an early study of a reduced-dose vaccine published in Science, Crotty and colleagues determined that antibodies declined approximately 10-fold by approximately 6 months after the second dose. However, CD4 T-cell numbers declined only about two-fold after the second dose. \"We thought this was quite encouraging,\" Crotty said. As for CD8 T-cells, approximately two-thirds of individuals experienced just a two-fold decline at 6 months. \"Again, we thought this was a pretty amazing result for [an mRNA vaccine](https://www.healio.com/news/rheumatology/20220202/acr-recommends-fourth-dose-of-covid19-mrna-vaccine-for-patients-on-immunosuppressants),\" Crotty said. Regarding the question of whether T cells are recognizing variants, Crotty suggested that previous COVID-19 infection may provide some CD4 and CD8 T-cell response. However, further data on the nature of this response. He suggested that T-cell recognition of omicron is \"sustained.\" If there is a final factor for consideration, it is the number of exposures to COVID-19 in some form. \"Multiple exposures, either from hybrid immunity or [multiple vaccines](https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20211020/fda-authorizes-mix-and-match-booster-doses-for-covid19-vaccines), is good,\" Crotty said. \"Your "}
