They usually form in the mouth or at the gums. In Western Medicine, the causes of mouth ulcers can vary and include but not limited to factors such as minor mouth injury such as from an accidental bite, lack of vitamins such as iron and B12, allergic reactions to mouth bacteria, emotional stress, lack of sleep, hormonal changes during menstruation. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), mouth ulcers can be due to Yin deficiency from lack of rest and sleep, heatiness due to overindulgence of alcohol or fried or oily foods. There are many ways that mouth ulcers can be cleared fast and naturally. Here are some of the TCM tips to do so: 1. Take orange with salt. Orange is full of vitamin C and given that mouth ulcers can be caused by bacteria in the mouth or made worse with bacteria, taking orange will help boost the vitamins and immunity in the body that can help to clear any bacterial infection resulting in the ulcers. Salt has a cleansing and germ-killing property. Therefore, orange and salt can help to clear mouth ulcers fast through their immunity boosting and anti-bacterial effects. In TCM, orange and salt can cool any form of heatiness down, which can help to bring down the mouth ulcers rapidly through their cooling effects. 2. Spray watermelon frost herb over mouth ulcers Watermelon frost is a powdered herb that is used for relief of heaty symptoms such as sore throat, toothaches, minor burns and cuts. It has a very cooing and calming effect which can reduce swelling and redness and soreness of any form. This herb has its record in the 17th century during the Qing dynasty and the way that watermelon frost can be obtained is by removing a watermelon of its content then pack it with salt. Then put it in a bowl, seal well and after a few days a 'frost' will appear on the skin. For mouth ulcer, just spray the watermelon frost herb over the lesion areas to alleviate pain and swelling. 3. Sleep early Sleeping late will result in the body becoming Yin deficient and cause deficient heatiness to develop in the body. Mouth ulcers are signs that the body is weakened on the inside from lack of rest and sleep. From Western Medicine point of view, sleeping late will cause the bacteria flora in the body to imbalance and cause soft moist mucosal tissues such as the mouth and gums to form ulcers, which are areas of inflammation. 4. Eat fresh vegetables and fruits Fresh vegetables and fruits are packed with minerals, vitamins and water that are essential to reduce any inflammation in the body and maintain good skin and membranes conditions. I recommend taking a rainbow colour of vegetables and fruits daily. "}
