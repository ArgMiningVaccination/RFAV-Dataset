Vegetables and fruits are also rich in vitamin C, which promotes the formation of collagen, which is essential for subsequent recovery, increases the amount of energy, and promotes healing. - Slow carbohydrates such as rice or pasta. They improve digestion, which is very important before acute medical interventions, as the suspension of the body during surgery promotes constipation. Fast carbohydrates are well-absorbed, help to improve mood, and activate the production of serotonin or the \"happiness hormone,\" which can be slowed down by a lack of motor activity and exercise. - Proteins. Chicken or turkey meat, red meat, fish, eggs, seafood. They are the muscles' best friends, which will be inactive for a few weeks after the operation - the latter is due to the mandatory state of rest after the intervention and the inability to lift any serious weight. - Unsaturated fats.
