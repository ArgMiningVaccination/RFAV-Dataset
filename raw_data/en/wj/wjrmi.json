Longitudinal Tracks There are several broad-based curricular components that are integrated with biomedical sciences and clinical teaching, running through various Phases of the revised undergraduate medical course: Health Ethics, Law and ProfessionalismYong Loo Lin School of Medicine - NUS Bulletin AY 2012/13 - Registrar's Office - National University of Singapore http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/nusbulletin/YLLSoM/UG/UGedu.html [6/29/2013 12:17:38 PM]The Health Ethics, Law and Professionalism (HELP) longitudinal track aims to develop ethical sensitivity, theoretical understanding, reflective and critical skills, and professional attitudes in medical undergraduates through all five years of the curriculum. It is student- and patient-centred; case-related, multidisciplinary and inter-professional; fully integrated into all phases of the curriculum; and regularly assessed, bothformatively and summatively. Information Literacy This longitudinal track aims to enable all students to gather and critically evaluate research information, effectively incorporate the selected information into their knowledge base and apply the knowledge in patient care, and also to lay the foundation for future training in carrying out high quality research. Medicine and SocietyThis longitudinal track aims to expose students to the concepts of preventive healthcare at the population and individual level, with emphasis on the epidemiology of common communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as on vulnerable groups. It also aims for students to gain an understanding of the influence and relevance of behavioural, social, cultural, environmental and economic factors that willassist in their promotion of health and management of illness as future doctors. Patient-based Programme and Clinical Skills Foundation ProgrammeThe Patient-based Programme aims to give medical students an introduction to the Singapore healthcare system, the practice of medicine and the importance of the preclinical sciences. Students will be trained to become practitioners with skills in listening and questioning, and who understand and reflect on patient- centred care. Examples of skills that the students are expected to achieve are the ability to conduct and manage an open interview; introduction to the physical examination; the ability to evaluate and reflect on their interviewing skills; and to understand another person from that person's point of view. Theselongitudinal tracks begins in Year One and will run through to Year Two of the curriculum. Course of Study Satisfactory completion of all components of the curriculum is required for graduation.

A fundamental and commonly known fact in education is that assessment drives studentlearning, and that well-designed assessment instruments will have a positive steering effect on student learning and learning outcomes. In the selection and design of assessment instruments it is critical, therefore, to adopt best practices which will ensure matching with the desired learning outcomes that will drive students learning in a positive way. Assessment strategies that will be implemented for the B.Sc. (Nursing) programme will: Be holistic and designed to test the cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains of learning. Test the various levels of learning (knows, knows how, performs, does) as described in the Miller's pyramid (Miller, 1990). Ensure the validity and reliability of test instruments used for both formative and summative assessments e.g. integrated, scenario-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and extended matching items (EMIs) which test higher-order thinking skills will replace recall, rote-memory-based Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Include testing of clinical skills, log book record of clinical practice and case presentations at clinical conferences in its clinical assessment. Include multiple test instruments based on their utility with respect to the validity, reliability and practicality. Base pass/fail judgement on, whenever applicable, pre-determined criteria (i.e. criterion- based assessment).

In 1912, it was renamed King Edward VII Medical School, in recognition of a gift of $120,000 from the King Edward VII Memorial Fund. Substantial academic expansion took place and the name was further changed to King Edward VII College of Medicine in 1921to reflect its status as an academic institution of university status. In 1949, the college amalgamated with Raffles College to form the University of Malaya. This later became the University of Singapore and in 1981 became the National University of Singapore. In 2005, when NUS celebrated its centennial anniversary, the Yong Loo Lin Trust made a transformational gift of $100 million dollars to the Medical School, which was similarly matched by the Government. The giftwill provide funding to recruit and retain top faculty as well as to develop new infrastructure and state-of- the-art facilities to position the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine as the key driver in Singapore 's Biomedical Science initiative. To reinforce its position as a Health Science academic campus, Singapore 's first Bachelor of Science (Nursing) Programme was launched by the School in August 2006 through the establishment of the AliceLee Centre for Nursing Studies. The founding of the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies was made possible through a $10 million donation from the Lee Foundation. The School established two additionalcentres to complement its active research programmes, the Centre for Health Services Research in collaboration with RAND-Health; and the Centre for Biomedical Ethics through a donation of $2.5 million dollars from the Chen Su Lan Trust. These two centres further cement the School's status as a Research Centre of Excellence. These initiatives will help ensure that the School's mission will continue to succeed for generations to come: to provide excellence in medical education for successive generations of healthcare practitioners, generate world-class research aimed at changing the way medicine is practised, and to provide healthcare of the highest quality to serve the people of Singapore and the region.
