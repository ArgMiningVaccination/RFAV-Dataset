Integrated Report 2021Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. Representative Director, President and CEO As a leading company in infectious diseases, we seek to provide total care for COVID-19 through a number of approaches, placing our top priority on bringing the pandemic to an early end.Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future 6 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Message from the President Looking back on our business in the pandemic year of fiscal 2020 First, I would like to convey my sincere condolences with respect to all who have perished due to COVID-19, and I pray from the bottom of my heart that everyone who has contracted this disease will have a quick recovery and that this pandemic will come to an end as soon as possible. I would also like to express my deep gratitude to all the healthcare workers and others who have been doing everything they can to prevent the spread of this disease. With our mission to \"constantly supply the best possible medicines (healthcare solutions) to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve,\" Shionogi has been contributing to healthcare for more than 140 years. The pharmaceutical industry must always strive to continually discover and deliver the medicines that patients need, regardless of disasters or other situations. When Japan experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake a decade ago, it reinforced our commitment to contribute to society by stably supplying needed medicines, and we have been practicing comprehensive risk management, starting from the training of our employees, ever since. As a result, we are proud to say that, during the pandemic of fiscal 2020, we were able to fulfill our social obligation to steadily pro- duce and provide our medicines without any stockouts. However, we did experience our second year of large declines in revenue and profit metrics. The global spread of COVID-19 caused a contraction in the infectious disease field and in the pharmaceutical market overall, and so, while we made proactive growth investments in R&D and other areas, we were unable to cover these expenses with revenues from new products, and this led to regrettable business performance for our shareholders and other stakeholders who had been counting on us. In particular, we did not make enough effort to counteract the expected contractual decline in royalty revenues for Crestor and other factors that we had anticipated in advance. As a company who continues to depend on royalty revenues, at present primarily from our HIV franchise, this represented a gap in our planning and action. From multiple perspec-tives, it was a year that drove home the importance of early reconnaissance for changes in our environment and trans- formation of our corporate culture into one that can rapidly develop and execute a tactical recovery plan. At the same time, fiscal 2020 was also a year in which the issues in our infectious disease business, which could be considered dilemmas, became clearer. For example, the influenza mar- ket, which is a major area for us, has now seen large declines for two consecutive years, and revenues from influenza-related products have plunged to almost zero. For society at large, this can be viewed as a favorable trend, resulting from the population adopting strict precau- tions against contagion of respiratory diseases. However, for those with a business focus in infectious disease in gen- eral and influenza in particular, an environment in which the number of influenza patients, which had previously been a relatively consistent 10 million per year, suddenly swings to zero in one year and could conceivably rebound to 30 mil-lion or so in the year following, presents a tremendous challenge to navigate and maintain a sustainable business. Turning to R&D, it was a year that we committed to the pursuit of a range of countermeasures to fight COVID-19, while maintaining steady progress in our key projects. Shionogi has been conducting infectious diseases R&D for more than 60 years, and, over this long history, we have built up a strong track record and knowhow, span-ning discovery, development, and production and supply. Therefore, we believe that our mission as a leading com- pany in infectious diseases is to deploy these capabilities to help end the COVID-19 pandemic. With this in mind, we have taken a number of steps, such as the develop- ment of Shionogi's first vaccine, research into therapeutic drugs (which is our strength), and the establishment of wastewater epidemiology services that could become a future platform business. However, at this point in time, we regret that we have been unable to live up to society's expectations. In fiscal 2021, we will provide safe and effective solutions for patients and society at an unprece- dented speed and make an all-out effort to help bring the pandemic to an early end. Transformation from a conventional drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company providing medicinal drugs into a HaaS company providing integrated healthcare products and services Advent of the SDG-native, digital-native era Trend toward achieving a sustainable society Changes in discontinuous social systems and values Changes in healthcare needsSustainability of the existing business Large revenue declines in existing pharmaceuti- cal business as patents expire Even after overcoming the patent cliff, other pat- ent cliffs will come, and this is not sustainable * Healthcare as a Service: Provide a range of healthcare services in line with customer needs, rather than only providing pharm aceuticals 7 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Shionogi's initiatives vis-\u00e0-vis pandemic-induced environmental changes Shionogi's business environment has changed at an unprecedented speed, and the pandemic has increased societal demands, particularly in healthcare. Some of these changes will probably be irreversible, even after the pandemic is over. With our Company Policy as our com- pass, Shionogi has been taking a flexible approach to our business as we carefully sense society's needs. Our Medi-um-Term Business Plan, entitled Shionogi Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030), unveiled in 2020, calls for us to achieve business sustainability by transforming ourselves from a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company specialized in providing medicinal drugs into a HaaS company that provides integrated healthcare products and services. Also, from the standpoint of contributing additional value to society, we have embarked on a new direction, seeking to more comprehensively resolve the problems faced by patients and society. In line with this direction, we are driving our transformation to a more sustainable business model, one able to adapt to the rapid social changes that are now taking place. Ending the pandemic is an urgent matter, and as a leading company in the area of infectious diseases, we are pursuing initiatives for total care of COVID-19, from the detection and pre-symptomatic stages to preven- tion, diagnosis, treatment, and suppression of exacerba-tions. Addressing this pandemic comprehensively will require a suite of linked products and services that extends far beyond medicinal drugs alone and exempli-fies what is intended by HaaS. Toward an early and stable domestic vac- cine supply As COVID-19 rages on and variants spread, Japan is awaiting the availability of a domestic vaccine. Japan is the world's number-two country in terms of new drug dis- covery, and so, rather than being reliant on buying vac-cines from overseas, Japan should instead become a vaccine supplier itself. Furthermore, in the event that a highly lethal variant should appear in Japan, a Japanese company will feel the greatest sense of urgency and dedi- cation to make a vaccine to fight it. Shionogi officially entered the vaccine business when it made UMN Pharma into a wholly owned subsidiary in fiscal 2019. The pan- demic hit immediately thereafter, so we made the early supply of a COVID-19 vaccine a top priority and have been pouring our efforts into vaccine R&D. As vaccines are now available around the world, it is difficult to con- duct large-scale clinical trials on a global basis, so we are holding ongoing discussions and brain-storming sessions with the relevant government ministries and regulatory authorities regarding flexible administration of the exist-ing approval system, reflecting the need for an alternative evaluation method. Shionogi is developing a recombi- nant protein COVID-19 vaccine which employs technolo- gy commonly used in influenza vaccines and is thus expected to have a good safety profile. Several vaccines using this technology have already been approved and are being used for other diseases in Japan, so we believe that using the same type of technology should gain ready acceptance. For instance, if vaccine booster shots are to be periodically administered going forward, a vaccine with fewer side-effects would be preferable, so if Shiono- gi's vaccine is proven to be very safe, we will be able to fulfill society's needs. Also, if we use UMN Pharma's vac- cine technology, we could simultaneously inoculate not only against SARS-CoV-2 but also against influenza and other viruses as well. We are also doing research on a nasal vaccine. In addition to supporting Japan's national security, we would also like to contribute to global health by providing the world with vaccines from Japan through direct supply or technological transfer. Development of truly safe and effective therapeutic drugs Even if a superior vaccine becomes available, it will not be 100% effective against the disease, so a supply of safer, more effective antiviral therapeutic drugs will be needed to eliminate people's fears and restore normalcy to society. In fiscal 2020, we selected a compound that is highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 from our compound library and embarked on research. Unfortunately we had to halt development of the initial candidate prior to clin-ical trials because we determined that this compound would not meet everyone's expectations, for example, for a similar degree of safety to our existing anti-influen-za virus drugs. To replace that candidate and move with urgency, we conducted research using various drug-dis- covery approaches on targets of the specific proteins making up SARS-CoV-2. As a result, over the course of a few months, we generated several interesting leads in the form of medium-sized molecules such as peptides and macromolecules, as well as some promising small-molecule compounds. Among these, in July 2021, we began clinical trials on a small-molecule compound that could become an orally administered antiviral drug. We will continue our fight to meet the needs of society 12 8 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021and to relieve the strain on the healthcare system as rap-idly as possible. Supply of diagnostic drugs, suppression of exacerbation in disease patients For COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, the presence of an infection needs to be correctly ascertained. Since it is not possible to ward off such diseases completely through awareness or prevention at the pre-symptomatic stage, infected people\u2014or the pathogens themselves\u2014need to be identified with a rapid diagnostic system, in order to trigger the correct response, such as proper treatment procedures. For COVID-19 in particular, a high proportion of people are asymptomatic or have mild cases compared to conventional viral infections, and the progression of symptoms varies from person to person. Therefore, we believe that the option to address mild/moderate symp-tomatic cases by having the patient convalesce at home or at a lodging facility, reserving intensive care hospitalization for those individuals at specific risk of severe exacerbation, is key to alleviating pressure on the healthcare system. To address this need, we have launched a Th2 Chemokine (TARC) kit (the use- ful biomarker for predicting exacerbation risk in COVID-19 patients. This product was developed in collaboration with the National Center for Global Health and Medicine. By predicting the risk of COVID-19 exacerbation from the dis- ease's early stages, this test kit makes it possible to make the right choice for each individual, whether it be hospital care for high-risk patients or convalescence at a lodging facility, at home, or elsewhere for low-risk patients. Also, to suppress exacerbation in high-risk patients, Shionogi has partnered with BioAge Labs, Inc. of the U.S. for the global development of asapiprant (prostaglandin D2 DP1 recep- tor antagonist, S-555739), which we discovered. Together with the prediction of patients at risk, we will contribute to suppressing exacerbation of disease. Early prediction of outbreaks Based on joint research with Hokkaido University, we have set up a framework for the early detection and observa-tion of COVID-19 outbreak trends based on wastewater epidemiology. We believe that the social implementation of this framework will enable the early prediction of out- breaks so that steps can be taken to lessen the next wave of the pandemic. While this initiative seems uncharacter-istic for a typical pharmaceutical company, it is one that utilizes Shionogi's know-how in dealing with bacteria and viruses, and we have high expectations for this service, which takes advantage of this expertise. Sustaining and stabilizing our infectious dis- ease business One company, or the pharmaceutical industry alone, can only go so far in dealing with a global pandemic like COVID-19. Actually, most of Shionogi's initiatives are being implemented through partnerships. The current pandemic has uncovered many issues that are not spe- cific to a single country, including the need to start pre- paring for pandemics during ordinary times.

Integrated Report 2021Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future Message from the PresidentCreating the healthcare of the future Shionogi's Vision for 2030 is \"Building Innovation Plat- forms to Shape the Future of Healthcare.\" This Vision speaks directly to our business sustainability, overcoming the upcoming expiration of patents for key products in our drug business, and addressing the shifts in healthcare needs as society changes and social values become more diverse. The current pandemic is accelerating social change, but, even if there had been no pandemic, such changes would have happened eventually. In accordance with our 2030 Vision and STS2030, which we announced in 2020, we are confident that we will be able to deal with dramatic changes in our business environment, if we suc-ceed in our goal of becoming a HaaS company. Examples of our progress in fiscal 2020 include gain- ing a great amount of vaccine know-how over the course of the year, and building a vaccine production frame- work with assistance from the Japanese government. Going forward, we will continue to expand the vaccine business so that we can earn stable profits and increase our contribution to society. Also, programs such as the epidemiology monitoring service using highly sensitive detection technology for COVID-19 in wastewater, rep- resent new fields of business activity for Shionogi. This is a program that arose from the \"I want to do it\" project, which is a bottom-up initiative for fulfilling our Vision. The \"I want to do it\" project solicits employee ideas for new business opportunities that they want to pursue immediately. It challenges them to form an in-house business venture. Every year, we receive many interest- ing and enthusiastic proposals, so I feel that the culture and framework for internalizing the pursuit of HaaS is spreading throughout the entire company. In addition, our China business, which was established through our new joint venture with China's Ping An Insurance Group, is off to a promising start, despite some initial start-up hurdles, like restrictions on personnel transfers. We started placing Shionogi products on the Ping An Group's online healthcare platform, and sales have begun. The key next growth step for the joint venture is to gain approval in China for Shionogi's innovative drugs, cefiderocol and naldemedine, and discussions in this regard with the Chinese authorities are progressing without delay with the support of our partner, the Ping An Group. We are working steadily to build a platform that offers one-stop healthcare services utilizing both companies' strengths, including AI-led drug discovery and the smart factory concept. One way that the current pandemic has drastically affected society is that it has accelerated the advance- ment of digitization. As this advancement proceeds, the healthcare paradigm is shifting and customers' needs continue to evolve. We therefore established the DX people's health and wellbeing, Shionogi wants to con- tinue fighting by employing its capabilities to the great- est extent possible, so that the world may be protected from the threat of another pandemic, once COVID-19 is over. Both preparing in ordinary times and fighting back require the construction of a global collaborative frame- work and the strengthening of institutions, as well as securing funding for continued R&D and stable produc- tion and supply, all of which require alignment amongst governments and administrations worldwide. We there-fore intend to be to be proactively involved in advocacy programs through partnerships and industry bodies as well in negotiations for the creation of new incentive and reward structures, including subscription models for products and services and strategic reserves. Now that concern and awareness about pandemics is at an all-time high, we will do our utmost to engage in dialog with our many stakeholders for collective understanding and alignment to create a stably growing infectious dis-ease business meeting the needs of society. 10 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Shionogi's pledge to all stakeholdersPromotion Division in July 2021 with the goal of facilitat- ing a discontinuous transformation and creating new value in response to these shifts. The DX Promotion Division is responsible for creating healthcare solutions using digital technology, making use of data to support the realization of the solutions, and building IT and security infrastructure. Also, to develop and secure human resources, we are retraining employees to become IT/digital personnel and hiring IT and digital human resources from the outside. Furthermore, we are holding DX training sessions for all managers as part of the PJ-KANAME, so that we can transform our organiza- tional culture and strengthen our IT and digital capabili- ties company-wide. We know that reforming how we conduct R&D and reforming our business processes are two points on which we especially need to focus if Shionogi is to trans- form itself into a HaaS company in the future. Accelerating R&D In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Shionogi has been conducting R&D at a pace that is much faster than we previously thought possible. These efforts include moving a candidate vaccine into clinical trials within one year, even though we had no prior experience in this area; identifying of promising candidate com- pounds for COVID-19 therapeutic drugs, an effort restart- ed in November 2020 and that took only several months; and launching clinical trials of those drugs in July 2021. At the same time, the world's major pharma companies have worked even faster to develop vaccines, antibodies, and other therapeutic drugs and have begun to supply them commercially. Of course, there are differences in the magnitude of available resources, but we can learn a lot from them, including with respect to the speed of their assessments, and their risk-taking and radically streamlined processes designed for COVID-specific efforts. For Shionogi, it made us aware that we should reconsider how we conduct R&D, especially during emer- gencies. I think that our next step should be to see how much we can apply this \"emergency\" R&D process to \"normal\" times as well. If this part goes well, I think that we should have enough capability to accelerate our cur- rent pipeline development schedule and make it more efficient. By further cultivating our strengths of creativity and expertise as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company and continuing to challenge preconceived ideas both internally and externally, we will strive to the best of our ability to become a hub of co-creation, so that companies with different capabilities and from differ- ent industries will choose to partner with us to create new healthcare products and businesses. More sophisticated decision making To transform ourselves into a HaaS company, we need to further enhance the speed and quality of our business decision-making process. To date, our decision-making process has had some issues, including the transparency of the discussions and detail of record-keeping, as well as in terms of maintaining traceability sufficient to support third party review. If people are not able to see the ratio- nale behind a certain decision, the proper response to a change in external conditions or emerging project find- ings may not be apparent, such that subsequent appro- priate steps (e.g. suspending the project) may not be taken. Also, such a state of affairs prevents us from learn- ing from our past successes and failures. With the unveil- ing of STS2030, we are improving our awareness of risk and return and our assessment capabilities, monitoring our organizational decision making as a company, and quickly building a framework that will further enhance our abilities for the future. One year into our plan, we have completed awareness-raising among all managers and have created the physical infrastructure, so we are now focused on improving decision-making speed and quality and tightening the linkage to budgets. Shionogi lists \"protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases\" as one of our core objectives. As a leading company in the infectious disease area, and also as a HaaS company, we want to be able to make real contri- butions to SDGs by achieving total care for COVID-19, which is a pressing social issue. We therefore place top pri- ority on bringing the pandemic to an early end, and there-by restoring the safety and well-being of society. As this process unfolds, we will continue to drive to achieve further growth of the company and to contribute to creation of a sustainable society through balanced engagement with all four of our major stakeholder groups\u2014our shareholders and investors, our customers, society, and our employ- ees\u2014so that we can apply our capabilities and resources to provide all of them with meaningful value. I request your continuing guidance and support in this endeavor. 11 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future Message from the PresidentBoth the world and Shionogi have changed significantly over time, but we have not forgotten our founding spirit, and our head office is still located where we were founded, in Osaka's Doshomachi.

Founder Gisaburo Shiono, Sr.1886 From Japanese and Chinese medicines to Western medicines At that time, Western medi- cines were available through foreign trading houses in Yokohama and Kobe, but they were expensive because drug wholesalers who were not familiar with trading bought the medicines at whatever price the foreign traders asked for. Gisaburo soon added peo- ple experienced in trading and fluent in English and imported medicines directly so that even the common people would be able to buy them at a reason-able price.1909 Registered the cor- porate emblem FUNDOH Reliability and trust are nec- essary qualities for corporate management. Since our found-ing as Shiono Gisaburo Shoten, we have regarded reliability and trust as our most valuable \"capital.\" Shionogi's corporate emblem is derived from the fundoh , which is the balance weight traditionally used to weigh medicine on a scale. The fundoh also symbolizes \"accu- racy,\" \"honesty,\" and \"trust,\" meaning Constructed the Shiono Seiyakusho manu- facturing manu- facturing called Shiono Seiyakusho, was built in Nishi - nari-gun, Osaka (the present-day Fukushima-ku, Osaka) to for - mally launch the business of manufacturing new drugs. This gave Shionogi a pharmaceutical division in both name and reality and was also the moment that Shionogi embarked on a new path as a drug manufacturer. Gis - aburo's second son and director of the plant, Chojiro, wanted to get the company through tough operating conditions, so he invit - ed Heizaburo Kondo, a doctor of pharmacology who had just returned from studying in Germa - ny, to serve as an advisor.1943 Renamed the Com- pany Shionogi Seiyaku K.K.

In 1919, the year following the end of World War I, Shiono Gisaburo Shoten, the drug wholesaler led by Gisaburo's eldest son, Shotaro, and Shiono Seiyakusho K.K., the pharmaceutical business led by his second son, Chojiro, were merged in order to further expand the company. The new company was named Shionogi Shoten Co., Ltd. In 1943, the name was changed again, to Shionogi Seiyaku K.K. (the present Shionogi & Co., Ltd. in English) to demonstrate that the company would focus on the drug manufacturing business. FUNDOH from the Edo era Corporate emblem Salvarsan : Shionogi's first step in fighting infectious diseases In the early 1900s, syphilis was a serious infectious disease for which no cure existed. We started importing Salvarsan in 1911, two years after it was developed overseas in 1909, and this was a major step in the treatment of patients suffering from syphilis.Sinomin : Our first in-house developed drug that made a global contribution In the 1950s, infectious diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia ranked among the most common causes of death. We therefore began R&D into infectious diseases, having made the management decision to become fully involved in the major social issue of infectious disease. Sinomin, a sulfonamide we discovered in 1959, was out-licensed to Roche of Switzerland, and it has been instrumental in treating infectious diseases throughout the world. Even now, more than 50 years since its launch, it continues to contribute to people's health as Baktar, a combination with trimethoprim.Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future 12 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

Our Company Policy, which is our eternal goal, has enabled us to move forward without losing sight of our basic direction as a pharmaceutical company, which is \"to serve people's health.\"1958 The Detail Person Declaration The Detail Person Declaration set forth by President Kotaro Shiono stated, \"Shionogi's detailing activities will entail enquiring about patients' medical benefit and recom-mending Shionogi drugs to be used for those patients for whom they are appropriated. You must not focus solely on price and participate in price war.\" This further clarified that our activities are based on our long-held belief that justice comes before profit. 1983 Construction of the Kanegasaki Plant The Kanegasaki Plant was built in the town of Kanegasaki, Isawa-gun, Iwate Prefecture, as one of our key factories, based on a long-term plan for the future expansion of our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.1998 Establishment of the Shionogi Code of Conduct The Shionogi Code of Conduct was established to comple- ment the Shionogi Corporate Policy as a criterion for behav- ior as the company went global and developed into a global corporation. The Company Policy describes our business purpose, while the Code of Conduct sets forth the type of conduct that Shionogi should practice as a member of soci- ety and as a pharmaceutical company.2020 Revising our man- agement philosophy To continue growing as the external environment and val- ues evolve, we need to reflect society's and customers' needs in our targeted Vision and in the Values that are essential to achieving this Vision, and to have the flexibility to take action. We therefore estab- lished a new Vision and Values for our Company Policy, which is the foundation we call Heri- tage that serves as the basis for all of our activities. Finibax Xofluza : An anti-influenza virus drug with a new mechanism of action We launched the anti-influenza virus drug Xofluza in 2018. By combining the power of our value chain and alliances and utilizing the SAKIGAKE designa-tion system, we were able to obtain approval in Japan and launch the drug with the short time period of about three years from the start of Phase 1 clinical trials. This drug is both effective and con-venient, and it is helping influenza patients and their families, as well as the healthcare community.Fetroja : The trump card in antimicrobial (AMR) treatment In 2020, we launched the multi-drug resistant anti- biotic Fetroja in the U.S. This drug could become the trump card for saving patients whose lives have been endangered due to the lack of treatment options. We are providing cefiderocol to many countries and regions, including low- and mid-dle-income countries, through alliances and other means by employing Compassionate Use and Early Access Programs (EAP), thus contributing to the treatment of patients.Tivicay : Helping to improve quality of life for everyone living with HIV In 1988, we founded our Laboratory for Medicinal Chemistry Research and began researching HIV and other antiviral medicines. After many failures, we launched the HIV drug Tivicay in 2014. Tivicay possesses superior effectiveness and safety, and it is an HIV integrase inhibitor for which it is difficult to develop resistance. We are therefore making a major contribution to treating people around the world so that they can live with HIV and have a bet-ter quality of life. 13 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Shionogi's Company Policy is to strive \"constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.\" Based on this, we are working on material issues (materi-ality) so that we will provide new value to customers and society through our business activities and thus attain growth and a sustainable society.

Domestic prescription drug sales and exports/overseas subsidiary sales were \u00a594.7 billion (down 10.9% year on year) and \u00a524.6 billion (down 20.0% year on year), respectively, due to the impact of changes in the business environment during COVID-19. Royalty income related to anti-HIV agents from ViiV Healthcare Ltd. was \u00a5123.4 billion (down 3.7% year on year), due to the effect of exchange rate movements. Operating profit was \u00a5117.4 billion (down 10.1% year on year), due to higher R&D investments in key projects and projects related to COVID-19.

Although ViiV Healthcare's Juluca , and Dovato remained firm, exchange rate movements caused sales to decline of 3.7% year over year. Other reasons for the decline were the absence of milestone payments received from Roche in the previous year in connection with progress in global development of Xofluza and lower receipts of royalty income from Crestor sales since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 under the terms of the license agreement with AstraZeneca.

DOE was 4.1%, exceeding our KPI of 4.0%.ROE was 13.9%, exceeding our KPI of 12.5%.

Also, it is a busi- ness with significant business risks in terms of invest-ment efficiency, because the medicines are used to treat symptoms in acute situations, the treatment periods are short, and dosages are small. However, constant prepa- ration against the threat of infectious diseases is neces- sary for a society where people can live in peace, and due to our mission, Shionogi intends to remain in the infectious disease business going forward. We are there-fore rebuilding our infectious disease business model from zero, because we need to ensure its stability and sustainability. We are transitioning from a business model for handling an indeterminate number of infec-tious disease patients to a business model that will enable us to achieve a certain level of profit stability, despite the ups and downs of the business, through stockpiling, subscription models (fixed payments), and supplies to low- and middle-income countries, along with a stable vaccine business.Establishing a new infectious disease business model Our miss ion is to \"protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases\"We continue to work on establishing a sustainable business model and creating new healthcare solutionsSpecial Feature 26 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future Shionogi Intensified Its Infectious Disease Efforts \u2014Taking on the challenge of our new infectious disease business model\u2014 There is no mistaking that the absence of an infectious disease pandemic is a good thing for humanity. Howev-er, if no one starts preparing for a pandemic during nor- mal times, when disease breaks out, it will inflict a huge blow on society. Also, if the national government and other public bodies do not have any means for support- ing companies that are gathering stockpiles, the num-ber of companies engaged in the infectious disease business is decreasing. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call in this regard. Procurement and stockpiling by govern- ments and others Sales of our anti-influenza virus drug Xofluza have been low because there have not been any influenza out-breaks for the past two years. However, just because no outbreaks occurred for two years does not mean that there will be no outbreak in coming years. On the con-trary, having no outbreak of a virus for two years is reducing herd immunity and could increase people's risk of getting sicker and make the next major wave of infec- tious disease even more serious. Also, we do not know when a pandemic will break out with a strain of the flu virus that has antimicrobial resistance. In anticipation of such a situation, Shionogi is involved in discussions about the need for countries to stockpile a number of medicines with different action mechanisms in normal times. The subscription-type reimbursement model Our multi-drug resistant Gram-negative antibiotic Fetro- ja (cefiderocol) has been proven effective, and both the UK and Sweden have adopted subscription-type reim- bursement models. A subscription-type reimbursement model allows a government to receive a supply of medi- cines when necessary in exchange for paying a fixed compensation to the developing company, regardless of the volume of drugs concerned. Because a fixed pay- ment is guaranteed, we can get earnings from the drug regardless of whether an outbreak occurs, which stabiliz- es the business. Going forward, Shionogi will try to increase the number of countries using the subscrip-tion-type reimbursement model so that we can have a stable stream of earnings, while also being pandem- ic-ready and promoting proper use.Push incentives*2 Among our R&D alliances with external organizations, which constitutes a push incentive, are the Broad Spec- trum Antimicrobials Program of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X), the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), the New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) program of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), and the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR), and we have high expectations for their progress. Also, our efforts to date toward resolving the many issues involved in infectious disease treatment have entailed collaborating with partners in various areas of healthcare and taking initiatives to shape specific solu- tions. Shionogi has participated in the Global Health Ini-tiative Technology (GHIT) Fund, Japan's first public-private partnership fund created to advance the research and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases in the developing world, since its inception in 2013. *2 Push incentives include funding assistance for R&D, among other items Pull incentives*3 Pull incentives are critical to a continuous supply of new antibiotics that will help patients. To date, there has been much discussion but little tangible action in terms of pull incentives. We recognize that pull incentives have to fit country and regional situations, so we are propos-ing the implementation of a suite of programs, such as partially delinked or fully delinked market-entry rewards, subscription payment schemes, and government pur-chases, in addition to innovative, anti-infective-specific, value-based pricing and reimbursement initiatives, such as Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)-linked reimburse- ment reform. We welcome the ongoing discussion of pull incentives by governments and other organizations and strongly advocate for quickly moving from discus- sion to implementation. *3 Pull incentives include financial assistance for product launches, among other itemsThe need for stockpiles 27 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

Integrated Report 2021Protect People Worldwide from the Threat of Infectious Diseases Shionogi has been busy trying to provide solutions to various viruses, including HIV, influenza virus, norovirus, and RSV. The infectious disease treatments that Shionogi has given to society so far, such as Tivicay and Xofluza, are the growth drivers that are currently supporting us. We are able to continually create new medicines in the virus field because we are experts in virus characteristics and the diseases that they cause and because we have built a solid platform for the discovery of new infectious disease drugs that can fight the progression of pathogens. We are currently putting top priority on employing our know-how to come up with solutions for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). While new infectious diseases such as COVID-19 are considered to be a problem, the three major infectious diseases cannot be controlled and continue to spread over the long term on a global scale, and they pose a serious threat and challenge to global health. At Shionogi, we believe that our infectious disease initiatives are tied to our efforts to achieve SDGs and that these initiatives are the priority business that will produce sustainable growth for both the Company and society. We are broadening the scope of our research from our original strength in HIV research to research into the three major infectious diseases, and we are accomplishing this through a number of external partnerships. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious problem, as it is difficult to detect and spreads relative- ly slowly. AMR has been referred to as \"a slow tsunami that threatens to undo a century of medical progress.\" Currently, 700,000 people die every year from AMR, and estimates suggest that if noth- ing is done to address AMR, over 10 million lives will be lost each year by 2050. To protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseases, Shionogi is working to develop new medicines to fight severe infections, including AMR, and is also promoting the prop-er use of infectious disease drugs. We will continue these efforts so that we can prevent the gen- eration of new drug-resistant bacteria and viruses and so that patients will be able to receive treatment now and in the future.Responses Related indicators Provide viral infectious dis- ease products and services Viral infectious disease-related pipeline (including out-licensing) 6 products Provide vaccines developed in-house Build manufacturing facilities for vaccines developed in-house Responses Related indicators Provide products and services for the three major infectious diseases HIV-related product pipeline (including out-licensing) 2 products Obtain approval of cabotegravir for prophylactic use Contribute to better quality of life with cabotegravir Development of an antimalarial drug and an anti-mycobacterial dis- ease drug through alliances with partners Responses Related indicators Provide products and services for severe infectious diseases including AMR Provided cefiderocol through Compassionate Use programs Number of countries with subscription model agreements 2 countries Number of people given information on proper use on the website or in seminars by the Office for Stewardship to Proper Use of Medicine More than 1 million people to date 29 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021New initiatives for viral infectious diseases Shionogi is expert in virus characteristics and the diseas- es that they cause and has given innovative antiviral drugs to society so far, such as anti-HIV drug Tivicay and anti-influenza drug Xofluza . Shionogi made UMN Phar- ma, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary in March 2020, mark- ing our full-scale entry into the vaccine business. The COVID-19 pandemic broke out immediately thereafter, and the development and provision of domestically pro- duced vaccines have been long awaited. So, Shionogi is now tested to demonstrate its true value as a leading company in infectious disease. We are making every effort to advance R&D of COVID-19 therapeutic agents and prophylactic vaccines to restore safety and peace of mind to the world. Hopes for vaccines as part of total care for infectious diseases Vaccines prevent infections by inducing a specific immune response through the administration of safe antigens that correspond to the source of the target infection. Ever since the first smallpox vaccine was creat-ed by Edward Jenner, vaccines have been used against many infectious diseases and are a key part of modern healthcare. A move into the vaccine business has been one of Shionogi's goals for many years, as part of our drive to deliver total healthcare, not just treatments, for infectious diseases. Shionogi took an important first step under STS2030 when it made UMN Pharma, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary. Ideal vaccine profile and UMN Pharma's proprietary technologies Prophylactic vaccines are given to healthy people, so they need to be even safer and have greater efficacy than therapeutic agents. Also, for new infectious diseas- es like COVID-19, which are highly infectious and most people are not immune to, stable manufacturing of a vaccine is key, because vaccines need to be adminis-tered to large numbers of people in a short period of time so that the population can achieve herd immunity. UMN Pharma owns a recombinant protein vaccine man-ufacturing technology called BEVS (baculovirus expres- sion vector system) that can be used to produce a recombinant protein-based vaccine using viral antigen proteins. Compared with conventional vaccines that use attenuated or inactivated viruses, BEVS technology makes production simple and very safe, and is expected to allow Japan to become a major manufacturer of vac-cines. UMN Pharma has been working to develop more effective and convenient influenza vaccines, but the pri- ority has now shifted to finding a vaccine against COVID-19, with no effort being spared in R&D to make the world a safer place and allow the resumption of eco-nomic activities. \u0084 Advantages of BEVS Speedy Protein can be manufactured within 8 weeks once data on the target gene is availableStable No change in the target pro- tein sequence and antigenicity Scalable Easy to scale upSafer No need to handle the actual virus, safer for manufacturing staff and local residentsSpeedy, low cost, and suited to mass production Development of a nasal vaccine In the interest of speed, the COVID-19 vaccine currently under development is an intramuscular injection, but Africa and emerging countries do not have the medical infrastructure to administer injections to multitudes of people. Therefore, from the standpoint of access to healthcare, we are also conducting R&D on a nasal vac-cine as a preparation that would be easy to administer anywhere. We have therefore partnered with HanaVax Inc., a drug discovery venture company originating at the University of Tokyo, to speed up research for a nasal vaccine. A nasal vaccine using technology from HanaVax has the merits of being noninvasive, of being able to effectively induce immunity in the respiratory mucosa, which is the area that becomes infected, as well as the entire body, and of not requiring administration by an advanced healthcare system or healthcare professionals. Besides the aspect of Japan's national security, we want to help the entire world by providing a medication from Japan that is easy to use everywhere. 30 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Develop drugs for the three major infectious diseases HIV initiatives The HIV integrase inhibitor Tivicay (generic name: dolutegravir) discovered by Shionogi exhibits superior efficacy and safety and is also associated with minimal risk of drug resistance. Tivicay has made a real contribu- tion to both treatment of HIV infection and the Compa- ny's growth. It is now positioned as the treatment of choice for HIV in therapeutic guidelines worldwide and is at the top of the WHO's list of recommended treatments. Many HIV-positive people are now being treated with this drug. Until now, treatment for HIV infection involved a lifelong regimen of at least three different types of drugs. Therefore, an additional need appeared, which is to improve patient quality of life by reducing side effects and through less frequent drug dosing, while also main-taining efficacy. Tivicay is highly efficacious and not sus- ceptible to the emergence of resistant viral strains. Its use as the key drug in HIV therapy reduces side effects and has allowed patients to be treated with a two-drug combination. This has led to the launch of Juluca Tivicay + rilpivirine) In December 2019, Dovato was added to the US guidelines on the management of HIV infection, leading to increased prescribing of this two-drug combination. To reduce the frequency of drug administration, Shion- ogi invented a long-acting formulation of the HIV inte-grase inhibitor cabotegravir (generic name). This medicine is already available in a number of countries, including in the US and Europe, in combination with a long-acting formulation of rilpivirine (U.S. product name: CABENUVA). Clinical studies on once monthly injection demonstrated viral suppression equivalent to current treatment methods, and many participants in clinical tri- als said that this drug formulation was better than current oral preparation for daily use. Furthermore, an applica- tion for a once-every-two-months formulation is also cur-rently under review. Shionogi expects that the significant reduction in the number of days taken per year that patient will need to take treatments will help to improve patient QOL and adherence to the drug regimen. Shionogi has developed cabotegravir as a sin- gle-agent HIV prophylaxis drug with high social needs, taking advantage of its first long-acting injectable formu-lation that is administered once every two months. We have filed for approval in the US and hope to be able to launch the product there sometime in fiscal 2021. Clinical studies have confirmed that injectable cabotegravir is more effective than the current once daily oral pre-expo-sure prophylactic (PrEP) treatment. Initiatives diseases Shionogi started collaborating with Hsiri Therapeutics, Inc. in May 2018 on drug discovery research with the goal of discovering drugs with new mechanisms of action to treat mycobacterial diseases. In October 2019, Hsiri and Shionogi expanded their joint research partnership, sign- ing a new agreement on joint research into different novel mechanisms of action. Shionogi aims to strengthen this partnership with Hsiri while focusing efforts on research into treatments for mycobacterial diseases with new mechanisms of action in order to discover a series of treatments over the medium-to-long term. Initiatives for malaria Every year, over 200 million people develop malaria and over 400,000 people die. This infectious disease occurs mostly in tropical regions, and mortality rates are partic-ularly high among children under five. Malaria hampers economic development. Estimates suggest that if malar- ia was eradicated, some 10 million lives would be saved and it would have a positive economic effect of around $4 trillion. Strains resistant to mainstay drugs have start-ed spreading in recent years, and there is a real need for therapeutic agents that are effective against these resis- tant strains and have a good safety profile. Shionogi has been conducting discovery research by establishing a collaborative system with Nagasaki University since 2019 and with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kitasato University since 2020. These partnerships aim to utilize these institutions' strengths in discovering innovative antimalarial drugs.365 days 12 days (two-drug regimen) 365 days 6 days (prophylactic monotherapy)Over 85 %Prophylactic effect exceeding 66 %Patient satisfaction rate during clinical trialsNumber of days taken per year \u0084 Advantages of cabotegravir For existing oral drugs 31 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseasesHelp to tackle serious infectious diseases including AMR bacteria Proper use of anti-infectives Shionogi has a long history of anti-infective R&D, manu- facture, marketing, distribution, and programs to ensure their proper use. We believe that our essential responsi- bility as a company that handles anti-infectives is to take steps to curb the emergence of drug-resistant bac- teria and viruses, and the Company is working on pro- grams throughout the value chain.Cefiderocol The rise of Gram-negative bacteria that have acquired resistance to existing treatments is a major issue for healthcare, as they are on the rise and mortality rates are high because they are difficult to treat. Shionogi discov-ered cefiderocol, the first-ever siderophore cephalospo- rin antibiotic, as a promising therapeutic option to tackle this issue and launched this drug in the US in February 2020 under the brand name Fetroja . Since April 2020, in Europe, cefiderocol is being approved and launched under the brand name Fetcroja . Shionogi has a policy governing the supply of unap- proved drugs and has established a system that will give patients access to cefiderocol treatment, if they need it, but are in countries where the drug has not yet been launched despite already being approved. Cefiderocol has also been approved by the US Department of Health and Human Services for coverage under the New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) program, which is aimed at promoting the introduction of new medical technologies by reimbursing hospitals for in-hospital treatment costs. This is expected to improve access to cefiderocol for patients needing treatment with this drug. Also, the UK and Sweden have each adopted a subscription-type reimbursement model for the drug. (This mechanism allows a government to receive anti-bacterial drugs whenever necessary in exchange for paying a fixed fee to Shionogi.) We will continue work- ing on initiatives to hasten the delivery of products and services to the patients who need them. See the section \"Improve Access to Healthcare\" on pp. 60-63 for more information on how we are facilitating access to cefiderocol treatment. $100 trillionMore than 10 millionWorld : 700,000 US: 35,000 Europe : 33,000Assumed economic impact*Estimated number of deaths in 2050 if no action is taken against AMR*\u0084 Current status of AMR\u0084 Mechanism by which drug-resistant bacteria and virus- es emerge and actions taken to control these Deaths due to AMR bacteria (annual)Manufac- turingMarketing Use Process by which resistant strains emergeFactory emissionsInappropri- ate prescribing (unnecessary treatment, over - treatment, undertreatment)Inappropri- ate use (underdosing, interrupted treatment) Resistance develops via wild animals, water, agriculture Resistance develops in vivo Resistance develops in vivo Actions by ShionogiReduce envi- ronmental burden Uncouple MR perfor-mance assessment from sales volume Raise aware- ness to pro-mote proper use Implement program of surveillance FETROJA (cefiderocol) * O'Neill, J. Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (2016) 32 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Since 2018, healthcare institutions in many countries, especially in Europe, have been increasingly requesting emergency use of cefiderocol. We therefore launched an internal project for providing patients with early access to cefiderocol, and these EAPs have made it pos- sible for us to provide this medicine to many patients. This project embodies our Values of being dauntless in spirit and being bold. We expended much labor to get this program off the ground, but because we stuck to our goal of contributing to the prompt treatment of patients, many patients who would have died from seri- ous infections were able to be treated and saved with cefiderocol.Cefiderocol Early Access Programs (EAP) Partnerships for achieving our vision Api Co., Ltd. and Unigen, Inc. Shionogi is working to optimize manufacturing process for large-scale manufacturing, as well as equip and expand man-ufacturing facilities. In collaboration with Api Co., Ltd. (drug product manufacturing) and Unigen, Inc. (drug substance manufacturing), the first phase of construction was complet-ed at the end of March 2021, and the manufacturing equip-ment was ready. We are expanding our manufacturing facilities further, with completion targeted by the end of 2021. Unigen owns proprietary technology for cultivating viral proteins from insect cells and is already engaged in commer-cial manufacturing of influenza viruses. This cultivation tech-nology can be used to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. AMR Action Fund Because AMR is a social issue with high risk that cannot be tackled by a single company alone, 22 major pharmaceuti-cal companies from around the world came together in July 2020 to set up the AMR Action Fund, resolving to invest around US$1 billion to respond to the AMR threat. The AMR Action Fund aims to provide patients with two to four new antibiotics by 2030 through the initiatives outlined below. Investment in companies engaged in R&D for new antibiotics Provision of technological support by the investing phar- maceutical companies Engagement with governments around the world on the formation of a healthy market that is structured to allow the continued development of new antibiotics Like-minded companies and foundations will work together on these new initiatives to tackle the threat posed by AMR.

Integrated Report 2021Section 1 Shionogi's Strengths Cultivating the Future Protect people worldwide from the threat of infectious diseasesSpecial Feature A Turbulent Fiscal 2020 and Creating Our Disease Strategy Vision Fiscal 2020 was a year in which COVID-19 brought about dramatic technological innovations and changes throughout the world. In STS2030, Shionogi is setting the goal of transforming itself into a HaaS company, i.e., a company that provides healthcare services, not just therapeutic drugs. It is therefore incumbent upon us to contribute to society by always grasping these global movements and changes so that we can provide the necessary products and services in response to patients' thoughts and concerns, as well as the needs and issues facing society. We want to provide total care that runs the gamut of diagnostic, prevention, treatment, and other services that patients need and maximize value through synergy, so that we can achieve economic growth as a company. This is the concept behind our disease strategy articulated in STS2030. To execute this disease strategy throughout the company and become a HaaS company needed by all of society, we recruited representatives from our various organizations to devel- op a Disease Strategy Vision and work with society to achieve this Vision by 2030. Our Disease Strategy Vision The Disease Strategy Vision is a guideline for realizing what Shionogi wants to accomplish by 2030, which is \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare.\" We selected the keywords, awareness-rais- ing (communicating), prevention (to prevent), diagnosis (to diagnose), treatment (to cure), and care (to protect) from the standpoint of achieving total care by using information throughout the patient journey, from the discovery of symptoms to hospital treatment to preven- tion of exacerbation and recurrence. Prevention is key to our Disease Strategy Vision, but in the sense of employing our strengths, it goes without saying that curing disease is of particular importance. Also, to maximize the impact, Shionogi wants to build a healthcare platform that advances the development and distribution of the critically necessary and innovative products and services throughout its value chain, includ-ing the new DX Promotion Division established in July 2021, and from awareness-raising through care. The Role of the Integrated Disease Care Division The Integrated Disease Care Division needs to further broaden and expand strategies to create the values sought by our stakeholders, so that Shionogi can become a HaaS company. We reorganized the New Product Planning Department to strengthen its role and be the department that comes up with a consistent strategy, from research through the post-launch stage. Also, the new Vaccine Business Department was set up as the body overseeing vaccine business, including the COVID-19 vaccine currently under development. We will continue to work together with the entire value chain and our stakeholders to create a bright future for healthcare based on our new Disease Strategy Vision. We are building a healthcare platform that promotes product development throughout Shionogi's value chain.

Integrated Report 2021Shionogi's Further Evolution STS2030 and the Digital Transformation (DX): \"Transformation or Die\" Our growth strategy for STS2030 is to transform our business to one that is not dependent on pharmaceuti- cal patents, and to achieve a major transformation from a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company into a HaaS company. As a HaaS-creating company, Shionogi will not be able to survive in society if it cannot trans- form itself faster than the rapidly changing world caused by COVID-19 and provide new value to society. To create new services that meet the needs of society, we must combine the strengths that we have nurtured as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company with the strengths of our various partners to create ser- vices that will solve the difficulties of living for more peo- ple and raise the level of happiness in society. IT and digital technology are indispensable to creating these new healthcare services, and we need to undergo our own DX transformation and ensure the achievement of STS2030, so that we will be a HaaS-creating company that is the hub of trusted collaboration. Establishment of the DX Promotion Division If we are to achieve STS2030 by taking a DX approach, we first need to make our IT and security foundation stronger and more efficient. The IT and Digital Solutions Depart- ment is the IT control tower for the entire company. The department formulates IT strategy, is a global leader in building safe, worry-free, and stable IT and security infra-structures. In addition, for systems that will be introduced into various value chains, we will work to provide overall optimal digital solutions by being involved in implemen-tation projects from a company-wide perspective. Also, as DX advances, the foundation for data utilization that decides how to collect, store, and manage internal and external information and data and how to use these data to create new value will become an increasingly important asset. The Data Science Department is building a data control framework that can be used by the entire value chain (VC), is assembling business issues involving the VC, and by using advanced analytical technology and simulation techniques, supports the use of diverse data for improving productivity and creating new value. Furthermore, providing new value to society is a key direct contributor to Shionogi's growth. The Digital Intel- ligence Department is promoting a digital transforma-tion plan with our internal and external partners and is encouraging the creation and business development of solutions that prioritize stakeholders. The three departments that constitute the DX Promo- tion Division together will work tirelessly to promote the construction of a foundation for data utilization, improve company-wide productivity, and create new healthcare solutions through close cooperation with internal and external partners, thereby effecting the necessary trans- formation to achieve STS2030.We will use IT and digital technologies to create new healthcare solutions with our partners.

STS2030 is a strategy for dealing with the 2028 patent cliff on our HIV products and 2030 beyond that, and it is divided into Phase 1, which runs through 2024, and Phase 2, which starts in 2025. Over these two stages, we will provide value with our new platform, as outlined in our Vision.

Integrated Report 2021To overcome the HIV product patent cliff and achieve sustainable growth, we need to accomplish a major transformation away from the style of a drug discov- ery-based pharmaceutical company, which is supported by earnings from drug patent royalties, and into a HaaS company. In STS Phase 1, we will work on expanding our own sales of medicines in Japan, the US, and China and concentrate on building and strengthening a new busi-ness model that is not patent-reliant, while continuing to focus on developing the pipeline products that will serve as our next earnings pillars. While honing our strengths as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company, we will consummate our transformation into a HaaS compa- ny so that we can ensure a sustainable and stable earn-ings foundation. The Three Strategies for STS Phase 1 To realize transformation to a new growth as a total healthcare company under the basic policy of Phase 1, we have formulated three strategies: an R&D strategy, a top-line strategy, and a management foundation strate- gy. We will expedite our business transformation by con- centrating on strengthening our R&D geared to the next growth drivers and our domestic and overseas business-es and building an infrastructure for new value creation. Development of an innovative pipeline Business growth through creation of diverse businesses Building framework for new value creationNew value creation Infrastructure buildingR&D strategy p42 Top-line strategy p44 Management foundation strategy p.50 Financial policy Our financial policy in STS Phase 1 calls for making busi- ness investments of \u00a5500 billion by the end of fiscal 2024, the plan's final year, in order to acquire new growth driv- ers by building our overseas business and launching new businesses, and we are researching and analyzing various investment candidates. It is also important that we make investments that will augment the earnings of our exist- ing businesses. We are being more proactive about investing in R&D, as we are going to increase R&D expenditures by at least 20% over what we spent in the past five years, and we are also making investments to bolster our domestic product portfolio, which is based on our disease strategy, and are proactively investing in IT in accordance with our criteria and building a digital infra- structure for achieving growth as a HaaS company. We have tightened our financial decision making for invest-ments that will play a major role in achieving our future Vision by establishing hurdle rates (between 5% and 11%) for growth, different country risks, and each business line. These business investments and company initiatives will bring revenues to \u00a5500 billion by fiscal 2024, with overseas revenue ratio increasing by over 50% from strengthening our in-house sales organization overseas, thus bringing sustainable growth to Shionogi. We will implement a shareholder return policy that steadily increases the dividend in line with the Company's growth so that our shareholders can get a sense of how Shionogi is growing. To this end, we will have a flexible capital policy that, besides dividends, also includes share buybacks, cancellation of treasury shares, and elimination of cross-shareholdings, and we will work on increasing our basic earnings per share (EPS), dividend on equity (DOE) attributable to owners of the parent, and return on equity (ROE) attributable to owners of the parent, which are KPIs for our shareholder return.The Positioning and Goals of STS Phase 1 \u0084 Financial KPIs (for FY2024, IFRS) Growth indicatorsShareholder return indicators Yuji Hosogai Vice President, Finance & Accounting Department, Corporate Strategy Division Revenues \u00a5500 billion Core operating profit \u00a5150 billion Core operating profit margin Over 30% Overseas revenue ratio (excluding royalties) Over 50% Original pipeline ratio Over 60% EPS Over \u00a5480 DOE Over 4% ROE Over 15% 38 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021The business environment in which Shionogi operates changed drastically and rapidly in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the contraction of the market for prescription drugs due to changes in how people receive medical care, the spread of influenza and other infections decreased significantly due to encouragement of infection control, and it was a year in which the sustainability risk of the infectious disease business became apparent, while society became keenly aware of the importance of preparing for possible new future pandemics in normal times. As a leading compa- ny in infectious diseases, Shionogi is pouring its man- agement resources into providing society with various prevention, diagnosis, and treatment solutions, and we are also holding meetings with governments and public administrations on building a sustainable infectious dis-ease business model so that we will be prepared to take action when the next pandemic arrives. Also, the COVID-19 crisis forced countries to make huge fiscal expenditures and equity markets rose throughout the world, increasing the prices of investment candidates, so we were unable to make the major business invest- ment needed for acquiring our next growth drivers, as set forth in our financial policy. The initial year of STS2030 was harsh but driven by the social significance of achieving our 2030 Vision, we will complete our trans- formation into a healthcare platform that is not afraid of change so that we will bring about a sustainable society. Progress on the Areas to Be Strengthened To bring an early end to COVID-19, we are developing a wider range of initiatives from the standpoint of total care, from detection and prevention to diagnosis, treat- ment and suppression of exacerbation. Besides the development of therapeutic medicines, these include developing a vaccine, furnishing test kits, additional indi-cations for severity prediction markers, and building an automated system for analysis of COVID-19 in wastewa-ter. Considering the social situation, while we continue to focus on initiatives that provide value to society mainly in the infectious disease area, we are also moving forward in our efforts to provide society with other products and services besides prescription drugs, and we are making steady progress in laying the groundwork for expanding business throughout the entire Group. One initiative is Shionogi Healthcare's launch of two products developed from turning the prescription drug Rinderon-V Ointment/ Cream 0.12% into an OTC product and encouraging the proper use of topical medications. We are also working on the initiatives to strengthen our growth foundation as a CDMO* and stepped up the pace of our growth. These initiatives include the acquisition of Nagase Medicals, which engages in the manufacture of anticancer drugs and other products for Shionogi Pharma and specializes in production technology for highly pharmacologically active agents. In addition, we started discussions to establish a joint venture between Shionogi Pharma and Chiyoda Corporation for the collaborative development of continuous production technology. In our overseas business, we launched sales of Ping An-Shionogi products on Good Doctor, China's largest online drug and health management platform. We are also in the process of quickly expanding our China busi- ness as we prepare to launch cefiderocol in China. To expand sales of cefiderocol and promote the proper use in Europe and the US, we are strengthening our sales organization in the hospital market. Also, with a view to expanding countries that use a subscription-style repay- ment model, such as the UK and Sweden, we are holding active discussions with authorities in various countries. We will ensure a stable and growing management foundation for 2030 by pursuing higher profitability through striking a balance between our own sales and our alliances and, even if the patent on a particular prod- uct expires, building a durable business model where earnings can remain stable.STS Phase 1 Progress in Fiscal 2020 Sale by our own business Alliance businessPharmaceutical patent business modelDiverse business models that leverage our strengthsAreas to strengthen Current identityAreas to strengthen Sales of pharmaceuticals through our own channels (Japan, US, China) Foundation in pharmaceutical alliances (royalty business, current earn- ings pillar)Products/services other than medicinal drugs OTC Vaccines CDMO* New platform business * CDMO: Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization\u0084 STS2030 \u2014Expansion Through Transformation of Business Models 39 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 2 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Transformation Strategy Medium-Term Business PlanWe will implement the business investment strategy necessary to achieve STS2030. Investment strategy to increase corporate value According to the financial strategy set forth in STS2030, Shionogi will invest \u00a5500 billion by 2024 to strengthen its commercial portfolio, the pipeline, and technological platforms to add and create new growth drivers. It is extremely important for achieving STS2030 goals to expand our product portfolio for the Japanese market, to add marketed and near-term products to drive the top-line and sustainably grow profitability in the US and Europe, and to leverage the multi-faceted platform we are building with Ping An Insurance Group in China. And, as always, out-licensing and creative partnering will be the optimal mechanism to maximize the global potential of certain of our products. When acquiring assets for our commercial markets and pharmaceutical development pipeline, we are seek- ing to optimally leverage our existing capabilities and resources. The assets may be accessed through licens-ing or M&A, but with the emphasis on acquiring prod-ucts rather than infrastructure, with limited exceptions for highly-specialized or truly complementary cases. Regarding Japan, our mother market, we are seeking products that can be expected to create synergy with existing franchises and/or with the accumulated exper- tise of our pharmaceutical business, and which can con- tribute to productivity and profitability in the near and medium term. For the US and EU, we are similarly seek- ing assets which can contribute quickly, building on the specialized, hospital-focused capabilities we established for the successful cefiderocol launches, or that create synergies with franchises we expect to arise from our own pipeline in the future. In China, in Ping An-Shiono-gi, a joint venture which draws upon the DX expertise of Ping An Insurance Group, the owner of China's largest online medical care platform, and the deep pharmaceu- tical expertise of Shionogi, we are establishing a plat-form that can handle a wide range of products ranging from innovative pharmaceuticals, to branded generics, to vaccines, to OTC products and supplements, as well as the creation of technological breakthroughs in the creation of HaaS, and can then successfully deliver those new product categories commercially. To accelerate these efforts, we and the Ping An Insurance Group will be looking for new investment opportunities in China and beyond in the Joint Venture's territory. For R&D, we would like to acquire technologies and candidates that expand our range of modalities and capabilities, with emphasis on our core franchise areas of infectious diseases and CNS. Looking further ahead, to create new healthcare platforms, we will be seeking to create innovative types of flexible alliance networks that allow the pooling of expertise across fields and industries. Since investment has a multi-year economic effect, it is important to evaluate it from a medium- to long-term perspective. Last year, Shionogi updated its investment valuation and decision-making approach. We always ensure that the investment target is thoroughly examined from a due diligence perspective - scientifically, commer- cially, and legally - as well as confirming full alignment with STS2030 and our regional and focus area strategies. Risk/reward balance is critical, with investments that have a large business risk often being those that have the most potential impact on future sales and profits, so our analy-ses must consider a range of scenarios and outcomes, as well as the specific characteristics of regions and markets. Wherever possible, we will seek assets and technologies that are not \"one-off\" opportunities but rather have the potential to provide continual strategic and/or technolog- ical benefit, and to generate additional new potential opportunities, over the medium to long term. We are keenly aware of the competition for all of these assets, both from other companies with similar product, pipeline, and technology needs, and from the wide range of funding options available to prospective partners from other sources. While seeking these oppor-tunities, we will not, however, lose sight of the fact that valuations must be reasonable and consistent with our stewardship of all our resources. We must therefore ensure that Shionogi is the most attractive partner from John Keller, Ph.D. Senior Executive Officer, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy DivisionSection 2 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Transformation Strategy 40 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Message from the Head of the Corporate Strategy Division many perspectives, demonstrating world-class capabili- ties in every aspect, in expertise and scientific excel-lence, in operational efficiency, in collaboration and alliance management, and also in our record and com- mitment to ethics and compliance. High capital efficiency management which takes the cost of capital into account We also incorporate the concept of capital cost into our approach and maintain continual focus on improving the efficiency of our use of capital. Although it is not an external KPI of STS2030, we are assessing our overall goals by using an ROIC tree, based on the concept of return on invested capital (ROIC), and guiding us in improving the efficiency of capital use, the operating profit margin, and the capital turnover ratio. To ensure that projected returns are actually delivered, we have designed a KGI tree that links clearly defined KGIs with specific KPIs, so the steps needed to create value are evident. We monitor the progress of activities against KPIs and, if the expected results are not delivered, we can quickly make the necessary adjustments to our path, correct our course, or refocus to avail ourselves of new opportunities. This allows accurate, targeted and flexi-ble responses to changing conditions, representing a further evolution of the ROIC management approach under our previous medium-term business plan. Shareholder return policy At Shionogi, we are focused on maximizing corporate value while balancing investment in growth and share- holder returns, in order to deliver medium- to long-term profit growth. With respect to dividends, we plan to increase the dividend in a stable manner in line with the growth of corporate value, using a DOE of 4% or more as an index, so that all of our shareholders can consistently get a true feeling for our corporate growth. In fiscal 2020, we paid a dividend of \u00a553.00 at the end of the second quarter and \u00a555.00 at the end of the fiscal year, resulting in an annual dividend increase of \u00a55.00 per share (the 9th consecutive year of dividend increase). Also in fiscal 2020, we acquired treasury stock (8,777,500 shares, a total acquisition amount of approximately \u00a550 billion) in order to strengthen shareholder returns and improve capital efficiency. Although it is not a shareholder return index in STS2030, the results of shareholder return measures are reflected in the total shareholder yield (TSR), which has been above the TOPIX average since 2014. \u0084 Total shareholder return (TSR) 1 yry 3 yrs.yy 5 yrs.yy 10 yrs.yy Cumulativ e Annual rate Cumulative Annual rat e Cumulative Annual rat e Shionogi & Co., Ltd. return (TSR): The total return to the shareholder, or the total return on investment, including dividends and capital gains 2.

Integrated Report 2021The societal changes caused by the spread of COVID-19 have also induced a major transformation in drug discov- ery R&D. At Shionogi, we have altered the entire way we think about R&D, as our procedure about drug discovery and the limits of its speed actually turned out to be assumptions based on preconceived notions. As an infectious disease company helping to end COVID-19, Shionogi has issued an internal COVID-19 emergency response declaration, and we are doing everything we can, including revamping facilities and making emergen- cy procurements. Also, about 70% of our researchers are concentrating their resources on discovering drugs for COVID-19, focusing on a COVID-19 vaccine and a small-molecule therapeutic drug. We have seen dramatic changes as a result. It took us only 142 days, faster than other global pharma companies, for our R&D efforts for a small-molecule therapeutic drug to move from synthesis of the first lot to the launch of clinical trials. The role of the Research Division in STS2030 is to polish our product creation skills so that we can create solutions to social issues. Shionogi's strength lies in its high level of drug discovery, and in the past 10 years we have launched six new drugs globally. On the other hand, some of these products have yet to maximize their value, and there are still issues in understanding and grasping the needs of society and customers in drug discovery. In order to pro- vide solutions that are truly appealing to society and cus- tomers, researchers need to further hone their scientific skills to accurately grasp increasingly diverse and sophisti-cated needs and realize solutions. To this end, we are promoting measures to dispatch researchers to medical sites to experience the \"problems\" through dialogue with doctors and patients, and measures to widen researchers' perspectives by allowing them to accumulate work experience in other divisions and Group companies. Moreover, to create a vibrant research institute where researchers can collect and disseminate information on their own and gather colleagues to produce results, we have introduced an autonomous research system where researchers are given a certain amount of free discretion to conduct bottom-up research that they want to do, thereby strengthening their science capabilities and encouraging them to exercise their independence. We have also implemented management reforms in the research division, such as bringing in personnel from the sales and development divisions, with the aim of becom- ing a research institute that can provide solutions to the problems of society and customers at a different level of speed by incorporating the perspectives of development and marketing from the exploratory stage of research and becoming aware of the market from early on. Through these multifaceted efforts, we will transform ourselves into an autonomous group of researchers capable of cre- ating customer happiness through science.Pursuing product creation and efficiency in COVID-19 drug discovery Transformation in our research laboratories The conventional thinking about drug discovery says that the chance o f becoming a medicine is one in tens o f thousands and that it takes five years to get from de fining a concept to getting a development candidate. We have mobilized all of our human resources and our accumulated research knowhow to discover therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. Working even on weekends and holidays and as fast as possible, we suc - ceeded in creatin g a development candidate in about nine months from definin g the concept and it took onl y 13 months to launch clinical trials. As an in fectious disease company, Shionogi will never fail to deliver medicine to the world. We are really fighting as hard as we can, as this is our reason for existence, and all of our e fforts so far have been to facilitate each person's strong desire to save the world and bring this to fruition. We are working ceaselessly to create results generated by innovation as soon as possible so that we can find optimal solutions to the problems (needs) of patients and society. Using the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for change, we are implementing various transformation in our R&D.Pioneering the future of healthcare with our accumulated skills in product creation and a system that can flexibly and boldly change priorities An employee speaks To discover COVID-19 therapeutics Yuki Tachibana Director, Medicinal Chemistry 1, Laboratory for Medicinal Chemistry ResearchSection 2 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Transformation Strategy 42 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021R&D Strategy While COVID-19 has caused apprehension about clinical trials, in fiscal 2020 we succeeded in staying on schedule with almost all of our programs by acting in response to changes in the external environment, including being flexible in adjusting the number of clinical trials initiated in each region through collaboration among the US, Europe, and Japan. In fiscal 2021, our top priority remains to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic drugs as soon as possible, and we are working on the development of based on core eight projects so that we can provide innovative value.In accordance with the watchwords, \"speed\" and \"cre- ation/maximation of product value,\" the Drug Develop- ment and Regulatory Science Division has not only worked to make our processes based on conventional methodologies more efficient as possible, but has also changed our approach and overhauled our develop-ment process from square one. At the same time, we always place \"science\" at the top of our decision-mak- ing list as we absolutely need to get the science right. Even if we emphasize speed and proceed with testing using different methods from the previous ones, we still need to be strict and objective in considering data and to make sure that what we are doing is scientifically per- suasive in terms of efficacy and safety to make a go/no go determination. We are therefore sparing no effort in our action to voraciously gather and analyze past cases and latest scientific knowledge, think through them thor-oughly, and hold extensive discussions before reaching well thought-out decisions. In particular, in developing a vaccine and therapeutic drugs for COVID-19, we are holding daily discussions, including with senior manage- ment, about which patients would receive such solu- tions, how fast we could provide them, and what kind of development plan we should have for accomplishing this. As we proceed, we are communicating with the regulatory authorities more closely than in the past, and we are discussing how to execute our development plan as soon as possible and based on science.

Integrated Report 2021Promoting domestic business to achieve our Vision for the Japan business STS2030 sets \"Become an indispensable partner in infec- tious diseases and psychoneurological diseases/pain\" as the Vision for our Japan business. The spread of COVID- 19 has limited MRs' opportunities to call on healthcare institutions, which has had a major impact on activities to disseminate information about our domestic drug busi-ness. However, we have taken this as an opportunity for change, and even with the various changes taking place in the external environment, we are building a framework that will maintain two-way communication with our cus- tomers, including physicians and healthcare professionals. By building a strong, resilient framework for disseminating information in both physical and digital terms, we will always be responsive to diverse customers' needs. Building a structure that is responsive to customers' needs COVID-19 has changed customers' information needs. More than ever, we are being called on to provide high-quality information by every means of communica- tion, as needs are diversifying with respect to consulta- tions, be they face-to-face, online, or via other formats. As a new initiative to provide information digitally, we have located electronic medical representatives (e-MRs) in certain geographical areas, while we also strengthened our existing product and disease education and our training in two-way communications skills and worked on enhancing the skills required in MR activities. E-MRs sup- port MR activities by providing more detailed, wide-rang- ing information online, thereby helping to improve the quality of our information dissemination activities. Upgrading online content As the digitization of society progresses, there is also an increasing need for on-demand information through the media or websites rather than by consulting with an MR. To meet this need, we updated our owned media for healthcare professionals. This entailed upgrading exist-ing web-conferencing audio-visual functions, as well as content and materials for use in routine healthcare and healthcare institution education, such as videos that pro- vide a broad range of product information and patient education, slides for training in infectious diseases, and materials for patient use. Moreover, on our owned media, we have aired some of the lectures held locally throughout the country, thereby enabling people in local areas to access lectures on medical and pharma- ceutical topics and on more detailed medical issues. In addition, we strengthened our partnership with Stream-I, our joint venture with M3, Inc., and are taking a new approach to fusing MRs' real and digital data-pro-viding activities and digital content transmission. Plans for executing our disease strategy To be able to provide products and services for all diseas-es, as set forth in our disease strategy, it is essential that we obtain our customers' broad understanding of the solutions (products and services) that Shionogi provides by communicating with the relevant academic societies and with professors who are also opinion leaders and by formulating/revising new healthcare guidance and treat-ment guidelines. To disseminate and execute the disease strategy in STS2030, we established new hospital MRs. The mission of the hospital MR is to disseminate prod- ucts and information on diseases in general to local areas and nationwide through programs at key hospitals, nota-bly, university hospitals. Our newly reorganized Pharma- ceutical Commercial Division and our Integrated Disease Care Division will collaborate closely to achieve our patient-focused disease strategy, which aligns with the needs of healthcare professionals and patients alike.Achieving top-line growth through an optimal strategy for each region Focusing on therapeutic drugs for key diseases, we are building a stable earnings foundation by cov- ering all diseases through varied approaches that encompass everything from prevention to treat-ment to convalescence and by providing value that responds to stakeholders' needs. We are also working to improve our global presence by expanding our business in the Japanese, U.S., and Chi-nese markets and strengthening our European business. JapanSection 2 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Transformation Strategy 44 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Top-Line Strategy Update on changes in our global business to achieve our 2030 Vision In the year since we set global business expansion as a key strategy in STS2030, we have been accelerating our initiatives aimed at changing our overseas business to focus on three poles: the U.S., Europe, and China. In the U.S. and Europe, we worked on \"strengthening our sales capabilities in the hospital and specialist mar- kets focused on cefiderocol,\" proposed last year, while in China, we established Ping An-Shionogi Co., Ltd., and launched its business. These were the first real steps toward achieving our 2030 Vision. Based on these results, we have made fiscal 2021 a year for further leaps forward. Business expansion with cefiderocol With no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic, inter- est in infectious diseases has increased around the world, and cefiderocol has drawn greater attention as well. Because we have continued providing data on how to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and promote proper usage, primarily in the U.S. hospital market, many more patients than we had initially expected have benefited from cefiderocol. In Europe as well, we were able to provide information through Early Access Pro- grams (EAPs) in several countries, including launches in the UK and Germany. In addition, cefiderocol has played a role in individual countries' AMR countermeasures, one of which is the adoption of a subscription-type reim- bursement model in two European countries.Expanding our China business In our China business, we established Ping An-Shionogi Co., Ltd., a joint venture with the Ping An Insurance Group, in November 2020 and started collaborating with the Ping An Insurance Group immediately thereafter. This initiative is a true case of building from the ground up to achieve our 2030 Vision, and it constitutes the first big step in our transformation into a HaaS company. As one of the new business models that combines the strengths of both Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and China's Ping An Insurance Group, we started to provide existing generic products and over-the-counter drugs through the Ping An Good Doctor (PAGD) platform, which is Chi- na's largest online healthcare platform, thereby we aim to improve our top line. Another initiative that is consid-ered as important as this new platform is the establish- ment of a new pharmaceutical business in China. Last fiscal year, we started getting ready to develop and launch two products, cefiderocol and naldemedine, and we were able to make steady progress. Going forward, we plan to advance multifaceted initiatives such as expansion of our generic drug business; development and marketing plans for new medicines; new businesses that use the platform; and AI drug development, as well as engage in mutual cooperation with the Ping An Insur- ance Group so that we can achieve HaaS and push for-ward to provide the best healthy experiences. At Ping An-S hionogi, we are trying to create new me dicines an d services by utilizing real world data from the Ping An Insurance Group and providing the best healthcare solutions to everyone in China through the PAGD. We are already selling three pro d- ucts on PAGD, and are getting ready to add four more. In addition, we have launchedinitiatives to provide patients who consent with early detection, medical treatment,and the best healthcare services by providing customers with wearable devices and smartphone apps so that we can use the health data we gathered from them. Goin g forward, I want to be involved in bi gger and faster initiatives to create new medicines and services .We have entered into numerous interdivisional and organizational tie-ups in the awareness that we should not have a structu re that relies on either the real or the digital as we move forward with building our structure and with our initiatives vis-\u00e0 - vis the real and the di gital. The important thin g is to contribute to both societ y and healthcare by delivering high-quality in formation that meets the needs o f every patient and healthcare pro fessional in any given situation so that they will have trust in Shionogi's medicines and use them.

Ping An Healthcare and Technology Zhang Jiang Senior Vice President Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company LimitedTatsumori Yoshida Chairman & CEO Ping An-Shionogi Co., Ltd. Ping An-Shionogi Co., Ltd. has started supplying products over Ping An Good Doctor, a healthcare platform with China's largest user base. With their eyes fixed on future development, Zhang Jiang, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of Ping An Healthcare and Technology Company Limited, and Tatsumori Yoshida, Chairman and CEO of Ping An-Shionogi, had a discussion.Ping An-Shionogi 1Discussion 1 Responding to the various needs of customers: Ping An Good Doctor Yoshida: We have achieved a good start to this collabo- ration faster than planned\u2014at the time of establishment of Ping An-Shionogi\u2014provision of our products via the online Ping An Health platform, \"Ping An Good Doctor (PAGD)\". Zhang: I believe the efforts of Kui Kaipin\u2014Director of Ping An-Shionogi, who has acted as an intermediary between the two companies\u2014have been crucial to this success. We are grateful for this partnership with Ping An-Shionogi and have high expectations for the future.Y: We believe PAGD sets itself apart from other online healthcare platforms that have their roots in selling products.Z: Exactly. PAGD is a leading healthcare services plat- form in China. It has 400 million registered users as of 30 June 2021. It has an in-house medical team of about 2,000 members and over 38,000 external medical profes- sionals that use a proprietary artificial intelligence-based healthcare system, and enables 24/7 online medical Section 2 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Transformation Strategy 46 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Co-Creation InitiativeDiscussion examinations and prescription of medicines. On top of all these, it meets the diverse needs of its customers through its tie-ups with offline medical institutions and by providing a wide range of services such as referrals and delivery of medicines.Y: PAGD is making a significant contribution to solving issues unique to China. Z: Yes, a good example is that it has made a significant improvement on the recurring shortages issue of doc- tors and the resulting long waits at hospitals. Additional-ly, PAGD is working aggressively to achieve the same level of healthcare services in inland areas of China that have insufficient healthcare infrastructure in urban areas. Y: That's great. I believe PAGD has potential to signifi- cantly grow in value as a healthcare platform through the co-creation of new value\u2014such as proposing ways of improving and maintaining the health of patients, preventing and early detection of their health problems, and creating more effective medical solutions\u2014by utiliz- ing the authorized integrated data of PAGD registered users' medical examinations, prescriptions and various test results. Z: Exactly. Expectations for further cooperation to improve sub-optimal health Y: China has the largest population and is the most rap- idly changing country in the world. On the other hand, it has various social issues such as an aging population, thus the importance of health management will contin- ue to grow. With this background, PAGD has the poten- tial to become an indispensable total healthcare platform that provides a wide range of solutions useful for people's daily health management, and to go beyond the traditional model of providing online medi- cal care and medicines. Z: In China there is a growing need for healthcare to improve the health of those who are in a state of sub-op- timal health\u2014that is, in between healthy and sickness. Thus, we predict over-the-counter (OTC) drugs to play a more significant role. We have high hopes for the busi- ness collaboration with Shionogi Healthcare in the OTC sphere because the OTC market is large. Y: We are starting with sales of health foods in online shopping websites however, we aim to develop and sell Shionogi healthcare products that meet the needs of the Chinese market in the future, and develop and sell Ping An-Shionogi proprietary products based on needs assessments using the PAGD platform. Aim for sustainable growth by collecting real-world data and analytical research Z: What makes Ping An-Shionogi proposals attractive is they are based on science. I am very excited because even though we have collaborated with various other pharmaceutical companies, this is the first time with the kind of proposals enabled by Ping An-Shionogi that attractively advance the value of PAGD utilizing scientifi- cally-backed data. A new initiative I find particularly interesting is the collection and analytical research of real-world data. We are accumulating a variety of real- world data such as sleep and physical activity volumes collected from wearable devices of users who gave their permission to participate in this research. The research data is authorized by users and linked to medical testing and treatment data. Ping An-Shionogi is making a posi- tive contribution to people's health by using this data to create healthcare solutions and for artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug discovery. It is a meaningful initiative that builds on the strengths of both PAGD and Ping An-Shionogi. Y: This initiative really owes its very existence to PAGD. Ping An-Shionogi, through collaboration with PAGD, wants to play a role in the healthcare platform business industry by creating solutions from prevention and diag- noses of medical conditions, through to treatment and management of the recovery and recuperation phase. We aim to grow sustainably as a total healthcare compa-ny by promoting this business model. Z: Collaboration between Ping An-Shionogi and Ping An Healthcare has growing potential by utilizing the various technologies of the Ping An Group starting with PAGD. We look forward to initiatives that will create new value in the medium to long term. Y: Yes, let's work together so we can provide total healthcare services that meet people's health needs! 47 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Ping An-Shionogi concluded a joint-research agreement with Ping An Technology Co., Ltd., which has a broad range of AI technologies for drug discovery. Ping An Technology's Xie Guotong and Ping An-Shionogi's Tatsumori Yoshida discussed how both companies could work on solving social issues such as improving social productivity and extending healthy lifespans, which are aims of the Shionogi Group.Ping An Group Tatsumori Yoshida Chairman & CEO Ping An-Shionogi Co., Ltd.Xie Guotong Chief Healthcare Scientist of Ping An Group Deputy General Manager of Ping An Technology Director of Ping An Healthcare Technology Research Institute Ping An Technology Co., Ltd.Ping An-Shionogi 2Discussion 2 Promote drug discovery by effectively using Ping An Technology's AI technology Yoshida: We have many targets in establishing Ping An-Shionogi, and have very high expectations around developing total healthcare solutions including drug dis- covery utilizing Ping An Technology's world leading AI technology. Xie: Ping An Technology is developing AI technology in various domains such as natural language processing and image analysis and have successfully applied these technologies in a wide range of fields, from fintech to healthcare. With such strong technical support,Ping An Smart Healthcare provides end-to-end solutions for reg- ulatory authorities and the healthcare ecosystem by sup-porting the government with management of institutions, doctors, diseases and drugs to drive effi- cient operation of China's healthcare system. We are very confident in our ability to develop healthcare solu- tions in collaboration with Ping An-Shionogi because of the AI technological strengths we have built up in a wide range of fields. Y: We inked agreements for joint drug discovery straight after Ping An-Shionogi was established because of the appeal of their AI technology at Ping An Technology. After only three months since starting research for spe- cific diseases, we were able to find promising com- pounds from amongst more than 500,000 compounds. I'm amazed at this speed. X: Our AI for drug discovery achieved a higher level of precision than world-leading teams from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University at a MIT competition to predict the efficacy of antibiotics. How-ever, as we do not have the experience or expertise to apply this AI technology to actual drug discovery, we are extremely fortunate for the opportunity to increase the precision of this technology by applying it in joint research with Ping An-Shionogi. Also, I am pleased that our AI technology is growing stronger than when we began this joint research. Y: Generally, if everything goes according to plan, it takes about two to three years from formation of a research concept to discovery of a promising com- pound. Taking only three months this time is truly an amazing speed. X: I'm glad we have picked off at a good start. Vital to this three-month speed is Shionogi's drug discovery expertise that supports an original pipeline ratio of over 48 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021 SMART HEALTHCAREPing An Smart Healthcare Ping An Smart Healthcare, affiliated to Group subsidiary Ping An Smart City, focuses on four core areas to support the rapid development of China's healthcare system: improving institutional management by empowering health and medical authorities; assisting doctors in diagnosis and treatment; supporting the public health system to manage epidemics and chronic diseases; and facilitating pharmaceutical research. Currently, Ping An Smart Healthcare services are available in 90 Chinese cities and are expanding in overseas markets, serving a total of 20,000 medical organizations and 800,000 doctors.

AI technology is not effective unless it is built up together with the people who will utilize it. I believe we will be able to evolve Ping An Technology's AI technolo- gy and Ping An Smart Healthcare's end-to-end solutions to be even more applicable to real-world uses and to use it to help develop amazing potential compounds and services by making the most of our AI technology in jointly discovering drugs using Ping An-Shionogi's drug discovery expertise. Contribute to people's health by fusing the strengths of both companies Y: Two of the social issues Shionogi Group is tackling are improving social productivity and extending healthy lifespans. Vital to solving these social issues is finding solutions to psychoneurological diseases that signifi-cantly reduce people's quality of life. I believe Ping An Technology's capability of data processing and AI tech- nology and Ping An Smart Healthcare's end-to-end solutions are vital for discovery of drugs for psychoneu- rological diseases. So I hope we can develop innovative solutions in the psychoneurological disease area by maximizing both our company's strengths. X: I really hope we can create solutions together for this kind of social problem as there are a great number of people who suffer from psychoneurological diseases in China. Y: Because researchers from pharmaceutical and AI com- panies are from very different backgrounds, I thought the most important thing would be to form common under-standing and relationships built on trust. However, by regularly meeting and discussing matters we have been able to build very good relationships. I have heard there are still technologies that haven't been used in the ongo- ing projects. Let us contribute to people's health by cre-ating innovative healthcare solutions in terms of both quality and speed by breaking down bottlenecks through a multifaceted approach that unleashes the syn- ergistic impact of our combined strengths. X: I am so excited. Let's do it! 49 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 2 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Transformation Strategy Discussion Co-Creation InitiativeTo become a HaaS company, we must transform ourselves into a high-productivity organization that can create new value. Therefore, the Corporate Strategy Division, which is responsible for designing and implementing the overall corporate strategy, and the Administration Division, which is responsi-ble for creating mechanisms that enhance effectiveness, have teamed up to build a strong manage-ment foundation that can flexibly respond to rapid changes in the environment.Create value by transforming structure and the processes that shape structure and developing the right human resources to administer processes To become a HaaS company that creates new value, we need to be in a position where we will be chosen by other companies and industries that have different strengths. This is why Shionogi is speeding up its transformation efforts to become a high-productivity organization that will continue creating new value while honing its strengths as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company. To transform ourselves into an organization that tackles new fields at speeds never before attained and enables bold investment decisions and resource allocation, the Corporate Strategy Division and the Administration Divi- sion are spearheading a reorganization of our manage-ment foundation. This will center on a transformation mechanism to reform our decision-making and work pro- cesses and human resource development. We built and put into operation a system that can make prompt and accurate decisions and monitor and review them. This evaluates the appropriateness of our business risk and increases the transparency and traceability of our deci- sions in line with the recently established Shionogi Group Decision-Making Policy. As for training human resources responsible for value creation at Shionogi, we are starting educational programs that will upgrade our management ranks, beefing up self-investment assistance, and taking other steps to create an environment in which all employ-ees can continue learning.The Decision-making Process (Project K) To fight with determination against unprecedented events, all of the decision-making processes at Shionogi need to incorporate timely decision making that proper- ly assesses the business risks. Therefore, the Corporate Strategy Division and the Administration Division have teamed up on a transformation project (Project K) that will overhaul our old approval methods and institute a timely and high-quality decision-making process throughout the Group. First, the project team formulated the Shionogi Group Decision-Making Policy and organized and revised all rules pertaining to approvals and meetings, then announced them to the entire Company. Next, it installed a Company-wide system for approvals (Shiono-gi new Approval Management System 2020: SAMS) to centrally manage the necessary information and deliber- ation processes involved in our decision making and the appropriate reports. SAMS conducts a multifaceted evaluation of each proposal's business risks and, setting the decision maker according to the level of impact and uncertainty of each proposal, and makes sure that all records of the deliber-ations and approval can be accessed in the future.

Integrated Report 2021Management Foundation Strategy parency and traceability than previously, which includes reviewing decisions made by specialized departments in the approval process, the post-approval progress, and even the final reports. In addition, by implementing thorough in-house train-ing on the decision-making process and upgrading every employee's skills in accurate assessment of busi- ness risks, planning, and decision making, we are creat- ing a foundation for repeated challenges, even in situations that require that unprecedented decisions be made in an era of drastic change.Recruiting Manager The success of STS2030 hinges on bolstering our manag-ers, as Shionogi's managers are required to support employees' growth, promote transformation of the work- place, and maximize the outputs of the entire organiza- tion. With this in mind, in fiscal 2020, we launched PJ-KANAME, a new program for manager development aimed at all domestic managers that stresses managers' personal growth, sophisticated decision-making skills, and a commitment to grow both employees and the organization. PJ-KANAME offers a wide variety of programs on cor- porate strategy, organizational behavior, and manage-ment of human capital, including such topics as dissemination of the new medium-term business plan, approval processes, goals management and human resources assessments, and labor management. The pro- gram is designed to upgrade the level of our manage-ment team, as they engage in daily study online, in group training, and self-study. In fiscal 2020, PJ-KANAME held 27 courses that ran for a total of 190 hours, which is equiva-lent to about 10% of a manager's work hours. By strength- ening the qualities that a Shionogi manager should have, we will achieve a higher dimension of sophisticated deci- sion making that incorporates our management and busi- ness strategies and our training and management of human resources, which are the fount of competition. We are solidly behind Project K and PJ-KANAME, which are positioned as the flag bearers for reforming both the hard and soft aspects of the management foun- dation strategy in STS2030, and these projects will accel- erate the pace of Shionogi's transformation as we achieve our Vision of \"building innovation platforms to shape the future of healthcare\" by 2030.Image of business risk Targets (performance, etc.) Now (meaning decision) Future Decision-making in business involves uncertainty to a greater or less- er extent, and the impact can be large or small.

So that each employee will take the initiative to polish their skills and become a human resource with exception- al skills, we are promoting human resources policies that will offer a deeper understanding of Shionogi, such as the acquisition of business skills to increase our market competitiveness, our history and current strategy, and directions for the future.

This includes the human resources setup, the challenger incentive system, and education and training. Personnel System Shionogi has had a job grade-based personnel system since 2013. This system treats employees according to their job grade, regardless of their age, gender, or other traits, and it assesses employees using a combination of a behavioral assessment, which is an absolute evaluation of the behavior that Shionogi desires, and a contribution assessment, which is a relative evaluation of the degree to which each employee is contributing. Starting in fiscal 2021, we are adding our five Values to the behavioral assessment items to reflect the Shionogi Way. We also plan to include all of these Values in the human resources requirements in our human resources system from now on. With respect to our compensation system, we set com- pensation at levels that are appropriate for the job based on the labor market, so that we can pay people according to their work. Bonuses are performance-linked so that each employee will benefit based on meeting his/her chal- lenges in contributing to the Company's growth. Challenger Incentive System We continue to award the President's Prize, the winner being chosen from among entries from Japan and abroad. In addition, we launched the \"I want to do it!\" project in fiscal 2019 to support voluntary initiatives by Shionogi Group employees, and two ideas that received awards have been commercialized. Education and Training We have strengthened and enhanced education and training based on the Shionogi Way, including basic training for boosting key capabilities at all levels, distrib- uting video content that increases Shionogi-oriented knowledge (Shiopedia), and education for managers 53 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Workplace learningthat develops management skills so that we have man- agers who fit the image we desire. Besides offering compulsory training tailored to job grades and business units, we have beefed up what we call affiliated pro- grams, which consist of training through self-learning so that employees can acquire exceptional skills. In addi-tion, as a self-investment support scheme, since fiscal 2019, we have been offering support of up to \u00a5250,000 per year to union-level employees for self-investment. In fiscal 2020, about 2,300 people used this system, and support totaled about \u00a5170 million, more than double the prior year's amounts.

This year, the Sustainability Management Department and Shionogi Career Develop - ment Center Co., Ltd. formed a production team that sent out explanatory videos on the Integrated Report internally every week. These videos both explained the content of the Integrated Report and described the struggles of the business units to come up with plans and programs. I think that this content enabled me to identify with them and to feel like I am part of a famil y. As I asked the business units about their initiatives for achieving STS2030, I became aware o f the horizontal links between business units, and this gave me the opportunity to think about how my own work is connected with Shionogi's business direction. Viewing the Shiopedia in forms employees about the direction and initiatives the Group is taking, and I hope that this initiative brings about a new type of Shionogi-style healthcare. Akiko Konishi Human Resources Strategy Group, Sales Planning Office, Pharmaceutical Commercial DivisionAn employee speaks Shiopedia Shionogi Group employees. The first time that proposals were solicited for the \"I want to do it\" program, I sent in an idea for surveillance o f wastewater for in fectious diseas - es, and this was chosen as a new business. In Europe and North America, COVID-19 has led to major strides in public impl e- mentation of wastewater epidemiology surveys, but Japan has fewer COVID-19 cases and the concentration of viruses in wastewater is low, so detection has been extremely difficult usin g the existin g technolo gy. We therefore conducted joint research with Associate Professor Masaaki Kita jima of Hokkaido Universit y to develop a virus detec - tion met hod that is 100 times more sensitive t han the existing one. We have starte d commercialization based on this world-class technology and are o ffering this service to national and local government bodies.

Integrated Report 2021Shionogi believes that taking steps to address employ- ees' well-being so that they will perform their work ener-getically is a key part of implementing its basic policy. In fiscal 2020, we formulated the Shionogi Health Poli- cy, which supports employees' health from three aspects: improving the health literacy of employees, supporting the maintenance and improvement of the mental and physical condition of employees and their families, and sustaining and continuously improving a supportive and productive working environment, as well as the employees' home environment. The Shionogi Group's Smoke-Free Declaration As a key part of our Basic Health Policy, the Shionogi Group issued the Shionogi Group \"Smoke-Free\" Decla-ration in April 2020 and strengthened our efforts to have a zero smoking rate among our employees. We want to promote not only the cessation of smoking but also a smoke-free environment for the entire Shionogi Group, so we have embarked on awareness campaigns and non-smoking support initiatives and have launched a stop-smoking project at the request of smokers and non (former) smokers. We will continue our efforts to be smoke-free so that all employees can enjoy a comfort- able workplace environment.Shionogi offers diverse workstyles so as to provide an environment where each employee can apply his/her skills. In April 2021, we started offering a new workstyle globally in the form of a 24-hour flextime work system that has no core hours. Also, with the expectation of improving productivity by making it easier for all employees to work, we expanded our work-at-home program so that employees will need to go to the office at least five days a month and eliminated the practice of transferring employees without their families. Besides these improvements, we conducted an engagement survey to assess ourselves and are now reviewing the situation and coming up with improve- ments. Specifically, the Human Resources Department is communicating the survey results to employees and holding dialogs with all the Company's divisions so that it can ascertain the particular issues and needs and start making improvements. Through this ongoing initiative, we aim to create a workplace environment where no employee who wants to work at Shionogi will be left out. The ratio of female managers has been gradually increasing and surpassed 10% in fiscal 2020. Going for-ward, we will continue to talk with our employees to make further improvements in our system.Making the Most of Human Resources Diversity The Shionogi Health Policy 1520 10 5 0 2018 2019 2020 2024(%) (FY)Goal 0%As one o f Shionogi's values is having respect for diversity, instituting an organizational culture of diversity and inclusion (D&I) is essential to the achievement of our 2030Vision. In 2018, Shionogi formed a Diversity Council to formulate a Diversity Vision*and hold joint promotion events in each organization to achieve this vision . In fiscal 2020, we created a framework for strengthening D&I in our executive ranks and each or ganization, and selected members of each of our or ganizations pla yed a central role in identi fying D&I issues in each workplace and worked toward resolving them. We also held training for managers and employees, as well as online gatherings for employees to get to know each other. As D&I has a broad range o f meanings, we believe the key to achieving it lies in how it is integrated into our daily operations. TheDiversity Council is aiming to create conditions in which each employee can contri b- ute to the Company's performance by acting as a motivating force for diversity insideand outside the Company, and it will continue working with an awareness of providingini tiatives that make our hearts resonate with each other.An employee speaks * In 2018, we established the Diversity Council to over- see initiatives for promoting diversity and inclusion in each of our organizations and to create a Diversity Vision so that all our employees can work toward diversity and inclusion from the same perspective.

In line with this concept, Shionogi is also working to expand healthcare services beyond just pharmaceuticals and to improve social envi- ronments, with a focus on psychoneurological disease and pain, which substantially reduce quality of life, so that everyone can live longer, more fulfilling, and more active lives.

Integrated Report 2021Improve Social Productivity and Extend Healthy Lifespans Psychoneurological diseases, which comprise diseases of the heart and brain, are subject to many prejudices and misunderstandings, so steps need to be taken to impart a correct understanding of these ailments. Also, the appear- ance and types of symptoms are truly wide-ranging, and it often takes a significant amount of time to form a definitive diagnosis. This results in complaints from patients that they cannot get a proper diagnosis or that their families, friends, colleagues, and others do not understand their situation. Shionogi is working to provide healthcare that is opti- mized to the individual's medical history or symptoms through the establishment of technologies and method- ologies that are objective and can give rapid diagnoses, even in cases where many symptoms are intermingled in a complex manner. Besides these efforts, we are also working toward achieving total care that incorporates support systems that will enable patients to live fulfilling and comfortable lives.Our disease strategy VISION for psychoneurological diseases/pain Initiatives for painShionogi has declared in STS2030 that it will focus on psychoneurological diseases and pain as priority diseas-es in addition to infectious diseases and provide innova- tive drugs. We are currently marketing therapeutic drugs for depression, ADHD, and pain, and we are engaged in R&D for the discovery of pharmaceuticals in the fields of developmental disorders, psychological disorders, dementia, and pain. With these core medicines, we aim to achieve total care for diseases, including resolution of the various problems that patients experience. To achieve HaaS in psychoneurological diseases/pain, Shionogi has formulated a five-part disease strategy VISION. Psychoneurological diseases and pain signifi- cantly reduce the quality of life of those people who suf- fer from them. Also, both the symptoms and the environment surrounding these ailments vary widely, so it is not good to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. Shionogi is constantly taking steps toward bringing about a world in which these patients can receive the appropriate healthcare products and services in a timely manner. Pain occurs through a wide range of different mechanisms and it can be extremely difficult to pinpoint the specific cause. On top of this, individuals experience the pain itself and pain severity in different ways, making objective evalua- tion difficult. This is because patients are unable to commu-nicate to physicians or other people about what kind of pain they have or the severity of their pain, so they have the prob- lem of not being able to get the proper treatment. Shionogi is working to develop a way for patients to be able to correctly convey the severity of the pain they are experiencing and a method whereby physicians can quickly and correctly diagnose the cause and severity of pain. We are also aiming to improve quality of life for patients and the people around them by providing healthcare optimized for the individual from diagnoses that are based on scientific evidence and also offer ser- vices that enable people to live with pain. Shionogi has formulated this VISION for achieving its disease strategy to maximize the value of the healthcare products and services we offer, and our value chain cen- tered on research, development, manufacturing, and marketing is using alliances to execute this strategy. We have pooled our extensive knowledge in collaboration with academia, various corporations, and government bodies so that we can make social contributions by pro- viding optimal solutions for patients' problems.Initiatives for psychoneurological diseases Correct understanding of disease symptom treatment methodsCommunicate Prevent Routine handling of disease traits and onset riskObserve Management of physical conditions and the support necessary for living in societyDiagnose Rapid testing of early symptoms and objective diagnosis based on data Cure Healthcare choices optimized for the individual, including non-medicinal options in combination with therapeutic drugsBringing about a world in which patients can receive the appropriate healthcare products and services in a timely manner. 57 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Rising social security costs are putting pressure on government finances around the world, especially in indus- trialized nations, as birth rates decline and the average age of the population increases because people are living longer due to medical advances and better lifestyles. Social security systems are likely to be completely overhauled as a result. In this changing environment, if Shionogi is to continue growing along with society for the next 10 or 20 years, we need to constantly seek how to apply our R&D expertise, skills, and experience to the healthcare services and to build systems that will deliver the right products and services to patients and society. We are aspiring to be a company that is constantly contributing to the sustainability of social security and longer healthy lifespans as we explore the possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance through wastewater epidemiology, therapeutic and preventative vaccines, healthcare apps and other DTx (Digital Therapeutics), and information services, and drill down into the issues that people face from a total care perspective cover - ing pre-symptomatic and preventive care, diagnosis, treatment, and control of disease severity.

Integrated Report 2021Contribute to Sustainable Social Security Provide wastewater-based epidemiology surveillance services In June 2021, we launched a service to survey the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in communities through the use of wastewater-based epidemiologic techniques in regular monitoring of the concentration of virus traces in waste- water. This initiative was the first plan chosen from our \"I want to do it\" project, which supports ideas proposed by Shionogi employees. The service uses a highly sensi-tive system for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, which we developed jointly with Hokkaido University. We hope that local governments will use this service so that we can help detect infections in communities through the regular monitoring of wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater-based epidemiology surveil- lance initiative using Japanese technology Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a way to moni- tor the outbreak and spread of epidemics by measuring the concentration of traces of the virus (genetic informa-tion) in wastewater using wastewater-based epidemiolog- ic techniques. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, such as pneumonia, and it multiplies in the intestinal tract. It has been reported that the virus is detectable in feces of infected individuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms. Therefore, vari- ous countries, including European countries and the Unit- ed States, have been attempting to estimate the prevalence of infections in communities by detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Meanwhile, Japan has had a lower rate of COVID-19 infection per capita compared to those countries, and thus a low concentration of the virus in wastewater, making it difficult to detect the virus in wastewater with existing methods. To overcome this issue, Shionogi has been conducting joint research with Hokkaido University on a highly sensitive technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The technol- ogy jointly developed by Shionogi and Hokkaido Univer- sity has achieved a 100-fold increase in sensitivity compared to conventional methods. We will first engage in social implementation of this technology on SARS- CoV-2 to assist Japanese disease-fighting efforts. Infection prevention countermeasures based on objective indicators It is difficult to predict when and where, and what kinds of pathogens cause infectious pandemics (global out- breaks) to spread. Wastewater-based epidemiology is an effective way to detect symptoms from an early stage. For COVID-19, it seems that many infected people are asymptomatic, so it is extremely difficult to find out how much the infection has spread. This methodology does not identify individuals but makes it possible to ascertain the status of the infection over a broad area, such as in a community or facility. We therefore hope that it will serve as an objective indicator when municipalities are considering pandemic prevention measures. The results of the collected samples can be used as epidemio- logical indicators to identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, where it is spreading, and convergence in catchment areas.Early detection of infected individuals and the outbreak of clus- ters at various facilities (such as hospitals, elderly care homes, dormitories and other group housing facilities) is possible, thereby preventing the spread of infection.\u0084 Services for municipalities \u0084 Services for other facilities Wastewater treatment facilities Prompt measures to prevent the spread of infectionMeasuring traces of the SARS-CoV-2 in facilities' wastewater Identification of infected individuals in the facilityMeasuring traces of the SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples Detection of infection in catchment areas 59 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021In countries throughout the world, physical, economic, and social problems are causing disparities in people's access to healthcare. Our purpose is embodied in the slogan, \"to strive constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve,\" and we, along with our many partners, are working earnestly to improve access to healthcare so that the value that is generated by our innovations can be delivered to as many people as possible.

Integrated Report 2021Improve Access to Healthcare Shionogi has formulated the Shionogi Global Health Access Policy Statement and is helping to improve access to healthcare by focusing on the three areas of developing innovative therapies for unmet medical needs, improving access for patients in need, and strengthening healthcare systems.Shionogi Global Health Access Policy Statement Developing innovative therapies for unmet medical needs We at Shionogi want to develop better, more innovative treatment techniques for our core therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and psychoneurological diseases/pain so that we can bring about a society in which all people can live comfortably, in safety, and their own way in areas with unmet healthcare needs. Along with our many partners, we are making contributions to global health by developing healthcare solutions that are con-sidered to be truly necessary. Improving access for patients in need In developing countries, access to innovative medicines is not always possible due to such reasons as affordabili- ty. In consideration of pharmaceutical prices and the accessibility of medicine, Shionogi's responses include product donations, patient assistance programs, and price considerations in accordance with the dynamics and healthcare system of each country. In addition, so that third-party institutions can use our research results to meet patients' needs in low-income countries and other selected areas, we are not filing patents for our products in the least developed countries, low-income countries and most low- and middle-income countries. We are also dealing with this issue by entering into appropriate partnerships in areas where we lack a distri- bution network so that Shionogi's products can reach the patients who need them. Strengthening healthcare systems An effective healthcare system is absolutely essential to improving patients' well-being. Shionogi is making every effort to build healthcare infrastructure in cooperation with everyone who is operating in the actual healthcare environment so that we can overcome complex regional issues.Shionogi Global Health Access Policy Statement Improving access for patients in needDeveloping innovative therapies for unmet medical needsStrengthening healthcare systems Contributing to AMR Helping to resolve the issue of AMR with cefiderocol AMR is an urgent issue that could lead to serious losses in society. If nothing is done to address AMR now, esti- mates suggest that over 10 million lives will be lost glob- ally each year by 2050. Compared with other disease categories, the infectious disease area is not seen as profitable, which means that many drugmakers have exited the field and few are interested in entering it, and the relevant R&D expertise is gradually being lost. Given this situation, in 2020, Shionogi became the first compa- ny in the world to market cefiderocol, which is a sidero- phore cephalosporin antibiotic. Cefiderocol is patho- gens (Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriace- ae) that the World Health Organization considers as requiring priority action. We believe that with cefidero- col, which was created as a result of R&D that places high importance on AMR countermeasures, we can con- tribute to the world with our efforts to resolve the seri- ous global problem posed by AMR. 61 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Thinking on the proper use of cefiderocol Shionogi has been involved in R&D, manufacturing, sales, and distribution of anti-infective medicines for many years, but as a company responsible for handling infectious disease medications, we believe that our responsibility as a company that handles infectious dis- ease medicines is to promote their proper use, which is critical to prevent the generation of resistant bacteria and resistant viruses. To date, the programs we have implemented throughout our value chain (manufactur- ing, sales, oversight/surveillance, public awareness pro- grams) have focused on Japan, but the same type of approach to proper use will also be necessary when cefiderocol expands on a global scale. In particular, in areas where people needing healthcare services and medicines cannot get them due to social reasons, such as the healthcare system, public health, and poverty, infectious diseases caused by AMR are more serious, but the infrastructure for the proper use of infectious disease medicines does not exist. We believe that we must resolve this issue when we disseminate cefiderocol. Partnering to expand access to cefiderocol in LMICs We launched cefiderocol in 2020, focusing on devel- oped countries in Europe and North America, but in countries classified as lower middle-income countries (LMICs), not only is there inadequate infrastructure for proper use, but actually getting cefiderocol to those destinations is a problem in itself. Shionogi believes that cefiderocol should be provided to patients around the world, including in LMICs. We therefore decided to enter into partnerships with companies and organiza- tions that share our thinking on proper use because we need to work with them. Then, in July 2021, we entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partner- ship (GARD-P) and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) on access to required cefiderocol needed for patients with AMR who have limited treatment options in LMIC. As we pursue discussions and cooperation with these two organizations, we are building a system for accelerated delivery of cefiderocol to needy patients throughout the world with the necessary timing.Publishing cefiderocol on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines Essential medicines are medicines that meet people's top-priority healthcare needs, so medicines chosen for this designation are considered on the basis of patient morbidity rates, evidence regarding efficacy and safety, and relative cost-effectiveness. They are also defined as having a guaranteed product quality and appropriate dosage and formulation, and as being readily available at a price affordable by individuals and the local com- munity. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines is a list of essential medicines as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO), and many LMICs and other countries use it as an example for compiling lists of criti- cal medications and stockpiling them. About 300 medi- cines are currently on the list. In November 2020, Shionogi proposed to WHO that cefiderocol be added to the list of essential medicines. As of July 2021, the proposal was being reviewed by experts at WHO. If cefiderocol is added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, we believe that it will facilitate the medicine's inclusion on the essential medicine lists of LMICs and other countries. Eliminating drug lag through Compassion- ate Use Compassionate Use is a system employed mainly in Europe and the United States whereby, from a humani- tarian standpoint, investigational drugs can be used by patients with life-threatening illnesses and serious ill- nesses that seriously affect their daily lives, but only in cases where there is no fully effective treatment avail- able. Shionogi has established a Policy for the Supply of Investigational Drugs, under which we provide such drugs free of charge in accordance with an appropriate process when the prescribed requirements are met. We also have in place a system for prompt supply, such as making a decision within five days of receiving a supply request. With regard to cefiderocol in particular, in both fiscal 2019 and 2020, we received a large number of sup- ply requests from patients and healthcare-related par- ties in many countries, and we provided supplies after prompt decision-making. Cefiderocol is gradually becoming available in more countries, but many coun- tries have not yet approved it, so we will continue trying to eliminate the drug lag by utilizing the Compassionate Use system. 62 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

In the sub-Saharan region south of the Sahara Desert, mortality is extremely high among pregnant women and children under the age of 5, and programs are needed that focus on improving the situation of mothers during pregnancy and childbirth and on the situation of infectious diseases among children. We have partnered with the international NGO World Vision to initiate a program for creating communities that can manage maternal and child health autonomously and sustainably. First-Term Project (Narok County, Republic of Kenya, Oct. 2015 - July 2021*) To date, we have built community clinics and water supply facilities, given guidance to healthcare professionals, and trained healthcare staff. In 2020, the program had to be tem - porarily suspended due to COVID-19, but during that time, healthcare staff in Narok County's communities took over and raised residents' awareness and took other steps to advance the program. As a result, clinic visitors and births at the facilities increased, showing that awareness about and the practice of proper hygiene is spreading. Following the project's end, we handed over the community clinic to the County in June 2021 after we strengthened the support sys - tem for healthcare staff so that they could continue to share knowledge and change behaviors on their own, and we cre -ated a support system for the County's Health Department so that it would be able to continue providing services to the clinic. With the cooperation of Nagasaki University and World Vision, we are now evaluating what intervention effects can be seen with respect to maternal and child health, nutrition, and hygiene as a result of the first-term project. * We extended the support period after the program was temporarily suspended. Second-Term Project (Kilifi County, Republic of Kenya, Apr. 2020 - March 2023 (tentative)) Although the impact of COVID-19 delayed the start of actual programs from the project's beginning, we have embarked on building a maternity ward, started knowl-edge and technical training and education for health- care workers, and are sending a mobile clinic to remote areas every month, among other things. In 2021, we will build a water supply facility for the clinic and strengthen and expand community awareness programs. /L50097 Communications Barrier-free Project (CBF-PJ) As part of its Vision, Shionogi is implementing the Communi- cation Barrier-free Project (CBF-PJ) to eliminate communica-tions barriers for patients with vision, hearing, and other impairments when they are accessing medicine.The universal packaging for the Sedes series that came out of this project proposal won the METI Manufacturing Bureau Director-General's Prize at the 60th Japan Packaging Con- vention 2021 (JPC2021). This packaging is designed so that anyone, including people with disabilities and non-Japanese people, can find out how to take the medicine correctly, and customer satisfaction is higher than for the previous packag-ing. We are thrilled to be able to help more patients use their medicine properly, and we are striving to develop more solu-tions aimed at achieving our Vision.

Integrated Report 2021Supply Socially Responsible Products and Services Stable supply Create an internal framework to ensure proper usageStrengthen monitoring systemsShionogi periodically conducts quantitative assessments of its procurement risk vis-\u00e0-vis suppliers and contract manufacturers so that we will never run out of product supplies, and we ask risky suppliers to make improve- ments, keep a list of alternate suppliers, and procure from multiple companies. During the COVID-19 crisis in fiscal 2020, we gathered data from other countries and conducted regular checks on our overseas suppliers so that we would not experi- ence any impediments in procuring raw materials, espe- cially from overseas. Also, when deemed necessary, we procured overseas raw materials ahead of time, and therefore had no Japanese domestic inventory stockouts. As pharma companies are now expected to be transpar- ent in their relations with healthcare providers and oth- ers, Shionogi is responding to the expectations of healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders by observing laws, regulations, and the industry's self-imposed rules and devising its own Shionogi Pre-scription Drug Promotion Code, which is based on high- er ethical standards. We are also devising an internal framework based on the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Guidelines on Activities to Provide Sales Information on Prescrip-tion Drugs. We separated the Promotional Compliance Office from the area responsible for sales promotion activities, and the office is reviewing promotional materi-als, monitoring and providing oversight guidance for marketing information activities, and giving appropriate training to employees. With respect to the Promotional Compliance Office's reviews and supervision and guid-ance of activities, we received advice from the Review and Supervision Committee, whose members include external third parties, and a reporting system has been put in place so that we will have an internal framework that ensures the dissemination of reliable information. Furthermore, we have incorporated AI into our tasks for monitoring marketing information activities and are improving the efficiency and quality of our activity sur-veillance by strengthening our setup to achieve better supervision of activities company-wide. Through these initiatives, we are aiming to build an appropriate internal framework for promoting the prop- er usage of medicines and to improve public health.In accordance with the amended Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act, we are clarifying the scope of the roles and responsibilities of the responsible officers, so that an event like the recent loss of credibility regarding drug manufacturing due to compliance violations will not occur. Based on a framework of proper controls, we continue to bolster our internal standards and every Group company's production and marketing framework, as well as raise awareness through Shionogi Group employee education and training.Furthermore, the Shionogi Group is attempting to develop compliance-oriented attitudes throughout its supply chain through initiatives to instill a \"quality culture.\" At the same time, due to COVID-19 limitations on vis-its, it has been difficult to perform the site inspections that we had been doing. However, we plan to be proac- tive in initiating remote inspections so that we can implement even more efficient and high-quality control and oversight of our domestic and overseas plants. 65 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Shionogi believes that respect for human rights is very important to the pursuit of its business, and respect for human rights is part of the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct. We promote initiatives that are in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (hereinafter, Guiding Princi- ples), and in fiscal 2020, we formulated the Shionogi Group Human Rights Policy and carried out a human rights risks assessment.

We will continue to hold human rights education and training sessions. In fiscal 2020, we moved forward with human rights due diligence at Shionogi in dialog with external experts and human rights specialists. So that we could check the state of our risk response, we compiled the human rights risks related to the Company's value chain from the executives and employees who had received human rights education. This risk assessment found issues in the areas of risk assessment concerning labor conditions in manufacturing regions that use raw materials and basic materials and in labor conditions for foreign work- ers.

To deal with these changes in the external environment, Shionogi will revise its Procurement Policy in fiscal 2021 to incor - porate new ESG topics. We will also create a new Business Part- ner Code of Conduct for our business partners to follow and will work to resolve social issues throughout our entire supply chain.Shionogi has begun revising its Suppliers' EHS/CSR Manage - ment Guidance, which sets risk classifications and administrative procedures for business partners, and is ranking and conducting assessments of its business partners in AMR and rare disease medicines and its business partners with high human rights risks. In addition, we have installed EcoVadis, a rating plat- form that evaluates companies' social responsibility and sustainability of procurement, to enable more fair and objective CSR evaluations and are assessing our busi- ness partners in accordance with the highest priorities. Shionogi analyzes the risks in the procurement and man- ufacturing of raw materials and products while taking measures to ensure a stable supply by working closely with supply chain business partners. To deal with pan- demics, earthquakes, and other unforeseen situations, we are multi-sourcing suppliers and product manufac- turing plants that handle raw materials for high-volume products. We also secure a certain level of inventory for raw materials and products that can only be supplied by that business partner.Cite the basic principles set forth by the Pharmaceuti - cal Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) as a code of conduct that our business partners are re quired to follow Assess and manage our business partners based on our own Business Partner Assessment Ru les Risks of global suppl y chain that can be disrupted due to COVID- 19 and other in fectious diseases, natural disasters, and geopolit i- cal risks, causing stoppages in procurement and suppliesRevise our Procurement Po licy Establish \"Business Partner Code of Conduct\" Incorporate tools for evaluating suppliers from the perspe c- tive o f sustainable procurement and multi faceted method s Establish management methods in accordance with the im portance o f business partner s Establish a stable suppl y chain mana gement s ystem b y diversif ying risks through and automating business processe sCurrent Situation Issues/Needs 67 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

Integrated AMR Industry Alliance's programs, the Shionogi Group is investigating the status of antimicro-bial emissions controls and management. We have already completed audits of all of our owned antimicro- bial-manufacturing plants, as well as all of our suppliers in Japan, in accordance with the Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework published by the AMR Indus-try Alliance. In FY2019, we began audits of our suppliers outside Japan.Selection for AMR Benchmark 2020*1 Shionogi has been selected for AMR Benchmark 2020 in recogni- tion of its excellent overall AMR control activities. In the manufac-turing category, in particular, Shion- ogi obtained 80, the highest score. *1 The world's first report analyzing and evaluat- ing AMR initiatives, issued by the Access to Medicine Foundation, a Netherlands-based NGO It is feared that climate change will have a devastating impact on global economy and social systems, and an early transition to a carbon-free society is an urgent social challenge for the entire world. Risks relating to cli- mate change and the process of transitioning to a car- bon-free society affect almost all industrial sectors. At Shionogi, we are assessing and working to minimize cli- mate change risks. To assess the impact of climate change while responding to societal demand for related information disclosure, we are working to improve and expand our information disclosure relating to climate change based on the framework of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). See our website for details.Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Approved by the SBT Initiative At Shionogi, we have devised a medium- to long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally and achieving zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. This target received the approval of the international environment body SBT*2 initiative in June 2021. *2 SBT stands for Science Based Targets: Targets for reducing emissions based on scientific evidence. 100 75 5025 0 2019 2024 2030 2050100 75 50 25 0 2019 2024 2030 2050\u0084 Greenhouse gas emissions reduction Supply chain (Scope 3 Category 1) 69 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Resource conservation and circulation BiodiversityOne of Shionogi's resource conservation and circulation initiatives is to use biomass bottles and mechanically recycled PET film in our product packaging, and we will continue to expand their use to more products. Biomass bottles We use biomass bottles (plant-derived polyethylene bottles) as containers for our Cinal EX Pro chewable tab- lets, Cymbalta capsules, Irbetan tablets, and Pirespa tablets. Biomass bottles are packaging containers made of polyethylene derived from materi-als left over in sugarcane processing. By switching from conventional petro- leum-derived polyethylene bottles to biomass bottles, we can reduce CO 2 emissions and also conserve fossil fuel resources.Mechanically recycled PET film We use mechanically recycled PET (polyethylene tere-phthalate) film in the packaging (aluminum bags) of Intuniv . Mechanically recycled PET film derives from used PET bottles that undergo several steps: selection, crushing, cleansing, and high-temperature decompression. The replacement of virgin PET film in the outermost layer of the aluminum bags with mechanically recycled PET film results in reduced CO 2 emissions and fossil fuel conservation while maintaining the quality of the pack-aged products. Kelp forest regeneration project In July 2021 in Hokkaido's Hakodate City, Shionogi Healthcare Co., Ltd. launched the Kelp Forest Regenera- tion Project, an industry-government partnership with Hakodate City, which aims to preserve natural Kjellmaniel- la crassifolia kelp, which is in danger of extinction, and to propagate the use of farmed Kjellmaniella crassifolia kelp. Shionogi Healthcare is the developer of Fucoidan, which uses Kjellmaniella crassifolia kelp. Realizing that the areas producing natural Kjellmaniella crassifolia kelp are in danger of disappearing, the company launched this regeneration project in fiscal 2019 and is attempting to shift from natural kelp to farmed kelp as the ingredi- ent for Fucoidan. Going forward, we will make even greater efforts to protect natural Kjellmaniella crassifolia kelp and pro- mote regional revitalization through accumulated know- how. We also plan to collaborate with academic institutions on improving the quality of farmed Kjellman- iella crassifolia kelp. See the press release below for details.Aburahi Botanical Gardens At the Botanical Gardens within the Aburahi Research Center in Shiga Prefecture, we conserve endangered spe- cies and rare plants.

Integrated Report 2021Section 3 New Growth\u2014Shionogi's Sustainability Strategy Protecting the Environment Instilling compliance awareness Shionogi's Compliance Handbook serves as the guide- post for addressing questions about compliance, and it is promoting understanding and awareness of the impor- tance of compliance. In particular, in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic wrought changes in the social environment, major shifts occurred in workstyles, and as stated in STS2030, opportunities to enter new fields increased as we partnered with other sectors that we had never dealt with before. In other words, we had to possess a high awareness of compliance and develop the ability to behave properly as we needed to make new and difficult compliance judgments and execute them more promptly. Therefore, rather than taking passive measures, such as trying to increase compliance awareness through mes- saging from business units responsible for compliance activities, we implemented programs that involved more proactive and specific messaging by having from each employee make a self-determination (expression of inten- tion) about how they are aware of compliance in their own job and at the workplace, and how to put it into action. After compiling these messages, we revised the Shionogi Compliance Handbook (6th edition).Responses Related indicators Instill compliance awareness Renewed to a bottom-up compliance handbook that reflects the opinions of employees Strengthen tie-ups with compliance Units in each countries Verify through progress reports: 5 times Employee education Top managers (division and organization heads): 3 times Education for compliance officers and promoters: 2 times Education for new hires: 4 times Awareness education regarding the revised Code of Conduct: 100% completion rate Prevention of corruption and bribery (domestic law/interna- tional law): 96.5% completion rate Internal reporting system Reorganize reporting desks (for Group companies) Number of incidents submitted to reporting desks: 40 Compliance awareness survey Administered a questionnaire on compliance (100% response rate)For the Shionogi Group, compliance is the basis for the company's survival and development. Com- pliance means compliance not only with laws, rules, and regulations, but also with social standards, and it also includes ethical behavior as a company and as a member of society. This stance is set forth in the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct and the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy, and all of our executives and employees are in strict adherence.

In addition, we will separate manage- ment and business execution through the Board of Directors, which supervises management and makes decisions based on medium- to long-term management plans, and the business execution framework, which is led by Executive Officers who execute business operations through swift and flexible decision-making. The auditing system consists of the Board of Corporate Auditors, which supervises management and audits business execution, and the Accounting Auditor, which fulfills its roles and responsibilities from an independent standpoint. Corporate governance structure Board of Directors / Board of Director's meeting The Board of Directors is chaired by an outside director and in principle meets once per month. To strengthen the Board's oversight of business execution and to promote highly trans-parent and equitable management by drawing on perspectives from outside the Company, the Board currently consists of five members. Moreover, more than half are outside directors and two are women, which allows the Company to maintain a sys-tem that ensures fair and efficient management. Also, all three outside directors are independent appointments who understand the Company's corporate responsibility, and they are contributing to increasing transparency in management. Board of Auditors /Board of Auditor's meeting To ensure that the directors and each organization in the Com-pany conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appropri- ate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Auditors and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting internal audits, to carry out audits and exchange opinions with the rep-resentative directors to take necessary measures. The Board of Auditors consists of two standing members and three outside auditors. The members of the Board of Auditors attend meet-ings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Management Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with corporate auditing standards, members of the Board of Auditors conduct business and accounting audits to verify the legality and validity of the duties carried out by the directors and corporate officers responsible for business execution. They also receive reports from the Internal Control Department and the independent accounting auditors and exchange opinions.1 2Representative Director Corporate Executive Management Meeting 3 Corporate Officers Departments / Group CompaniesCompliance Committee Internal Control Department Three-way audit coordination 72 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 4 Shionogi's Value-Promoting System Corporate Governance Business execution framework The Company has introduced an executive officer system to support dynamic and flexible business operations, enabling the Group to respond rapidly to significant changes in the operat-ing environment, and it has also established the Corporate Executive Management Meeting as a body to discuss business execution. It is composed of directors, standing members of the Board of Auditors, and the corporate officers responsible for business execution, and it meets every week in principle. The business execution framework consists of nine divisions responsible for research, development, manufacturing technol-ogy development, marketing, global business, corporate strat-egy, healthcare strategy, administration and DX, and the quality assurance organization. Nomination Advisory Committee The Nomination Advisory Committee consists of the President and Representative Director, three Outside Directors, and one Outside Corporate Auditor, and is chaired by an Outside Direc-tor. Topics discussed included the balance of expertise among the members of the Board of Directors, including outside direc-tors, and corporate officer nominations. The committee also delivers reports and makes proposals at Board of Directors meetings and conducts in-house inspections that give outside officers the opportunity to review our human resources by talking with division heads and heads of our major organiza-tions. It was held once in fiscal 2020. Compensation Advisory Committee The Compensation Advisory Committee consists of the Presi-dent and Representative Director, three Outside Directors, and one Standing Auditor, and is chaired by an Outside Director. Topics discussed included the performance evaluation of Direc-tors and Executive Officers in fiscal 2019, performance evalua-tion indicators for fiscal 2020, the release rate of medium-term performance-linked stock compensation, and the ideal form of the executive compensation system, etc. It was held three times in fiscal 2020.Outside officer/president opinion exchange meetings Meetings that serve as a venue for outside directors and the president to exchange opinions are in principle held three times per year. These opinion exchanges take place with the objective of enhancing the quality of discussions at the Board of Directors' meetings. Opinion exchange meetings are con-vened with outside directors, all of the corporate auditors, and the president in attendance, and topics for discussion include recent trends in the healthcare industry and Company business, as well as plans for executive training and the status of that training. At the fiscal 2020 meetings, there was a proposal from an external officer to check the development status of senior man-agement by having opportunities for dialogue with the man-agement level below the executive officers. In response to this proposal, starting in fiscal 2021, we will set up opportunities for outside directors to engage in dialogue with future executive officer candidates and advisors who will perform functions equivalent to executive officers. Outside officer information exchange/ study sessions In order to deepen understanding of Shionogi's business, the Standing Corporate Auditor hosts the outside officer informa-tion exchange and study sessions, which are attended by out-side officers and senior management of Shionogi. In fiscal 2020, there were two events on August 31, 2020, and March 22, 2021. At the August study session, members toured the Shionogi Education and Training Center, which is our training and exchange facility, to deepen their understanding of human resource development at Shionogi. The March study session focused on our China business and shared information about the business environment in China (politics, healthcare system, etc.) and related topics, with a view to future business expan-sion opportunities following the establishment of Ping An-Shionogi.3 4 56 7Principal activities for the year \u0084 No. of meetings held, other(Times) 2020 2021 April May June July August September October November December January February March Board of Director's meeting 1 121211111 21 Board of Auditor's meeting 2 2111 1111 1 Nomination Advisory Committee 4 1 Compensation Advisory Committee 5 111 Outside officer/president opinion exchange meetings6 11 1 Outside officer information exchange/study sessions7 11 73 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Deliberations at Board of Directors' Meetings The Company's Board of Directors engages in lively dis- cussions that incorporate a variety of opinions and advice from outside directors and outside auditors alike. Based on their diverse experience and expertise, each director takes a broad view toward promoting our growth strate- gy and maximizing value for all our stakeholders while engaging in managerial decision-making and oversight. The Board of Directors' meetings in fiscal 2020 engaged in lively discussions on a broad variety of top- ics, including formulation of the new medium-term busi- ness plan, establishing a commercial manufacturing facility for the COVID-19 vaccine, announcement of the year-end dividend and earnings forecast for fiscal 2021, making Tetra Therapeutics a wholly owned subsidiary, and our greenhouse gas reduction target application to the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative. As an example of the animated discussions at our Board of Directors' meeting, this section has thumbnail descriptions of the two topics of establishing a commer-cial manufacturing facility for the COVID-19 vaccine and announcement of the year-end dividend and earnings forecast for fiscal 2021. The skills matrix on p. 78 illustrates the diverse experience and expertise of our directors, including our outside auditors.Approach to Succession At Shionogi, appointments to the executive team are among the most important decisions made by the Board of Directors, and these are thoroughly deliberated under the strong leadership of the President. In an era of fast-moving change in the external environment, the crite- ria for assessing candidates are changing, and the Com- pany recognizes the need to groom successors from various aspects, based on our vision of the Shionogi of the future. As mentioned above, we have created oppor- tunities for early dialogue between the advisors who will be candidates for future executive officers and outside officers. In addition to the Nomination Advisory Commit- tee, discussions are also held at the outside officer/presi- dent opinion exchange meeting, where outside directors provide a great deal of advice. Also, through the presi- dent's management seminar, where the President himself does the teaching, we are implementing human resources training that aligns with our qualifications for a successor. /L50097 Example of Deliberation Details : Announcement of Year-End Dividend and Fiscal 2021 Earnings Forecast The business execution side proposed an increase in the dividend because financial performance should be recovering as the busi - ness grows steadily from now on, after two years of lower revenues and profits. Also, regarding the fiscal 2021 business foreca st, they stated that many uncertainties exist that make it difficult to forecast earnings, including \"changes in the timing of providing COVID-19 related products and services due to development guidelines and policies\" and \"changes in the market environment due to the prolongation of the pandemic.\" They proposed not announcing an earnings forecast, saying that a number of uncertainties could not be incorporated into an earnings forecast, because of concern that a revision of the earnings forecast caused by an unfores een event every time could cause a market disruption. In response to this proposal, the outside directors and outside auditors said that when society and the stock market are watch ing Shionogi as a leader in infectious diseases and its progress in COVID-19 product development, not giving an earnings forecast f or fiscal 2021 could lead to speculation about our development of COVID-19 drugs and a vaccine and harm our reputation in society and the stock market. They therefore suggested announcing an earnings forecast that does not incorporate uncertainties and offe ring a careful explanation to this effect, given that as a leader in infectious diseases, Shionogi needs to take an above-board stan ce in response to social demands. Likewise, regarding increasing the dividend, a comment was made that financial performance should improve going forward, and the payout ratio should be raised to about 30%. After this discussion, it was decided to increase the year-end dividend and to announce the earnings forecast without factorin g in the uncertainties after explaining them in detail.2/L50097 Example of Deliberation Details : Establishing a Commercial Manufacturing Facility for the COVID-19 Vaccine The business execution side made a proposal to invest in a facility for the commercial manufacturing of a COVID-19 vaccine befo re Phase 1 clinical trials begin and to beef up human resources in the R&D area, even though there is risk of failure at the R&D s tage and mass manufacturing planning usually does not begin until both Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are completed and the com - mercialization decision has been made. This proposal elicited discussion from the outside directors and outside auditors regarding the terms for using such aid, the facility's operating costs, the potential impact on non-COVID-19 business activities from concentrating resources on COVID-19 initiatives, and other risks and opportunities concerning our business over the medium to long term. The upshot of these discussions was that, as a leader in infectious diseases and to help bring an early end to the pandemic, w e must build a manufacturing system before Phase 1 clinical trials begin, we should bolster our resources dedicated to fighting C OVID- 19, and we can expect to obtain future synergies with our other businesses. It was therefore decided to make an early facility invest- ment and to funnel human resources into that area.1 74 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Features of Shionogi's Corporate Governance Consider balancing among our four types of stakeholders Shionogi incorporates the perspectives of its four groups of stakeholders\u2014customers, local com- munities, shareholders, and employees\u2014in main- taining transparent and proper business management that treats its stakeholders fairly and is responsive to the expectations of local communities.Emphasis not only on complying but also on explaining Shionogi has no plans to mechanically comply with all the items contained in the Corporate Governance Code. It is important that we always strive for the best compliance system, clearly express our thoughts about points with which we will not comply, and thoroughly discuss any differ-ences of opinion with outsiders. Diversity of the Board of Directors and Board of Auditors To further strengthen our framework in view of the progress in our business development, Shion- ogi is building the necessary framework from the standpoint of diversity and such factors as exper- tise and experience. Regarding diversity, we have appointed two female directors, and regarding skills, we have appointed directors and auditors with a wide diversity of skills and age groups.Management transparency A majority of Shionogi's directors and auditors are independent and outside officers, which increases the transparency of our management. Also, based on our Disclosure Policy, we continue to disclose our corporate information to all of our stakeholders in a fair, timely, and appropriate manner. \u0084 Changes in Corporate Governance Structure Fiscal 2004 Number of internal directors reduced to five from fourteen Introduction of cor- porate officer systemFiscal 2009 Introduction of an outside director system Establishment of Nomina-tion Advisory Committee Establishment of Compen- sation Advisory Committee Start of opinion exchanges with auditorsFiscal 2012 Majority passes to outside directors and outside auditorsFiscal 2015 Information sharing meetings with out-side directors Advent of female directorsFiscal 2020 Outside director appointed chair- man of Board of Directors Increase in number of female directors (Increase in proportion of women on Board of Directors)Fiscal 2017 Changing composi- tion of Nomination Advisory Commit- tee and Compensa- tion Advisory Committee (to majority of members now being outside directors)20 1510 5 2003 2004 2010 2008 2009 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2020 Outside directors \u0084 Outside auditors 75 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

Integrated Report 2021 Message from the Chairman of the Board of Directors What has Shionogi done to strengthen its governance? I believe that as a pharmaceutical company Shionogi has a very serious social responsibility to protect people's health, safety, and well-being. We are implementing very effective corporate governance by aiming for transparen- cy, fairness, and accountability in our decision-making processes and developing solid decision-making func- tions and oversight functions for our Board of Directors. Currently two of our five board members are women, and more than half are outside directors. The Board Chairman and the heads of the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee are all out- side directors. I therefore believe that we are building a cutting-edge corporate governance framework. Please tell us about the responsibilities of outside directors and their discussions at Board meetings. Because we are a pharmaceutical company, outside directors need to have a proper understanding of Board meetings' agenda items. Before the Board meetings, adequate time is always spent having preliminary brief-ings on the agenda items so that everyone participating will have a common base of knowledge and awareness of the issues, and thus we can have straightforward and detailed discussions that incorporate a wide range of viewpoints. Also, as Board Chairman, I am aware of the timeliness and pertinence of the agenda items. This year, we need to take ample time to discuss issues like our progress in developing COVID-19 treatment medicines and a vaccine, as fighting COVID-19 is our top priority. Human resources development is one of the key mis- sions of the Board of Directors. For a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company like Shionogi, the areas requiring the greatest concentration of resources are human resourc- es and R&D. Our discussions take a long-term view so that 10 years from now, we will have concentrated our manage- ment resources, made strategic investments, and steadily nurtured a pipeline (new drug candidates) and the human resources that will carry the next generation forward. As an outside director, I am striving for prompt and bold decision making that arises from lively discussions based on diverse perspectives on how to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium to long term. What can we expect from Shionogi in the future? With STS2030, we have unveiled a major direction toward transforming our business model. We aim to fulfill our cus-tomers' healthcare needs, and we have partnered with M3 and the Ping An Group to gain a foothold in the field of total healthcare. At the same time, providing solutions to COVID-19 as a leader in infectious diseases is an urgent issue. We have a social responsibility to respond to soci-ety's demands for COVID-19 prevention, treatment, and medicines, i.e., total healthcare. Providing solutions for COVID-19 is in fact the touchstone of STS2030. Also, the world still has many incurable diseases and new medical frontiers, and Shionogi's mission is to create the next growth drivers and come up with solutions to the many social issues involved in the field of healthcare. To become a social institution that truly supports a healthy society and people's health and well-being while also increasing our corporate value for the long term, we will work hand in hand with all our stakeholders to carry out our social responsibilities, share ownership with our stakeholders of our value system of fur - ther expanding our strength as a drug discovery-based phar-maceutical company and collaborates as a healthcare provider focusing on healthcare services, and we expect to achieve sustainable growth based on mutual trust.Independent Outside Director Keiichi Ando Biodata Mr. Ando joined the Sumitomo Bank Limited (now Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) upon graduating from the University of Tokyo's Faculty of Eco-nomics. After serving in various positions, including Representative Director and Deputy President of the Bank and Executive Officer and Representative Director and President and CEO of the NEW KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIR- PORT CO., LTD., he has been an Outside Director of the Shionogi Group for the past five years, since 2016. He is currently an Outside Director of Tsub-akimoto Chain Co. and an Outside Director of DAIHEN Corporation. With his practical experience as a corporate executive at a financial institution and broad insight into finance, and experience as the CEO of a business firm, he is working to increase Shionogi's corporate value by transforming our business model and devising and implementing our growth strategy. 79 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 4 Shionogi's Value-Promoting System Corporate GovernanceAnalysis/evaluation of effectiveness The Board of Directors performed an analysis and assess- ment of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in fiscal 2020 that focused on Shionogi's Basic Views and Guide- lines on Corporate Governance, Article 6. Directors and the Board, (1) Framework, (3) Roles and Responsibilities, and (6) Operation, by conducting questionnaires and inter- views with each director and corporate auditor. Below is a summary of the findings. Summary of analysis and evaluation results for FY2020 and response Framework Our assessment is that the Board of Directors has currently secured the necessary framework from the standpoint of diversity and such factors as expertise and experience. As a future topic and based on our business expansion and transformation, from the standpoints of further diversi-ty and succession, the need to appoint a foreign national as a director and develop and appoint candidates for the next successor was mentioned. The Board of Directors will continue to consider ways to further strengthen the gover-nance framework while taking into account the status of the Company's business development. Roles and Responsibilities With regard to reports on the status of management development and overseeing the status of management development, reports were made and opinions exchanged on an ongoing basis at the Nomination Advisory Commit- tee and outside officer/president opinion exchange meet- ings. Reports about the status of compliance activities are also made to the Board of Directors twice a year, and opin-ions were voiced at Board meetings. Furthermore, Activity plans for ESG promotion and their progress were pro- posed and reported to the Board of Directors twice a year, and related individual measures were proposed and reported to the Board of Directors on a case-by-case basis for deliberation and resolution. Matters identified as future issues included progress reports on the medium-term busi-ness plan, and detailed explanations and debate concern- ing the status of development, selection process and progress of development of management executives. The Board of Directors will continue to consider ways to further flesh out its roles and responsibilities. Operation To further stimulate discussion at Board of Directors' meet- ings, we continued to hold preliminary briefings on the agendas of Board of Directors' meetings on a regular basis and delivered the appropriate reports on the matters decided at Board of Directors' meetings. We also went on a site visit to the Shionogi Education and Training Center. As a future topic, a suggestion was made that time be secured for Board of Directors' meet ings to further enhance discussions. We will continue to consider ways to enrich management of the Board of Directors. Remuneration for directors and corporate auditors Process for determining remuneration The Compensation Advisory Committee deliberates care- fully on the matter of directors' compensation and discuss- es various issues concerning remuneration for directors and executive officers, verifies the levels of remuneration every year, and deliberates the remuneration system, and performance evaluation system for the following fiscal year. Remuneration Framework Total director remuneration is determined within limits set Cross-shareholdings After due consideration of the relationship with the cost of capital, cross-shareholdings are only held in cases where it is judged that they will increase Shionogi's corporate value and contribute to a sustainable improvement of corporate value. In other cases, we are proceeding with sequential sell-offs in consideration of stock prices and market trends. Since the end of fiscal 2017, the number of stocks and shares held and the value of shareholdings have been reduced by 30% and 38%, respectively. In addition, the economic rationale for continuing to hold individual cross-shareholdings is verified annually at a Board of Direc-tors' meeting.\u0084 Trend of cross-shareholdings (Listed stock, market value) 900 600750 300450 150 0 2017 2018 2019 20203025 1520 510 0(Billions of yen) (No. of stock) (38%) 24 stocks27 stocks 19 stocks 19 stocks 59.6 36.4 bln43.1 bln (FY) \u0084 Value of shareholdings (based on market value) Number of stocks and shares held 80 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

This consists of base monthly remuneration, performance-linked bonuses determined by results for the fiscal year and other factors, and since fiscal 2018, restricted stock compensation (medium-term, performance-linked and long-term). Also, outside directors receive only base remuneration. Base remuneration is determined based on the base remuneration table according to the position and role of directors with due consideration of the management envi-ronment and global trends. Performance-linked remuneration (bonuses) is paid as cash remuneration, which reflects performance indicators (core operating profit excluding royalties, sales of assets, etc., profit attributable to owners of the parent and other total performance evaluation as directors) to heighten the awareness of improving performance for each fiscal year. As short-term incentives, they are determined based on the calculation table according to performance such as achievement of targeted profits and other factors in each fiscal year and paid in June of each year. Non-monetary remuneration (Stock-based compensa- tion) is granted in July of each year based on the stock- based compensation table according to directors' rank and job responsibilities. For medium-term performance-linked stock compensation in particular, the performance evalua- tion will be based on the degree of achievement in fiscal 2022 for the portion to be granted in the three years from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022 during the STS2030 Phase 1 period (fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2024) to determine the ratio of lifting the transfer restriction (100% to 0%). In addi-tion, when lifting the transfer restriction, 50% of the amount of stock-based compensation, translated into the share price at the time of lifting, is paid as monetary compensa-tion. Performance evaluations use such quantitative indica- tors as revenue, overseas net sales, core operating profit, ROE and the ranking in total shareholder return (TSR) among 12 competitors including the Company (relative TSR) and also incorporate the status of ESG, compliance, and development associated with COVID-19. The Compensation Advisory Committee discusses the ratio of remuneration by type for executive directors in con- sideration of remuneration levels, using as its benchmark companies that have a similar business size to the Compa- ny and are included among the relevant business types and categories, and the Board of Directors, in respect of the recommendations given by the Compensation Advisory Committee, determines the details of the remuneration system, etc. so that the ratio of remuneration by type is in line with the recommendations. The policy for determina- tion thereof is set in accordance with the separately defined \"Policy for Determination of Details of Individual Remuneration, etc. for Directors.\" In addition, pursuant to the resolution at the Board of Directors meeting held on February 22, 2021, it is considered appropriate that base remuneration and individual bonus amount, etc. are evalu-ated and determined by a person who bears the ultimate management responsibility, and thus, such evaluation and determination are entrusted to Isao Teshirogi, Representa- tive Director and President. The Compensation Advisory Committee deliberates the policy and criteria for the entrustment and provides the Board of Directors with the results as recommendations for their resolution, and Isao Teshirogi, Representative Director and President, to whom such determination is entrusted, shall make decisions in accordance with said recommendations and the above- mentioned resolution by the Board of Directors. \u0084 Actual compensation The ratio of basic remuneration: performance-linked remuneration, etc.: non-monetary remuneration, etc. for fiscal 2020 is 5:2: 3.\u0084 Remuneration track record The targeted ratio for each type of remuneration is set at base remuneration: performance-linked remuneration*1, etc.: non-monetary remuneration*1, etc. = 4:3:3 premise that all KPIs are achieved. *1 Performance-linked remuneration, etc. consists of executive bonuses, and non-monetary remuneration, etc. consists of restric ted stock.

Integrated Report 2021Section 4 Shionogi's Value-Promoting System Corporate GovernanceCreating corporate and social value through engagement Approaching our diverse stakeholders Upgrading the information provided on our websiteShionogi is working to achieve a sustainable society by creating corporate and social value through optimally balanced engagement with its four groups of stakehold- ers: shareholders and investors, customers, society, and employees. Our information dissemination efforts to date have focused on pharmaceutical products for treating diseas- es and have been targeted at our customers, such as healthcare professionals and patients and their families. However, as Shionogi transitions into a HaaS company providing total care, including during the pre-symptom-atic and convalescent stages, we are diversifying the information we provide to our stakeholders so that it will serve the general public. We need to communicate not just through general media and healthcare professionals but directly through our owned media, so we have beefed up our website and have expanded our commu-nication through social media as well. We intend to broaden these efforts going forward so that we can engage with diverse stakeholders. In May 2020, we refreshed our corporate website so that we would have a framework for providing information on the Shionogi Group to more of our stakeholders. In par- ticular, the web page \"Commitment to Fight COVID-19,\" which we set up to describe our most recent efforts with respect to COVID-19, has become our website's most frequently accessed and widely read page. In June 2021, we refreshed our website for patients and their families. We will continue to improve the accessibility and useability of information so that a broad range of stakeholders will be able to easily obtain the information that they seek.Interacting in the most balanced manner possible with four stakeholder groups Customers Employees Shareholders and investors Society Twitter InstagramOpening official company accounts on social media We have had a YouTube account since July 2016, and we recently set up accounts on Twitter and Instagram. These are communicating various types of information on Shionogi. By disseminating information using the characteristics of these social media, we are increasing recognition of Shionogi by expanding our fan base to new groups of people. We also plan to expand the information provided by linking our website and social media accounts. https://www.shionogi.com/ global/en/SHIONOGI @ SHIONOGI_JP SHIONOGI/@ shionogi_official SHIONOGI commitment to fight COVID-19 https://www.shionogi.com/global/en/sustainability/informa- tion-for-id/covid19-initiative.htmlFor patients and their families (Japanese only) https://wellness.shionogi.co.jp/ \u0084 Shionogi-style \"engagement\" 82 Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2021Section 4 Shionogi's Value-Promoting System Engagement with Stakeholders A fundamental of the Shionogi Group is to have each organization identify the positive and negative risks asso-ciated with its decision making and business execution and then take the initiative to manage and deal with those risks. As part of our corporate strategy, we have created and implemented a company-wide enterprise risk management system that manages the risks of the entire Group, including such crisis risks as pandemics, natural disasters, terrorism, and cyber-attacks, and responds to such business risks by creating new business opportunities and taking risk avoidance and risk reduc- tion actions. In particular, the Corporate Executive Man-agement Meeting and the Board of Directors deliberate and make decisions on policies for responding to signifi- cant risks that could have a major impact on manage- ment, and based on the response policy, the supervising department works with the related organizations to implement these measures. In fiscal 2021, we will step up our efforts to rebuild into an organization geared toward company-wide risk management that integrates our organizational goals and culture and work on fostering such a culture. Based on our by-laws, we are working to manage crisis risk with a view to respecting human life, considering and contributing to local communities, and controlling dam-age to our corporate value. Specifically, we are working to consolidate and maintain a comprehensive crisis manage- ment structure that incorporates a business continuity plan premised on the occurrence of a major earthquake or pandemic. In addition, in fiscal 2021, we will take further steps, including formulating a business continuity plan that addresses IT infrastructure. Going forward, we will respond to the risks facing us so that we can continue to function smoothly as a pharmaceutical company engaged in work with a critical social mission, such as stable supply of medicines as well as research and development of medicines and prophylactic vaccines for COVID-19.Under STS2030, we are aiming to transform our business model and build new healthcare platforms. Business uncertainty is expected to increase in the process of this transformation. If we cannot respond to sudden changes in the environment within and outside the company, we may fail to achieve the goals of STS2030. That could also affect business continuity, so in fiscal 2020 we focused on identifying related risks and worked to build an organization and foster a culture in which information about vari- ous business risks are reported to management promptly by departments and other business units. Building and Promoting an Enterprise Risk Management System /L50097 Response to Dichloromethane Leakage at the Kanegasaki Plant In January 2021, a leakage of about 17 kL of the solvent dichloromethane occurred on the property of the Kanegasaki Plant (in Iwate Prefecture) of Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd. The direct cause was a piece of ice that had pushed down the handle of the drainage valve at the bottom of the tank, leav- ing the valve half-open. We are currently taking steps to clean up and prevent spreading to the surrounding area. So far, no leakage outside of the site has been confirmed. Also, we will be implementing appropriate surveillance programs going forward, including sampling and analysis of under- ground observation points around the plant. We extend our sincere apologies for the trouble that we have caused to the plant's neighbors and everyone else in the surrounding area./L50097 Response to the Cyberattack on Taiwan Shionogi In response to the October 2020 cyberattack on Taiwan Shionogi, we are taking steps to build an IT-BCP by form- ing a project team to bolster our IT infrastructure and make our business continuity efforts more robust. Also, in addition to bolstering the IT infrastructure, strengthening our data security base, and improving its management, as a result of the cyber-attack at our Taiwan location, we are performing a global security assessment and taking steps toward preventing a recurrence and any outbreaks at our other global sites, and we are strengthening our response, such as by comprehensively reforming the entire Group's network structure.Scope of risk: Business risks, compliance, crisis issues, ESG, and other issues pertaining to our management strategyBoard of Corporate AuditorsBoard of Directors Corporate Strategy Committee Risk Management SubcommitteeCorporate Executive Management Meeting (President) Internal Audit Risk owners: Supervising department, supervising committees Perform risk analysis/identify priority risks Risk analysis/evaluation /L50478 DepartmentsDomestic and over- seas Group companies Various Groupwide important meeting forums Human Resource Committee, Compliance Committee, Branding Committee, Shionogi Group Companywide EHS Com- mittee, etc.Reporting Reporting significant and approval Directions and approvalFor risk management: Centralized manage- ment of risk information PDCA promotion and support MonitoringSecretariat\u0084 Risk management structure 83 Shionogi & Co., Ltd.

Therefore, behavior that violates laws and regulations or runs contrary to social needs could lead to a loss or decline in the Group's credibility among its stakeholders and even have an impact on our financial performance.
