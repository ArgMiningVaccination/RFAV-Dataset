During a 3-year study, an investiga-tional seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vac-cine, new episodes of otitis media A 20% reduction in surgical insertion ear tubes A 23% reduction of the frequency of episodes of otitis media (5 episodes in 6 months or 6 episodes in 12 months) A review of medical records of the chil-dren who participated in the study showed that of 47,000 physician visits due to otitis media re-corded during the 3-year trial, about 9% fewer visits occurred in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine gr oup versus the comparison group, ac- cording to investigators Steven Black, MD and Henry Shinefield, MD, co-directors of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, Oakland, CA. Results of the study were presented at the Pediat-ric Academic Societies\u0092 1999 Annual Meeting, held May 1-4, 1999 in San Francisco, CA. Up to 95% of children experience at least one bout of otitis media by age 6, and several million each year battle chronic infections that can lead to aggressive antibiotic regimens, surgery and great distress to families. We\u0092re talking about a major disease that causes a great deal of distress in children, said Dr. Shinefield. Even curbing ear infections by that margin could create an additional benefit in cutting the use of antibiotics, according to Cynthia Whitney, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention. Health officials say that pneumococcus and other bacteria are becom-ing increasingly resistant to existing antibiotics due to overuse and misuse. \u0093Otitis Media is probably the most com-mon reason kids get antibiotics. If we can reduce antibiotic use in that group, we can maybe reduce the amount of antibiotic resistance we see now,\u0094 she said. Research released last fall showed the vaccine is 100% effective in preventing meningitis and bacteremia, both serious bloodstream infec-tions that in rare instances can cause death. The three year study followed 38,000 children treated at Kaiser clinics in Northern California. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated Wyeth Lederle Vaccines\u0092 heptavalent pnemococcal conjugate vaccine for a \u0093fast\u0096 track\u0094 development program. Essentially this will allow the company to file a rolling prod-uct license application, which permits the FDA to evaluate individual components of the licensure application for approval before the entire applica-tion has been submitted. CUMULATIVE LEVELS THIMEROSAL FOUND TOO HIGH IN VACCINES O n July 7, 1999, the PHS and the AAP an- nounced new recommendations regarding the reduction and/or removal of thimerosal, an organic mercury-based preservative, from vac-cines. These new recommendations are the result of a recent review c onducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of thimerosal, an ad-ditive that has been used to prevent and/or kill bacteria/virus contamination and maintain potency in vaccines since the 1930\u0092s. Thimerosal was found to introduce a slight level of mercury for smaller-weight children during the first six months of life that exceeds a measure for mercury estab-lished by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These levels have not been shown to cause toxicity. The large risks of not vaccinating children far outweigh the unknown and probably much smaller risk, if any, of cumulative exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines over the first six months of life. Nevertheless, steps are now being taken to remove as much thimerosal as possible from vaccines in order to increase the margin of safety that already exists. There has been no data or evidence of any harm caused by the level of exposure some children may have encountered with the existing immunization schedule. Since hepatitis B vaccine is routinely given at birth and contains a small amount of thimerosal, both the AAP and PHS have recommended that this vac-cine be delayed until the infant is older. DPH recommends that providers conform to the AAP recommendation for hepatitis B vacci-nation of newborns and infants. These recom-mendations include the following: 1. Infants of mothers known to be HBsAg-negative should begin the hepatitis B vaccine series at six months of age. 2. Infants whose mothers are HBsAg- positive or who have unknown HBsAg status at the time of delivery should receive the first dose of vaccine within 12 hours of birth. 3. Infants of mothers belonging to groups at high risk for hepatitis B infection should receive the first dose within 12 hours of birth. These high-risk groups include, but are not lim- ited to, Asian Pacific Islanders, immi-grant populations from countries in which HBV is of high or intermediate endemicity, women with risk behavior during pregnancy and households with persons with chronic HBV. Once adequate supplies of thimerosal-free vac- cines are made available, health care providers can resume the current immunization schedule and administer the hepatitis B vaccine to all infants during the newborn period.

The CDC noted that the disease is most common among one to six year olds. While approximately 4 million Americans contract the disease each year, the CDC estimates that 100 people died between 1990 and 1994 from related complications, including pneumonia and blood infections. Ten states and the District of Columbia currently require varicella vaccinations for children. Connecticut is in the process of revising school and day care regulations to include chickenpox vaccine. The proposed regulations would require all children born 1/1/97 or later to show proof of immunity to varicella (chickenpox) for entry in to school or day care. The target implementation date is August 2000. The State Immunization Program has published guidelines for evaluating chickenpox like rash in recipients of varicella vaccine in day care or school settings. The diagram shown (see p. 3) can be used to assist in determining the nature of a post-varicella vaccination rash and in making decisions regarding exclusion of students from the day care or school setting. Any additional questions should be directed to the Connecticut Immunization Program. CT RESPONDS TO CDC'S RECOMMENDATION TO POSTPONE ROTAVIRUS VACCINE O n July 15, 1999, the United States Public Health Service (PHS) recommended that health care providers and parents postpone the use of the rotavirus vaccine for infants, at least until November 1999, based on early surveillance reports of intussusception (a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the bowel fold in on itself) among some infants who received rotavirus vaccine. As of July 7, 1999, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has received 15 reports of intussusception that occurred within three weeks following rotavirus vaccination. Although intussusceptions occur among infants who have not received rotavirus vaccine, CDC will be collecting additional data in the next several months that may indicate more clearly whether the rotavirus vaccine increases the risk of intussusception. The recommendation is being made with the consideration that rotavirus season is still 4-6 months away in most parts of the United States. The department recently surveyed the three major pediatric centers in Connecticut. Since November 1, 1998 when the rotavirus became available, three infants with intussusception were treated at these three hospitals. None had received the rotavirus vaccine and all recovered. Rotavirus vaccine has not been supplied by the Connecticut Immunization Program. However, many practices in our state have been purchasing the vaccine privately. Until more data is available, we recommend the following: 1. Health care providers should temporarily suspend administration of rotavirus to unimmunized and partially immunized children. 2. Parents or guardians of children who have received rotavirus vaccine within a period of approximately three weeks should be advised to promptly contact their physician if signs or symptoms indicative of intussusception develop. 3. All cases of intussusception which occur following administration of rotavirus vaccine should be reported to VAERS (800-822-7967). Additional information about thimerosal and rotavirus can be found on the AAP and National Immunization Program (NIP) websites: http://www.aap.org and http://www.cdc.org/nip.

JUNE 1ST IS A VERY IMPORTANT DATE FOR VIS's June 1, 1999 is the date by which health professionals must be using the most current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS\u0092s). Federal law states that you must give parents, guardians, and/or your adult patients the appropriate VIS before you administer any of the following vaccines: Hepatitis B 6-10-94 While it is not federal law that you hand out the aforementioned VIS\u0092s, CDC recommends that you also use the following VIS\u0092s: Pneumococcal 7-29-97 Rotavirus 3-23-99 Hepatitis 4) CDC: Varicella-related deaths among children-United States, 1997, MMWR 47 (18): 365-368 Page 2 If rash occurs at If rash occurs at If rash occurs at Timing Post Vaccina-tion < 1 week 1-3 weeks (typically) but can occur up to 6 weeks > 6 weeks and and and and Symptoms Generalized rash (typically 200-400 lesions with many vesicles) Fever Cough (if \u0093partial\u0094 immunity has developed, symptoms may be attenuated) Generalized rash, more maculopapular than vesicu- lar (usually <20 but can be up to 50 lesions [median=5] Some localized vesicles at the site of injection (median=2) Afebrile Asymptomatic Generalized rash, more maculopapular than ve- sicular lesions) Often afebrile Minimally symptomatic Generalized rash (typically 200- 400 lesions with many vesicles) Fever Cough Type of Disease Wild-type chickenpox Vaccine-related chickenpox; Side effect of vaccinees) \u0093Breakthrough\u0094 chickenpox with as modified varicella syn-drome\u0094) (occurs in as many as 20% and 27% of vacci-nated children and adults, respectively, with household exposure to wild-type varicella) Wild-type chickenpox (vaccine failure) com- plete vaccine failures are very unusual Infec- tious?

Exclude as for wild-type chickenpox GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING CHICKENPOX-LIKE RASH IN RECIPIENTS OF VARICELLA VACCINE IN DAY CARE AND SCHOOL SETTINGS The two most important features to consider in making these determinations are 1. The time interval since receipt of vaccine 2. The severity of the chickenpox-like illness, as outlined b elow Stamford A k i d s health fair took place a the Stamford S c h o o l Readiness program on April 24th. \u0093 C h i c k e n Pox\u0094, the school nurse dressed as a c h i c k e n , went from class to class passing out red stickers to the children, asking them to place them anywhere on the face, hands, etc. where chickenpox may show up. The health fair focused on health education and promotion and accident prevention as well as the importance of immunization. There were 60 attendees. Mary Alice Flynn, IAP Coordinator offered chickenpox vaccine to all eligible children. Children in the school also participated in an immunization coloring contest. 360 participating children were given a \u0093Meanie Baby\u0094 named \u0093Chicken Pox\u0094 with spots all over him and blood shot eyes. (See photo p. 4) Meriden Volunteers from the health department displayed immunization information and promoted immunization awareness at a Daffodil Festival at Hubbard Park on April 24th & 25th. Several health and safety advocacy groups sponsored the event which consisted of many activities including health promotion, crafts, a food tent, a carnival of rides, music and a parade. Over 300 people attended each day of the fair. New Britain Ramona Anderson hosted an \u0093Immunization Day\u0094 on the opening weekend for the New Britain Rock Cats baseball team on April 18th. All parents who brought their child\u0092s immunization record card received a free ticket for their child with a paid adult ticket. What an innovative way to spread the immunization word! Torrington Sue Sawula sponsored the fourth annual \u0093Be Wise, Immunize\u0094 children\u0092s immunization fair on April 23rd, at Brooker Memorial Health Center. Free shots were offered and entertainment was provided including pony rides, clowns, and face painting. An immunization booth was displayed and refreshments were served. Approximately 250 people attended and 15-20 children and adolescents were immunized.

The patient, a 12-year-old resi- dent of East Hartford, had recently returned from a five week stay in India where measles cases continue to occur. The child is home schooled and is therefore not legally required to be vacci-nated. The East Hartford Health Department continued surveil-lance and notified the state of a second measles case in the 7 year old brother of the index case. These represent the first confirmed cases of measles in CT since 1997. "}
